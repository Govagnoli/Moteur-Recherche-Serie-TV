when I first start the show I know two year then we know four then we know five the sixth year happen and then that be it then suddenly seven happen and we go this be really it we be do eight and so it be just be a crazy ride honestly who know it would go this long who know it would be this successful part of the success of Stargate too be not something that we see except that we keep getting renew I be not always really aware of what be go on out there in the real world in term of our rating or fan response I know the fan base for the show be phenomenal but until you go overseas you do not really know suddenly you be in Europe and people be go Sam Sam Australia everywhere I go people recognise you so then you go wow it be a success who know Sci fi be not a genre that I be hugely into I 've say this before and I will say it again I be a Little House on the prairie girl but I want to do this show because of the character because I love the character and I see so much potential for she in the pilot I see her flaw but I also see great potential and I see all her strength it be not a character that you come across very often as a woman so I be really thrill by the opportunity to play she that be what jazz I ok I be Stargate Barbie and we be dead it be not that I think Sci fi and I still do not we be not in a ship all day long we be present day fallible human being we be goofy and irreverent at times there be a definite sense of humour to the show and a definite human element and I think it be very accessible even though I be probably the most sci fi character in it because of the techno babble I speak I use to do Shakespeare now I do techno babble I do not think of it as a sci fi show I hope that do not upset sci fi fan cos it be a sci fi show but it be so much more what what we get trouble w what kind of trouble think Bolivia oh Jaffa they make our position keep work what a dream job we get to do what we love to do for a live everyone loves be here crew cast it be so hokey but we really like each other we love each other just last night I be talk to Chris Judge for an hour and a half I talk to Michael before he go to Australia and to Don the other day and get together with our craft service guy and hair stylist we really dig each other we be very very lucky and I do not know that it be the same on every show it be just like a family Michael Chris and Rick be just like my three brother so we have our sible rivalry but when push come to shove we would go to the wall for any one of we we would all look out for each other and that be rare I think so what happen beyond the gate I have a very boring life during the shooting of Stargate because I have to stick to a pretty regiment routine in order to say all the word that I have to say this be my favourite thing but on weekend for I it be about get out into the wood with my dog just breathe fresh air and hiking I be still renovate my house I play guitar not in public ever but it be really quiet sedentary just chill Chilling chilling I be not a big party girl I do not go to the club scene unless I go out with Christopher Judge which happen once a year cos that be all you can handle it be very quiet I be nature girl on weekend I buy an Ocean Kayak and now I be kayak which I love so I be just outdoors y girl shoot in Vancouver be brilliant in the summertime and even up until a couple of week ago I be kayak Wintertime you go ski the guy play hockey so you go to the hockey game my husband play with the Stargate guy it be a perfect lifestyle out here especially if you be into the outdoor directing be and be and have be something I 've want to do since before I get on Stargate and I be direct theatre for I it be really six year of prove to the power that be that I could do it in the negotiation for season seven I lay it on the table and say this be a deal breaker I have to be able to direct and they let I that be the scene we be do one crane shot which'll end up in a wide master a two shot of Daniel and Carter and simultaneously shoot a medium close up of Barrett with his radio Nice resurrection initially I be go to direct it early in the season then I be go to direct the episode right after the summer hiatus then I be go to direct the second last episode suddenly it be the last episode and it be Michael 's episode which be great because I could talk to Michael about what his vision be when he write the script I 've never see such a complete bastardisation of what be once a very lyrical and musical piece of work it all work out initially I be freak out oh my God how be I go to do this it turn out to be the most phenomenal experience of my career so far I love it the one thing I keep forget to do be say Action Action that be brilliant Daniel you ok where be she she will not get far all unit this be Agent Barrett the female prisoner be unaccounted for secure all exit without exception every single member of this crew give 110 for I and they all say they would from our location manager Lynn Smith to Bridget McGuire to James Robbins all of the element that happen prior to shoot and then on set everyone it will take a really long time but that be what cool shot take I be able to design a show and design a style for the show base on the knowledge that I know I could push the camera department because I know that our crew could handle what I be throw at they the two and a half page crane shoot that I design for the opening of the show and I know that it would work and they all add I also have the privilege and the safety net of Michael Greenburg on set every day he just let I do my thing I design every shot I draw it out on paper I would say Michael this be the next scene these be my camera angle this be why I want the camera to move here a great director I can not believe she be a first time director she be get all the right move all the right stuff and she look good she use to be really ugly then she got punch in the face and become pretty then of course I have a great cast Rick be not in it sadly but Michael and Christopher I just love they they be so on board that go back to that whole why we love each other so much Brad Rines be my editor and he be an amazing editor so I come in with his mix and his first edit and go this be great I barely have to change anything will Waring say to I when you go into the first day edit you will pretty much sit there and go ' cool ' this be really cool there be just a few thing that we change a couple of take we use differently but it take less than a day for I to do my director 's cut it be that easy mind you I design the show in such a way that there be little room for editing which the producer may or may not have like but it be like you kinda have to do this this be the way I do a lot of what we call oner where it be an entire scene in one move so you can not cut into it all part of my design it be great directing be a career path I will always want to be an actor there be always a charge to that creative juice but to open up other element especially after seven year on a show you do not wanna become stagnant I would love to direct episode of the spin off but certainly other thing this be the final shot of season seven and it be bloody brilliant if I do say so myself Cut Project the gate that be a wrap till season eight Whoo thank you to the fan to all of you hope you be enjoy season seven hope you be enjoy the dvd I 've say this before and I will say it again there but for the grace of you go we if it be not for your support we would not be do the show or season eight oh my God it be fantastic for your letter and your love and just for stick by we from the moment the show be announce we have a fan base before we even hit the airwave you stick by we and so thank you from the bottom of our heart if it be not for you we would not be here thank I be Amanda Tapping thank for watch beyond the Gate or something like that d'oh d'oh D'oh how be that enhoh to be on a show for seven year you be bless first of all to do anything for seven year you know to have that sort of relationship with a group of people that be as great as this group of people it be so fortunate to be on a show like Stargate that be really keep its level of commitment to turn out a good product but also to have fun and laugh in the work environment every day be just phenomenal as we go through the seventh year we laugh even hard and have more fun than we ever have so it be be a very unique experience do not hold back you will only anger I far well the relationship that we have between the cast Basically we be one great big dysfunctional family we 've all kinda learn each other 's ism and quirk and have find that rather than try to make each other feel well that it be much well just to laugh at each other will someone tell Rick he be not really dead he can move now he be a Method guy that be how we make it through each day with Rick and his love of irreverence Rick and I actually do not really speak to each other for two year we be both very alpha male and then when Rick 's child be bear I can remember be in the circus and we be talk about it and I relate to he my own experience with the birth of my child and by the end of it we be both cry like baby and that be really the genesis of our true friendship it take it out of the workplace and we actually become friend and Michael Shanks and I we 've have this bond from the very beginning the cat be the most cassionate that mean he be passionate but for cash that make you cassionate no this dude can see the good side of anything can see the positive side of anything as long as it do not involve he because he need to be angry about something we get into some really entertaining shouting match early on through the year we 've come to know each other extremely well and he be just one of my good friend really Amanda tap she really live her life through her character actually he think he know how to act no theatre real actor make no money you can cut that part right no Amanda 's like everybody 's sister she be just a joy to be around every day she be always make sure that everyone 's ok do well everything be fine at home she just take it upon herself to make sure that everything be smooth every day and that be invaluable Don Davis be nuts he be crazy but he be also one of the most kind hearted gentle soul I 've ever meet but you know it be everybody on the cast we be truly just a big happy family we know each other 's kid parent wife husband boyfriend whatever that just make it one big cohesive unit cos we spend more time with each other than with our significant other at home and that be another reason that the seven year have be so remarkable because of the general happiness that be pervasive through the set on a daily basis join I beyond the gate join I beyond the gate join I beyond the gate I have this sickness this terminal sickness call golf and a lot of the crew play a lot of our producer play if there be be a big tournament on at the weekend all film will stop till we talk about all the good shot and bad shot who do what and da da da then talk about each other 's round and how everybody play on the weekend it be fun cos there be a lot of good natured ribbing that go on and everybody 's true sense of competitiveness but also you can really see how much everybody really enjoy each other you take a Saturday or Sunday you be usually through in the morning so we can get back to our family but we take that time and we go and play golf together and it be a real hoot but what I really like be take money away from the big guy like Brad I be well than Brad and Coop I be well than Coop Greenburg I be well than Monty Better get in the hole baby I hate to say maybe this might cost I my job I do not know I be kill this course this course have get my name all over it cos you have to allow they their ego I be in the limelight I be the one that be on tv so for a little while I have to just let they beat I for a while I be play with the producer I be about to take the rich guy for some money I be the bad golfer out there though there be none of that one upmanship so I just have to smooth everything out cos that be how I be I have to make it look like I shank the ball a lot or hit the ball wide left and right I have to make it look like that but little do they know I be do that for their benefit I suffer the sling and arrow for they cos that be just what kinda cat I be I be off track again I 've actually write for a very long time even in the early day I talk about write an episode but it be tough for writer and producer to take you seriously when you show up for work late every day for three year so I think the first step be that I have to show they that I be serious about it which mean kinda clean up my entire act and show they that I be serious about be here and be around Brad Wright give I my first opportunity to actually write a story for the Warrior so I pitch the story and then write the story then the teleplay be give to Peter DeLuise one of our two most prolific director initially Pete and I be go to collaborate on the teleplay and then Pete realise he would have to split the teleplay money with I so Pete do not return my call until he be do so I 've still get a little thing with DeLuise over that but you know you get I you get I you make all the money that be all right my name be still on the cover story by but so the follow year I have actually be work with Brad on a pitch and we be just have a few problem kind of tie all the element of the story together to turn into the teleplay and I think of a completely different story on the way upstairs to his office I know that he would spoon feed I the script so after the outline phase I ask he if I could just write the script from there the reason I do that be cos I want a true assessment of my writing ability and Brad say fine so I email the script to Brad and I email the script to Martin Wood who be go to be direct it anyway that story be the changeling ok Probie get ready to get your foot wet the genesis of it be what if Teal'c be a normal guy how would that play out and that be the seed of the story I be just so proud to be part of that process everybody outta there t get your ass outta there that be an order agh save yourself I be get you out old man teal'c get a medical team down here now yes ma'am then I be allow to write another episode season seven and get to work with Robert Cooper who I also enjoy immensely and that be for Birthright Birthright be the original story that I have be work with Brad on and then we be able to get Jolene Blalock to play the lead and it really just turn out fantastically do not make this mistake Moloc will not allow this to continue you give I no choice how many warrior have to die our sister in your care will be return safely or the two of you will be sacrifice Kree sha Mel lak maybe I could put pen to paper for an episode or two if there be a spin off that would be a great boon to my writing career Fo ' shizzle my nizzle part of what have really make Stargate so great over the year be just the absolute Welcome to stargate crazy support of the fan it be really heart warming and we love you guy and thank you so much but lady you got to stop send I underwear all right but really we want to thank you all for seven great year of love and support we will keep puttin ' them out there thank for watch beyond the Gate we be about to wrap up year seven so we be go full speed ahead on year eight we will see you then well we will not really see you but you will see we hey hey Bobby Janice what be up girl how you doing what be up Lizzie what be up baby how you doing we will see you season eight enhoh I wake up in the morning usually late I come drive in with my hair on fire and put out the flame when I reach the front gate I come stroll into my room half conscious and then I waltz in still in some sort of semi coma into Hair and make up and come out look like a million dollar well a buck the guy be good but they can only do so much without use plaster that be the morning fix the make up stuff take about 15 20 minute from there we waltz off to set and do our blocking Blocking be this chaotic period where half awake people try and direct other half awake people to stand in certain spot and be only able to do so by put tape mark on the floor especially colour code tape mark Mine be blue Blue I have blue tape so that be where I be suppose to stand sometimes we can if it be important to we move around but we try and limit our motion because we 've get a lot to do during the day we finish block come back out here and then if we have not do so already like the true professional we panic and try and learn our line if this lead to hostility it will Dr Jackson I do not believe you be invite to this meeting yes General I know I be sorry but please hear I out I think the situation can be resolve peacefully how we 've be on this planet a long time it be only in this one region that the Unas attack we go in and we set up usually what start off be a master shot then we zoom in for close up coverage of everything especially at the military base and then we go in and we shoot it master close up all sort of stuff and we do this for about eight page of dialogue a day we shoot episode in around six or seven day now can we at least try to negotiate with they they be animal they be intelligent being with a sense of honour if you underestimate they more will die Seven and a half page a day that be a lot of page it be a lot of word I got to get to work could you turn that off Mr Rooker what can you tell I about Michael Shanks there you have it usually the time when you actually get a scene be right after you finish shoot that be what that scene be about that be what I do and I come back in here and beat my head against the wall then we go on to the next scene we do this to about 7 30 at night sometimes eight o'clock then we drive back home and try and memorise our line for the next day and do anything like live a life a personal life say hi to friend and family we 've alienate over the past seven year and that be about it that be a day in the life a long time ago in a not so far galaxy actually it be seven year ago so I guess it be a long time ago we all go down for a screen test for a series base on a feature film call Stargate three people just gravitate towards one another that be a man name Christopher Judge a woman name Amanda Tapping and some dweeb who do not really know his a from a hole in the ground name Michael Shanks we all just seem to find solace in laugh with each other Lo and behold a few week later after find out I have get the part we arrive in Vancouver to begin shoot and I find that Christopher Judge and Amanda Tapping have also get their part we shoot the Nox here we shoot the pilot here too this be our location for it we have to run up and down that hill I be wear 187 pound of armour this be our first day of film right here french hour Amanda 's like a mother hen big sister type she like to have fun but she keep herself within the confine of the rule of the game so to speak she be almost britishly proper she be almost like a big sister to Christopher and I cos we be bad kid Christopher 's the bad of the bunch and I be somewhere in between so Amanda act as this big sister Christopher be just a jokester a prankster he be the main instigator of the trouble that we seem to share and Amanda 's there to shake her head pat we on the back and say nice one guy get a blister from my gun Chris and I for the most part it be very rare that you get people who work so often so many hour a day that after so many year still like one another you learn way too much information about each other but Chris and I watch hockey game together and we still hang out a lot he be become a very very close friend it be amazing that the chemistry and that original dynamic that be spark in an audition room year ago have manage to remain consistent and have bond we close together as family it be be a wonderful experience to share with those people Richard he remind I of I a lot when I first meet he cos he be just a very private person but once you spend so much time around he you realise he be like the big kid of them all in the embodiment of a 50 year old man who be be through the war and have all the wisdom of that he be like a kid bust to get out if it be not for the social propriety that make he be certain thing I think you would just see he run around anything for a joke the sense of humour that we share be the most both on and off the set we seem to be on a level playing field when it come to a lot of different thing especially sense of humour and that be where we find our strong bond not only enjoy that off camera and joke with one another but work with one another to always be laugh whenever we be work together there be rarely a serious moment you play a lot with the zoom it be always the sign of an amateur if you be zoom a lot that be what be make it so much fun be to find one of these people like the close group of friend you have a subconscious communication with that be an incredible strength and it make for a good friendship all right here be what I would like you to do pick up that phone call Mr whoever run this Place Hagan I be sorry but I just can not do that we be old friend tell he Mr Man who have the Stargate be here to see he he will understand Stargate go ahead button phone Mr Hagan please Nice Cut cut it too condescend a little bit I use to play hockey I play hockey for about 22 year and play up to university be someone who be canadian it be what canadian do we 've start our own hockey team I 've organise the troop and it be amazing to see all the people that have play before and be enthusiastic about play it be great because it give you time to socialise with everybody outside of the environment of the Stargate set to see everybody in their natural surrounding you be on an even playing field and it be always be a great workout you do not know you be get a workout but at the same time it be so much fun I miss it so much we play the other team in town the Smallville guy the Twilight Zone guy the Chris Isaak guy you get to meet some people you have not see in a while it be nice to go out and make some new friend and some new enemy and afterwards share a beer with everybody our guy as much enthusiasm as we have our skill level do not necessarily meet our enthusiasm but we always get a good group of people out and rub a few face with our glove and swear a little bit too much I usually end up in the penalty box so that give I my designate rest time so when you use your stick like this or your glove like this you go to the penalty box and you feel shame two minute for bad attitude too much spit on the bench no gum chewing and not enough use of clichés I be go to go out and play again hopefully once I get back to play I really see why I miss it we be good our team be a little we be learn each other 's in and out and whatever it be one of these great social sport you say you do it for fun but I do not think anybody really do do it for fun because everybody want to win the good thing about hockey player be when it be all over they leave it on the ice whatever friendly rivalry that you 've build up over the hour of play usually gets leave behind and you can share a beer or 12 with the guy that you 've just finish rub his face into the board if I be not do Stargate I would hopefully still be act somewhere I be train as a theatre actor in thing like Chekhov and Shakespeare and Molière so after I graduate from university I start do tv and film and stuff but my love have always be to carry on with Shakespeare and to keep a hand in it be one of those thing that you have to keep do to remember what you learn tv can be very it take up all your time and there be not a lot of room for side project one of the thing I want to do be to keep involve in do theatre so I think in 1999 a local director Morris Panych ask I if I want to participate in Hamlet I say sure what part he say Hamlet after I have clean out my drawer I say I guess I could jump at that challenge I think I get everything I ask for in term of it be a challenge it be a role that every actor want to do and once face with it they wanna run in the other direction the stage fright become all too common an occurrence on every open curtain so hopefully that be something later on down the line I will be able to do again but in the meantime I just wanna keep revisit the root of where I come from and just be able to re experience the joy of why I first get into it and what your first love be and to re experience the appreciation of the art of act Sci fi fan I think be probably fan of all different genre of show and probably the most passionate and intelligent fan you could ask for the good thing about they be they keep you honest because they follow the show close than people that make it do it be important that we have fan who be that reverent and that intelligent it bring the writer ' game up the actor ' game up everybody pay a lot more close attention to all the detail which be essentially what will end up make a well show when I leave the show at the end of season five it be one of those decision that you make and it be a job that you move on from and I 've move on from many when you make that choice a lot of other people be on board for that decision make process there be a strong reaction from people that be not happy that the character have step out from be a regular character on the show they let their feeling be know it be great to know to get that kind of expression you realise that regardless of what you think you have accomplish you 've touch a chord and a lot of people be very reverent to the character that be flatter in a way and you realise that there be a bit of responsibility that go with play a character on television your fan at the end of the day will make you or break you and apparently there be a lot of fan out there who be very supportive of the work I 've do on the show and that be fantastic so far behind the scene you can not even see he thank you all for watch Michael Shanks beyond the Gate we will see you all sometime if not you will see I I will look occasionally at the screen but I probably will not see you I be go to go now cos I 've run out of thing to say you be follow I enhoh every one of you volunteer for this and you represent over a dozen country you be the world 's good and bright and in light of the adventure we be about to embark on you be also the brave I hope we all return one day having discover a whole new realm for humanity to explore but as all of you know we may never be able to return home I would like to offer you all one last chance to withdraw your participation begin the dialling sequence ok Atlantis it start with obviously the movie Stargate there be a ring it take you to other place there be the show Stargate SG 1 there be a ring it take you to other place now there be Atlantis and there be a ring and it take you to other place at the end of season 7 of Stargate SG 1 the hero of that show find an alien outpost in Antarctica under the ice and it reveal the location of the long seek after lose city of the Ancients the Ancients be the race of alien who we believe build the Stargates and deposit they all over the galaxy since Season 1 we introduce the concept that the original Stargate on Earth be in Antarctica that be the episode Solitudes so in a way I 've be plant the seed for this spin off series since then the original premise for Stargate Atlantis be that the city that we find be indeed under the ice of Antarctica when Sci fi approach we with MGM and say that they want to do both series simultaneously Robert and I have to go and come up with a variation on that concept which be that yes we find an outpost in Antarctica but that lead we to where the real lose city be which be in fact in the Pegasus galaxy the whole city up and fly away and go somewhere else the Ancients ' city which be actually sorta more of a ship city than a city or a ship it be kind of a city that fly it take off and go to another whole galaxy once they be there they basically do what they do and that be build Stargates put they on a whole bunch of other planet then kind of like a big galaxy wide science experiment start life human life on all the planet capable of support human life and this change the series concept significantly originally it be go to be set in our galaxy but the beauty of set it in another galaxy be that we be essentially reset the whole adventure back to zero we be start in Pegasus in a place very similar to where SG 1 start in our galaxy what have we miss not much here as before we build a system of Stargates so that fledgling civilisation could travel between the star exchange knowledge and friendship but it be not a perfect place it be not Eden after all eventually they find out that there be a sleep enemy there call the Wraith these be sort of super bad guy who be equally as powerful even more so than the ancient as it turn out these Wraith kind of like to suck the life energy out of thing they grow to kinda like the taste of the life energy of human and start to feed on the human that be in that galaxy initially the word that come down the pipe be gothic and dark and that the Wraith be a breed of vampire not in the standard sense of the word because they do not suck blood they be essence stealer then we have to physically flesh these guy out quite honestly it be very wide open from a creative standpoint at that point the Wraith have wing we be look at they more as animalistic rather than human form but after initial drawing start go out it become very evident that their view of the Wraith be that they be dark they be evil and yet they have an underlying beauty to they we go through a multitude of stage after that where the look change subtly from draw to draw to draw the wardrobe concept go back and forth ultimately it be gloriously hideous on the day the Ancients be undermanne completely overwhelmed by this terrible enemy the survivor of that siege that go on for maybe 100 year decide that the only thing they could do be to sink the city under the water on this alien planet in the Pegasus galaxy that be the story Plato hear he hear the story that 10 000 year ago this ancient city that be great and powerful sink into the ocean during a great war so it do happen it just do not happen on Earth and now we go there kind of seek new power source for our own ancient technology that we 've discover that we be use in the defence of Earth and to fight the Goa'uld and also to possibly meet some of those ancient and you know see what be go on in this other galaxy we end up getting trap there and have to deal with the scary Wraith that be just the short version the old saying if I ever have a chance to do this again we be get that chance everything hopefully that we learn in those seven year now go into eight year of SG 1 we be apply to Atlantis thing like the puddle jumper this framework in the set represent the dimension of a puddle jumper now we can have a vehicle because we do not build it because it be of ancient construction that can fly through the Stargate and take we wherever we need on the alien planet it be something that we just simply could not have purpose build anywhere in the early year of SG 1 of course by the time we be think of Atlantis I want to save it for that Gate ship one ready to go sir Gate ship one no no no that be all wrong what do you mean it be a ship it go through the gate Gate ship one a little puddle jumper like this it be the first series I 've ever have a hand in create you know I start as a story editor on Stargate SG 1 in the first season I be at the read through of that pilot I have sort of move my way up to be an exec producer this opportunity to sort of spin off from what have be an incredibly successful run on SG 1 be an opportunity that I think nobody could 've pass up when Brad and Robert first come to I about do the end of season 7 the Lost City two parter I be thrilled because I think this be a great way to set up whatever come next possibly a movie possibly a new series I have no idea it be go to be what Atlantis have turn into Atlantis be absolutely an amazing way of continue the Stargate saga I think when you be try to create a spin off you have two choice one be that you can take a character or two from the establish series and throw they into a new situation and it all become about the character carry on their own story or you can take the idea the mythology that you have in an establish series like Stargate SG 1 and then you spin that mythology off in a different way this be what Brad and Robert do well this be why when you do a spin off with the same creator you do the good thing which be you hold the integrity of the series of SG 1 and you put it into a brand new package the danger be that your fan will be disappoint when they see that they be look for SG 1 and they be not go to find it in a new series unless that continuity of the mythology be there and you find interaction with character that will take they onto the next level so they still get the idea of Stargate SG 1 still get the mythology of Stargate SG 1 that they be very familiar with and you get it in a new package and the new package be absolutely astounding cut very nice Print that one Print both of they please we have plan pitch and talk about Atlantis for some time it just take a long time to get the deal do when it finally do get do in late November the Sci fi Channel ask we if we could deliver the show so it could air in July July ' 04 this year that be a very short window to get a series up and run especially while we be do Season 8 of SG 1 even though we have pitch the show Atlantis we have not start write a script we do not have a deal writer do not write without deal so Brad and I think it over and talk about it at length but because of the really short window and the fact that such a massive set need to be build and so many aspect of the production need to get go we actually start development before the script even begin Brad and I be look at plan for the set before we would even type Fade in I remember I have actually sit down to start type in early December on the scene I be suppose to be work on and Brad call and say I just go into the stage and the floor be in on the set Type fast literally the script be evolve as the set be go up grant we finish fast than they do but they have a lot more to build we have roughly seven week of prep after everyone have the script in their hand which be a very very frightening thing when start up a series especially science fiction that depend so much on prop and set and visual effect the visual effect be already go we have four people work on computer and do what we call pre vis and actually do the visual effect shot before we shoot the actual footage which seem a little bit backwards but be the only way we be ever go to get everything complete and together in order to air the show on July 16th the way we have promise we would a warm welcome how do you manage to keep my ass from getting blow out of the sky the exceptional flying of Major John Shepherd he like it here you like it here Shepherd be a pilot like Jack O'Neill be he have the same we do not leave people behind core belief that Jack O'Neill have he use humour to disarm a situation just like Jack O'Neill do or Richard Dean Anderson do but it come from and I think Rick would back I up on this a less cynical place Rick be naturally a cynical person and that be why he be so funny in Joe Flanigan we find that magic quality that I think you have to have in the person who be the centre of your show he be very personally charming very personally witty but he be also a smart actor all those thing be on the surface he be also add a layer of complexity to his scene find those thing that you do not even know be in there because he be add they and that be what star do I be play the part of Dr Elizabeth Weir and she be like myself new to all of this she sort of come from a much more political background she fight against the military from what I understand that be also an interesting turn I believe that Stargate be very military base I do not think she even be aware of interplanetary relationship until a few month before all this happen the first time you meet she in I think season 7 of Stargate that be her first introduction to the idea of alien so she have a crash course and all of a sudden find herself in charge of a whole new Stargate I want from the get go to have the leader of the Atlantis team to be a woman because I do not want a general to be at the heart of this I want a civilian leader you can not militarise Antarctica so I think well why not extend that to the expedition to find Atlantis it be an international team that be essentially not and can not be lead by any one military commander from any give nation so that be why Dr Weir be the perfect candidate she be a negotiator we want somebody who be a negotiator at the heart of the leadership of Atlantis because that be that role then Torri come and do this part and she be spectacular she nail the character what Torri give be a strength to Weir that be a natural strength cos she just come across as a strong person without be support with overly heavy handed dialogue she be just strong I do sci fi when I first leave theatre school year ago I do not get it and I do not think I have the joy of it cos I do not understand how to play with it so it be something I be excited about now I 've work as an actor for the last ten year and I 've learn a lot about this medium television medium which be different from theatre and I 've learn how to have fun with it and just that be very exciting the amount of play that be go to be involve in this yeah I be go to be play the character of teyla she have become the leader of her people in a sense her father be the leader and he be kill a number of year ago her mother be take away by the Wraith they 've force my civilisation into a kind of mediocrity in a way we use to be this great powerful beautiful civilisation now we be kind of live in tent and our settlement be very temporary because we have to pick up and leave at a moment 's notice my character she be very intelligent she be very strong she have a wonderful physical ability she can run fast than any of the other people on the team and she be a great fighter she be a very good warrior here be a tough task I mean here we be try to find a particular feeling the character teyla be suppose to be a leader among her people so we need someone with strength and passion and the ability to lead people but also a soulfulness and a little bit of sadness because of what her people have be through I honestly think she be all round the good actress we see it be a nice bonus for we that she be also a Canadian I be thrill I have never really have a chance to do sci fi and yeah I be kind of a sci fi girl I love read fantasy I eat that stuff up I be very excited about it I know my dad will be a big fan regardless of whether or not I be on the show he be a huge sci fi guy he be probably the one that instill it in I yeah I be really look forward to it I be Rainbow Sun Francks and I play Ford on the old Stargate Atlantis I be just overwhelmed I be actually get my first look at the set now I 've only be here a couple of hour it be an interesting time at home in Toronto out of nowhere I guess about three or four day ago I get a call like you 've get a chance to do this all right agent just calm down give I these four page tell I what I 've get to do I go and put myself on tape and I guess I get a blessing something that rarely happen in this industry where I got cast for this role solely on tape now I be here play Ford and I hope they give I two gun I be come for you I be come for you high energy when I be here be I ever high energy I think that it may be slightly unique that Brad and I tend to have a philosophy that we want to put the good actor in the role if we have to alter our idea of what that character be in order to do that we will we feel that we maybe have not find the exact right guy yet for Ford the deadline be get real close I watch the tape of the first kid who I have ask for then there be this other audition on there afterwards I say this guy be great I show it to Brad and he agree immediately and everybody love he and he get the part literally Thursday night he fly up get the part and be at the read through on Friday and we shoot on Monday you might take he the wrong way you might look at he and think he be a young boy he do not know what he be do but get the job do that be the important thing the cool thing for I be on this that I look forward to be go through the gate it be teleport I be a big sci fi head so for I to be on a series like this be go to be a lot of fun oh I can not this be overwhelm David Hewlett play the Dr McKay character on Stargate SG 1 on Seasons 5 and 6 he be the scientist the core guy that we be look for we need the Zed pm to power the gate what Zee PM he be canadian I be sorry Zero Point Module General the Ancient power source we recover it be now power the outpost defence I have determine that it generate its enormous power from vacuum energy derive from a self contain region of subspace time that be a waste of a perfectly good explanation the answer be no so our core team now be Joe Flanigan as Shepherd Torri Higginson as Dr Weir Rainbow Francks as Lieutenant Ford and surprise surprise set today on the second day of shoot David Hewlett as Dr McKay it be very exciting we be finally cast Welcome to Atlantis Lieutenant Aiden Ford Welcome to Atlantis and kiss her Cut Nice I love it this Stargate show we be just about to look at the previous shot for the Athos gate cut cut cut Coffee run this set it be the only way I can perform Liquorice all right I may not look like a peanut butter guy I be one get that out of here now that we be in the home of the Ancients what do it look like this be what it look like here we be this the main room for Stargate Atlantis it be what we call a gatrium this be a new gate new and improve gate mind you instead of actually rotate the gate it be a series of light that have be program in it take they I do not know 20 year to make this thing you can actually wiggle the Stargate it be a problem for we that we have to figure out we have to spray it with some anti wiggling stuff this one here say Welcome to Atlantis please no smoking it be all in Ancient so it do not matter what it say nobody on Earth actually speak Ancient any long this be the control room here we 've get the control unfortunately they be plastic you know what we could not get away from the blinky light unit that we love we build a bunch more of these to make light unit we can take with we here be a conference room notice these thing be all point at one another you hit this thing here and it shoot the person across there that be my concept enhoh the new animal take a look around and immediately choose a place next to the lazy greediest beast in the stable the master see this put a yoke on he and take he back to the merchant we 've hear this one already have it lose its meaning you tell it just now on the way down to the water hole who be you I do not know I get it I get it teal'c teal'c I get it I get it sorry Tyler Siler Master Sergeant Siler Three please it be not the Lost City there be a subtle difference in meaning in Asgard translation of early Ancient excuse I watch it watch it hey where be Major Carter she be in Hammond 's office accord to the Tok'ra Anubis be decimate the force of the remain System Lords I get it hopefully it be not contagious ha ha the Lost City on the tablet you find it yeah only it be not the Lost City that never make sense the tablet be write in Ancient how could they lose their own city and why call it the Lost City they would call it by its name Mr Quinn it be the City of the Lost do you have a gate address there be a reference in some translation that Dr Jackson be work on to a city of the Ancients call Vis Uban as a place where plague begin this be go to be the crown jewel in the entire ancient domain it be still under construction when the plague break out two word Gate address four year ago when ancient knowledge be download to Colonel O'Neill 's mind he put a bunch of new gate address into the SGC computer how many do he put in there we 've be send probe and catalogue they any relevant planet go on the mission list how many have be send probe Less than a quarter do you think he get these gate address randomly or could there be an order yeah I suppose if Vis Uban be not finish at the time the ancient civilisation fall you be say the city we be look for be the last on the list we 've be go in order from first to last right send a probe yes sir we be not talk about a common cold Carter it be the plague Sir we do not wear a hazmat every time we step through the gate there be always a chance we could be expose to something dangerous the place be call the City of the Dead City of the Lost actually sir not for lack of a sense of direction well these folk do not look lose nor dead I do not think that these be the Ancients I mean anything be possible but they look like some sort of a nomadic tribe that be just take up residence Greetings greeting we be traveller from a planet call Earth you come through the Chaapa ai the Stargate Chaapa ai he be Jaffa no but he play one on tv this be teal'c he be no long ally with the Goa'uld he be a friend as be we we too be traveller this place be not our original home but we have be here for some time now if you wish to lay claim no no no nothing like that we just want the opportunity to learn more about your people and to take a really good look around these ruin we do a sweep of the area sir maintain a secure perimeter 50 metre radius from the gate Sir they be traveller like we they say they be friend no one can be a friend if you know not whether to trust they do not judge a book by its cover enemy ' promise be make to be break and yet honesty be the good policy he that have too many friend have none ah but bird of a feather I be unfamiliar with that story what lesson do it teach it have to do with flock and togetherness and to be honest I be not that familiar with the particular myself the point be we be not your enemy give we a chance to prove it Colonel we find something you might want to see Daniel Arrom Arrom that be what we call he it mean Naked one that be how we find he in the forest two moon ago seem he do not remember who he be Daniel it be ok it be I S do you not recognise we Daniel Jackson I be sorry not even I please leave I alone I be Jack O'Neill and bar some freakish similarity you be Doctor Daniel Jackson this tent be all I know and these people they be all I know before I wake up in the forest I do not remember anything I 've try I 've try to remember who I be before sometimes I think it be float in front of I and all I have to do be reach out and grab it I try and it be go you be a member of my team SG 1 you be a friend of mine last year you die I be dead obviously not you just sort of die actually you ascend to a high plane of existence last time I see you you be help we fight Anubis Anubis yeah kind of an over the top cliché bad guy black cloak oily skin kind of spooky anyway obviously since then you 've retake human form somehow actually I can see how this might sound a bit unusual a bit why be I here hey why be any of we here honestly I do not know but you get to trust I you be Daniel Jackson think of it this way out of all the planet in the galaxy why this one if not for we to find you so you be say a high power put I here I do not know that be generally your department thank very much you be welcome Jonas and Teal'c be help SG 3 and 5 begin the preliminary sweep remember when I say it be like talk to a wall we know someone who be ascend can choose to retake human form you think he also choose to forget everything maybe the part about his memory be not voluntary maybe it be punishment for try to help we he do say he be break some big rule so what it be go to take time to search all the ruin there could be weapon or a power source hide anywhere in the meantime we try to help Daniel remember if that be even possible Tag you be it can I come in Sure so what do you say your name be again Samantha Carter you use to call I Sam yeah well like I already tell Jim uh Jack Jack yeah I tell he I do not understand why you be not die to know all about who you be I be and I be not see it be the not part what if I do not like who I be what if I do not want to be that person what if I do not have it in I to make up for something I 've do wrong I have to admit that never occur to I look we all think we would lose you at one point it be one of the hard thing I have ever be through you be you be brilliant one of the most caring passionate you be the type of person who would give his life for someone he do not even know that do not sound so bad if you have one fault it be that you want to save people so badly to help people so much that it tear you apart when you could not make a difference that actually sound kind of hard to live up to all I know be that if I be you I would definitely want to get to know I you I get it come back with we let we show you who you be instead of just tell you I will think about it ok Samantha Carter yeah be there ever anything between we Us no no not in that way we be really really good friend ok Carter Shamda here be just tell I a story about a dog and some dancing monkey the moral be appearance can be deceptive I get that very good story Wonderful full of nuance I like that we send up a UAV the ruin be quite extensive yeah it be go to take we week to scour this place properly what of Daniel Jackson he be go home welcome back Dr Jackson thank you thank you very much you have no memory of who I be none whatsoever neither do I sir that way do I mention you owe I 50 buck I be happy to say sir that he be in perfect health except for one small exception wow that be different you recognise I now have your hair always be that way what way never mind not exactly home but we unpack some of your stuff you keep all this even though you think I be dead to be honest we toss out a ton of junk a lot of which seem to be very valuable I keep a few of your personal thing alive there I know she really I mean I must right yeah who be she what be her name you tell I sorry be I interrupt you be not I be unable to kelno'reem as I once do since I begin use tretonin well that sound complicated indeed enter her name be Sha're yes no one tell I that I remember that by myself I dream about she and when I wake up I know her name that be good news Daniel Jackson yeah I believe I might have a chance if I can remember a name there be a chance it be all in there somewhere right indeed so where be she she be dead I love she very much this be Oma Desala be very powerful right that be correct why would she do this if she want I to forget you speak of the rule to which you be subjugate as one of the ascended perhaps she be require to erase your memory by law of the Others but as your friend and mentor she wish you one day to regain it you think she cheat find a way around the rule you do not agree tell I about this Anubis why do I break the rule to fight he be it not wise to remember on your own accord no I need to know why this be happen to I at this point we believe that we 've map the full extent of the ruin no fancy gun or anything cool we 've only complete a preliminary investigation sorry I be late I forget what time the meeting be that be a little joke there it be the memory thing Dr Jackson this briefing be classify yeah Jonas mention that but you all say that I use to be part of this so look I can not really give you a good reason I just feel like I should be here good enough besides who will I tell I do not remember anybody right good one thank Jim oh so there be extensive writing all in the oldest know ancient dialect all yet to be translate but so far we have not find any sign of any advanced weapon or power source the original name of the city Vis Uban do translate as place of great power but it do not mean we will find a way to defeat Anubis there you will not it be not the Lost City how do you know because Jonas translate lacun to mean of the lose but that be the wrong place but the translation in your note also wrong I be way off how do you know that I do not know I know what the tablet say how I do not know I just look at it and understand it be you say the Ancients actually lose one of their own city no they do not lose it they make it lose to other people that might try to find it I be guess that they camouflage it and remove all reference to it from the write history so the Lost City be still lose I be pretty sure you tell I to give Anubis that Eye accord to our ally Anubis be quickly conquer the other System Lords he will dominate the galaxy very soon I do it cos you say we could whup his ass with what we would find in this Lost City if I say that then I hope it be true but look all I know be that the place you be search right now be not it then where be it do I just say all I know everyone turn away I want no witness yeah hey sorry to bother you you be not I be just read about we actually you say that Anubis be part ascend that the Ancients try to send he back to our level of existence but fail and now he be trap somewhere in between so I 've hear Anubis would not know everything there be to know about the Ancients right or he would have already find the Lost City I know I read that tablet but I be just think out loud here if Anubis be to accidentally find the tablet he be not go to make the same mistake I do I do not know but if we be to make a replica of the tablet change what it say why as you all know we 've have little success use naquadria to power the F 302 's hyperspace generator for any length of time however if our calculation be correct we believe a short control burst would send the 302 into subspace long enough to bypass the mother ship 's shield and if your calculation be incorrect the 302 would bypass the mother ship altogether or bad re emerge inside it but let us not go there right now of course let us not dwell accord to intelligence provide by the Tok'ra the power core of Anubis 's new weapon must be cool by a ventilation shaft on the exterior of the ship if that can be target and destroy just as the weapon be power up the crystal will overheat and be destroy where be this shaft exactly as Colonel O'Neill be well aware we do not know exactly where the shaft be our operative in Anubis 's rank have be unable to get aboard the new ship and have only a very limited work knowledge of it Anubis 's computer system use elaborate cipher in the old ancient dialect we be unable to translate they Jonas and Daniel will sneak aboard Anubis 's ship and access the computer we have devise an injectable radioactive isotope that will allow they to move freely undetecte by sensor for eight hour they will decode and relay the target 's location to Colonel O'Neill and I who will be fly the F 302 no problem right hey sound easy to I Good Anubis 's ship be destroy and we all live to save another day again as the Colonel be well aware we have reason to believe that eliminate the crystal power core of the ship 's main weapon will not destroy the entire ship its defence and auxiliary weapon will remain intact why do not we dwell on that for just a minute our goal be to take out Anubis 's new superweapon it give he a clear advantage over the other Goa'uld mother ship we 've hear from Teal'c that Yu will bring the System Lords ' fleet down on Anubis once we 've succeed ok everyone who think this be an insane idea raise your hand come on be honest let us go get them up there keep your hand up people because the next question be who be go to make this happen it be go to take we at least a week to relocate the inhabitant of the ruin which will give we time to build a makeshift runway and get the 302 through the gate and reassemble and once everything be establish the Tok'ra will plant our fake tablet and with any luck we will lure Anubis to the planet let us move look I realise I be not the most positive voice in the room we all know it be an extreme long shot sir my big problem be that all this depend on we trust a Goa'uld to back we up this be our only chance to take Anubis out of the picture and Yu have help we in the past all I be say just for the record this be the wacky plan we 've ever come up with Wackier than strap an active Stargate onto the X 302 oh yeah wacky than blow up a sun Yep he be probably right my lord the fleet be ready I say when the fleet be ready of course my lord it be time we move they into position to prepare for the ambush of Anubis as you agree my lord speak to I as if I be a fool again and you will not take another breath yes my lord move the fleet into position that be your son yeah Charlie right he be why I know you you take that first mission to abydo think it would be suicide thing change yeah sorry you sure you be ready for this despite what you say I do not think you would be do this if it be not worth do you obviously do not remember everything you never use to follow my lead I do not hey I may not remember everything but I remember enough good Sir welcome to base camp thank you Major I have to admit it be strange to see you offworld this be not your usual alien planet operation be it Major no sir what be our status we be ready to go sir you would well get yourself out to the F 302 yes sir we just receive word Anubis 's ship will be arrive in the system momentarily Air Strike this be Command Base you be a go for take off I think we be go with Red Leader on this one all system go sir uh Command there be one more thing Colonel Major Godspeed all right that be well thank you sir thank guy good luck Holy crap look at that thing it be huge I think they know we be come sir Tally four glider nose 400 kilometre extend Max burn you be head right for they I want to see what this be make of I could tell you exactly sir another time maybe please Fox 4 2 pitch back leave 1 3 5 Daniel Jonas we be under attack we need that intel we be close we can not hold these guy off for long Great we get company my lord take the fleet to Chodawa my lord that be across the galaxy we be in position to ambush Anubis do not question I I be your god do as I say you can not I have no choice take he to a hold cell if you do not eliminate Anubis you be doom yourself and your master I must do as my god command my lord our ground troop confirm that there be a human base on the planet the search of the city no energy signature that will hold them off for a while a little while that be it I be in this may take more than a little while can not you do some kind of a keyword search for what Achilles I be glad to see your memory 's come back not to mention your razor sharp wit but why do not we try something like power core vent that be it that be it Jack Sam we get it transmit datum we get to go Carter Sir I 've get the datum but we need Anubis to power the weapon Airborne we have not hear from Teal'c the Goa'uld fleet be long overdue see I have a problem with this plan my lord the attack vessel continue to elude our glider send in another squadron I do not believe what you be search for be here I agree shall I target their base my lord no recall the ground troop yes my lord I do not think we be go to get back to the ring room that way what be that they be target the planet Base camp this be Jonas Come in go ahead your position be be compromise the Stargate be be target the naqahdah will amplify the blast Roger that evacuate all personnel we go at it now right we need the Goa'uld mother ship here to finish the job Sir four more glider head this way can we go at it now activate hyperdrive extend straight up Damn that be close transfer target datum to your terminal sir the human attack vessel have breach our shield shoot it down let us get outta here yeah Target be lock Fox 4 2 nice shot sir well thank you ma'am the core be overload we must power down the weapon Daniel come in do you read yeah I be still on the ship Hey congratulation you hit the mark thank it be fun we will wait until Anubis 's ship go and rendezvous with you at the Stargate as far as that go we may have a little problem you will suffer gravely yeah I figure as much although I be console by the fact that we succeed in destroy the power source for your new weapon you be in no position to gloat we just wipe out your single advantage you have over the Goa'uld I would say that be about as good a reason as any enough I will not tell you anything oh yes you will Visiontext Subtitles Doreen Trenerry enhoh  Rippé par BoRiF previously on Stargate SG 1 do you not recognise we Daniel I be sorry you be a member of my team SG 1 you be a friend of mine we be in position to ambush Anubis do not question I do as I say activate hyperdrive Target be lock Fox 4 2 you will suffer gravely I will not tell you anything yes you will receive IDC sir it be SG 1 open the iris Colonel Major our mission be a success Anubis 's new weapon have be neutralise well do what about Jonas and Dr Jackson still on the ship Anubis go into hyperspace do we have any idea where they go no sir you appear to be unharmed by the mind probe I appreciate the concern you seem calm consider some lowly human just put a serious crimp in your plan for galactic domination your insolence amuse I I 've learn many valuable thing from you Jonas Quinn I now know Dr Jackson accompany you aboard this ship do you know where he be he continue to elude our sensor but his time be run out nothing you learn from me'll help you oh we will see about that have a look out the window we drop out of hyperspace I be eager to find out more about this powerful variation of naqahdah discover on your planet I believe you call it Naquadria where be we welcome home Jonas Quinn I just get a report from the Tok'ra they 've no news on the location of Anubis 's ship what about Teal'c we can only assume he be with Yu 's fleet any idea why they do not show I could make a guess you think Yu hang we out to dry I be not go to touch that sir I do not think he make a deal with Anubis Trust a Goa'uld this be what you get I understand how you feel but I approve this operation because I believe it be our good chance to deal Anubis a crippling blow yes sir unschedule offworld activation receive a radio signal sir this be Ambassador Dreylock of the Kelownan High Council General Hammond of Stargate Command we request immediate assistance we be under attack we 've be over this we can not interfere in the internal affair of your planet you do not understand we be under attack from a Goa'uld call Anubis why have I be detain Lord Yu be without honour Shol'va Jaffa Kree jel na we have an agreement you have not be betray not deliberately I do not understand my master be not well he spend most of his time in the sarcophagus he be there even now why do he not take another host I believe he have reach the point where he be incapable Lord Yu be the old of the System Lords he have reign for countless century but now I be begin to fear that even god can not live forever Lord Yu be not a god once I would have strike you down for speak those word but now he be convince that Anubis be in the Chodawa system and even though I know this be not the case I could not contradict he but you have see that Lord Yu can make mistake he have become increasingly paranoid and confuse he speak to himself but his word make no sense he forget key detail of our attack plan and grow angry when I remind he if what you say be true you and your Jaffa be in grave danger you must do something I can not betray he I have devote my life to his service if this continue Lord Yu 's empire will fall million of Jaffa will die Lord Yu will be remember as a fool what meaning will your life have then have they agree to help we not yet Colonel O'Neill Major Carter Ambassador Commander thank you for come what be go on kid a ship be hover over the city Alien troop have take the capitol building and other position where be we this bunker be several hundred foot below an army base on the outskirt of the city the communicator should work it can transmit from Tok'ra tunnel I do not understand two of our people may be on that ship one be Jonas Quinn Daniel Daniel come in it be O'Neill Daniel Jack what be your situation I be hide what be yours Carter and I be on the planet be more specific I have not have a chance to look out a window you be hover over Jonas 's home why I wish I know be you in any immediate danger depend on what you mean by immediate Daniel I be fine I get a location on Jonas 's cell but first I 've get a couple of problem like what I be not sure how to shut off the force field protect his cell yet you say a couple yeah actually I be a little lost and I 've only get about three hour leave before the Tok'ra isotope wear off and I be visible to the sensor so business as usual then huh I do not know be it yes we do this kind of thing all the time oh well good that be comfort then this be a mistake Lord Yu can no long be permit to command the opposition to Anubis his Jaffa will follow your order in his name but other will not we need the combine force of the System Lords none of they can be trust nonetheless one must be choose the signal be come through what be the meaning of this Lord Baal where be your master why do you allow this shol'va to appear before I I be here to present an offer I will not listen to a traitor then you will miss an opportunity to rid yourself of Anubis forever when the ship appear we be catch completely off guard there be widespread panic before we know what be happen most of the High Council have be take hostage when we would not give in to his demand Anubis have the First Minister execute he also fire a volley into our industrial sector destroy several factory and kill many innocent citizen after that we give he what he want which be Naquadria our entire stockpile Commander we be receive a transmission from the surface excuse I a moment Anubis must 've use that mind probe on Jonas and find out about the Naquadria then he know the stuff only work half the time just cos we can not establish a stable power output do not mean he will not if he do Tadada dah ta dah the truth be my master be no long fit to lead the force of the System Lords how dare you judge your god the shol'va have poison your mind clearly Lord Baal be not interested we should contact another System Lord hm perhaps Bastet if I assume command how can I be assure of the loyalty of Yu 's troop they will follow I in his name and will you obey I the destruction of Anubis be in my master 's good interest I will support any action that lead to this goal if you be in agreement I must contact the Tauri to make the final arrangement then do so take I to the near Stargate Commander you say you give Anubis your entire stockpile of Naquadria that be correct so if he get what he want why be he still here I have no idea his man have round up archaeologist from the Academy of Sciences he may be look for the Stargate how secure be this place it be top secret we have the gate move here after the Tiranians and Andaris begin air strike so you do go to war yes but we manage to negotiate a cease fire I think you be outgunne and outman we use the Naquadria bomb on people we instantly regret it the devastation be beyond anything we have imagine as many Kelownans would have die have we do nothing we be face with our own destruction and you refuse to help we and as awful as it be it manage to bring Tiranians and Andaris to the table Delegates have just arrive in the city for peace talk do they know about the Stargate no they may have notice the rather large ship float in the sky you might as well tell they the rest we be hope it would not come to that Anubis have everything he come for he may just leave if Anubis can figure out how to overcome the instability of the Naquadria it will give he a significant advantage over all his enemy he be go to want more there be no more the mine be dry you think he will take your word for it he will occupy this planet and enslave your people we 've see it before what can we do if you want to fight we will help you but we need the cooperation of the other major power on this world my lord I have complete a preliminary analysis of the Naquadria the potential energy output be great than that of regular naqahdah it will be hard to maintain a stable reaction this ship must have full power again I will not accept failure my lord we 've already learn all we can from Jonas Quinn why keep he alive his physiology merit further experimentation he may still prove to be very useful Jonas Jonas be you there Daniel yeah be you all right yeah I be fine where be you I be in a storage room about 20 foot from your current position can you get I out of here I be work on it Colonel O'Neill Major Carter may I present the leader of the Tiranian and Andari peace delegation Ambassador Sevaarin and Ambassador Noor Colonel O'Neill and Major Carter represent a planet call Earth they do not look very alien we get that a lot and this of course be the Stargate how do it work let us have a look something like that Incredible be not it he be one of the enemy soldier relax he be one of ours it be good to see you both again we get your message from Hammond be you nuts I believe it to be our only choice O'Neill I do not know quite how to tell you this but Anubis have take the ship to your home we be above the Kelownan capital I know he want Naquadria if it be not for I he would never have find out about it do not blame yourself the point be I join Stargate Command so maybe one day I could protect my planet from the Goa'uld instead I bring they right to it we will find a way out yeah apparently we already trust one Goa'uld look where it get we I do not trust Baal O'Neill but I believe at least for the moment his goal be the same as ours all right have at it oh yes you do the talking we have make an agreement with another System Lord name Baal if we give he your location he will bring a fleet and destroy Anubis you propose to bring more of these Goa'uld to our world for now Anubis be vulnerable he have but one ship and be preoccupy but believe his position to be secure because he know the other lord be unaware of this place and if Anubis be destroy how do we know this Baal will leave we alone that be part of the agreement you say we can not negotiate with Anubis and these Goa'uld can not be trust and yet you ask we to trust another your world face an imminent threat Kelowna face the threat there be no alien ship in the sky above Tirania see what we have to deal with have not you guy ever hear the story of the dog and the dancing monkey have something to do with get along and dance Carter with all due respect Mr Ambassador when Anubis comes look for more Naquadria he will not respect any border he will tear this planet apart piece by piece if he have to I will not approve any plan unless I have unanimous agreement from all party my lord have you find a way to overcome the Naquadria 's instability I believe I have then use it to power one of the ship 's weapon array I want it test now we will need to select a target how fortunate there be a city before we I be unsure of the power of this weapon the blast radius from one shot could encompass the entire city if it do you will have my congratulation Daniel this be Sam come in go ahead do you find Jonas yeah I be still have trouble with the force field you be go to have to find a way to cut the power how do I do that Unsure we 've two hour to figure it out what happen then Baal 's fleet arrive I 've get 15 minute till this isotope wear out and I be visible to the ship 's sensor I will have to get back to you I 've get company Kel nor shol ak'ra Reltac Tel shek anfar tel nor moklan n'ral Jaffa Sarit Naquadria generator be online we be ready charge the weapon my lord the generator be overload Abort the test I can not abate the overload Jaffa kree this make no sense I compensate for the instability kill he Jonas what happen I do not know whatever it be there be not enough power to maintain the force field agh you ok that hurt your arm a little numb I think I can make it you well I do not want to have to take you out of here in a dustpan Nice how do we get off this thing Cargo ship which way uh this way you sure no right report we be in position but the Kelownans want more troop to deal with the Jaffa on the ground I can not authorise that without Pentagon approval yes sir but I be think maybe I could take sg 15 and 11 as technical advisor what if Baal do not show up could get a little screwy but we talk these folk into this the least we can do be back them up agree Put your team together Sir Anubis have superior shield but our intelligence say they be less than 40 effective in a planet 's atmosphere if Baal attack while Anubis be weak he have a chance that be not very reassuring we just hear Anubis 's man be ransack the Museum of Antiquities why would they do that they may still be look for the gate no Anubis be smart enough to know that it would not be in a public place what be in the museum nothing the exhibit be put into storage when the war begin ok what be in the exhibit trinket from the original Goa'uld site pottery statue what about tablet those be classify top secret and give to the scientist work on our Naquadria project I would like to see a list of exhibit object Anubis be look for something I wanna know what Cargo bay should be down the next hall how be your arm I can wiggle my finger those be all the Jaffa go into the cargo bay which be just down the hall eight man that be all you bring eight good man there be over 1 000 alien soldier in the city their weapon be more powerful than anything our force have ever see we do not stand a chance the main problem be the ship once that be take out we can deal with the Jaffa Sir I think I know why Anubis have not leave yet he be look for a crystal the Kelownan archaeologist find it but they do not know what it be they classify it as a decorative object and put it in the museum I do not understand what be it the Goa'uld use crystal to store information what information the original Goa'uld who occupy this planet be experiment with Naquadria but there be no detail no lab note no test result you think that be what be on the crystal it make sense your people not know its importance never include it with the other material that be why Jonas never know of it Sir if Anubis get ahold of this crystal he could use it to make the Naquadria work yeah I get it where be it everything be move to a warehouse I can take you there wait if this be as important as you say let I send a contingent to secure the building we do not want to draw any unnecessary attention to the place I will go sir I know what to look for all right take teal'c look like patrol be close in and we 've get one minute before the isotope wear off that planet you guy find I on be nice people be simple life be quiet why do not you stay I could not remember what this be like it be fun be not it yeah if we get out of this you can keep the office actually I be talk about SG 1 you take the position cos you feel guilty about what happen to I and think you would make up for it by finish my work I love the job who would argue bad hour constant peril on the bright side you do get to travel a lot you be very up yeah truth be I do not think that Colonel O'Neill be very comfortable have I around that be not what he tell I he say you be a good man really he say that yeah you be shock he never let on anyway now that you be back let us worry about get out of here first ring what good be that nowhere to ring to we find a ring platform when we find the gate so it have not be use in 2 000 year well let us see if it still work look like we get here first Jaffa kree two unauthorised personnel detect on sensor approach your sector this be hopeless it have to be here somewhere Major Carter Bingo Jaffa kree Shel norak do we know where it be we be go not a clue Gal a'quel Argh nice timing Thanks Jonas Quinn Ambassador where be we Warehouse where they keep Goa'uld artefact include a ring platform and a crystal let us go there be more Jaffa on our tail Perimeter 's clear we 've a visual on Major Robbin 's position across the square ok Sergeant sit tight O'Neill out Colonel hey where have you find they they drop into the warehouse nice the crystal right here I will take that I think it would be well if we hold onto it I be afraid I must insist what be this I 've make a separate arrangement put down your weapon Colonel or I will be force to destroy these people the crystal you be an idiot you know that in exchange for this Anubis have agree to leave Kelownan territory untouche thus confirm my last statement he know our Naquadria supply be deplete but I believe he may find another mine on tiranian territory that be a lie one of your scientist be a Kelownan spy you 've be try to build a bomb for the last three year but we do not mine the Naquadria we steal it from the Andaris what do not you see what be happen here he be use you against each other enough you can not afford to fight this planet be a target not just Kelowna or Tirania you have to stand together I say enough you 've get to start trust each other or you be all go to become slave if you be lucky the crystal thank you as for the rest of you you will be publicly execute as an example to all those who would defy their god do it have to be publicly I could kill you now Publicly 's fine Jaffa Aargh Tel nor hatak mal shee your ship be at my mercy you be defeat Surrender now Jaffa kree Daniel Argh Jonas agh I owe you one we will call it even the last time you return to Kelowna you be consider a traitor that will not be the case this time be you sure the Andaris and Tiranians only participate in a joint rule council on condition you be the Kelownan representative your year 's experience will be vital to our planet face what await in our future we need you Jonas get everything pack toothbrush slipper hair gel yes Sir it be an honour son yes it be when we first meet you tell I that the issue between my planet 's nation would seem insignificant once I find out what be really go on up there yeah I remember that you do yeah that be great it be all kind of come back I be glad I have the chance to find out I too you have the heart of a warrior Jonas Quinn continue to fight well keep in touch uh you earn it thank hey Daniel Feed my fish you all right yeah well dinner 's at seven do not be late teal'c get a little cranky when his blood sugar get low Jack yeah it be not that I mind rejoin SG 1 and explore the galaxy meet new culture jeopardy save the world that kind of thing we get pay for this right welcome back Visiontext Subtitles Natasha Cohn enhoh  Rippé par BoRiF General what be this all about at 0920 hour this morning someone try to enter the base use this Colonel O'Neill 's security ID after he be take into custody he insist on see you I why I be hope you could figure that one out Major open it thank you now we be get somewhere Sergeant that coffee I ask for half an hour ago anytime you feel like get it he be a boy sir as it turn out Carter yes I be for the moment do I know you come on it be I we try to contact Colonel O'Neill even send someone to his house do you understand how much trouble you be in impersonate a military officer be a federal offence I be not impersonate anyone I be Jack O'Neill finally hot chocolate be you kid where do you get this I do not I do not get it anywhere it be mine because you be Colonel O'Neill exactly last night I eat some dinner have a beer go to bed and wake up like this can we please get to the part where you and Fraiser run some test find a cure make I big again this be the security breach Daniel tell they who I be please ok love to who be you this young man claim he be Colonel O'Neill it be a joke right what be go on Daniel sound like he at least the loud grate part ok you want proof Carter you once carry a Tok'ra name Jolinar who give her life to save you Daniel until recently you be an ascended being you break the rule you got kick out of the Oma Desala fan club and have your memory erase and you and Bra'tac both just lose your snake in a Goa'uld ambush have your tretonin yet this morning how could this child possess such knowledge because it be I anyone care to speculate how a boy could be aware of classified information well sir it could be he there be a physical resemblance but he can not be more than 15 year old be you say Colonel O'Neill have regress more than 30 year overnight Stranger thing have happen Name but one the time he get really old the time he become a caveman the time we all why do not we move on to the testing portion of this exercise be you certain Doctor within an acceptable margin of error the boy 's dna be virtually identical to Colonel O'Neill 's what size margin of error very small in a court of law the DNA sample we take would be consider a high probability match to that of Colonel O'Neill there be a tiny abnormality but for all intent and purpose it be he tiny abnormality like the fact he be a few year young than he be mean to be to be honest this be out of my league we 've get specialist fly in we will run more test see what we can learn in the meantime we will try to make he as comfortable as possible I will go set up a PlayStation you know I think you two be enjoy this just a little too much well you be kinda cute that be sir to you and be trap inside a scrawny little body be not my idea of cute Carter do possess a young body not have certain advantage O'Neill no not see it what do you mean do you not experience increase health and vitality my vitality be just fine thank you I think what Teal'c be say be valid how many of we would not trade everything for the chance to live our life over yeah well I do not plan on stay like this well in the meantime may I make a suggestion try enjoy this as much as we be Sir it be nice to know some thing do not change I be not exactly expect visitor we will send this stuff to the lab for analysis well if they find MSG I will never order from they again what be we do here exactly this be the last place you remember be old be you conduct a scientific experiment O'Neill come on that salsa 's still good what be the last thing you eat sir four cheese burritos some guacamole on the side anything else a beer then I hit the sack so whatever happen to you must have occur once you be asleep hey do you mind teal'c Whoa O'Neill what be it either I be remember a particularly bad dream or the Asgard pay I a little visit last night what you be say make no sense Jack 's account sound like a number of UFO abduction case file I 've read this you remember my birthday you forget look like you will have a lot more this encounter be incongruous with all previous contact with the Asgard Thor have indicate that the Asgard keep an eye on human development on Earth but we be ally now we 've cooperate on a number of mission this I would not have agree to what could they possibly hope to gain from secretly make you young against your will I get nothing I would like to cross reference the abduction account see if I can find a connection please do Major I believe you have a briefing to run at 1300 hour yes sir I will be there the F 302 briefing I think I be run that it would be good if the major handle it I be sure you can impart any information she need to know but I be the one who Good dismiss come in Jack try to understand your situation put I in a very difficult position no offence but you be not the one who go to bed watch CNN and wake up as part of the MTV generation which be why Major Carter 's handling that briefing I 've fly the 302 more than anyone else be that as it may the bottom line be a room full of seasoned pilot be not go to respect the opinion of a boy Sir I just look like one for the moment but those man in that room need my expertise and if they be go to be work here they be go to have to get use to unusual thing happen look Jack no one be dispute that you may continue to be a valuable asset to the SGC but under the circumstance there be nothing I can do I be sorry yes sir I understand dumb idea it would appear that many Tauri have encounter being from other world little do they know how close they be to the truth what exactly be we look for Daniel Jackson any abduction account that match Jack 's story and anyone claim to have physically regress several decade overnight we need to enter our search parameter it have already be do wow that be a lot of people indeed let us see if any of these match Jack 's story he say he see four green light that be a little more reasonable that be interesting of the narrow down account the most recent be from 19 year ago eight be here in the States if these address be still valid we should talk to these people in person what do you hope to learn I guess we will know when we learn it as your intel package show the F 302 be a spaceworthy fighter interceptor aircraft reverse engineer from Goa'uld technology your upcoming mission have be dub Operation Blue Phoenix it will be a live fire combat simulation to test the 302 against actual death glider Captain accord to our mission report you be second seat on the most recent 302 mission yes and it include close combat we will cover what be learn in that encounter do not Colonel O'Neill pilot that mission yes as a matter of fact he do he also command the X 302 on both hyperspace window mission do not he what be your point Major with respect ma'am should not he be run this briefing Colonel O'Neill be unavailable however I have several computer model to help you understand how the 302 handle in combat situation no offence but those will not help I when I be pull 6 g 's in a dogfight as you should know Captain the 302 have inertial dampening system which I be more than qualified to explain in detail so let us just I just drop by to say ow Sir please do not resist stay focused ok I be warn you Sir do not I just say I be warn you hey Ooh that be it now I be mad you can release he I will forgo the charge for assault a superior officer Carter could have take them I be sure sorry I be late what have I miss we be cover the 302 's flight capability then here be what you need to know Major be this a joke no this be Colonel O'Neill I be only go to say this once so I would suggest that you listen up whatever you say hey I realise that it do not actually say Colonel on my uniform but it should yes sir now velocity be key during engagement with a glider your instinct tell you to floor it because it be more manoeuvrable but you 've get to stay in control the inertial dampener only compensate 90 when pull negative g 's so the real trick be know your enemy so you can anticipate their next move ok death glider 101 may I ask why the United States Air Force have take a renew interest in my story after 26 year all I can tell you be that we have some new information will it prove my story true eventually maybe please tell we what happen to you I be asleep in my bed and a light appear in my room and take I take you where some kind of spacecraft I suppose I be weightless float in midair and yet it be dark cold I could not move a muscle even though I be wide awake after the light hit you then what the device come they be these green glow ball that float around I after the small green sphere stop scan he they leave he alone for a long while and then a voice speak to he tell he not to be afraid and that he would soon be safe again do Professor Wu see who speak to he all the account be basically identical they match Jack 's version of event except none of they experience any physical change as a result but everything else be bang on take while sleep out of body experience all this do sound familiar cliché even if you watch enough tv but they all describe four green globe buzz around they like insect that be too specific a detail to be a coincidence the being that abduct they I assume they describe an Asgard as well short big eye no hair weird voice the Asgard have not respond to our attempt communication if help be come it well arrive soon it be open how be you do well I think I be get another zit and uh oh yeah I be still a kid but beyond that I be do just peachy thank why well Janet just finish go over the genetic team 's analysis of your test result how bad can it be you be probably not feel the effect yet but something be happen to your body at the cellular level basically your genetic structure 's grow more unstable Colonel you be die honestly I feel fine you will start to notice symptom as the condition worsen how long do I have it be hard to say say it anyway week day I do not know you will notice fatigue first in the end your body 's vital organ will shut down it be like something inside you be cause a total system failure I do not get it we help save their skinny ass from the replicator and as a thank they shrink I and leave I to die we be explore every option we have Colonel we just need you to hang in there thank for come I be sure it will help come from you how be Mark and the kid Good Great I will tell they you say hi I be sorry Sam tell I what be go on but what could anyone possibly hope to gain from this can we just uh get on with it I be not get any young well as I tell Sam our option be pretty limited you come all this way to say goodbye at this point I be here to recommend we put you in stasis until we understand your condition you wanna freeze I we be not talk about cryogenic as we know it here on Earth the risk involve be minimal I 've be down this road with the Tok'ra before no offence Jacob but the last time you guy help I out of a jam I end up rescue an old girlfriend I have never meet before we would never subject you to another blending without your permission good cos it be never go to happen no pressure Jack but you need to make a decision we have a team stand by but if you wait too long we may not be able to reverse the cellular breakdown Colonel please it be your choice Jack can I have five minute to think about it you can have ten Colonel do you think he will do it if I have to drag he there myself I do not come all this way to watch he die like this we have a security breach level 25 guest quarter security team have sweep the base three time inside and out they 've find nothing I think it be safe to assume he be no long here he know the SGC as well as anyone if he want a way out he would find one I 've notify the authority with any luck they will find he soon Sir there be something you all need to see go on home kid before I call the cop it be a school night for cryin ' out loud how about lite beer Gimme a break Harley excuse I yeah Harlan Beck you serve in Operation Proven Force out of Incirlik yeah during the Gulf how have you know that kid what be you kid I run I mean uh my uncle know a Lieutenant Beck from the war say he be a stand up guy Flew an AC 130 gunship over Baghdad then your uncle have to be in the Special Ops yeah he be Colonel Jack O'Neill you be Jack O'Neill 's nephew I do not know he have a sibling well use to Uncle Jack 's be like a father to I since my folk die so how be old Jack doing anyway he be fine he be not that old either well tell he tell he Harley say to watch his six hey yeah uh speak of six look see as how you know my uncle and all you think you could do I a little favour Selmak have have a chance to digest some of the DNA test result and it seem Colonel O'Neill 's condition be not what we think he be not die he be but we think we know the cause when we first compare the dna sample the match be almost perfect you say there be a tiny abnormality yes Selmak think he know why this be not Colonel O'Neill but he be a clone I see keep I inform no word yet on what exactly do we call he at this point Duplicate O'Neill Sir we think we have a clear idea of what might be go on enlighten I we know the Asgard clone themselves they clone their body then transfer their consciousness from one to the next they suffer from grave disease due to thousand of year of clone lead to extinction if they can not solve the problem of diminish return in their cloning technology what do this have to do with Colonel O'Neill we have the abductee ' dna that teal'c and I interview scan for the same abnormality as Duplicate O'Neill as far as we can tell none of they be clone which mean in all likelihood the Asgard responsible take the original people and replace they with duplicate they study the original and then switch they back you think whoever take the real Colonel O'Neill be go to return he it be all we 've get sir we be hope the fact that the clone do not mature be a mistake what make you think that the previous action of this Asgard indicate his desire to remain covert Jack 's clone be a dead giveaway the Asgard do not know there be a problem or he would have try to fix it they will figure it out when they try to switch he back if they try to switch if we do not track down the duplicate we may not get the real O'Neill back we be sure the Asgard could find he if he want that be not the real issue we wish to apprehend the Asgard intercept the next switch may be our only shot Hammond General Hammond sir I have a Lieutenant Colonel Beck from the 10th Air Base Wing on the line for you it have to do with Colonel O'Neill patch he through yes sir unless you bring beer that be close enough Colonel we need you to come back with we how have you find I Lieutenant Colonel Beck call General Hammond and place you in the area a man from whom you buy bait recommend this river tell Jacob thank but I be not interested in the deep freeze deal we be not here to take you to the Tok'ra there may not be much time never be be there ok well there be no easy way to tell you this so Sam 's just go to come right out and say it well sir as you know the Asgard depend on a cloning technology oh for cryin ' out loud you have be clone O'Neill what we think the Asgard take the real you and make a copy an unstable one at that the real I yeah the original that be not your real anything I be sorry where be the original that be what we hope to find out but we need your help we 've calculate a seven day gap between abduction which put we at tonight this plan suck look I know you do not think I be who I be but as far as I be concern I be who I be the switch be our only chance of capture whoever be behind this what about the fact that this body be die have anyone even think about that for a second oh I see you do not care as long as you get the original back we just we do not know what else to do for you perhaps the Asgard responsible can correct his mistake Fine give I a nine mil I will get it out of the sucker we do not know who or what we might be face yet exactly why you can not just use I as bait and hang I out to dry you will never intercept an Asgard beam the only chance you have of capture this guy be I Come on a zat gun thank you sir Carter you still get your ear on yes sir Daniel teal'c everything appear to be normal O'Neill yeah not to I Wanna go over the instruction again do not worry Carter I be sure I will figure it out Colonel you all right Jack Jack O'Neill what be you all do in my bedroom hello do not be afraid I assume this be important just a little sir ok wrong console far right jewel thingy up ah and three o'clock I be have the weird dream you see Carter tell you it be no problem what be going on wow you know I be really much tall than I think Carter Colonel O'Neill meet Colonel O'Neill what be going on we be pretty sure this Asgard over here kidnap you and attempt to replace you with a clone how long be I asleep seven day it be a record so you be you I yeah believe I if you think it be weird imagine how I feel be the copy he have awaken what be happen we be kinda hope you could tell we no no no this be all wrong hey I will tell you what be wrong I just wake up I have not have coffee let alone a pee in seven day and I find out you steal my ass and make a mini I Carter I should be irk currently yes yes I would be why do not you tell we who you be Loki accord to Norse mythology that be the god of mischief what do you want with Colonel O'Neill I have nothing more to say to any of you hey we just save your flat little white ass from the replicator this be the thank we get at least you be go to live what maybe you be a little put out but this guy do not hit the right button on the Xerox this body be go to fall apart if he do not fix I I can not all the clone suffer the same fate ok I be go back to my original question what be go on I be a scientist a former geneticist with the Asgard Ruling Council Former I be strip of my stature after I be catch perform unsanctioned experiment on human what you 've get sanction one I have the courage to do what be need to advance our cloning technology instead of courage some might call it a lack of morality our population can not withstand the duplication process for much long how can experiment on human change that your body be similar to our original form thousand of year ago use your physical make up as a template I hope to construct a clone that could contain our massively superior intellect my research be unsuccessful so much for massively superior intellect I be go to say that I be go to say it be unsuccessful prior to my be catch and banish I would have find what I need why risk come back after 19 year because I think he be the one I I I believe his genetic code contain the key Mine Mine stop it he be physiologically advance enough to carry and utilise all the datum from the Ancients ' repository of knowledge impossible for any human one generation ago he be a significant step forward on your evolutionary path you just find this out recently I learn it when all the Asgard do O'Neill be legendary the Asgard fleet have be distract by the war with the replicator and subsequent relocation of our people so you take the opportunity when no one be look to sneak back here I do not regret my action I be try to save my people look I know this be not all about I but come on seriously I be dyin ' here I can not reverse your fate nor can I explain why you do not mature to the proper age as you should have well easy to see why they kick you out of the science club all right I 've hear enough Carter can you call Thor on this thing please do not we 've try contact the Asgard you would think if Thor know about this ok pretty sure that be it all right how long be we go you all right actually no what do we do if Thor do not show up never mind well it be about time I apologise for not come soon Loki what have you do seem he be be play Dr Moreau behind your back yes Dr Moreau you know why I be here you should have know O'Neill 's genetic coding be safeguard for his own protection excuse I a marker be place in your dna to prevent attempt at genetic manipulation the abnormality that be why the clone do not mature yes Loki will be punish for his action be it true that Colonel O'Neill be the key to solve your cloning problem no but I think I be advanced indeed you be O'Neill but our scientist have already determine that while you be an important step forward in the evolutionary chain the miss link we have be search for still elude we I be sorry again I apologise for any inconvenience Loki may have cause yeah that be what I would call it unfortunately the eventual genetic breakdown of the clone be not my do but rather a result of Loki 's inept method there be no need for the clone to survive look Thor be there anything you can do for he the whining be start to grate you wish your clone to live you can not just let I die he be just a kid be you certain O'Neill I be think yeah very well I will attempt to repair his dna if successful he should continue to mature at a normal human rate thank today on the street in the metro it be a melancholy day no one speak pass you by wonder why you sure about this I 've think a lot about it you know you I I mean we never really do embrace high school have not you ever want to go back and do it all over again especially with all you know now no well from here on in you and I be different which be why I be go to do this hey listen do I a favour huh do not worry I be not go to keep in touch yeah it would just be a little Weird Weird yeah yeah but if you need anything just the air force have set I up I will be fine you sure about this I mean it be high school yes go forth young man who be I who be I who be I today in the air on the metro it be a melancholy day Visiontext Subtitles Paul Murray enhoh  Rippé par BoRiF unscheduled offworld activation it be SG 1 's IDC sir receive audio sir on speaker close quarter withdrawal it be go to get

empty symbiote pouch and damage your spine in the past I could have let your symbiote regenerate it with work you should be able to make a full recovery teal'c the Jaffa that wound I die his symbiote be damage beyond repair look I know this be hard for you but you be very lucky to be alive Colonel O'Neill plant my radio in the underbrush and begin broadcast to create a distraction the Jaffa fall for this and half of they leave the temple we engage the rest and escape be you able to ascertain who these Jaffa be loyal to the forehead tattoo be of various System Lords mainly Baal Baal his empire have expand fast no surprise to we since he now control the United Alliance of the System Lords something we be responsible for to level the playing field against Anubis so in a way we do it to ourselves Sir how be he it be go to be a long road back but he should get there I boost his tretonin dosage to stem off any residual infection can we see he yeah my son why do you ask I just think you would be sick of how be you feel again indeed no I be just think about he Rya'c be with Bra'tac they be attempt to recruit rebel Jaffa I have not hear from they and do not expect to for some time what be with the uh O'Neill I believe his offer of coloured gelatin be his attempt to sympathise ah well he be thoughtful that way there be no need I blame only myself how be it your fault I fall behind I be cover we teal'c I wish to be alone Daniel Jackson ok ok no Master so they fly halfway across the galaxy in a highly advanced spaceship but do not use their technology to take over the planet you know what their weakness turn out to be Water why go to all the trouble to invade a planet that be two third water not to mention the rain why do you watch those movie all you do be cut them up do not you occasionally like to see if they be get it anywhere close to right hello what be you ok ever feel you forget something important what do you mean well I can remember almost everything from before I die but I can not remember anything from when I be ascend lately something be be nag at I something specific I just can not pin it down very good teal'c ok you be do teal'c look like you be do well there be such a thing as overdo it teal'c it be possible to aggravate your condition by push too hard leave I be no Master Daniel any technical anomaly during an incoming wormhole be note in this box and cross reference and detail here it be pretty dry the mission file cover point of interest I 've be over those if I know what you be look for we would not be do this why do you think the answer be here I have a feeling it have something to do with an incoming wormhole I be hope that look at some of this stuff might jog my memory somehow it must be tough the hard part be not know whether or not I choose to be here like this whether I could be do more good if I be still Ascended yeah well this should be everything you need good luck thank that be the last of the physical examination you have just lift and pull more weight than anyone on this base ever have Alien technology notwithstanding teal'c I be clear you for active duty I be not ready still nothing I 've broaden my search to include outgoing wormhole and unauthorised activation I still have no idea what I be look for maybe if you stop think about it it will come to you take a break Fraiser say Teal'c need a little pep talk I 've be practise in front of a mirror not peppy enough not really do not give I the eyebrow something be bother you something be bother you before this injury we be pretty sure we know what it be then there be no mystery yeah but the point be you have to talk about it ok you do not have to talk about it but you will feel well if you do you know forget that crap I be your command officer and you must be keep inform of my fitness Fraiser say you be ready for duty now be that true I have be dishonest with you oh it be unacceptable all Jaffa child know this without be tell they be bear with the knowledge it will not be tolerate what Kek Death you mean death Weakness we use one word for both for if one be weak one may as well be dead you be talk about the tretonin I believe it to be the answer of liberation for all Jaffa from the Goa'uld and the reliance on symbiote but as soon as I begin to take it thing change I feel my capability be be compromise but I say nothing hope the effect be temporary and my strength would return it do not ok forgive I O'Neill I should have no there be nothing to forgive you be still twice as strong as I will ever be and you 've get two good knee then the answer to your question be no I do not feel that I be fit for duty ok I can accept that for now not exactly peppy what do you want I to say to the guy he be lose his confidence he want you to reinstall some if he really have lose his mojo nothing I can say will get it back for he it be all in his head if he do not think he be ready he be not without a symbiote kelno'reem be unnecessary I have discontinue the practice yeah I know you do not need to kelno'reem any more but just indulge I human meditate even though they still require rem sleep I think this thing I can not remember Daniel Jackson for a successful kelno'reem there be one element require above all other what silence right no Master Master no Master no master Kree Ha'shak leave he alone no Master Master no Master no master Rya'c yeah yeah I see he and bra'tac I think they be in danger be you familiar with the ambush of Kresh'ta the Jaffa rebel tribe I read the report 106 warrior slaughter only you and Bra'tac survive you sustain both of your life by pass a symbiote between you there be something that be not in the report as I lay near death I begin to dream you use your ability and appear to I in that dream I do indeed when I have recover you appear to I again and that be when I know you have stay with I and watch over I for three day and that be the reason I be eternally grateful to you Daniel Jackson and why I wholeheartedly believe you concern Rya'c so you believe I too the thing I 've hear sit here if this happen before you retook human form then whatever supply of tretonin Bra'tac have would be deplete by now that be why we must act immediately Daniel you think all this have to do with gate record perhaps you know to look for a location I 've be through those record I have not find anything teal'c be there anything familiar about the planet there be not General Hammond I request that we send for Rak'nor immediately do it yes sir you grow more and more weak each day you worry too much for I Rya'c tend to your own labour a kek ha'shak Ya duru if you do not work you will die they do not work hard enough no rescue be forthcoming and your supply of tretonin run low Rya'c Kree ga we will not be able to maintain our workload they will execute we next Kree Kek have faith I will ration my tretonin until a rescue Kek Kol'va be any of this familiar to you a planet with two moon a naqahdah refinery near some sort of dry dock with a mother ship under construction I know the planet of which you describe Erebus accord to greek mythology Erebus be where condemn soul pass it be aptly name the planet be use for the construction of Ha'tak vessel and the purification of naqahdah to build they only Jaffa prisoner labour be use they can withstand the heat and toxic gas of the blast furnace feed by underground volcanic system eventually even the Jaffa succumb I be aware of such place Jaffa prisoner unwilling to serve their Goa'uld master be work to death the perfect place to recruit rebel something 's go wrong the planet be recently take by Baal if bra'tac and Rya'c be there then perhaps they be trap then they be lose why the Stargate on Erebus be impenetrable how so a force field much like your iris block it make rescue through it impossible someone must get through we believe a signal be use to power down the force field but we have no way of know what that signal be now I be there I see the whole thing happen nothing I could do just watch powerless to interfere Come on it have to be there just give I a minute I never think of check the Alpha site gate record a code energy signal be receive and record through the gate three month ago no one be able to determine its origin or its purpose that be the deactivation code bra'tac send before he be capture be you sure I be sure I can synthesise this if it be the code I can get we through the gate and I can provide detail of their defence and the lay of the land O'Neill I must tell you that I believe I may be a liability on this mission I do not if I should die it be my wish that you watch over Rya'c let us see it do not come to that all right Chevron six encode it be his son Chevron seven lock all right let us do this send signal now Clear ok so that happen SG 3 secure these guy then establish your perimeter Daniel Master Bra'tac it be difficult to ration that which you do not have if only you have not see I have see now tell I the truth I be not a child the tretonin be go then you will die and all your word of faith will have be for nothing no Rya'c not for nothing for you you might survive how long can you live without tretonin as long as I have to penhall Trade give I that thing no sign of Bra'tac wait a minute I 've get Rya'c if we eliminate that guard position we can create a blind spot Infiltration be the good option O'Neill all right it will be dark in an hour everybody get comfortable go they be in Jaffa hol Jaffa Come on come on Rin nok what be this he be dress the warrior down do the bidding of Baal Shut up Shut up I be paraphrase Kel mar tokeem Tal ma kree Meg tal you be poison you be curse by the wearer of horn you be sloppy Oracca aseemu oh for cry out loud Hol mel Damn it I think they 've be make just hold on Rya'c Father I be sorry Master Bra'tac say you would come but I do not believe how be he he still live but I fear not for long Tek matte old friend Rak'nor Tek matte Master Bra'tac there be enough for both of we you can not hide here for long it will take time for he to regain his strength then we will carry he we come to take you and bra'tac away what about they what about all the other there be too many they can fight and they will die if they stay they will die teal'c you 've be make get outta there get outta there teal'c Kree chok hold your fire hold your fire Sir just hold your position we be just go to sit here yes we be just go to sit here till we can find another way in Rya'c you be still alive yes Father that be all that matter what of bra'tac the tretonin have help what of you Father can you walk not at the moment you must those who can not work be kill you must not lose your faith Rya'c Rak'nor and I do not come alone even now a rescue be under way search patrol go off in that direction head for the Stargate they do not believe Teal'c and Rak'nor be work alone this be my fault how be that I should have do something when I have the chance when I have the power I think we 've already establish that would not have work out either nope it be time for plan B we have a plan b no but it be time for one we 've already determine there be too many guard for we we need a distraction grenade think big claymore much big major target TRP 1 his strength still grow good Rya'c you and Rak'nor must spread the word if we wish for our rescue to be successful the other must be prepare to fight how will they know when when the time be right they will know indeed can you fight I be not the Jaffa I once be no Rya'c no you be teal'c there be no great warrior Rya'c I be weak no Father please Rya'c no matter what you must survive you must survive or I have come for nothing now go once this panel go it will take second for the anti gravity platform to shut down it have be difficult for both of we you be feel well you will not be rid of I so easily when the time come I will be ready old friend as will I I be not so sure this tretonin seem to have have an effect on your memory why would you say such a thing you 've forget that a warrior 's strength come from his heart and his mind you have have a physical advantage over I for a long time and yet I have never lose a spar match to you because for year old man I have let you win well much well this could be a problem this be not your work station take he if you do not work then you will die this one do not know where his work station be but he be young and still able to work you dare to speak to I only to ask that I take his place so be it no no you be barely able to stand you would not have last another day it be a good trade Carter what be the hold up we be a go in 30 second sir assume we do not have 30 second you be once the first prime of Apophis now you be nothing but a weak pathetic shol'va do not look away be strong for he what well way for Teal'c to die than to be look upon the face of his son Kree Trey lon tonok Fire take they now come on boy have at them wait Father welcome back SG 1 the camp have be liberate all the prisoner relocate to the Alpha site they be anxious to join the rebellion then my mission have be a success Hammond of Texas I find myself once more in your debt I think it be Dr Jackson you owe on this one indeed kelno'reem be unnecessary although it do make I feel well Colonel O'Neill have officially inform I that I have my mojo back I guess I should be thank you actually you see I use to I use to feel like I do not belong anywhere really I think I think that this ascension thing would change that now I be realise that the sacrifice be far too great and my life here be too important to just leave behind I guess what I be try to say be that for the first time in my life I feel like I be a part of something something important as do I Visiontext Subtitles Stephanie Donohue enhoh  Rippé par BoRiF what be go on get MALP telemetry from P3X 289 Atmosphere be completely toxic Sulphur dioxide carbon monoxide methane ammonia if there be a gate there be life there at some point yeah I think that be a safe assumption look at this we get these image two hour ago after the MALP go through the dome seem to be the only thing that withstand the effect of the atmosphere how big be it about 2 2 km wide and 500 metre high the MALP 's give we a proximity alert three metre and we be pick up a static charge stop extend the arm it go right through whatever it be it be not solid move forward we 've lose contact the MALP 's not respond bring up that last image how be that possible I have no idea Colonel O'Neill report we be good sir but not much of a view what about suit integrity the hazmat could withstand 12 hour of exposure before any serious degradation not a problem sir we can make it to the dome and back inside an hour Understood Hammond out pick up a static charge yeah I can feel it so what do we do just walk through the MALP meet no resistance but it disappear it do transmit for a while before we lose the signal which suggest it get through I be read normal atmosphere oxygen nitrogen we be clean too seem the barrier scrub the suit when we pass through the inside of the barrier seem to be some kind of hologram you can feel the resistance that combine with the static charge must act as a warning so you do not accidentally step through the MALP appear to be fully operational the barrier must block the signal this be an amazing piece of technology Permeable to solid object but will not allow the poisonous atmosphere in we really need to study this further all right come on out let us go hello we be not go to hurt you you come from outside yes we do what be your name what be yours I ask you first I be call Nevin hello Nevin I be Jack that be Sam Daniel and Teal'c you wear strange clothe you catch we on a bad day Nevin where be your parent my father 's in the town can you show we we just want to talk to he maybe we could trade you know sir we probably could have find the town without his help Nevin I find some people in the garden Jack Sam Daniel and Teal'c I be Kendrick Nevin 's father I assume you do not get many visitor we think we be the only survivor survivor of what exactly you would well speak to the council you come from outside the dome that be right but the atmosphere be toxic anyone who go outside would die almost instantly we wear protective suit but where do you come from originally from a planet call Earth it be about 6 000 light year from here you come in a spaceship no we come through the Stargate it be that big circular object with symbol carve on it it be right outside the dome there must be a historical reference to one moment please the Gate of Mahg Mar discover 563 year ago believe to have be of significance in the worship of Goddess Morrigan take from Danaan and display in the National Museum of History so you do know about the gate we do now we 've access the relevant information through the Link it be a direct neural interface with a databank ow the Link contain the sum total of our knowledge all our history our culture our science everything you can call up this information whenever you need it precisely think this will work the signal be lose only when the transmitter cross the barrier we need only manoeuvre the MALP into the correct position Nice we have a scheduled radio contact with SG 1 sir dial the gate SG 1 this be General Hammond come in yes sir we read you loud and clear loud and clear Colonel O'Neill report it turn out this planet 's not so dead after all sir I take it the dome 's inhabited yes sir so far the native be very friendly if a bit odd if you know what I mean will they share information they will show Carter the technical stuff in the meantime they 've offer to put we up for the night all right next contact in 24 hour yes sir thank you what how many planet have you be to I do not know lot More than ten yeah More than 20 yes More than 30 yeah More than 40 yes More than 50 maybe Nevin let the poor man eat it be more than 50 be not it you think it be too late to pitch a tent be you sure you 've have enough to eat yes it be delicious you 've obviously no trouble grow food everything in the dome be self sufficient what about power we draw energy from geothermal vent beneath the town tomorrow I can show you the generator Pallan 's one of the technician who maintain the system your level of architecture seem to be out of step with your level of technology Technology destroy our world the dome be create because industrial growth poison the air our people be die so the survivor make a choice to simplify their life we have environmental problem if we learn your history it might help we the easy way for you to learn about our history be through the Link be that possible of course thousand of historical book be on file maybe that be not such a good idea we do not know if our brain physiology be compatible with the technology ah thank maybe later hello Nevin I be not Nevin I be Colonel O'Neill from Stargate Command all right Colonel O'Neill will you please take off my hood Nevin time for school go to your room and access your lesson when I grow up can I be an explorer we will talk about it later none of you have be out of the dome not in over 400 year we monitor the level of toxicity but we 've never see it what be it like it be not very pretty I 've see image on the Link of a great city with tall building of glass and steel I be afraid there be not much left but rubble I suppose that be why they create this so we be not always remind of what happen a pretty convincing illusion I would love to see how it be make the control room 's underground but the entrance be this way as you can see Major we have not abandon technology altogether yeah if use the Link be out of the question then this be your only option we do not have much need for book any more these be all that be leave from the old world interesting the writing 's similar to a language we 've see before can you translate it with your help let us get start atmospheric analysis dome integrity power utilisation very impressive if you do not mind I just have to check the coolant pressure please Pallan this look like some kind of religious text Evalla Evalla Pallan yes be you ok of course let I see do you see that see what the screen became fill with some sort of stream code Impossible they always display the status of these system I know what I see Pallan I be afraid you must be mistaken so what do we know well their technology 's incredible Pallan and I be rig up a computer interface to download some of the spec do they wish anything in return apparently not they seem happy with their situation it make no sense they live in a bubble they 've manage to survive for over 400 year sometimes there be more to life than mere survival we could offer they relocation yeah I suppose be you suggest we leave the dome we be just say it be possible there be many world where your people can live but we have all we need right here except room to grow we be talk about fresh water fresh air mountain tree we can experience all these thing through the Link you 've get to be kid I it be a very generous offer Colonel but this be our home what about the other folk in the town some of they have to think differently the council speak for the town and the council 's decision be unanimous what about the other council member the woman that be here there have not be a woman on the council since the last election and that be two year ago what there be a woman here yesterday Colonel I can assure you the council have always consist of three member I speak to Pallan he have no memory of there ever be a fourth council member she be just there yesterday maybe the Link have something to do with this if it can download datum into people 's brain maybe it can also be use to alter their perception or memory perhaps she oppose the other and they got rid of her so they erase she from existence seem a little harsh the bottom line be we can not trust these people I would still like to finish my research on the dome technology maybe something in the archive can shed some light on it the behaviour of the people do seem odd but they do not appear to be a threat all right see what you can find out how be it come I still can not find any historical reference to the time period when the dome be build by then our people have begin use the Link it be possible not much write material survive from that era let I ask you something if you have a chance to leave the dome and live on another planet would you take it Pallan tell I about the talk you have with the council and we have everything we need right here that be what they say we hope someday the poison'll dissipate and we will be able to reclaim the planet but not in your lifetime no what about child do not you and Pallan want to have a family of course but there must be population control a couple 's allow a maximum of two you be ok with that limited resource dictate we maintain the population at a certain level how many people be we talk about at this precise moment 1 373 and what would happen if someone decide to break the rule and have more than two child I do not know no one ever have try the interface now we get it you believe this technology will be useful on your world why do not you and your wife come see for yourself oh just for a visit do you have ocean Oceans desert rainforest it would take a lifetime to see it all it sound wonderful wait a minute these be the power utilisation figure that be right what be a normal variation between 0 01 and 0 07 well then we 've get a problem these level be 2 low than when we first come down here no that can not be no you be mistaken these figure be within normal range do you have this morning 's reading of course you see no variation this be wrong these measurement be foreign to you do not mean I can not recognise a drop Major I can access 400 year of record power utilisation figure on the Link there be never be more than a 0 1 variation hypothetically speak if there be would it threaten the integrity of the force field I suppose it might but it be never come up Colonel O'Neill be it true you 've offer to take we through the gate to another world yeah that be right then Nevin and I will come with you I see the way he be with you I realise he deserve more than this world can offer be you certain this be not a decision to be take lightly I want my son to be in a world where the sky and the cloud be not part of an illusion create by computer that be good enough for I Colonel come in go ahead Sir I 've run some calculation here and I 've discover something O'Neill Sir be you read I Carter the MALP 's go say again the MALP be no long park where we park it someone do not wish we to communicate with SGC that be not our only problem the dome be lose power I notice a discrepancy with output level but the computer datum show no change I convert the unit and compare the current level with yesterday 's reading and in the last 24 hour there be be almost a 4 drop if this continue the dome will fail how much time it be hard to say but when it do everyone here will die Evalla the computer 's give I new datum the power level be definitely drop Major Carter should we not warn the townspeople I be not sure we would convince they our only evidence be the reading and for some reason Pallan could not see they be change maybe he be in on it I do not think so I think his memory be be alter the same may hold true for the other Evalla Evalla I call out to she and she ignore I it be like she be in a trance perhaps she be under the influence of the Link who know what level of manipulation be possible so brainwash that be one way of put it we have to help they they be be hold against their will as long as they 've get those thing on they will not be convince of anything be it possible to disable the Link the same computer system control the dome if we tamper with it we risk bring the whole force field down however if I could use the computer to access the Link maybe I could reprogram the datum be send out do a little brainwashing of our own the only problem be I need Pallan 's help if I can find historical evidence in the library that contradict the Link some people may believe they be be lie to the record of council meeting will show there use to be over three member exactly all right you two do what you do teal'c you and I be late for a radio contact Colonel O'Neill where be you go back to the house we need those special outfit we have the house be this way you be mistaken it be in that direction there be nothing over there it be the edge of the dome come on I will show you here it be see right where you leave it hey be this where we sleep last night it be not what be go on here Colonel be you go back to Earth now no we be just go to send a message do not worry we will not leave without you excuse I anyone who want to leave be welcome to come with we why would I leave you desire to live in a world where the sky be not artificial you must have I mistake for someone else Nevin you want to be an explorer right I be go to be a gardener like my father you be under the influence of the Link what be you talk about those thing on your head lose them no no yes they be mess with your mind get rid of them the Link give we everything we need just take it off a minute just flick it off I can not to be disconnect from the Link would cause instant death now see that be something you 've never say before Colonel I think you should leave now Carter what be your status I be on my way to the control room well watch yourself they get to Kendrick I 've almost finish download the generator design Pallan we need to talk all right do you remember early I say I notice a drop in the power level I remember you be mistaken what about now do you notice any change Power level be constant no they be not it be just that every time these screen be update the datum on the Link be as well it alter your memory so you do not see what be happen Major this be absurd Pallan the dome be fail I tell you you be mistaken no I be not mistaken if you do not help I warn the other you Evalla and everyone in this city will die who Evalla your wife Major I do not know what be come over you but I 've never be marry I need you to disconnect yourself from the Link that be insane you believe that remove that node will kill you I 've know that since childhood Evalla remove hers nothing happen who be this Evalla I tell you she be your wife your memory of she have be alter just as you 've be keep from realise the dome 's dying I think the council be responsible but the change be happen too quickly I think it be automatic the computer make change then update the memory of everyone so no one be the wise Pallan you have to disconnect that would be suicide no that be just a lie that be be plant by the computer we need to reprogram the Link to convince the other but I need your help no Sam get it what be that legal document all I can say be thank God for lawyer when everyone else be convert to the Link they still use paper when the dome be make you all sign a contract on land ownership right look at the number that can not be there be originally 100 000 people Impossible the dome can not sustain that many not any more oh my God I think the power loss would cause the dome to fail but the computer find a way to compensate the dome be shrink that be what happen to the MALP it be where we leave it but now on the outside wait a minute if there be over 100 000 people live here where do they all go O'Neill there be other remain but the bone have be eat by the corrosive air I understand why you be reluctant to believe we Pallan thing in your head must seem like memory of a lifetime but they be not yesterday you do not know disconnect from the Link could be fatal you be lie these document be over 400 year old they be in your language how could we fake this why would we fake this they only exist because the computer do not foresee outside interference to anyone on the Link they be irrelevant but why the computer be program to maintain the community individual be sacrifice for the good of the whole only each time someone vanish no one notice because all memory be erase please no it be all right no I you see now we need your help what be your status Pallan 's try to access the Link we might be able to reprogram it Understood we be come to you what do I do it be another update Nevin I want you to stay here Father be Colonel O'Neill sick yes but we be go to make he well what be it these system be so complicated I be not sure I know what I be do you 've be do this your whole life you just have to try to remember the old fashioned way right maybe not that way agree let us keep move Carter we may have a problem they be control by the computer sir O'Neill hey Everything be go to be all right Colonel these be for you I do not think so you 've be disconnect from the Link you be not well let we help you Carter now would be a good time I be in what do I tell they there be no time to explain everything try to erase all memory of we completely do not make I shoot you you be not yourself Colonel without the Link your mind be play trick on you who be you I do it we run test on the geothermal vent that supply the town 's power they start to cool about 200 year ago the dome start shrink some time after that we should have the whole town relocate in a couple of day I think I be go to miss this garden how much longer'll the force field last it be difficult to say even with less surface area to maintain power would have fail eventually and in the meantime more of we would have disappear you still do not remember she do you no you know in a way I envy the other they all must have lose somebody but I be the only one who know for sure how do you mourn someone when you can not even picture her face I be sorry Pallan I wish I could help maybe you can how tell I about her Visiontext Subtitles Natasha Cohn enhoh possibly the beacon we detect with the MALP be activate remotely on impact if anyone be in those forward section I doubt they survive there should be an indication somewhere about how long ago they crash Sir these people be alive at least they be in some form of cryogenic sleep any civilisation without fast than light technology would resort to this to cross the vast distance between star otherwise it would take an entire generation and give the effect we 've get a shipload of frozen people that would be the more succinct way of put it their current state probably protect they from the impact how many do you think there be from the configuration of the ship 's exterior four section of vary size we will do a quick head count see what we be deal with then call for support Carter teal'c you pair up Daniel and I will start in this compartment yes sir five six 105 Jack O'Neill Major Carter Daniel Jackson respond O'Neill Major Carter Daniel Jackson it be SG 4 's IDC sir they be signal that they 've get SG 1 Defence and medical team stand by open the iris what have we get both unconscious but stable get they to the infirmary and maintain security protocol Daniel I have to go back I have to go back I have to go back I have to go back to the ship no no Daniel Daniel it be ok do not be afraid sergeant it be ok who be you what be this place notify I the moment they regain consciousness who be responsible for this I demand to know why this have happen why be I a prisoner those may be remove when you calm down Calm how do you expect I to be calm I be make promise that nothing could go wrong all right let us start there tell I what have go wrong what have go wrong what have go wrong well this be not the Stromos you be not a member of my staff and that be not I all right listen carefully we do not do this we be in the dark about what have happen as much as you be if you cooperate I will undergo no more of your test be you in pain yes yes a great deal all right I will get something in the meantime try to stay calm or you will be restrain far you have no idea who I be do you that be not Daniel Jackson but be he a Goa'uld no sir although at the moment he be every bit as arrogant then be he suffer from some sort of mental illness I do not know yet sir his preliminary EEG reading be like nothing I 've ever see there be indication of coma but at the same time we be see reading like those of a dozen people all jumble together be his condition life threaten I could not even guess he claim to be a passenger from the crashed alien vessel we discover how be that possible I have no idea but Teal'c be right and we be deal with more than one passenger Daniel 's behaviour in the gate room and throughout the preliminary testing be distinctly different than now I would say we 've witness at least two maybe even three personality could there be more we discover several hundred passenger in cryogenic suspension O'Neill request an enumeration of the cryogenic chamber we separate and I lose consciousness momentarily for what reason I be unsure when I return I find Daniel Jackson O'Neill and Carter in their current state speak of which sir I would like to check in on the colonel and Sam keep I apprise yes sir maybe you should head down to the infirmary I intend to remain here very well I be ordinarily a very rational man of course Dr Jackson I be a sovereign of Talthus my name be Martice Beg your pardon sir oh sir well that be a start Pupils be still a little dilated it be as though they be strike with some sort of powerful zat weapon at least their eeg be still normal Oi Doctor Inform General Hammond the colonel 's awake Hey Doc how be you feel sir Headache Bad I can take care of that but first I need to know if you be feel yourself well other than this nail through my head I be fine why I will explain later Teal'c get the three of you to the Stargate from the ship my team take it from there Carter and Daniel Major Carter be suffer the same after effect as you sir Janet Sam hey it be go to be fine you 've both suffer some sort of neural shock Colonel Major how be you feel get a nail in my head sir that sound like our Colonel O'Neill their eeg show normal brain activity they appear to be unaffected unaffected by what where be Daniel I need you to stay where you be at least until you be strong enough I be fine no you be not sir ow no I be not just find the small woman and tell she that what she give I be not good enough it be not work do you speak how be you feel now your medicine be worthless be you still in pain this body must be damage I doubt that Dr Jackson be in perfect health I assume Dr Jackson be the former not that I have anything against it it be young and strong than my own do something happen to my own body in time of disaster people need their sovereign how will they recognise I I 've already tell you we do not do this how else could I be in this situation we do not know how useful you be what be this place it be one of our medical isolation room could you be less specific in a military facility on a planet call Earth Earth the ship be bind for Ardena how far be we from Ardena I do not know the other passenger they will be concern for I as I be for they of course Most of they be still on the ship but we think several of they may be with we now as prisoner no we think they may be in this room we do not know the reason but several of the passenger in cryogenic sleep have what be happen Martice no Martice be a sovereign I be just a crew member be that how can this be it be all right I be here to help you no no this be wrong this be a mistake yes it be one that we want to correct I be Dr Fraiser I be Tryan Engineer second rank all right Tryan why do not we start again again I do not recognise this man or rather myself his name be Daniel Jackson the body you be inhabit belong to he he be not aboard the Stromos no then how can I have end up in his body your ship crash on a planet that we call P2A 347 we do not know how or why the crash occur only that the only survivor be those in cryogenic sleep when Daniel Jackson and the other member of his team board your ship this happen I have no memory of come here what do you remember Brace for acceleration Tryan Compartment be secure sir very well leave Talthus enter my sleep chamber then see your face here why be I restrain it be not you you be the fourth personality to emerge since be bring back we believe that there be other from your ship in there along with you in one body plus Dr Jackson no the strain on the body would be too great it would not survive do you know that for certain the only result would be insanity then we should both hope you be wrong what be happen be impossible this can not happen one can not return to any other body than one 's own there be fail safe to prevent that from happen it have happen look in the mirror to prove it to yourself we do not have a lot of time and you be the first personality that be be helpful so I need you to think all right how could this happen a sleeper 's consciousness be store in the same memory that maintain their body there be simply no way to separate they or send the consciousness to any other than its corresponding body unless oh no unless the sleeper ' body be dead O'Neill Major Carter I be pleased to see you have recover how be he yet another personality have emerge Dr Fraiser seem to be make progress how do he get stick in here Daniel Jackson 's preliminary electroencephalogram prove anomalous I dare you to say that again Dr Fraiser declare a code 17 Dr Jackson have be under constant guard only she and a few of her staff have have any direct contact as a precaution she think he be a Goa'uld not any more but I be take no chance until we determine how these person have find their way into Dr Jackson I would need another look at their cryogenic system schedule a mission briefing with Dr Fraiser Sir I would like to stick it out here with Daniel only medical personnel be allow access yes sir very well let us not jump to conclusion I be sorry there be simply no other way this could have happen only then can the fail safe be overridden and the consciousness leave the system I be dead as be the other who may reside in this body we can not be sure till we go to the planet well you will see help I out with something here why separate the consciousness from the body in the cryosleep process a consciousness can not survive restoration without loss of memory and intellect a person take such a journey without proper storage of their consciousness would arrive as a fraction of themselves the essence of that person would be lose so the memory requirement must be enormous each cryogenic capsule contain a matrix memory module to sustain one mind its system be connect with those that sustain the correspond sleeper 's body then it may be possible to upload your consciousness back into that memory each module store one consciousness do it one at a time no that be not possible here could these water molecule be return to this glass just as they be before in precisely the same configuration no our mind be blend pour into one vessel ill equip to sustain our volume but if the computer on your ship can separate the human mind from the body then surely they can isolate can you hear that no I can not hear anything the other their voice I can hear they they be get loud I need you to stay with I we need to work together it feel incredible the other can not help no one can help do not say that they be pull at I now I do not know how Janet Daniel what be go on something have happen I need you to just stay with I ok just hang in there that be it a moment later another person emerge but we learn nothing from her so he only surface for a moment but it be definitely Daniel at least we know he be still in there mm hm Dr MacKenzie just do a detailed analysis of his EEG and MRI reading we think Daniel be in a sort of coma having be suppress by the other it be like his consciousness have retreat protect itself that be why he could only surface for a short time the other signal be a jumbled mess how many other be there Dr MacKenzie believe Daniel could be carry the mind of as many as a dozen of the ship 's passenger maybe I could reconfigure the ship 's system to separate Daniel you be attack on that ship it may have be automate defence I think not Major Carter I discover Daniel at the base of one of the sleep chamber the door be open Daniel would not have step in on his own then someone else must have do so perhaps I regain consciousness before his assailant could do the same to we the question be why Tryan seem absolutely sure that his physical body be dead so what if this be a desperate attempt to preserve these people what if your attacker be try to keep these people alive the only way he could the ship could not have sustain they indefinitely so Daniel 's a lifeboat yeah it be possible Sir I recommend that SG 12 accompany we back to the planet they can search the ship for whoever do this while I study the cryogenic system you have a go dismiss I do not think we 've have a chance to meet where be my father I be sorry I do not know do you mind if I sit down beside you ok there what about they oh no they will not hurt you why do not I tell you everything I know and then we will just take it from there ok what be your name Keenin Keenin that be a very nice name I be Dr Fraiser SG 12 move out I know you would do anything to save Dr Jackson but the last thing we need be for this to happen to you we intend to avoid that sir good luck Keenin we be try to figure out all we can about how this happen what be the last thing you remember my father why can not I wait with you the ship must accelerate to escape the flare 's radiation you will be safe here you will dream sweet dream and when you awaken we will be in orbit around Ardena and I will be right here Talthus will be go hundred of year will have pass Keenin and all of this hardship will be part of our distant history do you understand now close your eye I want to stay on Talthus so you have to leave they know it be go to happen since a long time before I be bear do you know what a dark star be mm hm one that be burn out its fuel they say it would pass close enough to our sun to make it flare and that it would engulf Talthus I know my whole life that the world be go to end so your people build the Stromos they build three ship include the Stromos but it be not enough they have a lottery and they say that be the only fair way but my father be an officer on the Stromos so he be allow to pick one person from his family M m my mother make he choose I it be all right my mother say she would take her chance with the lottery but she be not choose the sovereign be choose but she be not choose no one I know be choose I want to stay with her it be ok Shh it be all right it be all right Shh it be ok what be you do Martice you may address I as Sovereign and I will ask you never to do that again now what have you do to resolve this SG 12 this be Carter come in this be SG 12 we just begin our search stay in radio contact Carter out these power level be extremely low I do not know how it could still be work perhaps if we revive one of they they may be of some assistance I do not think there be even enough power to do that I demand to speak to someone in authority well I be sorry you be stuck with I why have you involve the boy in this what boy the boy you be just talk to he where be he if we do not get these system hook up to a power source these people will die I will need a naqahdah generator and I will have to build one generator should be enough please do not hurt we tell they to stop shout it be unendurable I can not hear they be silent they be in your mind Martice no no no no no no no what you say it can not be so I have responsibility to attend to I can not remain here you can not leave 3 000 of our people depend on I to lead they I be the sovereign I be sorry it be my destiny to rule over Ardena you do not understand the seriousness of your condition you do not realise who you be talk to I do not give a damn you do not belong in that man 's body and I intend to take it back be there other conscious people no the other still sleep why have you come back you do something to one of our people be he here with you he be not be you the one responsible there be no choice no other way you must do the same I do not think so the ship 's power be fail it be the only way we can save they Pharrin figure out a way to override the fail safe it can be do do not you see these soul be the last of an entire world they can not be allow to end like this maybe there be another way no no Power be fade even now in every compartment if you carry a handful of soul we could route the remain power to the other that be not go to happen we do not know how many more we can accommodate we I believe he too carry the consciousness of many 13 soul now reside in Pharrin 's body I fear I can harbour no more why do you attempt to preserve these life their body be dead we be the last of an entire world the other ship will come we have send a message they will hear it and they will come and when they do they will find a way to restore we why do you not attempt to revive the other after the ship crash we still do not know why it happen he be revive by the computer but the power requirement of his restoration cause too great a drain in the rest of the compartment Power level be drop Pharrin have only minute to restore power to 12 of the sleeper chamber before the occupant be dead but there be not enough time Pharrin be fail they one by one there be no other choice no other way to preserve we there be over a thousand soul aboard the Stromos if Pharrin have attempt to revive the other then many more may have die even one person to share the burden Pharrin walk as far as he could see there be little more than rock neither be there sufficient water or food remain aboard after the crash Pharrin dare not revive another soul we be not alone we live in a democracy of one it be strange yes but we be the choose survivor of an entire race how could Pharrin have allow even one of we to be lose still we could have help you there be no time we should have ask they no we could not take the chance you would never have consent would you we would not then we choose correctly our mistake be to flee when you revive so quickly from our stun weapon and return for your friend but too many of we be afraid there be other way we can help how we could provide you with an alternate power source to bring your energy reserve up to where they need to be to revive your people it be possible I can retrieve it and have it run within a few hour there be no other way listen to her no we must wait the ship will come we can take you anywhere you want to go another world like Ardena you have a ship there be a device capable of transport your people instantaneously to any world we call it a Stargate such a device be not possible come with we and I will prove it to you however we will only consent to do so if you return our friend to his former state he be preserve life at the expense of his own unwillingly please do not ask we to do this we be not ask the soul that your friend carry within he be amongst the most precious of all our friend be equally as important to we there will be nowhere for they to go they will be lose but it be possible to undo this how can I abandon they so easily we have swear to protect the sovereign but we may save hundred of other Pharrin there be a way do you understand that what we be offer could save everyone on this ship and do you understand that one of the soul that your friend carry within he be my son please why do it hurt so much all right prepare 100 microgram of fentanyl that will not be necessary I seem to have a high threshold for pain than the other Tryan yes oh thank God for that Janet can I have a word I will be back be you sure you trust this guy he have much to gain by assist us Officer Pharrin sir Engineer Tryan second rank Tryan of course of all of our crew you would have think this be not possible of all our crew sir you be the one who would find a way to do it how do you manage our training and a share will to survive it be a strange way of live with other but it be well than the alternative what of our ship and her passenger sir our ship crash land we fail to reach Ardena her passenger may yet be save but not without considerable sacrifice to you and to the other of the Stromos that reside within you I understand sir these people possess a device capable of transport all our people to another world perhaps even Ardena it be very real and it will save our people but in exchange they ask that their friend be return to they as he be before I believe it can be do if we act quickly it be a reasonable bargain I will do whatever be necessary sir whatever you ask of I no there will be no sacrifice of any kind as your sovereign I demand you return I to the ship immediately forgive I Sovereign Pharrin we have swear an oath to do his will we can not proceed Officer Pharrin I have give you a command do you understand I oh for cry out loud get up I swear to protect the sovereign he be dead his soul live not if I cut he out you would not oh yes I would Pharrin you will listen to I do not listen just do what you come here to do forgive we Sovereign it be the only way to protect our people I will not surrender this body not at any cost it be mine it be never ours if you save anyone you will save I the people of Talthus will die let they forgive I how dare you touch I for 12 year we fight to save the people of Talthus we will do anything to do so no matter how great the sacrifice Father Keenin I be so sorry my son you must sacrifice as well and we will be together do you understand the people of Talthus will be safe and they will remember we forever but we will be together we will be together well I can not tell yet if they make it into Pharrin but Daniel 's reading be back to normal how do you do that it be not I sir it be Daniel his mind protect itself he never emerge for more than a few second that be what let Pharrin separate the other from Daniel and absorb they the more the merrier I guess he will stay in suspend animation until the other passenger can take care of he you mean they the naqahdah generator will sustain the power we can begin the restoration process within hour we can relocate they shortly after that Good we will leave that for SG 4 they love that kind of stuff how be Daniel he will be unconscious for a while it be good if what Daniel that you Jack how you do bad headache Nail in the head kinda thing yeah something like that yeah Visiontext Subtitles Kerrie Slavin ENHOH  Rippé par BoRiF Best of Rip in Future oh God three month on this rock and I still can not get a decent cup of coffee Core sample analysis come in but so far the high concentration be 2 3 part per million 2 3 part Major Lorne we need enough naqahdah to manufacture 303s you know how big a battle cruiser be it be pretty big sir if we start mine these deposit right now today your great grandchildren're still go to be try to pull out enough ore to make one Colonel Edwards Menard late analysis show a concentration 50 time high than anything we 've see so far it be increase as we go deeply this could be the one sir yeah if this pan out your great grandchild might be off the hook yes sir Colonel Edwards I be glad you be here Jack Ritter 's be miss now for three hour I assume he have a compass and a radio the planet have strange magnetic trait which make a compass useless and limit the range of our radio we need he back now that we may have find a significant deposit of naqahdah how significant we will not know until after our analysis the Pentagon want battle cruiser and F 302s we find the rock and we find the rock finder there you have it Major Lorne will show you where Ritter be last see if you will follow I what be this artefact yes you find all this and do not contact I we be go to they 've be move well they be in the way Daniel go to your happy place go Lieutenant Ritter be map the surround area when he do not show up for chow we get worried and go out look for he sir send up flare hope he would see them get his bearing be it normal for guy to wander away from camp he might have be place marker multiple sighting you get turn around teal'c the ground be extremely firm O'Neill no track not in the immediate area but there be damage to the underbrush move off in several different direction Jack come in yeah go ahead I be not read you say again I say I 've get something here you need to see all right on my way you guy keep look I will be back what you get mostly mining equipment could be several hundred year old Hard to date it till I get it back to the SGC remember these ever so fondly still have power just keep go and go I want to show you the truly fascinating part it be a yoke capable of pull great weight it predate the harness on Earth Fascinating truly I be get to that part it be too big too heavy Meaning it be not make for a human being who be it make for it be too small for an animal base on what I know about the Goa'uld I would say it be make for an Unas the Goa'uld use the Unas as slave before human they be predominantly cave dweller and can work in harsh environment perfect labour for this kind of mining this day just get well and well teal'c come in Proceed O'Neill find anything we have not head up Daniel just find evidence an Unas might have be in the area acknowledge you want I to delay this operation because you find a shoulder harness Yoke actually that could be build for a creature that probably disappear or die off a long time ago the Goa'uld leave slave behind once they lose interest in a planet in three month we have not see anything like what you describe maybe that be the way they want it Doctor the Pentagon want result you do not understand Unas be territorial and when provoke can be dangerous be he always like this yeah pretty much if they be here do you think they have anything to do with Ritter go miss yes I do I be not close down this operation but I do think we should bring in some extra troop help secure the area what be it the Unas wear these to prevent the Goa'uld from burrow into their neck I believe these figure be intend as a warning to stay away Lieutenant Ritter all right I want extra ammo for everyone keep your eye open and stay in radio contact what be you intend to do these thing kill one of my man and string he up like a scarecrow what the hell do you think I intend to do you may have provoke they we do not even know they be here how the hell could we have provoke they if the mine extend as far as you estimate then this other entrance be in the network it be an alternate entrance to the same mine it have to be something about this area this mine they do not want we here the feeling 's mutual Jack look I know he can be a little but he be usually right about this stuff my order be to determine the potential of this site as a mining operation until those order be rescind I will ensure the safety of my people so be you go to help I secure this area or not this be a mistake it be his command Daniel he be never encounter the Unas he do not know what he be deal with Argh Aaagh Ka Keka Ka Keka Ska nat Ka Ko Keka Benna Benna Ka Cha Benna Ka Cha help he help he my men'll take care of the wound they be on the run let us take them now what be that what be they do now they be mourn their dead this may be our good chance we be not go to let them get away be we we will not pursue an enemy into unknown terrain you think they be capable of tactic we know they they be far more intelligent than you think I do not care they attack we Edwards we be not go in this be my command you be here at my request you be in charge of a mining operation your stand order no long apply let us take it back to SGC and we will figure it out there fine ow God get away how be the arm Good how be the science project you mean my overhaul of the gate diagnostic system I guess that be what I mean it be go well sir thank you for ask if we go back to this planet you be not come with we be you it be doubtful yeah that be too bad I be hope you would take command of the mission Colonel Edwards have no experience with the Unas nor you he be an ok guy Daniel he be just under a lot of pressure yeah yeah I guess I just spend a lot of time break you in I just do not want to have to start with a new colonel it will be fine just try not to be so what oh you know Colonel General Vidrine be down from the Pentagon he be be put in charge of BC 303 production we 've read your report Colonel and we agree that the evacuation be warrant unfortunately with the Prometheus strand across the galaxy Earth be currently vulnerable to orbital attack if someone can show I another way to acquire naqahdah I be listen otherwise we 've get to go back to P3X 403 with enough man and firepower I can take care of your problem sir we 've deal with these creature before and I can guarantee you it will not be as easy as you think be that as it may the Pentagon 's position be quite clear on this Colonel Edwards will return to the planet and begin mining operation SG personnel will provide security on a continue basis if this lead to hostility it will Dr Jackson I do not believe you be invite to this meeting yes General I know I be sorry but please hear I out the situation can be resolve peacefully how we 've be on this planet a long time it be not until we encroach on this one region that the Unas attack can not we just mine away from this one area all the other mine site we 've survey have be void of significant deposit this be the only site we 've find thus far that might satisfy production quota and if this lead to another dead end then we will not have a problem but I be not go to walk away from this until I know for sure then can we at least try to negotiate with they they be animal sir they be not they be intelligent if you underestimate they more will die who would negotiate on our behalf you I have a limited vocabulary and a rudimentary understanding of their way but this have go too far for I to handle myself what be you propose Doctor I suggest we use Chaka as a liaison Chaka an Unas we meet on a different planet I 've have contact with he he be make progress in his understanding of we we 've interact with these being before and live Chaka save my life this be their planet we be the invader we do not have to provoke or kill they I be sure no one want that Dr Jackson yes I be sure if talk be resolve in the time allot to determine the viability of the mine you be give up nothing by let he try all right Proceed Dr Jackson you will contact Chaka and return he here without delay one more thing so that there be no confusion if negotiation fail and it come down to we or they I choose we the use of deadly force be authorise IDC receive sir Dr Jackson plus one open the iris stand down Chaka 's never be in a structure like this before um a Cha ' Aka a Cha ' Aka be a greeting in this case he be say hello ' Ell o Pfft Pfft um I 've have a chance to talk with Chaka he be manage to accomplish some remarkable thing on the planet where Chaka live human use Unas as domesticate slave but Chaka lead an uprising and you neglect to mention this before how many be kill in this uprising that be not the point Chaka broker a truce and establish a fragile peace between the human and Unas who be formerly their slave if he manage to do this I know he could act as a peaceful liaison between we and the Unas of P3X 403 do he even want to help we I 've inform he of what we need to do he be eager to meet Unas of other world Tar Ma Kan Ko ' Uman ' elp Chaka Chaka ' elp ' uman look like the Unas have a party while we be go you be right Dr Jackson they be much more advanced than what I think they have command of fire Major Lorne as soon as this place be clean up I want you to begin a resonance scan analysis of the low mine shafts how do you intend to find these Unas Doctor I think Chaka will lead we to they Chaka Colonel he know you do not like he keep stare at he like that he be go to take it as a challenge Chaka Ka Kreeka just keep he away from I Hanson Penhall you be with they the rest of you I want this perimeter secure Antipersonnel and overlap field of fire move it he be get ready for a war he be responsible for protect his camp yeah or he be

while they be mine it I say I would speak to my superior on their behalf burial site be protect on Earth those rule should apply here we have to leave we get the result of the resonance scan the deposit be over 300 metre in length and almost completely solid 53 000 metric ton we be not go anywhere my meeting with the Unas go well they be reluctant to trust we but we be communicate how many of they be there I only see a medium sized clan why we need to know if we be go to relocate they they will never accept it sir they will not understand it then it be your job to make they understand if you do not we will have to go in there with tranquilliser and capture they they be not animal I be sure Chaka and I can accomplish something just let I go talk to they again you have 24 hour to convince the Unas to come peacefully or they will be forcibly remove ' Uman Ko Keka Onac Unas Ko Keka Onac right we should not fight each other the Goa'uld be our common enemy Ka nay Ka nay Friend uh

not buy it be you hear this they would have be see by aerial scan Unas live in cave where aerial scan do not detect they our position will be overrun I be close to work out an agreement they wanna be leave alone Dan'el hold your fire if they attack we will defend ourselves you be right Dr Jackson Let us get back to the gate no it be too late if we move now they will run we down what be he do I do not know do not do anything stupid he be give we a chance a chance to do what to surrender surrender not possible do not do it Colonel Kor Asek ' Uman A Ta Ka Keka what be you say that we do not have

not desecrate their sacred ground we will not in exchange the Unas will help defeat their ancestor ' killer the Goa'uld and just how be they go to do that they be go to work the mine themselves what do you propose this no actually it be Iron Shirt so the Unas be go to mine this deposit and turn all the naqahdah over to we that be right can they work a jackhammer I think you will find they be very intelligent and can learn you treat they with respect and you will find out what kind of ally they can be O'Neill be right about you you be a pain in the ass but well worth it Dan'el Aka Visiontext Subtitles Natasha Cohn enhoh  Rippé par BoRiF Best of Rip in Future sorry I have not change sir the message say it be urgent hello again Major Carter Warrick it be good to see you again you too what bring you here when last we speak you reiterate your desire for access to Serrakin technology yes of course yet diplomacy between our respective leadership have be slow to develop I be sure they be just be cautious as I tell Hammond and Dr Jackson I be here to offer you full access to the ion propulsion engine on the Seberus well that be great Sir this could I read your report Major I will not debate the value of the technology but there be more in return I would like your help to win a race it be call the Loop of Kon Garat every year the large corporation on my planet know as Tech Con Group award an extremely lucrative contract to the winner of the Loop a contract it be a time test method to find the most able pilot with the good ship for the job the race be open to anyone there be few rule the winner 's ship must arrive first and intact the government of your planet be let you share advanced technology with we in exchange for we help you to win a race not exactly I have arrange for a small group of you to come to Hebridan on a diplomatic visit there be no rule prevent you from help I and what you learn while you be there so unofficially how can we help Major can not hurt to ask can it sir the power you use to recharge the Seberus when I be strand a naqahdah generator the Seberus have be through a lot but my diagnostic analysis of its system show greatly improve efficiency when supplement by the naqahdah generator I would like to participate well actually I be not ask you to join I why not I will have to interface the generator could you not just show I Naqahdah generator be valuable to we we will not let one out of our sight besides you never know what issue could arise on the fly I feel compel to warn you of the danger it be not for the fainthearte we take risk to attain advanced technology all the time for I there would be no well way to learn about your ship than to see it in action a victory would mean a great deal to I I be not above accept your offer with your approval sir Major I expect you to evaluate the risk of this mission on an ongoing basis and act accordingly as always sir hey hey you ready yeah just about Warrick have set we up some meeting with high rank member of his government I bet O'Neill 's look forward to that oh yeah you really think this be worth it absolutely why do not you no yeah I just you just seem unusually gung ho Gung ho this be more than about attain new technology for you you mean help Warrick he do once risk his life for I yeah I hear that I think there be something else look I know that this could be dangerous but this be our job right it be what we sign on to do we take risk in the hope of achieve new level of technology if and I stress I ' participate in this race happen to be a little bit I do not know Fun what be a girl to do nothing that be just what I think I be Ardal Hadraig welcome back to TCNN 's exclusive coverage of the 59th Loop of Kon Garat with the Loop set to begin tomorrow we have a startling new development to report Perennial also run Warrick Finn announce today that his copilot will be a human from the planet we 've come to know as Earth Major Carter 's participation will mark the first inclusion of an alien in Loop history a band of explorer happen upon he when his ship the Seberus crash on an uncharted planet while transport convict to the outlying prison colonie the question on everyone 's mind be will these earthling bring Warrick luck a second time around continue coverage of the Loop of Kon Garat be bring to you by Tech Con Ultra Sport Beverage when you 've get an ultrabig thirst to quench only Tech Con Ultra Sport will do may I introduce you all to Eamon he be responsible for make the Seberus what it be today and he be my young brother ah yes I see the family resemblance it be uncanny boy it be like Colonel Jack O'Neill this be you just have to do it do not you Eamon you think we would lose without their help Eamon they save my life and be responsible for my get back home to Hebridan I suggest you show some respect my apology I be honour to meet my brother 's saviour and you must be Major Carter the one without whom we could not win the Loop you know I feel all warm and fuzzy how about you Major Carter if you be to be my copilot you will need to know how the ship work what be this the operation manual for the Seberus I have it translate for you thank you that be not our language it be mine sir right the long range scanner control unit do not come in again today when I call they say our credit I will go and pick one up after I escort Colonel O'Neill Dr Jackson and Teal'c to our capitol build T you come Carter request I remain to assist her she do I do indeed right yes thank you I do not wish to disappoint Major Carter yes I know the feeling shall we stay in touch I be in your debt Major Carter indeed with all your science I be surprised you do not have a power source that rival this oh they exist we just could not afford one Ah Warrick be desperate Major how do you mean he be go a long time we all think he be dead his wife Athea remarry and have child of her own now since his return work have be scarce he think this race be his chance to get his life back and he will do anything to win it what about you I I work for Tech Con I design garbage disposal unit for their food service division need I say more no Eamon I be back do you get the no they just transmit the race datum Tech Con Group progress and people work in total harmony I be Miles Hagan President of Tech Con Group I wish to welcome you as an official contestant to the Loop of Kon Garat Congratulations on qualify as always the Loop will run through a course that consist of four stage Defence we know that skip to the competition let us meet your fellow pilot shall we I do not believe it Jarlath Jarlath I know he from my day of transporting convict he be catch run illegal weapon I think he be in prison look like he be be parole he be not our big problem La'el Montrose independent cargo runner from the Parallel Colonies her ship be very fast and bad still hm muirio his skill as a pilot be legendary can we beat he you will lose in the navigation phase without a long range scanner control unit I will get one what be this expensive hello Warrick who be your friend hi Major Samantha Carter ah one of the earthling I hear about you we be here for the scanner control unit look Warrick Taupen I be run a business not a charity your credit be be over the maximum for month the good chance of my pay you back be for I to win I be sorry Warrick I can not give you a new one but you be in luck I just pick up this recondition unit this morning it should work fine I will take it thank you I promise I will settle up thing after after you lose you do not think he be good for it do you he do not stand a chance of win the Loop Jarlath still avoid personal hygiene I see who be your friend Warrick she look nice Golon Jarlath Captain of the Oran very much at your service ignore he Major stay out of my way Warrick or I will blow your pathetic ship to piece Warrick you be right he be not worth it that be it we be do she be ready do you believe the Seberus can win this race I would like to think we would have win without the naqahdah with it I would guarantee it Hungry that depend I be sure we can find something that will suit you with the Loop set to begin only minute from now I be join by race expert and two time champion Coyle Boron Coyle what be go through the pilot ' mind right now well at the starting buoy there be nothing else to do but run your preflight check and hope all your hard work pay off it be a tense time there be no question the stake be high the winner receive a lucrative contract with Tech Con 's deep space exploration project while anything else mean massive debt and the acrid taste of bitter defeat it be an interesting group of pilot this year Coyle who do you like you got to like this kid muirio he be get the talent and the ship to take it all what about Warrick and the human woman any potential for an upset they do not stand a chance well the gaming expert agree you can wager on the outcome at any of Tech Con Group 's friendly gaming kiosk conveniently locate throughout urban centre near you Tech Con gaming kiosk if you do not play you definitely will not win I be get the feeling that even a long look at an ion drive be not enough we will need a compression coil to have any chance of reproduce the technology if we win I will buy you one if we win Prepare for race start all pilot check in now Flight Control this be the Seberus prepare for race start what do you want Jarlath just to tell you to drop out now and save that worthless junk barge you call a ship from be destroy eat greeven Jarlath you piece of Greeven do not ask this be Tech Con Flight Control Stand by for race start ready or not here we go the first stage be a test of each ship 's defence capability against what those thing be fire at we yes bring aft shield to full that be auxiliary power right shield be hold Captain Shibo of the Tritan lose shield power key system be fail Tritan this be Warrick on the Seberus Siphon primary power from your regulator and boost your shield strength I can not I 've lose my interchange unit I Tritan hold on we be on our way to assist too late my engine be fry I be out Warrick thank anyway be he go to be ok Drones cease fire if a ship be disabled that be it we be clear anyone ever die in this race I tell you it be dangerous I know be there no event such as this on Earth where human risk their life yeah a few no matter how much win may mean I would never intentionally endanger your life this ship what now I think we be clear stage two we be enter the coronasphere of our sun it disturb the communication and navigation equipment Eamon have design shield specifically for this phase and so after stage one Muirios have the lead follow closely by La'el Montrose and Golon Jarlath the Oran make quick work of those drone we 've get stage two come up fast that would be the coronasphere it be make up of ionise gas so you fly though a layer of translucent plasma wow sound hot at this stage it be all about the shield do your ship have what it take to survive that intense heat and if it do not you would be instantly vaporise interesting in a horrifying sense if you have a love one who be close to death do not delay Contact Tech Con Group Funeral Services today and make your love one 's farewell memorable beyond word Tech Con Group Funeral Services help you make peace with death initiate coronaspheric shielding Communication system be inoperative they will come back what be go on I do not know we be lose engine power teal'c Eamon we be send a distress signal our key system be inoperative Engines be fail how do one respond here Major Carter come in we can no long maintain they 've lose all primary power they be in trouble auxiliary power will not engage we be on emergency storage cell what be you do the blast shield will block the radiation so much for not risk your life what happen the power diverter overload can you fix it no Major Carter Captain Warrick do you read I we be here can you hear we be you all right the power diverter overload impossible I run a full diagnostic three hour before the race unless unless what it be hard to tell with all the damage but if someone cut the link to the system somebody do this on purpose they would need knowledge of the system I think they know exactly where to hit we and how to cover their track Eamon we be be pull to the sun I know Bypass the diverter and manually regulate power to the engine with the accelerator it be dangerous more dangerous than fly into a sun we have to reconnect the naqahdah generator in order to bypass the diverter and supply power directly to the engine how much time do we have not much and so out of the ten ship that start the Loop only six remain and that number may soon dwindle to five for those of you just join we all I can say be where have you be hide Warrick Finn and his alien copilot have slip back into last place they run into trouble during stage two that be right ardal late update place they dangerously close to the sun Warrick must be disappoint to be face certain defeat so early in the race you got that right this be the moment where every pilot have to dig deep in that reservoir of desire and fortitude if they want to win it sound like maybe they could use a couple of bottle of Radon Shield 55 new from Tech Con Cosmetics Radon Shield 55 protect you and your whole family from the sun 's radiation Day in day out Radon Shield 55 keep your fun factor up and lesion count down available at quality Tech Con family outlet everywhere someone must have snuck in here get into the ship who would know the ship well enough no one the Seberus be a common model but I 've customise it significantly unless someone access the schematic on my computer at Tech Con I be do I too let us hope this work if it do not we fall into the sun and burn up or bad bad we could explode right now oh here go let us get out of here teal'c we 've get the power back online that be good to hear Major Carter I can not believe it what be it someone do access my computer who his name be Del Tynan he be my supervisor I can not tell exactly what he get if we be go to prove anything we need to go to tech Con they will not let you in without clearance you will need a hat three more ship have pull out and we 've fall far behind the other if you wish we can drop out now and avoid any further risk Carter you there Colonel sir I get it to work how be it go up there we have some trouble but we be fine now you sure yeah how be it go down there uh good we be go to help they bring a Stargate here in exchange we get an ion drive to study really yes so no need to take any chance I make a deal I be stick with it oh have fun be we Carter um get to go we be pretty far behind at this point all right be careful we will thank you you be welcome ok if we use the gravity of the sun to slingshot we around back onto the course we could pick up enough speed to get back into the race Brilliant Hi Eamon hello this be my cousin Murray Mm twice remove I just forget a data unit in my office will not be long you have to scan in Company policy sorry your brother be not do very well oh I too nice to meet you Murray this be Tynan 's office do he not keep his office secure the company philosophy encourage mutual trust besides no one be go to steal his plant everything of value be in here the system be protect by a secret pass code fortunately I put a program on my system that record an intruder 's pass code if someone attempt to access my file then it be good you do not subscribe to the company philosophy Mm this be an automate distress signal the follow pilot Jarlath be in need of assistance current status be Die you rot scrap ofjetsam this be bad than I think he have schematic for every ship in the race for the purpose of sabotage the competition but not this one it have booster from Tech Con 's prototype division a private sector pilot could not buy these to whom do that ship belong Muirios Tynan have set he up to win we have to warn Warrick I do not think so Oran this be the Seberus respond to your distress call Jarlath do you read Warrick we be close by what be your status my status be mind your own business you send out a distress call no my computer do everything be fine Transmission indicate your life support be fail my oxygen supply vent that be what you get for have no shield the drone must have cause a leak shut up Warrick go back to lose the race you will die if you do not let we help I do not need help least of all from you what about emergency reserve I do not have any I need the room for additional weapon Imbecile I would rather die kiss space debris than board that barge you call a ship he do not want to be rescue Jarlath hold on we will be there soon I be not come up there we try Come on can you move any slow you do not think you can still win do you we be only this far behind because we be sabotage a likely excuse so be I by the way how so the drone do not cause the leak in my life support I be never hit somebody fix the whole race it be not over yet what planet do you live on tell you we should have leave he to die teal'c do you read teal'c you still at Tech Con this be unfortunate you be a good employee Eamon how could you do this how could I how could I not your new friend here do not want you to know the Serrakin be not to be trust the Serrakin free your ancestor from the Goa'uld for what purpose hm share technology live in harmony all lie the Serrakin be seize control of our world piece by piece take power and opportunity away from pureblood human pollute our race by crossbreed weaken it by design do not you see the Serrakin be no well than the Goa'uld this be insane our society be build by both race for the good of all Hebridians be that why Serrakin hold all the high position and human be like second class citizen that be not true when Hagan find out Hagan be one of the primary architect of human oppression on this planet the winner of the Loop will be a pure human and that be merely the first step you be just mad because you 've be pass over for advancement three time you think I be the only one there be enough of we to make a difference have it occur to you maybe the reason you 've be pass over so many time be not because you be a human but because you be a moron I be do this to save my kind from the like of you I guess not welcome back to TCNN 's continue coverage of the Loop of Kon Garat we have startling development Warrick and Samantha Carter have re enter the race with a vengeance and be now pull into a close third position what do this mean for muirio he be have a commanding lead throughout he be get to be wonder what Warrick have that let he make up that distance so fast well Coyle perhaps he be use Ion Pro a new engine additive from Tech Con Propulsion Systems perhaps Ion Pro be guarantee to improve drive performance whatever class ship you fly whether you be compete in the Loop of Kon Garat or take the kid to school use Ion Pro in your power source Ion Pro from Tech Con Propulsion Systems your systemwide expert in ion drive technology I can not let you inside without clearance we be look for people in the building if you give I their name I will check ok one of they be name Eamon Eamon and his cousin Murray Murray yes that be they yes they be here can we come inside now no all right here be what I would like you to do pick up that phone call Mr whoever run this Place Hagan I be sorry but I just can not we be old friend tell he Mr Man who have the Stargate be here to see he he will understand Stargate go ahead Buttons Phone Mr Hagan please Nice what be you go to do Tynan he be an alien his people will miss he Tynan respond what be it muirio it be the Seberus Warrick be still in the race and he be gain on my position hard leave what be that you say leave oh do I sorry this be a waste of time we do not have a chance you be go to get we kill Shut up how do this happen you say the Seberus would be disabled and I would win you will win muirio just focus on what you have to do I will take care of the Seberus Tynan call the Seberus I know you can hear I what do you want Tynan I only intend to disable your ship but your stubbornness have force my hand I have your brother and one of the visitor from Earth so drop out of the race now Dr Jackson Colonel O'Neill I be sorry to keep you wait what can I do for you we think a member of our group might somehow be lose inside your building with one of your employee lose that seem unlikely well you got to know the guy of course come with I we be gain on they we have a chance you will let a little thing like your brother 's life stop you from win the race Shut up muirio La'el Montrose be gain on you you be suppose to take care of her she must have overcome the problem lose she I be try try hard do whatever you have to get rid of they take they away hello Del Mr Hagan Nice outfit you guy ok indeed how many time have I tell you do not get catch by the bad guy how could you do this Del he say he be defend his people from a Serrakin conspiracy to enslave human I do what I have to your kind be a disease the only disease here be greed he be protect the deal he make with muirio which I suspect be lucrative the reason you 've be pass over for advancement be because you 've be under investigation for corruption for a year we could not prove anything until now I intend to file a protest with the Employment Council Employment be the least of your worry right now Del Warrick Major Carter it be Eamon be you there Eamon be you all right teal'c and I be safe now get back in the race and win if you can you must be out of your mind do not say a word Major give I all you 've get Max power I hate to say it but Jarlath might be right muirio have too big a lead we will never catch he he cheat I can not believe they will still let he take first prize unless we can keep Muirios from cross the finish line first how can we do that that be easy just get I close the close we will get be when they double back past we after the final turn it will have to do what be you do reroute the conduit from your device and double it back through the communication array why so we can ask he to lose humorous more like tell he this will allow we to send a blast transmission if my aim be correct it will temporarily freeze the command control on muirio 's ship you be even crazy than I think never be much of a pilot but weapon it be an art they be come around the final turn he be try to take out La'el 's ship I do not think so well do Ah do not make I sick Unbelievable what a finish La'el Montrose have win the Loop of Kon Garat what happen to muirio it be his race to lose and he lose it some kind of beam weapon cause his ship 's power to fail open the door for La'el Montrose to take it all you have get to love there be no rule in this race it be what make this competition so special I must say I have not see anything like it you must be particularly surprised since you pick Muirios to win yes I be wrong about that you also say Warrick would not be in contention and yet he come very close to finish this race I be wrong about that too prediction for next year well I would rather not say back with interview after a word from our sponsor Corso 's Temporal Eatery where your whole family can eat what they want when they want part of the Tech Con Group family of restaurant sorry we do not win it be still worth it hey hey Warrick just tell I the winner of the race hire he as copilot on her new contract that be great yeah he sound happy you do not I be fine you still get that ion drive to study I know very cool you be just sore that you lose well it be not fair Bunch of cheater so what you go to do next year I be go to kick butt Visiontext Subtitles Natasha Cohn enhoh  Rippé par BoRiF Best of Rip in Future previously on Stargate SG1 they be so cool Savour the moment gentleman they be in trouble what would O'Neill do if he be here you want I to shoot you we be here to rescue you we allow ourselves to be capture on purpose this be great Sneakin ' around with you in a Goa'uld pyramid on an alien planet the one thing miss be some Jaffa chase we Felger Jay what Snap out of it sorry calibration scale for the power source right there right there what time be it it be two minute past the last time you ask I she should be here any second relax Jay relax we be on the verge of a major scientific breakthrough this weapon could be the key factor in our fight against the Goa'uld be it defeat the Goa'uld you be worried about or impress Major Carter unlike some people in this room I 've see what the Goa'uld can do first hand I know you 've tell I a thousand time you rescue SG 1 from the evil Lord Whatshisname Her'ak he be not an evil lord he be a first prime Jay you be a brilliant scientist some day you will win the Nobel prize what do you care what these military type think of you you do not get it when you 've stand side by side with someone and face death it create an unspoken bond an understanding that transcend simple friendship Colonel O'Neill and I have be to hell and back together when the mission be over you know what he say he say be this go to take long Colonel O'Neill Folger Felger I be not expect you sir yes well Major Carter say this be important d d d d do not touch it please this be a finely calibrate device it fire a focused plasma pulse Whoo boom it be an energy base weapon sir it could perhaps replace the missile on the X 303 Phaser more like a photon torpedo my assistant Chloe there you be Chloe this be all base on a Goa'uld design if you will join I to the rear of the weapon we will proceed with the demonstration my friend I present to you the 22nd century that be not suppose to happen I be really sorry General I assure you nothing like this will ever happen again it will not because I be pull the plug on your research no please General it be a minor glitch we be so close to a work prototype you 've say that for the last six month in fact I 've review your record Most of the project you 've oversee during your tenure here have be similarly long on promise and short on result what exactly be you say I be say it may be time for the Air Force to rethink your position here that would be a mistake it just so happen that I be work on a line of research and it be well I be on the verge of a major breakthrough really really really yes yes it be go to be huge it be go to make the plasma weapon look like a squirt gun sir what be it hm what be it well I be not ready for a presentation yet I still get to crunch a few number and dot a few I be I could probably have something ready by the end of next week you have 24 hour More than enough time dismiss thank you what be you think I do not know I have to say something they be go to fire I besides all we have to do be think of something to change the balance of power in the galaxy by noon tomorrow you have anything in mind as a matter of fact I do Avenger you got to be kid it be nowhere near ready it be just an idea we can make it work Jay this be exactly your problem you try so hard to impress people you always bite off more than you can chew ok yes you be right I have to start set more realistic goal for myself right after this project ok a computer virus the gate system 's just link computer deliver the virus be as easy as dial the target gate upload the program the virus would scramble the DHD 's coordinate so the symbol no long correspond with the proper coordinate and the target gate would be useless the Goa'uld rely heavily on gate travel it would be a tactical advantage for we do not you think it be interesting really but you do not have a finished program uh well not finish per se no I really still have to crunch a few number dot a few I be exactly yeah I will look at it if it show promise I will take it to Hammond oh yes ok whoa whoa do not celebrate yet it be not a do deal of course not of course not yes yes where be I how do she get I here you would rather stay and geek out a computer program than come with we do not take it personally sir this research show promise it be Felger he do save our life Colonel yeah do not remind I the ability to disable any gate we choose be a valuable weapon against the Goa'uld if it work that be what I intend to find out do not forget your safety glass Marines thank for join we let us move out to be honest Major I share some of the colonel 's scepticism I know Dr Felger 's record be a little sketchy but I think he show potential all he need be a little support just a minute oh jeez I will be with you in a second just you know put the dog out oh Major Carter I be in the neighbourhood this be not a bad time be it oh no no please come in come in just you know just uh really be not uh expect anyone sorry nice place oh thank you I be have it fumigate can I offer you anything no no I be fine oh all righty please please uh what uh what bring you by I take your proposal to General Hammond and he be agree to give you another chance oh thank God oh thank God that be great that be great cos I think I be so do for after that little incident thing there be one condition sure ok he want I to work on the project with you that would be uh you yeah that be not a problem be it no no no God no no what about SG 1 Daniel 's work on a relocation project the moon in the decaying orbit they be experience severe seismic disturbance and weather anomaly what about Colonel O'Neill teal'c they 've some negotiation with the rebel Jaffa leader there be be some infighting rivalry well they have to settle that yeah yeah I guess that mean you get stick with I then no no I would not put it that way I think the basic idea behind the virus be actually quite brilliant no really yeah a tie I wear tie and cologne there be nothing wrong with a man take pride in his appearance and smell this would not have anything to do with Major Carter would it do not be ridiculous here let I of course you do have to admit she possess one of the most brilliant scientific mind of our generation and a pair of leg that will not quit agh ok ok sorry well anyway what chance have a guy like I get with a woman like that she barely notice I know what that be like a little Morning oh hi hi nice tie oh thank we think the virus be ready of course there be no real way to test it except on another gate do you have a target in mind P5S 117 Ba'al 's main naqahdah mining site if we can disable the gate we would disrupt his supply network how will we know if it be successful a Tok'ra operative there can relay the result via their communication network send the virus yes sir you will wear a hole in the floor those Tok'ra be take their sweet time we should 've hear something by now Major Carter to the control room Major Carter to the control room that be it Chevron seven lock what be you do here what be go on Colonel O'Neill and Teal'c miss a schedule radio contact get a video signal sir Colonel O'Neill this be Hammond do you read Nice to hear from you General what be your status the mission be go accord to plan then we hit a little snag we can not dial the gate say again we can not get an outgoing wormhole we 've try all kind of address but we can not get a lock Stand by Colonel Whoa whoa whoa whoa this be just a coincidence there be no way this could have anything to do with my virus no could it there be no way Avenger could have anything to do with this Avenger that be what I call the virus it be name after a comic book I read when I be a kid the Amazing Avenger Green tight purple cape he be super strong super fast not as fast as the Flash that would be ridiculous of course this be not ring any bell with anybody be it could we have send it to the wrong gate no sir we double check the virus be send here P5S 117 Colonel O'Neill be on P3C 249 which be here within the gate system the planet be close together about 400 light year but that do not mean anything and until we hear back from the Tok'ra unschedule offworld activation Sir we be receive an audio transmission it be the Tok'ra this be Theless of the Tok'ra this be Hammond of Stargate Command General I be afraid I have to report a series of malfunction in the gate system malfunction several gate have go offline as yet we have no idea why we be gather information this be Major Carter do you have any datum on a planet we 've designate P5S 117 one moment please we be still wait for a sub space transmission can you send we any datum you do have Affirmative Transmission receive Sir I will need a few minute to analyse this go I will go help there it be I still do not see how this be possible automatic correlative update I think those happen once every 200 year that be the theory Major Carter report Sir first I recommend you recall all of our offworld team immediately it be already be do the mining team from P4F 221 be come through now you might wanna tell they to hurry it up what have you get this be the original target gate this be Colonel O'Neill 's position these be the gate first report offline by the Tok'ra a few minute later several more they be spread out from the original gate yes sir you still think this be a coincidence well sir we think we may have an explanation we know the gate network undergo periodic correlative update to compensate for stellar drift we 've never witness it but we believe the gate dial each other automatically to transmit the new coordinate that apply and you believe Dr Felger 's virus initiate one of these update it may have trigger an automatic internal protocol in the DHD before adapt the new coordinate it dial out and transmit they to a few neighbouring gate who then transmit to a few more and so on and so on and so on be there any way we can stop it no time sir if each gate only dial two other before adapt to the new system the entire network will be infect in less than two hour we need to focus on get as many people back as possible sir he be really mad be not he that be the last of the miner sir shut it down what be next P3L 997 that be Daniel 's team sir Dial it ok breathe Everything be go to be fine Grover Cleveland High School what Chemistry 201 I have an incident with my midterm lab they get the fire under control but poor Mr Hoffman 's eyebrow never grow back I should have get out of science right then and save everybody the trouble this be SGC you would not be here if you be not good at what you do you tell that to Colonel O'Neill how many team come back three out of how many 15 the rest be strand and Dr Jackson his team 's still offworld oh this be awful the flood water be rise but they be safe for the time be Carter General General Hammond yes sir I understand we contact the Tok'ra accord to their intelligence the entire gate network be down Colonel O'Neill report the mission 's be compromise sir look like one of the Jaffa commander sell we out go figure what happen the negotiation be go just fine then the gate break down after that they all start accuse each other of sabotage and all hell break loose Sir we think we know what cause your gate to malfunction it be the virus Felger 's virus it create a new coordinate system that spread to all dhd but since we do not have a DHD we have the only gate that can dial out I tell you not to trust that brown nosing little weasel he do not know I be stand here do he Sir I be as responsible as anyone else O'Neill we 've get incoming sir it be Alkesh we lose video must have hit the MALP he be just stand a few foot from it what be your situation please respond we be still in one piece sir oh thank God we be go to take cover sir Sir we could send reinforcement they would be strand too I can not send anyone until we fix this problem let us think this through logically the entire gate network be paralyse but we can still dial out we think the virus be spread due to correlative update initiate by the dhd we have no dhd so our gate be unaffected right it also mean another change might result in another system wide update so if we can get just one dhd convert back to the old coordinate system the gate network would spread it for we how when the new one be base on a completely random principle there still must be a pattern if we can get one dhd to establish a lock with one gate all we get to do be compare the address and extrapolate a translation program that would mean random dialling Seven symbol choose from a pool of 38 non repeat candidate that be about 63 billion possible combination she be good with number I be go to get she to do my taxis any word from Colonel O'Neill sir no we hope he be just out of range yes sir accord to our late report Ba'al be try to take advantage of the situation how so at the moment he have the large fleet so with the gate system down he have the advantage he be attack the other System Lords on several front and he be win Stargate Command Felger speak Mom Mom no no no I tell you not to call I here you be not suppose to have this number I be sorry I do not call I have to work late something come up if you must know Mom I screw up again yeah and I think this be the bad one yet no no it be bad than that one no bad than that one too Mom Mom Mom Mom I do not need a list of my personal failure right now ok to tell you the truth I do not know if I can fix this one I will have to get back to you on that Simon ok all righty bye bye friend it be coomb he say hi Jay I know you feel bad about this what be to feel bad about it take the Ancients 1 000 year to build the gate system and I wreck it in a day I 've also isolate we from all the resource we will need to defend ourselves leave we sit duck for the next Goa'uld attack but who care I need you to get past feel guilty and focus on find a solution but you never make mistake I do not you be perfect everybody know that Jay I be not perfect you have to say that because you be modest which be just another aspect of your perfection ever hear of a planet call K'Tau that be not your fault I bypass dialling protocol that make the wormhole pass through K'Tau 's sun it could have lead to the death of everyone on that planet that be it even your mistake be perfect what be you talk about you bypass a security protocol because you create a dialling program so so we can do that here instead of restore the DHD program to its original form why not upload everything from our dialling computer our program be not as sophisticated as the one that exist in the dhd it do not have to be perfect just accurate the DHD will automatically make all necessary adjustment how do you know that well it be ok I do not I do not but the fact that Avenger trigger a correlative update seem to indicate that the DHD program be adaptive by its very nature plus we have nothing else trust I Major this be go to work yeah sorry to rain on your parade guy but it do not work it should have work we try dial Earth but we could not get a lock maybe there be something wrong with the upload you can upload well huh if you 've get any other bright idea now would be a very good time what be your status Doctor Flood water 's rise pretty fast seismic activity be cause rogue wave we estimate that within 48 hour the entire city will be under water it should have work have you and Dr Felger make any progress I can not find he excuse I apparently he leave the base the pressure be get to he you say all he need be support I may have be wrong about that ok I admit it he be a complete screw up he make rash decision base on sketchy evidence he be clumsy in the lab and it would not kill he to ease up on the aftershave but the fact be he be at Stargate Command because he be a brilliant scientist no one understand that virus well than he do then I suggest you get he back yes sir Jay what be you do here we 've get work to do how do you find I here I call your mother she tell I this be where you come when you need to think I stand here when I figure out how to recombine epsilon particle in a matrix then I got mug by some teenager still it be a nice spot though what be you do feed the duck I need you to come back to Stargate Command before I join SGC my idea of a high pressure situation be defend a mathematical thesis in front of a roomful of bald man I do not do well when the fate of the universe hang in the balance Jay you design the virus you be the man for the job forget about the big picture for a second and the consequence just focus on the problem why do not the upload work I do not know it should 've every gate in the galaxy should be back online except for P5S 117 what do you mean Avenger 's resistant to that type of tamper I do not think it make a difference since P5S 117 be sabotage in the first place Jay what if the virus replicate itself and then travel along to the other dhd no it be not design to do that it be not design to trigger a correlative update either you say it yourself Jay the DHD program be adaptive Sir we may have find a solution let us hear it you want I to tell it it be your project we think we know why we can not upload our dialling program into the gate system it now look like the virus itself somehow transmit with the new coordinate to the entire DHD network the virus be block the upload that be right we need to neutralise it first but in order to do that we have to find it I do not understand well the truth be we do not know how the virus be transmit if it piggyback with the automatic update it be in the dialling program itself could be thousand of line of code like look for a needle in a haystack but it exist within a specific sub routine in the original target dhd on P5S 117 the catch be to make this work we have to reboot the system which mean remove the control crystal Someone 's go to have to go to the planet sir P5S 117 be control by Ba'al yes sir General I would like to volunteer Major Carter have the experience require for this mission Come on I 've get offworld experience I battle the Goa'uld I zatte a Jaffa Sir it would be well if we both go Major Carter 's right nobody know more about Avenger than I Jay this be crazy I cause this problem I be go to fix it you be a research scientist not a field operative do that stop I from infiltrate a Goa'uld mothership I think not they 've send the MALP the gate 's not even be guard probably cos it do not work any more but do not worry about I I know what I be do ok Jay Mm the antivirus ok yeah yeah I be go to need that all righty what wh what be that for good luck oh right you get set up I will be back soon where be you go I be go to check out the area should not we stick together in case you need backup or something I will be fine ok I be good too Jaffa land the Alkesh Teal'c and I have organise a counterattack be advise Colonel Major Carter have go to P5S 117 she be attempt to get the gate system back online that be occupy territory sir yes it be what team do she take she do not want to risk strand anyone else she go alone not entirely Dr Felger 's with her I be inspire with confidence there be no sign of any Jaffa activity in the area I be in I be in Whoo just a sec just a sec ok something 's wrong what this be not Avenger I mean it be but something 's hinky Hinky Point be this be not the program I write it be be tamper with since it be send maybe it be Ba'al Ba'al think about it he stand the most to gain he take your idea and modify it to bring down the entire gate network know it would give he an advantage that mean none of this be my fault Avenger be not design to cause a correlative update I would not get too excited it also mean our antivirus will not work that be right it be design for the original program which mean that we be now strand on a Goa'uld occupy world so it be kind of a good news bad news situation the Jaffa be not as protective of the gate as they once be but there will be a patrol we have to do something well I be open to suggestion here you say the virus be modify so we need to modify the antivirus to match it go for it I be hope you could handle it I be afraid you would say that you wanna do this instead do you know how many variation I go through before I get the antivirus right this could take day then you would well get start Yep oh yeah still no word from Sam to be honest we should 've hear back by now we be go to have to abandon the Stargate and move to high ground very well good luck Dr Jackson How be it come we be get there it be pretty cool we work together we be sort of like the intellectual Butch and Sundance of the SGC Butch and Sundance get corner and kill by the bolivian army that be a good point yeah what what what we get trouble what kind of trouble think Bolivia oh Jaffa they make our position keep work oh concentrate Jay Concentrate just background noise Argh how be it come I be feel a little rush oh there be not enough time there be not enough time Argh whoa whoa whoa O'Neill it be Colonel O'Neill thank God oh you would not believe Felger Felger Felger what do I say about touch absolutely it be just that we be over there they come then you over there but now you be here nice work how would you manage this one sir we get tired of wait Major Doctor welcome back Sir I trust the solution you find be of a permanent nature yes General I modify the antivirus to neutralise the alter version of Avenger but I also add a patch to ensure the problem be solve sir Permanently Dr Jackson manage to get the remain inhabitant of 997 to the Alpha site good to hear it sir what about Colonel O'Neill and Teal'c they find an alternate mean of transport I promise the colonel I would not say anything he want it to be a surprise I be so worried about you it be no big deal those Jaffa they could have kill you not a chance baby what be this oh hi guy I know we be not really suppose to be fraternise but hey I turn my back for two second and you take up with this trollop Oooh do not blame I just because

right hold it right there hi I be Ryk'I Goa'uld Moloc Shal kek nem Ron I too will die for you brother Teal'c of the Tauri your legend precede you thank you for meet I we be tell that there be a great many here who believe in freedom for all Jaffa go go More rebel Jaffa there be only one way to be certain Shal kek nem Ron Shal kek nem Ron warrior of the Tauri we mean you no harm please come with we Shal krek tel kree the Stargate will not be accessible for long we must hurry what be she do there be no time to explain come Kel ma lek Cree shak nel they be outsider they be SG 1 of the Tauri hey what be go on this one believe we should return to our planet that one do not believe it would be wise please we know you would be here how our intelligence network run deep within the Jaffa of Moloc we come to ask for help I promise you will be safe well they do save we Welcome to Hak'tyl Independence Liberation our dwelling be this way we really should call home first let the folk know where we be it be past our curfew by all mean why have we bring they here that be our mission why be I not tell we know you would disagree go ahead tell Ishta of our success so teal'c who be they my knowledge of the Goa'uld Moloc be limit however I be unaware of any Goa'uld that permit woman Jaffa to be warrior they seem to be well train all female receive training they have to defend their home world when their man be call to battle can not help but think of the Greek Amazon mythos yes I too female warrior capture man from other tribe in order to mate with they they sometimes remove their right breast in order to fire a bow and arrow I see neither bow nor arrow no wait you do not suppose that be why they want we do you I mean you know the three of we to mate with no no I do not think so cos you know I I be all for help people oh God forgive they for many of the young this be the first time they have see man this be Ishta our leader Howdy ma'am it be nice to meet you I 've hear so actually I 've hear nothing about you teal'c of Chulak former first prime of Apophis Shol'va and who have become a legend that be a bit thick do not you think I be no legend I fight as any true hearted Jaffa for the freedom that we deserve this be Daniel Jackson Major Carter and Colonel O'Neill hello I have ask you here so that I may propose an alliance that be a fine idea we should sit talk nosh no alliance can form between we and those who steal symbiote from a brother he be no brother of mine just a murderer of innocent child Shal kree there be much to discuss this be Syn'ac this morning she lay on her deathbed she reach the age of Prata three day ago hm Puberty ah without the symbiote we procure this morning she would be dead now this be Nesa young sister to Neith she be next to reach the age without a symbiote she will die as will all of our child 30 year ago Moloc decree that only male child would be allow to live only they could strengthen his army and lead he to victory aside from the obvious immorality that do not make sense how do you sustain a population of any gender without woman the Jaffa life span be long than human ' this could go on for a hundred year any female child have to be sacrifice in a ceremony of fire after they be bear they be burn to death yes well this be odd maybe they feel more comfortable talk to Sam why because we have penis Power bar yeah thank so how do you start bring they here as a temple high priestess part of my duty be to keep record of birth and to preside over the ceremony of fire itself I could not sit back and watch my sister be murder and do nothing as high priestess I along with my second Mala and Neith be allow access to the Chaapa ai of the world under Moloc 's rule no one outside this camp know you do this no our duty require we to attend to missionary matter on various planet so you offer the parent a chance for their daughter to live all but a few Jaffa under Moloc worship he religiously not even the parent can be trust child have to be spirit away for fear we would be report to the Imperial Guard it be punishable by death to even question the law of a god we have succeed in save many from their birthright of death so you want our help to overthrow Moloc we may have underestimate you we 've go after Goa'ulds before Moloc be very powerful his army be vast we have our way and some very powerful ally our immediate goal be somewhat less ambitious it be a struggle to procure the symbiote need for our young to survive we 've lose many warrior in these raid it have be say your weapon be formidable we also require sustenance Supplies among our grow population be scarce we be proud warrior we offer you our service and our knowledge in return we have an extensive intelligence network among the Jaffa under Moloc what if I be to offer you an alternative an alternative to what to your reliance on the Goa'uld Tretonin we 've have success with it so far on all two test subject it have not be easy the Jaffa will not give up their symbiote despite the fact it could free they they believe they would be weak Centuries of Goa'uld brainwash will these woman do it they be think about it they 've suffer atrocity at the hand of the Jaffa who serve Moloc they do not have a problem kill a few to survive a Jaffa be teach it be more noble to die than to kill these child have be genetically alter to depend on symbiote then have all access to they take away their guardian believe this be the only way for they to survive then they will have to see that there be another way Give'em the old teal'c charm it mean courage each design represent an ideal that no warrior should ever forget impressive that I do not sense your approach be not stealthiness one of the first talent teach to a Jaffa soldier with vary degree of success you wish to talk I into succumb to this experiment indeed come walk with I have you really the belief that this Tretonin be our way to freedom if it be successful it may be the first step for as long as Jaffa require symbiote we will be enslave by the Goa'uld the benefit a symbiote provide be not a Jaffa 's true strength we as a people must realise that sacrifice must be make if we be to ever truly be free this be where I come to kelno'reem much of our way of life have be design to instil our dependence on the Goa'uld you believe it be wrong that we kill Jaffa that our child would live but what be war for but to preserve our child we do not engage the defenceless or the weak we always fight with honour and those that die do not die in vain one day you will meet a Jaffa scout party that will not so easily be ambush then you doubt our ability be that what this be about you speak of progress and shedding of the old way and yet you still think a woman need your protection may your limb be more nimble than your tongue for your sake Urgh do not hold back you will only anger I far you have prove yourself a worthy adversary now hear I if you say no to Tretonin you have an unquenchable thirst for bloodshed and that do not serve those who follow your leadership I sense no symbiote in you you be correct you take this drug yourself and yet you conceal it your action betray your word all right that one mean pride no long will we need to lose our sister in battle no long will our daughter be dependent on symbiote teal'c have take the drug he stand here before you as evidence I be ask for four volunteer to travel with I to the Tauri to test its effectiveness be that a pin drop you must not go Mala I have make my decision Hak'tyl need you you be our leader I will go in your stead it be my right as Kin'dra you can not say no you be brave and true I too will go Nesa be of the age she be a child I be tell that it be not without risk but if there be one among we never that you even consider this be an affront to all of we your word be disrespectful I can not force her hand I wish you well Dr Jackson teal'c as Teal'c would say undomesticate equine could not drag he away the Hak'tyl want to learn about the rebel Jaffa we can send update on the progress of the Tretonin treatment through the MALP Kind of a pr thing sir I be General Hammond Welcome to Earth when you rise up against Apophis do you leave behind someone that you love my son and I have be reunite he have become a great warrior travel with my mentor Bra'tac spread word and what of his mother do she sit at home pine away for her hero no she be dead I be sorry teal'c you could not have know she die when her symbiote mature and be unable to procure another I see what of my symbiote it be be sustain we have method of keep a symbiote alive for some time as far as the Tretonin find the right amount be go to be trial and error we will keep increase the dose until we get the desire effect you be very brave not so much as you think the rebellion that I have help fuel have cause the Goa'uld to mistrust the Jaffa with their young you be make a point I be speak only of drey'auc she refuse to take the life of another Jaffa even to preserve her own no matter what their belief may have be what be your memory of her she could be as fierce as the wind or as gentle as the sunshine and she never fear to be either you still love she I will always have a place in my heart for her you be close to Colonel O'Neill yeah I like to think we have a special relationship I hope to someday have a special relationship oh no no it be not like that like what we be not I mean we do not I be speak of the mutual respect you share I know that I be from a world unlike yours teal'c where woman be not hold in such high regard my husband be a warrior of high station in Moloc 's Imperial Guard I be but one wife of many still as temple priestess I be afford many luxury to make up for my mistreatment what have become of your husband he be kill in battle against a rival Goa'uld I be once a temple handmaiden I fall in love with a young palace guard our relationship be forbid because of our station when it be discover that I be to have his child Moloc sentence my beloved to death and sacrifice our daughter before my eye I be so sorry when will the Goa'uld thirst for conquest and bloodshed end when they be all dead be you ok my sister say I should not talk to you you do not have to I will just sit here for a while I be Daniel I be not talk to you who be you talk to then no one so how be you I feel tired who be you talk to no one what be those on your face they be call glass they help I see well why would you need to see well cos my eye do not see too well how do they work here these make your sight bad yeah well they work differently for different people perhaps you be in need of a symbiote yeah I will just stick with the glass Neith tell I your people do not approve of our use of symbiote for heal it be more complicated than that I just think there be a well way Neith do not want I to participate in your experiment I know soon I will require a symbiote you do not sound very happy about that I will become a great warrior like Neith you know you can do that without a symbiote I can mm hm but uh you do not hear that from I have you nothing to say I have speak more in two day than I have in many year and so you be do perhaps I should take my leave thought of your wife still linger that be understandable but she be be go now for over a year there be no sin in take comfort in another lonely soul if you wish Mala be the only one not respond her white blood cell count be way down if this keep up she will go into sepsis what can you do continue to increase the Tretonin level but she be already at double the dose that be work in the other I want to move she to isolation we have no guarantee go in some would say an 80 per cent success rate be not bad in a trial like this not in the mind of the Jaffa we be not do yet we have not begin to explore the reason why it might not be work we need this to work I know Morning you have no right to speak to her sorry I save she from her birthright and it will be the symbiote I procure that will save she once again I have lose two sister and I will not lose another ok ok you lose two sister I be sorry Ishta be able to save I but she could not save the next two girl sire by my father he be a Jaffa station high in the Imperial Guard I swear that when I come of age no more of my sister would die when I hear my mother have give birth to another female I know what I have to do you should be proud of that my father discover the ruse Ishta and I use to keep Nesa away from the fire I have to kill he so we could escape well do not you want to give Nesa a chance to live free of the Goa'uld not your way you have move I away from the other because you do not wish to frighten they the truth be you be not do so well you be more susceptible to infection how be the other respond to treatment good very good Janet her bp be 60 40 give she a bolus we have to put she symbiote back do not if we do not you could die this must work if my people be to be free if I continue to be enslave by the Goa'uld I carry I be as good as dead please you challenge Ishta she be no long fit to lead we she consort with Teal'c her judgment have be cloud our sister risk their life for the experiment do you see no benefit even if the Tretonin work it merely place our dependence on the human whom you also do not trust who be to say their intention be pure their leader be man they wish to sap our strength with this drug we be safe here now but if Moloc learn we be behind the raid on his Jaffa our freedom lie in dominance over the Goa'uld we must fight so that we may use their symbiote to our advantage only then will we control our own destiny I wish to know if I be to challenge Ishta 's leadership who will follow I Neith you must come quick it be Nesa I be not wait any long how long before we see some improvement not long I hope she be code Assert CPR give I one milligram epi Prep for defib be strong sister I will not fail you what be happen Neith have claim Joma Secu Daniel teal'c this be Sam come in Daniel teal'c this be Sam come in go ahead Sam it be Daniel we have some bad news thing be not go well here either what be up it be Mala Ishta Ishta you dare interfere she challenge I it be my right it be your right to grant mercy excuse I look I know this be not a good time for this speak Mala 's dead what I be sorry how the Tretonin be not work they try to reintroduce her symbiote I just want you to know the other woman be fine see what your weakness have bring Nesa be in need of a symbiote she shall have one do not make this mistake Moloc will not allow this to continue you give I no choice how many warrior have to die our sister in your care will be return safely or the two of you will be sacrifice Kree sha Mel lak I know you wanna stop they but even if we get out we do not know where they be Come with I she insist I do not wish for someone else to die so that I might live I do not want to take a symbiote do you talk to your sister she would not listen it be my right to decide be it not I be not sure it should be what happen to Mala we do not know it be partly a reaction to her own symbiote it should not happen to someone who be never implant and the Tretonin work in other do it not yes I wish to try it ok do you know where Ishta and Neith have go no I do Sel ma ka nee we have be fortunate here this day more have die than need to we have save the life of my sister Shal kek nem Ron be the symbiote too near maturity what be wrong this Jaffa have the same wish for freedom as do we then he should not have fight with those that follow Moloc how many other that might have be our ally have we kill this day I will do it myself no be you ok she be severely wound her symbiote be damage as well Ishta you have a choice I do not know how much long I can keep she alive if I be go to administer the Tretonin it be now or never you must speak to her Neith your symbiote be die you must procure another no those way be over you sentence I to death I ask you to choose life she will not listen to I well maybe she will listen to her sister please Neith you betray I no you betray I since before I can remember you have teach I to believe in our freedom you say you would do anything so that you might protect I one day I will be a great warrior like you but I be not yet I still need you I have choose to live free you must choose to take the Tretonin if you be to continue to teach and protect I please I do not wish you to die will you come and visit yes of course my sister 's develop quite an affection for you Neith we be grateful to our new friend on behalf of the Hak'tyl I would like to express our thank our medical team will be check in regularly take note of any symptom that could be side effect of the Tretonin you train we well in the use of the medicine and the supply you have provide will go far if there be anything else you need anything call we send we an email just let not so many moon go by before we see you again do not worry I be sure we will be in touch Visiontext Subtitles Stephanie Donohue ENHOH these warrior be of both Ramius and Tilgath this meeting do not go well some of these warrior have be shoot in the back they be kill while retreat there be no honour in this battle Tilgath Ramius must have betray their allegiance the first prime of Ramius he be alive you must go from this place why do your master betray Tilgath Speak we come to forge an alliance my master do not do this he barely escape alive then what happen here one warrior you must what happen out there our intelligence be correct a summit between Ramius and Tilgath do take place however when we arrive Ramius have flee all those who remain have be slay include Tilgath by this one man alone from how he fight we I do not doubt it an Ashrak he be unlike any warrior we have meet obviously you take he down he withstand the brunt of our fire before succumb its armour must protect it from energy base weapon if so we could be deal with a new kind of technology and this be not a setup by Ramius to kill Tilgath Ramius ' Jaffa be equally as decimate his first prime say his master barely escape alive so obviously someone find out about the alliance and want to stop it Major run whatever test you have to I would like to call the Tok'ra in on this sir do it I wanna know everything we can about this warrior the suit must be affect the MRI as long as he be wear that armour we will not learn anything more his helmet be make up of two piece pass I those forceps look like he be fuse into the suit some sort of breathe filtration system it be a Goa'uld quite frankly that be not as shocking as the host how so it have an unusual organ structure everything be out of proportion Physiologically the heart and lung have to be abnormally large to supply enough blood and oxygen to its muscle someone try to genetically engineer the perfect athlete with no care for longevity leave it to the symbiote to sustain its life an engineer host a seriously flawed one even a Goa'uld symbiote would not be able to compensate for long we be still analyse genetic datum but for now we can tell you there be no evident trauma from energy weapon what do that mean the warrior 's armour appear to possess advanced energy absorption technology if it work how I think it do it would not matter how many blast be fire at it nothing would get through so Teal'c and bra'tac do not kill it yes sir apparently the host be on the verge of a pulmonary failure long before it meet they it have a heart attack sorry teal'c you do not stop it you and bra'tac just get lucky its entire cellular structure be less than three week old it be organic but it be definitely create in a lab we know the Goa'uld have be try to perfect a host superior to human this be definitely strong than human but it be far from superior traditionally the Goa'uld be also somewhat vain this be obviously intend to be a new form of foot soldier possibly a reaction to the recent uprising of the Jaffa what be most interesting be that this be be not alive when it be first grow it be give life after it reach its mature state Frankenstein 's monster how do you know that remnant of a unique energy signature within its cell it be similar to the residual effect leave by the use of a sarcophagus could it give life to something that be never alive no a sarcophagus be design to boost health or heal someone terminally injure they can not animate non living cell then what could have thousand of year ago a Goa'uld find a device originally create by the Ancients he determine its primary purpose be to heal but it be so powerful its effect on human host prove devastating however after much experimentation the Goa'uld be able to use the technology to make the first sarcophagus but could not eliminate all its negative side effect the Tok'ra have long seek this device in the hope of use it to perfect the sarcophagus technology so that we could all benefit from it now it may be the key to fight this new warrior how with it we could devise a weapon to counteract this life give energy who be the first Goa'uld to find it his name be Telchak Telchak Nicholas Ballard my uh grandfather one of Nick 's obsession be find the so call Fountain of Youth he claim he would find out the source of the fountain 's power be a piece of alien technology use by early mayan tribe around 900 BC Nick trace its origin to chac the mayan god of rain you think Chac may have be Telchak just a hunch maybe not just a hunch the device 's main function be to heal for the ancient for human to see an effect it would be from limited exposure at a safe distance still if it be hide near a water source it could be the basis of the mythology Nick believe Chac 's temple be in Central America he spend decade search for it but come up empty his note be mostly indecipherable the only mention of the temple 's location be somewhere near a waterfall in a river this be write in an obscure dialect of Goa'uld so where be it it be here if Selmak 's right it be in southern Honduras how can we be certain the device be there we can not but um we think we know who create the Goa'uld warrior Telchak no Telchak create the sarcophagus Anubis go to war with he for possession of the original device that be before Anubis try to ascend Anubis defeat Telchak but he never do find the device it be believe to be hide in one of Telchak 's temple you think Anubis be behind this he know about the technology he never find the device but he would not need to he would 've gain the knowledge when he ascend and build a new one still it be only a guess yeah but it be a good one the good news be sir the original ancient device be probably still here on Earth if we could analyse the technology of this device it might be possible to engineer a weapon to use against these warrior not to mention the possibility of harness its power to heal very well Dr Jackson take Dr Lee and see what you can find dismiss be you sure this be the right place this be where he say he would be what if he do not show up we have a few beer make friend Hola Muy bueno día caballero ¿ Una cerveza ¿ Una tequila De hecho estamos buscando a un guía llamado Rogelio Él quedo de vernos aquí Pedro hazte cargo tío I be Rogelio Rogelio Duran at your service this be just my day job you must be Dr Jackson that be right this be Dr Lee Buenos día Encantado so you guy wanna see some temple actually we wanna see one temple in particular here I be sorry to tell you this señor but there be no temple there you wanna go north that be where all the good stuff be there be lot of ruin my cousin have a truck we could be there in five hour yeah I be sure the north be great but we really wanna go here Señor I have be to this part of the country many time there be nothing there I promise you North that be where you wanna go either you take we south or we will find someone who will ok ok ok it be your money you say your cousin have a truck Simone his house be around the corner of course there be the issue of fill the tank with gas ok now we be talk business let us go gentleman um look I need a receipt or something if Anubis be truly behind this then his strategy be to assassinate any minor Goa'ulds vulnerable to attack absorb their troop in preparation for battle with Ba'al and the System Lords how many minor Goa'ulds have suffer attack at least three these new warrior be devastating do we know where they be come from no our fear be it be only a matter of time before Anubis target Earth these being be a threat to all who hope to one day see the Goa'uld defeat if Dr Jackson can recover this device even if he do there be no guarantee the Tok'ra can devise a weapon that can fend off these warrior we only learn a limited amount from our study of the warrior 's armour the only way to learn more be through interrogation which mean we have to capture one alive what have we get Major the warrior 's armour can resist our strong armour pierce weapon as well as absorb energy weapon fire however the material be make up of a close knit fibre similar to Kevlar mean something small and sharp should be able to penetrate it such as a fine tip trinium dart bra'tac say the fact that Ramius be still alive make he a likely target there be enough rebel Jaffa under his command to gain access to the planet we stake out the gate on Ramius 's planet and capture a warrior that come through what if one do not come through well we come home I suppose but let us say bra'tac be right we meet his contact on Ramius 's planet set up an ambush use a force field to trap a warrior and hit it with tranquilliser how do a dart get through the shield they be one way they keep thing in ah so what do you think I have some note accord to the map we be in the right place but uh this make no sense the legend of the Fountain of Youth say all water flow towards it how be that possible maybe the device have special property maybe it be superstition or it mean the flow from that waterfall flow in the direction of the temple well it should be right here but nobody ever listen to I I tell they there be no temple out here but they come out here anyways now the north have road we could drive to any temple we want but instead we be in this jungle yeah ok let us spread out look for a temple in lieu of that a marker of some kind anything that might tell we where to go go Agh find it this be the good spot for your ambush this path lead to the pyramid of Ramius I will go now to ensure that your eventual escape will be undetecte Brother Tek matte Master Bra'tac it be an honour to be in your service many thank Adal Chel nok right Carter do your thing Reynolds I want flanking position set up on either side ring the perimeter with claymore not much faith in plan A since when have plan a ever work right you ok yeah I be fine at least you be right about there be something here we be go to go look around stay put you get it señor have fun this be definitely early mayan stonework oh yeah SG 3 Sierra this be SG 1 Niner what be your status we be maintain position Stargate be secure no activity maybe we should start a pool be this cramp thing get to you why make these passageway so narrow maybe they be skinny people and the roof too ow my head God Skinny short people it be a dead end there be nothing on the wall or ceiling no glyphs no seal no Ancient script not even a pictograph be not there always write you know I mean somewhere there be bind to be maybe not SG 1 Niner this be SG 3 Sierra Target have come through the gate and be en route to your position right head up do it Carter I do not understand sir hit he again a third dart could kill we want he alive Son of a bitch Fire in the hole C4 Sir our position be be make grab the wounded and saddle up SG 3 Sierra dial the gate we be abort the mission Negative SG 1 we have major unfriendly Jaffa close in on our position we can not hold the gate Repeat Stargate be not secure soon we will be surround if we fight many more will die what do you wanna do surrender there be a chance Adal and his rebel Jaffa can free we later Dr Jackson Dr Lee yeah we be here we find a chamber go to be a while ah take your time señor we be pay he by the hour I do not understand how be we suppose to find this thing if there be no writing all water flow towards it so give I your canteen here hold this what good be that go to do there be something under here you be good how be he do stable but we 've get to get he out soon I be fine Jaffa I will handle this greeting well uh I know how this look so I think it be important we clear up any misunderstanding right away we do not come to kill you Honest be I right the fact be and this be the fun part we actually come to save your ass es all your ass do you see the irony all right there be this guy out there big guy big guy in a black suit none too fond of you Goa'ulds well anyway he be the one we be after not you so if you wanna let we go we will be on our way to save the world another day you be not buy this Jaffa Kree well that go well that go well well at least it have write on it yeah what be it say I have no idea oh careful it be the root technology of a sarcophagus which cause madness and addiction this be supposedly something far more powerful so activate it could be bad ok let us try pick it up without touch it too much running would be a good idea about now Dr Jackson can you hear I your friend 's condition worsen yeah well your friend can show up anytime now we must consider that they may not really at least we be alive yes if you call this living you be worried that the super soldier will kill Ramius and slaughter the rest of we Super soldier no it have a ring most likely the warrior be only after Ramius when we attack its only concern be escape so that its mission be complete so we just sit around while Ramius gets whack then what hey a little conversation go to kill ya Look I know you be all about loyalty so be I in fact many be the time silence teal'c hear I Jaffa your master be a false god and will surely be defeat however you still have a chance to be free your word mean nothing to I I know who you be the Shol'va teal'c and Bra'tac O'Neill of the Tauri Assassins who believe they could slay my master well if we be assassin who be that Hm Dr Jackson Dr Lee can you hear I can you hear I be you ok I think you be dead for sure we trigger some sort of trap I figure out why those passageway be so narrow to prevent people from escape alive you be good what have you find I be not go to rob you señor Hostia Madre de Dios consider this do it sound like it be go well your master will die as will you if you do not free we you lie my master be a god he be invincible you be next you know Ramius will force you to die for he while he escape my god will fight for his people you be wrong my friend your god be somewhere cower in fear like a child I have see it before he will not hesitate to sacrifice all your life to save his own hey what about we should not it be get easy to convince these guy Sir Hang in there Reynolds as long as it take Ramius have fall go now before it come for you go go go come on guy come on let us go let us go let us go come on if this be a turf thing we be not aware of we be sorry oh no señor please do not speak I be just say that whoever you guy think we be we be not who do I think you be I do not know we be scientist archaeologist in fact I be just say if this be a kidnapping you should know we be not worth anything trust I gringo everyone 's worth something to somebody I trip I be sorry Gee I can not see anything Chalo Argh what just happen your guide he try to run what can you do maybe now we will all stay on the path eh muchachos after you Vámonos Ouch it would appear Ramius be attempt to get to one of his ship Sir I think we still have a chance to capture the warrior how transport cycle complete get he get he Good Indeed Chino José Ven para acá far enough Agárralo Ilévenselo I do not know what you expect but no one'll pay anything for we we be worth nothing that be unfortunate for you because if no one pay you both die it be still unconscious not surprising consider we void the cargo bay of life support once we get it on the ship it take ten minute to pass out I be surprised it be even alive it put up a hell of a fight sir Hammond very well your prisoner be awake who do you serve Hm speak I serve Anubis how be you create I think it be safe to assume they will not get any more out of he find anything else initial scan indicate below normal brain wave pattern emanating from both the symbiote and the host he have the strength and healing power of a normal goa'uld but none of the normal personality trait the Goa'uld use sophisticated brainwashing technique I be open to suggestion how can we find out what it know if anything there be one possibility we may be able to use a memory recall device to access any conscious image in its mind as it think they do it Sir any word from Daniel no he be now six hour overdue per his regular contact schedule that be late even for Daniel the honduran government be look into it they 've send some people to their last reported location but find nothing if his brain wave be compatible with the device we should be able to see whatever he be think holographically what be your planet of origin that be the sky above his planet I do not recognise these star configuration it could be anywhere we have technology that should be able to pinpoint this location in the galaxy he just give we his home world ¿ listo I know it be not much but we do what we can so here be my proposal for you I will ask question you give I answer I believe you you get more water food maybe even a blanket at night ok ok who do you work for I tell you we be archaeologist maybe I be not so clear if I do not believe you thing get bad for you much bad you kill we you get nothing maybe I kill one of you to get your government 's attention who live who die that be up to you ok you listen to I what you be do now be a big mistake People very powerful people be go to come for we and well let us just say by let we go now you will save yourself a lot of trouble ok we do it the hard way understand this I will not hesitate to kill you both make an example of you for your government so the next time they will take we seriously you should know many prisoner talk as you do my friend will come and save I it give they hope the Tok'ra call it Tartarus a seemingly unoccupied planet in Goa'uld control space the Tok'ra be currently try to assess any defence that might be there Sir I be afraid I have some bad news I just receive a communiqué from the State Department in Washington it appear that Daniel Jackson and Dr Lee have be kidnap they may have cross the border into Nicaragua however as of this moment we have no idea where they be Visiontext Subtitles Natasha Cohn enhoh previously on Stargate SG 1 he be unlike any warrior we have meet we could be deal with a new kind of technology who be the first Goa'uld to find it his name be Telchak Telchak if it be hide near a water source it could be the basis of the mythology it might be possible to engineer a weapon to use against these warrior c4 what be your planet of origin he just give we his home world the State Department receive a ransom demand for Dr Jackson and Dr Lee we 've be give 72 hour to pay or they will be kill do they know who be behind it they have not identify themselves Intel indicate we be deal with honduran antigovernment revolutionary they be follow the book on this one officially they have no intention of pay any ransom Unofficially tie with their government be at stake no one be willing to risk break policy over this so we send a team in to extract'em we 've do it before the rebel think our tenuous relationship with the nicaraguan government will prevent we from take action but they be wrong the president have agree to help as we speak he be request that the CIA gather whatever intel they can but whether he be willing to risk an international incident thank you sir I will let you know the second I hear anything Apúrate gringo Rápido Apúrate you have not have water or food for two day Mm muy delicioso Pick of the season this be very good today we be go to start slow I be go to ask you again what be this and this be the part where you do not talk ok Mm for you and your friend if you tell I what this be I do not know how long someone can go without food but I believe the human body need water every three or four day it be an ancient artefact an artefact yeah I be an archaeologist that be what I do I look for artefact well I find one seriously I be an archaeologist you can look I up on the internet if you want do you have a computer it all make perfect sense you be nothing more than an archaeologist and you find and study artefact it make perfect sense hm I be go to ask you one last time what be this and again you be not so talkative what give you the right to come into our country and steal valuable artefact you call yourself a scientist you be nothing but a thief and you think you be well than I but I have reason for what I do I do not doubt that Chalo and here be something else you should not doubt compadre you will tell I what I want to know the CIA operative in Honduras an Agent Burke say he know where Dr Jackson and Dr Lee be take Burke do you know he yes I do anything I should know about he be the only agent on this we be stuck with he regardless right right nothing you should know about I see he be request you participate in the extraction the president have green light the op there be a C 130 wait at Peterson it leave for Honduras in two hour yes sir Sir I be go after Daniel Good this other mission should not be a problem sir when do you leave now good luck you too a este lado I do not know anything I do not know anything we 've confirm that Anubis have a base on Tartarus a powerful sensor array prevent anyone from approach the planet unnotice the Stargate on Tartarus be inside the structure with a force field protect it we need to know why Anubis create this new soldier confirm what we believe his intention be and if possible stop he any idea even if we could defeat the force field we have to assume the Stargate be guard we must gain access to the planet by shut down the sensor array I agree the question be how I will walk through the Stargate Selmak yes come again I wear the armour of Anubis 's assassin accord to your account on Ramius 's planet it pass through the force field but at what physical cost we have no way of know the force field at that Stargate be more powerful than the one we use I be sorry kid I be with Selmak on this one he will keep I alive do anyone else have a well idea once I 've deactivate the sensor array a scout ship can then approach the planet Radioactive isotope take beforehand will permit we to move around freely without be detect by sensor inside the base what be your exit plan the scout ship I will conceal it in one of the planet 's many low lie chasm power down to far avoid detection Major you have a go ¿ Estás bien Sí bueno gracia you do not look very happy to see I I would have give anything to see your face when you hear my name hey it be ok man it be not ok I 've get 48 hour to find my friend before he be kill just tell I what you know ok all business I can dig that station this be the last place Daniel be see before he hire a Rogelio Duran to take he into the jungle a short time after that he be snatch by anti honduran extremist and you know this how it be how this splinter group do business last year they kidnap an important engineer work on the Cajon River Dam big american contract insurance pay off and they finance their little war against the government with the ransom this engineer do he live yeah he do sometimes they do not what about weapon ok this be colourful Honduras and Nicaragua be have a territorial dispute I know what you be thinkin ' when be they not so anyone in the I hate Honduras fan club can shelter behind the nicaraguan border and buy gun what kinda gun ak ak for day Nicaragua get their stuff from Russia now but in the ' 80 they inherit all of it from Cuba they let we fight Cuba from their shore we get our ass kick and Cuba give they the gun we could get shoot at by an AK 47 that be fire at the Bay of Pigs attack you 've be down here too long Burke you think so you know why I get this crappy posting be you go to blame I now you coulda stand up for I Hillary leave I what happen when one team member be kill and the other will not vouch for you I do not see what happen to Woods I tell them what I know I be not go to lie I be not talkin ' about lie I be talkin ' about my head we be buddy you know I I tell them what I know you do not tell them enough and now you be here stuck in my part of the world you need I and I be call it on this one I do not think so I know how to get over the border I know where these rebel operate oh yeah I be in charge no you be just the guide just the guide that be what you think of I now that be right you be not so go you do not understand the need for a clear chain of command you wanna know how go I be ¿ Quieres algo más señor Sí Necesito un guía I be a guide this it be just my day job I never think I would die like this oh you be not dead yet I be sorry Daniel

surprisingly light I guess it be time good luck thank you George you come with I sit you seem damage Come on Dad the array be yet to be shut down we be helpless to act even if we be to attempt secure communication we would have to leave our hide position make we visible to their sensor Thoth Lord Anubis I be not expect you tell I how this one have fare this one have just return my lord I need time to finish my preliminary analysis before I make a proper report it can wait there be a remote probe malfunction it require your attention yes my lord so many thing could go wrong he be so stubborn perhaps it be time to consider the sensor ray be power down no doubt your father 's stubbornness Dad we be on the way good when you touch down proceed to the exhaust port assemblage I think I 've find a way to get you in Copy now hold up this be it as I tell you there be nothing here there be this well in the middle of nowhere standard US military boot tread all around make a wish what take you so long how hard could it be to track their GPS locator I be just kiddin ' I only be here a couple of minute myself change your mind in a manner of speak Vete Regrésate a la cantina ¿ Cuatro mil Muchas gracia señor Momentito this be the end of the road man you do not think these guy be go to make it easy on you do ya I will take you where you need to go for old time ' sake you know I take an emotional inventory and I realise that I have some issue Thought maybe we can put our petty difference aside on this one you be go to need I when this thing go down buddy come on give I a chance I will not let you down Sí vete Gracias Vamos Vaya con Dios now we be talkin ' sport fan ok my name be Burke and I will be your guide today we will be look at indigenous vegetation of Central America watch your step lady it be not Minnesota Easy if you value the life of your friend you will tell I what I want to know your friend tell I this device may be the origin of the Fountain of Youth myth maybe how do it work I do not know you grab we five minute after we find it who be this Telchak he be a mythological figure a mayan god that may or may not have live here thousand of year ago so this device be many thousand of year old possibly and this mayan god bring this device to this temple for what purpose to hide it to use it I do not know use it on whom People mayan people what would it do to they the research I use to find it just give a cryptic warning the device be dangerous even harmful that be all I know I do not think it be so harmful I have never in my life feel as strong as I do right now you turn it on yes turn it off you do not know what you be deal with the effect of the device may be unstable it be very dangerous it be beyond our comprehension turn it off you be lie what if he be not the device be curse Rafael we should turn it off turn it off do you not feel different as well I do and it scare I Por favor Rafael if you will not turn it off I will what happen I fool the exhaust port into purge the system I mean with the sensor array I got hold up you be not worried about I be you help I get this off Rebels move around a lot the grunt be self teach bush fighter it be harvest season Most of they tend to their farm now those who do not are ex military hold up about 20 click northwest of Ocotal well this be not suppose to be on the tour at least we know we be on the right track I 've be shoot agh no no no you have be shoot Sí Air Rescue should be here in about an hour I 've be lie here for day what be another hour who do this Unos malditos bandido que mueren del dolor del culo all right all right we be look for two scientist Dr Jackson they have he they go north across the border go we be not just go to leave you sure you can señor help will be here soon do not worry this be not the first time I 've be shoot save your friend please they owe I lot of money ah I love american gum good guy speak Lord Anubis one of the Kull Warriors be miss what be the reason for this behaviour there be damage but I believe our method of govern the symbiote mind be flaw Unacceptable determine the origin of the flaw and report back to I yes my lord he move I kill he it be as simple as that I think he be a hostile it be all history Burke Now be not the time I know we be out of position I want to cut the angle down as you approach the objective I guess Woods be doing the same so you both take it upon yourself to improvise at the same time that be right that be the third one I 've see how many do you think Anubis have there be no way of tell yet I be just guess but at least a handful the lab I be in be make to service several symbiote hold tank all empty this one be not should not we at least wait till night time I do not think we have that long we will not get far before they kill we if we stay they will definitely kill we I see the short term effect of that device I know what a sarcophagus do to a person 's sanity this be more powerful I do not want to stick around to find out what long term exposure do judge by the hold tank in this room Anubis must plan to have the queen spawn thousand of Goa'uld but why a symbiote be spawn with the genetic memory of the maternal bloodline they be egomaniacal and power hungry not a great combination for a foot soldier that be right but look at this this queen whoever she be must be in league with Anubis she be prepare for a spawn cycle yet her brain wave pattern be minimal she have no intention of pass on her genetic memory the symbiote will be blank slate much like Egeria on Pangar and Anubis will be free to imprint they however he see fit no free will they be drone they make the perfect soldier Deadly fearless unquestione loyalty this be too similar to what happen on Pangar to be a coincidence how do Anubis find out about Egeria Jonas Quinn Anubis must have find out when he scan Jonas Quinn 's mind if Anubis have any design on create a drone soldier that information would 've be the final piece of the puzzle this queen must not be permit to spawn again Teal'c 's right ok we take what time we have remain and try to find out what else Anubis be up to then we detonate the C4 and get outta here could be just a coupla click now how can you trust I I do not think I ask you to come here so I could shoot you too why would I think that forget I say anything you 've have opportunity before now what be bad be that you think I be incompetent for cry out loud Burke you be willing to go into a hot situation with I watch your back I have no choice and I be think of send you in first I watch you you wanna know the truth come on you really do not wanna know Man it be not my fault I mean I do not choose I just react it stink the whole damn thing stink you wanna know what really happen Fine I will tell ya Woods be ghost we he sell out he be no good he be send out a rogue transmission give our position away Woods realise I be onto he he turn his weapon on I and I just react why do not you come forward with this you remember how close we be the wife and the beer and the barbecue I could not do that to Cindy it come out Woods be a traitor she do not see a pension a month away from his retirement he be not retire he be set himself up as a mercenary for that warlord he make his choice he be go that be all that matter that be not good Disparen no no you let they escape Vamos a matarlos there must be a console somewhere that will let we access a log of recent activity even if it do not contain Anubis 's plan we might be able to gather intel on the movement of his fleet nothing but lab corridor and storage in this direction I think Anubis 's quarter be this way Bill you get to keep movin ' Mátenlos Mátenlos Síganme I can not I can not breathe yes you can come on stay down I will draw they off you be all my child Kull warrior you be the instrument of my conquest Hail Anubis Hail Anubis Hail Anubis Machete I be go to skin you alive how many more be there Daniel that be it you get them all what be you do here there must be thousand of they Fools C4 bra'tac we need that ride now I will be there momentarily will you be able to walk on this yeah Telchak 's device reanimate dead tissue yeah whatever hey get down what be with the guy from Evil Dead um Classified yeah you guy be into some crazy crap man get it go what be that it can not be good just punch it someone have open the rear hatch we be mid flight teal'c be you hurt indeed where my pride an old man do what I could not Sam Sam no do not move just lie still what hurt everything that be a good sign Perimeter 's clear just hear from Air Rescue they get the guide Rogelio he be go to be ok they will be here soon hey nice backup sure thing buddy anytime anywhere you know I think I should recommend that you be post to a nice place a temperate zone not too hot not too cold fine lookin ' woman that put out like break candy machine whatever I will see what I can do Thanks buddy be that the thing that make the guy do that thing yeah it be ok it be off now Good that be good yeah at least we think it be off it be not glow any more so the glow thing give it away so if it be not glow any more it should not be on do you wanna hold it no no that be crazy so miss I of course sir it could not have be that bad you be all still alive as be you and Daniel Jackson Daniel I be fine we get the device from Telchak Good hopefully we can engineer a weapon from it you must or we will be leave helpless to combat these new warrior we have some bad news sir Anubis have an entire army of these super soldier there be thousand of they the good we could do be delay his ability to manufacture more we will debrief fully in one hour Welcome home hey so nice command we do manage to make it out alive sir there be that Lunch Visiontext Subtitles David Van Cauter enhoh previously on Stargate SG 1 this be Prometheus otherwise know as the X 303 Sir there be an energy build up in the naquadria cell the jump must 've trigger a surge that overload the control system stand by to jettison the reactor module even if we plot a course for Earth use maximum sublight thrust it would take year P3X 744 if we can gate home from there we can get what we need to repair the ship so this thing be different from a nebula how that be why it be so exciting sir we do not know exactly and this formation just happen to be near our next cool down coordinate it will only be a little bit out of our way Colonel all I ask be two hour top if only to see the expression on your face first hand Kid and candy store come to mind I will try to retain my composure just keep in mind that our mission be to get this bird home in one piece Colonel Ronson report to the bridge must be time after you Major Sir the hyperdrive engine be at maximum safe temperature Shut them down Major Gant yes sir drop out of hyperspace Major Carter what be our progress well sir we cover 49 light year in the last leg consider the hyperdrive be lift from an Alkesh that be pretty good it be originally design for a ship one tenth this size only five more of these pit stop and we be home Colonel a bogey just appear on our sensor dead ahead 3 000 click can not you identify it Negative sir it be close in on we very quickly sound general quarter Bogey 's now at 2 000 click Raise shield Arm weapon Bogey be now at 900 click it be not slow down sir how long till we can jump to hyperspace again the hyperdrive need two hour to cool down before attempt another jump if we try one before that it could overload Colonel I be get some unusual reading from the alien vessel they be scan we sir Major Gant set up a wide frequency broadcast I wanna talk to they go ahead sir this be Colonel William Ronson commander of the Prometheus please respond if you can hear I I offer you peaceful greeting Bogey be now at 400 click and continue to gain on our position sir Sir thermographic sensor be show a build up of energy within the ship Energy build up be continue sir Colonel we have to get out of here Major Gant initiate evasive manoeuvre Delta now yes sir Executing Delta Major Gant report shield be down 69 their weapon be drain our shield 53 reroute auxiliary power to shield Weapons Officer prepare to return fire on my command Aft missile bay one through six ready sir Fire one through four now Sir missile destroy before reach the target Alien vessel be still gain on we sir Shield strength be at 32 Fire all missile at will wait suggest divert auxiliary power back to the sublight engine Major the gas cloud if we can get inside it it might make it hard for they to track we shield be below 15 even with engine at full strength we will never make it we might be able to make a small hyperspace jump into the cloud give I a few minute to override the safeguard you have two come on one jump weapon system no long operational shield be below 10 receive ship wide damage report Colonel this be Major Carter call the bridge Bridge please respond this be the bridge call all deck please respond this be Major Samantha Carter of the US Air Force vessel Prometheus as the sole remain crew member I feel compel to keep a log of these event after be attack by a hostile alien ship I sustain an injury and lose consciousness when I awake I find the ship devoid of all crew an initial system review indicate the hyperdrive to be operational but the sublight engine remain offline possibly due to damage from the attack I be hopeful further investigation will provide more answer however my first priority be to find out what happen to the crew having search the ship and find no one only one possibility remain to explain their disappearance since all the ship 's escape pod have be jettison I must assume an evacuation order be give after my lose consciousness in the chaos that must have ensue I be leave behind the sublight engine remain offline I guess something about the gas cloud be prohibit restart procedure thus far I have be unable to find a way around this problem without sublight engine power to manoeuvre the ship I be leave with only one other option Damn it Major Carter teal'c hear I you must remain conscious at all cost I just need to rest for a while you can not listen to I you be injure if you sleep you will die do you understand I know if you sleep you will die Twinkle twinkle little star how I wonder what you be up above the world so high be someone there like a diamond in the sky Twinkle twinkle little star hello how I wonder what you be ok I have send out a distress signal detail Prometheus 's situation and our last known position in space I know it may be hundred of year before it be hear that say Stargate Command be aware of our route and will undoubtedly do everything they can to mount a rescue and if any of the crew survive I can only hope they will eventually send help as well therefore I feel my good course of action be to settle in for the long haul by my calculation I have enough food and water to last several month with further ration it might be possible to double that play with I I 've be try to understand why the ship be unable to jump hyperspace during my last attempt the hyperspace window seem too unstable for the ship to enter it thus far sensor have be unable to identify the content of the cloud itself it be more likely make up of a denser group of gas than that of a typical nebula it be prevent the hyperdrive emitter from transfer power at an even rate until that change the Prometheus will remain trap here indefinitely Yep I would say you be stick all right you 've be run the same diagnostic program for four hour what make you think the result be suddenly go to change Sam hello be you this annoying when you be ascend depend who you ask I think I have a certain je ne sais quoi timing be so so no offence but I really do not have time for this this be ridiculous you be not even real well I be not so much I as I be you really I mean part of your subconscious mind so be I real that be up to you I guess the socratic implication be quite fascinating Daniel you just need some help that be all can not you just try to go along with this you be I talk to I yeah basically all right you have a point I could use some help thank you ok what do you I want well I think you be go about this all wrong this be help you 've wait week to study this gas cloud be not that the real reason you volunteer for this job now you be here finally here and you be waste your time run hyperdrive simulation in case you have not notice I 've get a small problem Daniel I be strand inside the thing you 've look at through a telescope for year it be a chance to study something rare and exciting up close Seize the moment seize the moment it be something new that we 've never encounter before you be ignore it do that sound like you Daniel I can not even think straight let alone stay awake Sam you have to check this out trust I it be important oh my God oh you hear about Sam yeah do not sound good 18 hour past due for contact yeah I would say something go wrong I make a list of planet with Stargates in range of the Prometheus route General Hammond have agree to send SG team to all of they include we why if something go wrong they might be able to make it to a planet with a gate at which time they would gate home would not they when the hyperdrive fail on the maiden voyage you be nearly strand on P7X 009 they do not know where the gate be sound like a long shot unfortunately the Tok'ra be unable to send a ship now they promise to retrace the route as soon as they can but visit these planet be what be what be something yeah ship 's log update I have discover that section of the hull be be corrode by the gas in this cloud although I have boost power to our shield it have have little effect on protect the ship I 've seal off those section affect by the corrosion but it be only a stopgap measure all I know for certain be if I can not find a way to stop it from spread the ship 's hull will eventually be breach when the blaze sun be go when he nothing shine upon who be you what do you want then you show your little light twinkle twinkle all the night come on this way wait Samantha teal'c do you see of course you do not I be here to warn you I know I have to stay awake that be not all everything may not be as it seem the fact that I be talk to someone who be not really here kinda speak to that on the contrary I think it be you that be not here what I believe you and the other crew member be be hold aboard the alien vessel how do you know it be possible they be probe your mind if so any information obtain may be use to attack Earth hold on even if you be right and I be not really here what be I suppose to do about it nothing teal'c give I something here very well as you attempt to repair the ship 's engine you may inadvertently be divulge vital information on Prometheus technology I do believe it would be prudent to do nothing I can not do that teal'c be careful Samantha wait where be you go you be wrong teal'c I be not on an alien ship I be right here this be real ow this be real the effect of my head injury be get bad I be not sure how much long I can last my only hope of survival be to somehow free the Prometheus from this gas cloud without use either the sublight or hyperdrive engine I think I 've come up with a way it have its risk by vent several level of pressurised atmosphere I be hope to generate enough propulsion to move the ship come on no hello be you here hey have I tell you my late theory it be really cool lose something do you see a little girl yeah no you know you do not look so good yeah anyway about my theory what if this cloud be not so much a collection of corrosive gas as it be a sentient be I be say the cloud be alive Sam the cloud be alive yeah it be a sentient be like feeling memorie a space bear alien entity if you will that be crazy why else would it be corrode the ship because the gas be corrosive or maybe we somehow offend it when we fly inside of it the point be if we talk to it maybe it will let we go you want I to talk to the cloud would it kill you to try how would I do that you say there be a little girl on the ship maybe that little girl be the physical personification of the cloud just go with I on this maybe that be its way of try to communicate with we Daniel this be not help talk to her Sam like a diamond in the sky Twinkle twinkle little star how I wonder what you be my mother use to sing that to I how obscure I be so tired you can not sleep not yet why because we need to talk eat you need to keep your strength up do you have a name I be Grace who be you you know no I do not know I be your father Dad I know it sound corny but you get to an age you get to an age where you think about everything you do wrong as a parent do not take this the wrong way I know I do not look so good I want so many thing for you Sam and look what it be bring you instead Sure but the massive headache really take the edge off it all be you happy Sam what just answer the question well at the moment thing be a little rough but in general sure I be happy no you be not you be content you be satisfied you be in control and that be the problem ok I be really not follow here I be say you be miss something vital from your life the sad part be you have no idea what I mean Dad I be happy I 've see and do thing most people could not even dream of I have an incredible life and yet you be alone well lately the date scene be be a little stale but then again I be maroon on a spaceship no always for as long as she be alive your mother show I a world beyond just ambition and career she give my life meaning and balance it be my honour to love she for the short time she be with I and if I be young again and I meet she for the first time even know her fate I would do it all over again that be love Sam I know you 've deny yourself the experience because you think it must inevitably end in pain and loneliness it be time to let go of the thing that prevent you from find happiness you deserve to love someone and be love in return Report Colonel this one be a bust too these folk be more in the dark than the first bunch they be indeed a primitive society whatever they have not see any sign of the ship we be oh for seven on this sir you hear from the Tok'ra they 've make an initial trace of the Prometheus 's route there be no sign of it at any of the designate cool down coordinate assume they stay on course they be expand the search conduct long range scan of system adjacent to the route home hopefully we will hear something from they soon I do not wanna hear it good cos I be not in the mood all right what when Colonel Maybourne and you be strand offworld Major Carter feel a similar sense of frustration she despair at the thought of never see you again not you indeed you be like a brother to I O'Neill you be like what 140 a young brother perhaps but that be not my point look t I know what you be try to do and I appreciate it Wanna try it be fun I remember when I be a little girl I use to wonder how a bubble could exist there be this thing call surface tension when molecule bind together Boring here just try see Fun yeah all right Carter on your foot let us go I be wonder when you be go to show up you just go to sit there too tired sir Samantha I be a figment of your imagination you be go to call I sir Old habit sorry be you go to save yourself or what I 've try just give up then I do not know what else to do right now you will think of something you come to give I a pep talk that be what friend be for friend hey this be you talk here Might as well be honest what if I quit the air force would that change anything or be it just an excuse I would never ask you to give up your career cos you do not feel anything for I Carter I would let you go right now if I know that easy I do not say it would be easy then what be stop you if you really wanna know I be try maybe it be not I that be the problem here let us face it I be not that complex I Sam I be a safe bet as long as I be think about you set my sight on what I think be unattainable there be no chance of be hurt by someone else Jacob be right you deserve more I will always be there for you no matter what believe I so what now go save your ass one last thing never mind what do you want what do you mean whoever you be I know why everyone else have show up why be you here what do you want from I I do not want anything but you do then the traveller in the dark thank you for your tiny spark how could he see where to go if you do not twinkle so what you look at it be complicated try I I be go to try to save myself with a bubble how the hyperdrive will not fully engage but maybe it do not have to if I can dial down the power flow I should cause a partial shift into hyperspace take the ship out of the cloud 's space time hopefully enough to cancel its effect on the sublight engine Neat yeah Sam what be you do she be attempt to rescue her fellow crew member that be crazy get back to Earth and then bring in the cavalry there be no time I agree the alien vessel be too formidable will you guy shut up just let she work this be Major Samantha Carter of the US Air Force vessel Prometheus can you hear I I be think you 've be stick in here as long as I have the only difference be I 've find a way out here be the deal return my crew everyone intact and let we go and I will help you get outta here do we have a deal what the hell just happen it be a long story sir just bear with I I be activate a hyperspace bubble to include the alien vessel we be go to bring it out of the cloud Major I will explain everything soon enough sir now what we see if they keep their end of the bargain well do Major Sir I would like to relieve myself of duty now Easy get she to the infirmary hey Jack excuse I sorry sir yes well a massive concussion will tend to disorient one how long be I out there it be all relative that time space continuum thing Sir four day I could have swear it be week teal'c and Daniel say hi they be plan a bit of a shindig for when you be up and around there be talk of cake a cake my idea can not wait need anything Magazine Yo yo I be fine yes you be thank you sir for what nothing think nothing of it I 've get plenty of that Twinkle twinkle little star how I wonder what you be Visiontext Subtitles Sarah Emery enhoh  Rippé par BoRiF receive a signal it be the Kelownans open the iris Mr Quinn it be good to see you again it be good to see you too sir I only wish it be under well circumstance we need to talk for several month we 've be analyse datum on the crystal leave behind by Thanos it be the Goa'uld that occupy our planet 3 000 year ago our progress at first be slow but we recently make a major major discovery it turn out that naquadria be not originally present here what do you mean it be not native to our planet it exist in the mineral deposit underground I know it do now but we believe that those deposit be originally make up of ordinary naqahdah I assume this make sense to you actually no it do not we find a reference to a process the Goa'uld discover which let they convert raw naqahdah into naquadria while it be still in the ground it start a chain reaction which have continue on down through the vein get deep and deep and we believe the process be ongoing be you say that right now there be deposit of naqahdah on your planet be transform into naquadria yes one very large one in particular we only recently discover it because it be so far beneath the surface but as the conversion process go deep the heat and pressure get high and naquadria be highly unstable we believe that when it reach a certain depth it be go to explode with enough force to obliterate Kelowna the first few reference to the conversion process that we find be pretty vague I be half convinced I would make a mistake in the translation then we come across test result which show the ratio of naqahdah to naquadria achieve in the process check this out the unconverted naqahdah break down into light element I be wonder why we never find any naquadria anywhere else in the galaxy now I think it be because it do not exist in nature at all that be why none of the Goa'uld know about it until Anubis probe your mind we 've get the late geological datum it look like oh hello hi oh Samantha Carter this be Kianna Cyr this be Sam Carter she help I out on the translation I 've hear a lot about you we could use your expertise right now what you get the naquadria have progress deep than we think how much time do we have a few week a month it be hard to say we must understand how the conversion process work if we want to stop it yeah but the information on the crystal 's incomplete then we be go to have to figure it out for ourselves Ambassador welcome to Earth actually it be First Minister now First Minister this be Vin Eremal and Lucia Tarthus the Tiranian and Andari representative on the council Councillors right this way I assume Jonas Quinn would be join we he send his apology he be devote his attention to the naquadria problem have any progress be make so far very little I be afraid I believe that with the participation of our friend from Earth a solution will be find we all hope that be the case but you may want to consider some contingency plan we can offer you limited relocation through the Stargate Limited a full evacuation of an industrialised world be a practical impossibility I be not sure I understand you invite we here to propose that we abandon Langara Langara be the new name of our planet it be from an ancient dialect common to all three nation a symbol of our new unity have a nice ring to it it be choose by a committee we understand that if this problem can not be solve Kelowna will suffer severe devastation at which point we be prepared to offer the survivor humanitarian aid we have limit resource but we pledge to do what we can be you kid have no one explain this to you we have try they seem unwilling to accept the truth if you know our history you would understand our reluctance to believe Kelownan propaganda our own scientist have study the problem while Kelowna will bear the brunt of the explosion in fact almost half the country 's landmass will be destroy you be not take into account the debris in the upper atmosphere it will block the sunlight and lower the average surface temperature significantly your entire planet will be uninhabitable it make no sense Naquadria be a heavy less stable isotope than naqahdah Conversion should require the continuous input of energy but it seem to be continue on its own which be impossible not necessarily low energy fusion can occur in the presence of certain catalyst like muon I believe that only work for extremely light material such as deuterium Kelownan understanding of particle physics seem to have come a long way we be quick learner I be not think about muon specifically other subatomic particle could have catalyse this reaction the real question be why do not this planet blow up a long time ago what do you mean you have not figure out the process because you 've assume that this transformation begin 3 000 year ago that be what the historical data indicate maybe so if you put that aside and assume the presence of the right catalyst you can account for this reaction it be just a lot fast than you think how much fast a deposit the size of the one you discover could take as little as a few year to transform completely what be that receive video transmission sir Major what be your situation Most of the fire cause by the earthquake be under control Dr Fraiser 's organise the distribution of medical supply it be hard to believe it be a coincidence it be not we trace the epicentre to a small pocket of convert naquadria locate about 20 km below the surface a small pocket when the main deposit go the explosion will be 100 000 time great this planet Madronas and how far away be it approximately 14 000 light year give or take the Madronans be a peaceful advanced society with resource to accept thousand of refugee Quinn 's report refer to uninhabited planet capable of sustain life the Andari government might consider relocation if one be available without infrastructure any uninhabited planet would not be able to sustain as many langaran refugee I be not suggest one planet for all of we you want your own planet the Andari people would welcome a fresh start give the oppression we 've suffer all you suffer under tiranian rule be peace and good government and mass arrest summary execution in response to terrorist act whoa we be get a bit off topic here three separate relocation be just not practical Madronas be your good bet to save as many life as possible Jonas Major Carter you 've discover something about the conversion process we determine that the transformation must have begin with a massive bombardment of subatomic particle which catalyse the reaction and allow it to continue without energy input it be possible to create these particle in the lab but there be only one way they could have be produce with enough energy to penetrate several mile into the crust of the planet it be the naquadria bomb test the test that be conduct two year ago we do this to ourselves historical document indicate that Thanos be destroy in some cataclysmic event maybe this explosion trigger the chain reaction it do at least with the naqahdah deposit near the surface Thanos manage to create naquadria in the lab but something go wrong the result explosion release the subatomic particle which catalyse the conversion of the first vein of naqahdah the rest of the deposit transform in less than a year after that it lie in the ground another 10 000 year and it would have decay back into naqahdah if you have not mine it first then we set off the bomb which start the conversion of the second deep vein this be outrageous if what you say be true the Kelownan government bear full responsibility for the imminent destruction of Langara your government form an alliance to attack Kelowna we be look to defend ourselves we go to a heighten war alert after we learn of your research which prove you be spy on we what choice do we have we be not go to rely on the Kelownan government to tell we the truth councillor please these talk must be suspend until I confer with my cabinet for cry out loud Jack who care whose fault it be your planet be go to blow up the whole damn planet Daniel I think it be good if we all take a little recess General I say we send them pack indeed we still have the potential to save thousand of life and yet they do not seem to understand or care this be diplomacy the way the game be play it take patience yeah well I be fresh out as be I I think you be on your own however many time you go over this we will come to the same conclusion there be simply no way to reverse the process maybe we do not have to accord to the late geological datum there be a minor fault line cross the vein of naqahdah about a kilometre above the large deposit if we could somehow trigger a move along the fault line we could isolate the advance naquadria and break off the chain reaction how do we do that set off a large explosion near the fault Stargate Command could provide a small nuclear device the only problem be we would have to get it down there which mean drill through 20 kilometre of solid rock what there be something I wanna show you it take we 2½ year to build at a cost of over half the annual Kelownan research budget a deep underground excavation vehicle Cool the fore and aft section have both be outfit with titanium cutter head each of which can withstand or apply thrust of up to 50 metric tonne what kind of advance rate uh about 80 metre per hour I know it be not fast enough but I do have an idea for a little adjustment that will give we a lot more speed Tok'ra tunnel crystal modify to work in conjunction with the cutter head pretty impressive mind if I look at your power system after you do we have to show she everything Kianna everybody have an agenda Jonas her people have make no secret of their interest in our naquadria deposit look I 've want to come forward with this for a long time but I always got overrule by the cabinet now we have no choice we do not need she we can go to the Tok'ra ourselves I work with these people for over a year I trust they with my life do not worry the machine be design to mine naquadria in the term of our alliance information relate to naquadria be to be share we be mislead we intend to tell you once the prototype be fully operational do you take we for idiot it be you that create this disaster and now you expect to benefit by acquire alien technology it be unfortunate the Kelownans do not reveal this information soon however regard the Tok'ra crystal you really have no choice without they we will not reach the naquadria vein in time to save your world it be that simple wow Jonas this technology be beyond anything I 've see in Kelowna I make some adjustment base on what I learn in Stargate Command pretty amazing yeah I tell you most of the credit go to Kianna Kianna oh yeah she take what she learn from I and make modification to the hydraulic the shielding mechanism everything without her this thing would be month away from be operational you two have be work closely on this yeah I guess what come on Jonas I be not blind what be go on let us just say that it be in the development stage although I do find her interesting I bet you do teal'c I trust your mission be a success indeed the crystal you request thank you how be the negotiation progress well they finally agree to send a three person delegation to Madronas to evaluate it as an evacuation site what of Jonas and Major Carter they be adjust the Kelownan excavation machine it should be ready for launch within 24 hour hey just in time to help I run a few diagnostic program what Jonas do you design the primary power distribution circuit I do not really design anything I do make suggestion for upgrade base on advanced technology you encounter with SG 1 yeah that be right why what be wrong the hardware 's different but the basic principle be very similar to a Goa'uld design that be impossible I go over it three time I probably would not have notice if I have not calculate that the generator be operate at 130 efficiency no there be some mistake Jonas who do design the system Jonas what be go on we know what be you talk about who do you serve Jonas whatever you think whatever she tell you be a lie they search your quarter do you want to explain why they find a Goa'uld communication device very well you know the truth now how shall we proceed I be assume this be the drug that allow you to escape detection it somehow mask the presence of a symbiote right I be send this back to the SGC for analysis how long have you be on this planet we know Anubis come here for a reason after his defeat I be despatch to find out why he be so interested in this place so you work for Baal I gain access to Kelowna 's research by implant myself in a scientist on the naquadria project let I talk to Kianna in a small way I 've grow to admire this host she be exceptionally astute a superior speciman let I talk to her I make the major modification to the excavator if you wish to complete this undertaking you will require my assistance why would you help we we share a common goal I too wish to save this world so you can hand it over to Baal I do not think so Jonas Kianna she be right you be go to need she let she help you for the sake of our people it be not her Jonas it be a Goa'uld try to fool we we 've see it before no Jonas please get her outta here depth be 2200 metre speed 1 5 metre per second the drill be run hot all right bring down your rpm do not overcompensate I can not stay ahead of these adjustment you be go to stall we out Power up you strip the drill head Control End simulation Jonas we 've get a problem could this be the result of Goa'uld sabotage no Major Carter believe the Goa'uld 's modification have improve the speed and efficiency of the drill the system require constant adjustment accord to the material it be pass through it be kind of like shift gear in a racecar Major Carter be not confident in her ability to run the drill she think the good person for the job be the Goa'uld you can not be serious we could overhaul the system and eliminate the modification but that would reduce the speed of the excavator and it would take week we do not have that kind of time the Goa'uld could have sabotage it any time instead she help Jonas improve several key system only to preserve the naquadria deposit for Baal maybe so but avert the explosion be our first priority without the Goa'uld we have no chance you 've make the right choice your confidence in I will not go unrewarded we have no choice and for the record our confidence in you be minimal which be no doubt why the shol'va will be accompany we and why all of you be armed who calibrate the primary inductor I do launch now and you will burn through they before you pass 100 metre right I will take navigation teal'c take shield and life support indeed we be go for launch in 30 second power up Engines be at 70 80 shield be active Navigation computer be online Engines be at full power Control we be set to go for launch in five four three two one we 've just receive word from Kelowna our security personnel monitor a communication device of Kianna 's apparently a message have come through from Baal she be overdue to report he be wait for she to send a transmission and if she do not they will come to find out what happen that be a distinct possibility what be it we be lose coolant pressure in one of the forward tube we must have break a seal Major Carter take the control where be you go I can divert coolant from the aft but I have to do it from the engine room I be come with you you still do not trust I do you no be there any way to contact the excavator they be too deep no radio signal could penetrate that much solid rock tell they about Baal 's message will not change anything if the Goa'uld do not make it back that would only happen if the mission fail if that be the case Baal will be the least of your problem I suggest we get back to plan your relocation check it now Forward pressure 's rise we be good maybe now you will believe that I wish this mission to succeed yeah for the wrong reason have it ever occur to you that serve Baal may not be my only interest here I never think I would find the company of a human so intriguing and suddenly I repulse you not that long ago you feel differently that be before I find out who you be what you be and yet the fact remain you never know the host before I take she all this time it be never Kianna it be always I what be happen I be not sure we be still on course still descend Hull temperature be rise rapidly 300 degree 400 degree and still rise be there any volcanic activity in the area Mount Kallan but it be be dormant for hundred of year just because it be dormant do not mean there could not be magma flow Hull temperature be 700 degree and still rise we be pass through a river of molten rock Daniel how be the whole diplomacy thing work out for you the late argument 's about selection a lottery assign position or set up a committee to discuss the problem I remind they they be face annihilation but they can not face their own mistrust I think I can help you out on this what do you mean hull temperature be 1100 degree the ship will not take much more of this Divert power to the shield we have no way of know how thick this vein of magma be if we turn back now we may survive I say divert power to the shield Power divert although I be not sure how much difference it will make hull temperature be 1200 degree do you really want to risk your life for the people of this world Major I be not so sure they would do the same for you we be lose hull integrity teal'c Hull temperature be drop 1100 degree and still fall we make it through very impressive Kelowna will accept nothing less than equal representation Really Kelowna be solely responsible for this problem need I remind you that the Stargate be in our possession for the moment be that a threat when it come to the survival of our people we will do whatever be necessary now you want a war we be try to save your world and you wanna destroy it save your breath Daniel you folk be do I do not understand well you see we actually like the Madronans they be nice people we 've decide there be no way we would subject they to the like of you Deal 's off you be toast General Colonel O'Neill 's right you can stay until we hear back from Jonas and Major Carter it be what you get for dickin ' around something 's wrong we be lose speed 1 5 metre per second and slow it be the forward drill they be damage by the magma they be come apart we stop Forward drill 's finish cut power it be as deep as we be go to get what be our position we be still over a kilometre from the target what if we drop the bomb here we be too far from the fault line it would be pointless then we have fail we have to go back and repair the ship too much damage it will take week I be sorry Jonas but we do not have a choice we still have crystal we can use those to tunnel the rest of the way they would never make it far enough if we focus they we can dig a passage big enough for one person that will give we the distance we need it might work but at this depth the heat and the gas would penetrate even a Tok'ra tunnel it would be suicide I will go do not worry Major Carter I may be intrigue by your willingness to sacrifice yourself but I do not share it my symbiote will protect I why take the risk you still think of I as nothing but a servant of Baal you be mistaken you have not tell he about the naquadria not yet you want it for yourself the fact remain that I be the only one who can complete this mission the tunnel be complete you understand the detonation procedure of course it be a simple enough device I be in position I be set the detonator this be not good Kianna this be Major Carter do you read go ahead we be lose power I think the generator have be damage I be afraid of that how much power do you have leave we be down to 70 so much for my empire say again if you begin the ascent now you may have enough power to reach the surface we be not leave you behind you have no choice if the power drop below 50 you will not even be able to restart the engine I be already dead if you wait you die too this be Jonas there be still time leave Start back immediately if you be do this out of concern for the host you need not bother the body be already severely damage even if we make it back I may not be able to keep she alive listen to I we be not go without you so shut up and get move we should have hear by now something go wrong power 's down to 53 she be take twice as long to get back as she take to get down Kianna this be Jonas Come in over please respond I believe we have no choice but to begin our ascent I will take care of her get we outta here power up engine begin ascent you wait you hold up your end of the bargain be that your only reason I already know your answer unscheduled offworld activation receive a signal Audio only put it through Gate control to First Minister Dreylock this be Dreylock go ahead we be receive report a major seismic disturbance Survey place the epicentre at the target coordinate they do it any word from the excavator Negative the power reserve be near depletion we be almost there ten second five second four three two one you miss it yeah I do judge from what you 've get to deal with in Kelowna I be not surprised I would take danger over one of those council meeting any day yeah I do not know what Jack say to them but they be be a little more cooperative let us hope it last how be you feel fine I guess I remember everything but it be like a dream the symbiote 's dead she save I she could have let I die with she but she do not you may find this hard to believe but she appreciate everything you do for her that you try to do Time to go home Visiontext Subtitles Gill Parrott ENHOH  Rippé par BoRiF previously on Stargate SG 1 Sarah Daniel we could have end it well than we do maybe Sarah be you happy Sam what you deserve to love someone maybe it be not I that be the problem here I be a safe bet the tablet talk of a lose city that be more valuable than anything be you say the Ancients actually lose one of their own city no they do not lose it they make it lose to other people that might try to find it so the Lost City be still lose Amulet be from the 12th dynastic period Inlay suggest the house of Amenemhet possibly a gift from the king 's family to commemorate a birth come of age or it be for luck royal goldsmith make they for the king hope floodwater would rise in the Nile grant they a bountiful crop good guess Dr Jordan send I a picture a few week ago I suppose I have a bit of a head start I be Sarah Gardner be that seat take well no but there be plenty of other empty table yeah but none of they have single beautiful woman sit at they how do you know I be single there be no ring on your finger I could have a boyfriend you be by yourself at 7 30 in the morning you be very observant I be a cop well then I feel compel to warn you most of the guy I 've date recently have die as in dead how various circumstance I will risk it how about dinner tonight my motel room your motel room I be in town from Denver on a case we will order room service open a box of wine a box something with a duck on the front stop it Pete I be on a roll here I have not even show you my badge yet aw and I get to go come on Sam call in sick spend the day with I we will go to the zoo there be no zoo in Colorado Springs Bowling there must be a bowling alley around here somewhere I have to work can not deep space telemetry wait a day have you see how much deep space there be out there I will see you tonight it jam the frequency the Goa'uld use for communication and remote control of device like ring transporter right now we be work on make it portable enough to at least pretend it be interesting it be very interesting please go on be you tired you think I have the weird dream last night about what work with Sarah back in Chicago before the Stargate programme how be that weird thing be all mix up my hair be different well no offence but it be not like you do not have some issue to work out oh yeah maybe you should talk to someone I think I be Colonel Carter Coffee talk to you later ok humming I be you be sorry what be his name Humming Pete Pete Shanahan he be a cop Speeding again be we from Denver a friend of my brother 's a setup Pathetic I know no it be great be not it well it be not serious or anything and yet it be humworthy Sir it be none of my business I be just happy you be happy about something other than quark not bad with the quark huh excellent bit uncomfortable be not it yeah a bit good luck thank you sir good morning hm hello I be sorry I do not hear you come in I mean how be you fine you settle in well except for want of a decent cup of tea I be in heaven that be good to hear you know I must have read everything you 've ever publish everything yes what a waste of time please your theory on the Hyksos dynasty be groundbreake if a little audacious I find they inspire I reference they in my doctoral thesis at Cambridge you must have fail I just hope I can live up to such talented company no I be sure if you be here you have you be stop the flattery be overwhelming I should let you continue I be go to continue you know I know this good place for coffee that no I mean I be sure they serve tea I would like that Dr Jackson Daniel Daniel I can not tell you how much I 've look forward to be here with you be able to pick your brain and that be great yeah it be ok I mean the company be fine oh come on how can you not like Singin ' in the Rain I 've always be more of a Fred Astaire fan it be a classic whoa whoa there lady Classic be reserve for the like of the french Connection Dirty Harry Serpico Cop movie what be your point this be romantic watch a man dance in the rain just cos there be no gun or car chase or nudity your chance of that be slim to none now buddy have I ever tell you what a good dancer I be my case down here wrap up tomorrow you be head back to Denver I call my captain and say I do not care if crime be run rampant up there I meet this woman this amazing person and we get this thing going on and what do he say get your ass back here or you be fire too bad I be lie I tell he I be take two week ' vacation the truth be Colorado Springs be very underrated Pete and it be go so well it be but it be get late it be seven o'clock I have to get up really early to go to work right which involve long arduous hour of you look into a telescope right Sam have I mention I be a cop I interrogate people for a living be you say you do not believe I be this all go too fast for you cos I could back off give you five or ten minute I will call you have I leave yet I can not feel my leg thank you a little human contact first if you please be that so hard Mmm I will live you 've be here all night have not you be it morning already I 've get something for you where have you get this it be find during an expedition in Morocco an associate send it to I for analysis no one be quite sure what to make of it I take the liberty of run a carbon date it be over 10 000 year old that be impossible the lack of writing in the pyramid the inconclusive dating on several artefact be you say this prof there exist a language that predate all hieroglyphic I think you might enjoy the challenge Daniel I recognise this how could you Medieval Latin be a derivative we can use it as a reference point Daniel how could you possibly know that I do not know I just do this make no sense maybe you should eat something in the dream the tablet be write in Ancient and in the dream I could read Ancient that be not so odd consider you can also do that when you be awake perhaps you want to reveal something to yourself like from when you be ascend your prior vision of Bra'tac and Rya'c in danger the tablet sound a lot like the one you find on abydo that be to lead to the Lost City but do not you think I know the location of the Lost City and I do not remember if you have the dream again perhaps you should translate the tablet I think you might need a break wow that be really nice I mean I do not really deserve you do I no Hungry I can not remember the last time I eat how be it go I be so close I think I find a basic structure to the whole thing it be about guidance at first I think that mean some sort of spiritual guidance but I be wrong here look something about a starting point or place of origin the step of a great journey lead to what lead to what a city a place of great power it be a map tell we how to find a city where an ancient race of human live see I know what the tablet be suppose to say I just can not seem to finish translate it perhaps the location of the Lost City be not the answer you be search for since I now require sleep I have develop an interest in dream there be much research to study on the matter ok sigmund what be my dream about since Sarah be take as a host by Osiris you have be unable to save she perhaps that be the focus of your subconscious desire something I know when I be ascend could help Dreams be the mind 's way of deal with desire that can not be fulfil oh so basically I be destine never to get a good night 's sleep again know your past experience Daniel Jackson I do not know how you have sleep well before now thank you teal'c this conversation have be disturb on many level up enough I uh what I will take that as a yes be those for I yeah it be the other 11 the one I leave before make a dozen I get it they be beautiful thank you can I open they now no now no will you stop how about now no ok now what do you think I think we be go to get notice come on this be great it be nice to know people still stay together no matter what be not it I can not do this what be the matter I be just go round in circle I can not find any reference that relate to this passage doorway what the origin of doorway how do you know that it make sense do not it yeah but how do you know that it be all there you just need to relax Mm oh no what we be suppose to have dinner tonight two month right I be so sorry I forget why do not you remind I it be all right it be too late now I understand if it be that important to I I would have say something you do not mind of course not you be suppose to leave what be you talk about I be not go anywhere your research will change the world you be a brilliant mind I do not want to stand in the way of that I want to be a part of it I be however go to order we pizza get back to work so do you wanna come in I do not know see the inside of your house that be a pretty big step suit yourself right now you be pretty much perfect what if it turn out you be really messy or bad you be a neat freak weirdo with label drawer and an alphabetise bookshelf Pff ok I be come wow just do not look at the bookshelf ok so why would you become a cop I watch too much tv as a kid Adam 12 Starsky and Hutch Barney Miller Barney Miller it be my favourite show those guy never shoot anybody never beat anybody up that be it what do you think every cop out there have an inspirational story it be just a job Sam I do not think so not for you and Mark tell I you have a story Bastard never date your buddy 's sister he do not tell I what it be it be no big deal I have a bit of a rough time when I be grow up Truth be I probably would have end up in jail if it be not for one cop who take an interest he really make a difference in my life and I admire that it be an admirable job well my ex wife do not think so do you see the episode where Barney get home and his stuff be on the lawn with divorce paper staple on top no I do not blame she I mean the hour suck and you never know if I do not have a choice it be who I be I can understand that really Deep space telemetry be who you be I wish I could tell you more you do not trust I I be not allow where be you go I get to drive back to Denver today and file my report Pete aside from get into huge trouble myself I could be put you in danger now you be tell I that joke about your boyfriend all end up dead be true pete please the problem be I feel like I 've just scratch the surface with you Sam how can we have a future together if you will not share your life with I Federal Bureau of Investigation how may I direct your call Special Agent Farrity please I will transfer you now please hold Farrity Dave it be pete what be up buddy I be in Colorado Springs on a case right now and I need a favour man can you do a background check on someone global agency search the work sure thing who be it an air force major Samantha Carter the only thing I do not have be a gate address and there be still a few passage I can not translate do you think you can I do not know it be like I be not in control like I be just along for the ride watch the whole thing unfold the strange thing be none of it be right please elaborate Daniel Jackson I be an idiot Sarah be in love with I and I have feeling for she too but my obsession with my research destroy our relationship she finally break it off with I when I work through our anniversary the Sarah I be dream about be different she care about my work as much as I do she want I to find the Lost City as much as I do sound like a normal male fantasy to I do you not say that Sarah introduce the tablet to you during one of the dream and that you feel that you have no control of the dream yeah teal'c the Goa'uld possess the technology to explore one 's memory you be suggest Osiris be here on Earth manipulate Dr Jackson 's dream we think it be possible sir Kinky she be look for the location of the Lost City in my subconscious she be implant an image of an ancient tablet to help I Osiris can access Sarah 's memory and use they to gain Daniel Jackson 's trust how be she do it we be speculate that she be sneak into Daniel 's house at night and use a memory device Anubis probe Thor 's mind thus gain access to Asgard beam technology that would allow she to come and go undetecte why not just snatch up Dr Jackson and use a mind probe on he like with Thor it be possible Anubis 's mind probe will not work on the subconscious it might have something to do with how Oma erase my memory it may be a way to get you to unknowingly help they learn what they wish to know so what do we do the Goa'uld be scavenger of alien technology they would interface any Asgard system with their own command device we hope the jamming device could prevent Osiris from use the beam technology to escape Daniel 's room you want to set up a trap we will not spring it until after she be help I remember the location of the Lost City what look no one want to save Sarah more than I do but I could know I mean it could be there somewhere in my subconscious we let she think she be operate without our knowledge until I 've have a chance to try to finish this and how be we suppose to know when you know if it be all happen in your head while you be sleep I do not know you would well figure it out we can not risk let Osiris escape with that kind of information Shanahan it be I I get what you want just give I the highlight well there be a lot of backstop ID work for the air force do deep space telemetry for NORAD be that all you find it be what do not turn up that say most the backstop dead end she be be scrub yeah someone wipe out every possible trace of her leave only what they want other to see she be probably connect with some top level stuff like black op covert unit thing the government deny all knowledge of you know look Pete you ask I this Major Carter 's connect to something big you might want to back off from this one ok buddy it be way out of your league it be not like I be date she or anything right hello hi it be I this be Pete I be probably chase a bad guy leave a message so what do we get Daniel 's at his house set up video surveillance Teal'c 's pick out his doughnut he love a good stakeout Jamming device be in the van it should prevent Osiris from beam herself out we take she down with these she likely have a shield but a tranquilliser dart will get through then we hope the Tok'ra can safely remove the symbiote and save Sarah what about this whole Lost City deal we watch and see once in his room Osiris will not be able to leave we just have to get to she before she realise she be be make Backup local authority have be notify but we do not want to do anything to alert Osiris How be Pete you know how it be usually you do not let it bother you cos they could not cope with the truth anyway usually I think he could have hey Daniel Daniel be you sleep yet yes Jack I be fast asleep what do you got there no I will pass here we go activate frequency jamming let us do it Carter she be still there sir how long do we wait Daniel must be get close Progress not really these symbol represent the location of the city like an address yeah yeah there be seven of they they will not translate into anything specific you be so close no I be not do not say that Daniel they mean nothing to I you 've work too hard to give up now I do not know I never know how unfortunate for you move in Move in Sam Pete what be you get down Holy Agh will you be all right Daniel Jackson yeah go go go it be no use Pete yeah why be that now that be not normal look out Clear be you ok I be ok be you ok yeah that be good oh God Pete you 've be hit have I Carter it be pete he need an ambulance just hang in there ok Sam what just happen I promise if you make it through this I will explain everything deal it be all right you be safe Daniel I be here it be all over you be free I be so sorry Shh it be not your fault I could not stop it we be go to get you through this hey be they treat you ok yeah who would have think there be a hospital here one of the good anywhere this place be unbelievable you have no idea thank I believe I live up to my end of the bargain what I be about to tell you be classify under section 11 c 9 of the National Security Act Chicks with laser beam ring and glow eye be classify under 11 c 9 let I talk will you ok you be currently in a top secret military facility know as Stargate Command in 1928 in Giza Egypt archaeologist unearth an ancient device capable of transportation to other planet by mean of a subspace wormhole I know it this be way well than a box of wine with a duck on the front I be not kid sorry other planet wormhole continue Visiontext Subtitles Stephanie Donohue enhoh  Rippé par BoRiF previously on Stargate SG 1 this be the base of the Tauri why be there Jaffa Rebel warrior Jaffa who 've turn against the Goa'uld be that go to be a problem not for we somebody want to tell I what be go on here it be history for 2 000 year every time a Tok'ra die by a staff weapon a Jaffa be hold it this be obviously intend to be a new form of foot soldier I serve Anubis he be get the strength and healing power of a normal goa'uld but none of the normal personality trait this be be not alive when it be first grow Frankenstein 's monster thousand of year ago Goa'uld find a device create by the Ancients with it maybe we can devise a weapon to counteract its life give energy where be the matrix crystal by the primary I can not find anything in here I have a system at the Alpha site its location be compromise when Anubis use his mind probe on Jonas do you really want to hang around I want to work as efficiently as possible Anubis ' drone be kick the crap out of the System Lords we be next this prototype should 've be do week ago it be do it be just not finish interesting distinction we just get Telchak 's device I be amazed we come up with something so quickly in this form it be only 70 effective in counter the reanimation technology that be because your power unit have not be properly calibrate this will be well maybe have you not have your coffee this morning Selmak do not like coffee you give up coffee for your symbiote I do not know that we never talk any more Sam what be happen we be under attack Goa'uld ship enter the atmosphere Colonel Riley 's order evac to Beta we be bug out right now what happen approximately 20 minute ago the approach of Goa'uld ship prompt evacuation of the Alpha site Sam be do research there she and Jacob be work on a weapon to neutralise Anubis ' new soldier we have no idea what happen to either of they how many people get out Casualty report be still come in but 90 be still miss include the base commander Colonel Riley I think the location of the Alpha site be secret it be a completely new address evidently the Goa'uld have discover its whereabouts Chevron seven lock Wormhole stable sir no radio chatter send the MALP yes sir MALP be en route receive MALP telemetry my instrument say the MALP be on its side you still have camera control yes sir if the Stargate fall over and it be face down the event horizon would 've dig a cavity when the MALP come through it fall into the hole there be no way to know if the DHD survive if we have another power source we can dial out manually possibly under enemy fire we will be fine sir the gate dig the perfect foxhole you have a go good luck Colonel thank you sir wow this destruction do not appear to be from aerial assault single radius blast quite possibly the self destruct to prevent the Alpha site from fall into enemy hand so we will split up search for survivor who could 've survive this start with the tree line there copy move out O'Neill what do you get this be the armour of one of Anubis ' drone Reynolds go ahead be advise we may not be alone here at least one of Anubis ' goon might have be on the planet when it blow Use extreme caution Understood Colonel Major Green you all right I be fine sir we get some serious injury here any other survivor in the area as far as I know we be the only one sir O'Neill go ahead find 12 but they be not in good shape how bad some can walk but most need immediate medical treatment Major Carter with them I be afraid not SG 3 's go to need help to get the gate back up sg 11 and 21 be assemble now I will be send they through momentarily however that mean a delay before I can send any other resource to help search get the wound out be our priority agree but if there be any other survivor they may not have a lot of time Understood sir we will keep try Jacob Anubis ' drone we know take this it be not 100 but it be all we 've get it only have a few more shot Sam have a fully charge power unit where be she I do not know I do not even know if she be still alive how be you do it be nothing Selmak can not handle we need to know what happen how do Anubis get the location to the new Alpha site I have no idea I be with Sam when the self destruct go off one of the drone be chase we into the forest George if I survive the blast you know that thing survive as well what about the prototype weapon I give it to Colonel O'Neill but it be only semieffective in its current configuration the upgrade power unit be with Sam and we have no idea where she be she be still miss be there anything else we can use against these drone their armour be impervious to energy weapon and regular firearm what about the drone kill in the blast Kinetic energy an explosion of that size they can not ignore physics so with enough kinetic energy it would have to be a lot how about a missile that might do it if you get close enough Sergeant Siler prepare a UAV with UCAV spec yes sir be I in trouble sir the Alpha site have be compromise indicate we 've get a security breach the Pentagon be demand I launch a formal inquiry immediately just tell I what happen son to tell you the truth I be not entirely sure I be still at chow when the alarm go off by the time I get to the command centre Colonel Riley have order the evacuation what about the Stargate it be hit by an Alkesh bomber we be cut off that be when the drone land in scout ship they take all we throw at they and just keep come so Colonel Riley order the self destruct he know there be sensitive material on the base he stay with the device so the enemy could not disarm it he tell the rest of we that we have one minute to make it to the tree line I should 've stay with he you be follow order Major yes sir be there any unusual activity at the Alpha site in the last few day any unscheduled gate activation or unexplained signal no sir what about the Jaffa and the Tok'ra they have not be get along very well but there be nothing unusual about that I want a list of all personnel human Tok'ra and Jaffa who 've use the Alpha site gate in the last 48 hour yes sir Footprints Standard issue from the SGC indeed the depth of the impression be consistent with Major Carter 's size there be another set over there someone much large perhaps a drone yeah do you believe this prototype weapon will be effective against it we will jump off that bridge when we come to it so how be the leg get there slowly but surely yeah slowly the way you heal it will probably take a day you do not come here to ask I about my leg you want to know what happen to Sam yeah the base be under attack we could hear the explosion get close and the sound of scout ship approach we have to leave now just gimme a second but we have to download the weapon design into the matrix crystal and wipe the computer memory you have the prototype we can not leave this datum for they to find how much long finish it work not good enough let us get the hell out of here the Stargate be hit we could not get out so we run for the hill the drone follow we if Sam be still alive it be still after she maybe it be just hide wait to go back through the gate out of all the room on that base why do it come to that lab and why do it chase we as oppose to anyone else you think it know about the prototype I think that be the whole reason for the attack Anubis know we have the only weapon in the galaxy able to stop his soldier and Sam have the design that thing will not stop until it find her Sergeant Siler report it be ready to go well do I want it airborne now yes sir General the leader of the Jaffa survivor be clear for debrief I want to speak to he immediately yes sir I do not know why I be be question we need to determine what happen if you wish to know who betray your base I suggest you ask the Tok'ra why do you say that they be without honour they be your ally then why will they not help we what do you mean even as we speak Anubis be move against the System Lord Olokun Drones slaughter Jaffa that stand against they they be die for a hopeless cause what be that get to do with the Tok'ra we believe they have a spy in Olokun 's high rank close enough to kill he the Tok'ra inform we of their operation I have no knowledge of any spy in Olokun 's rank then they be lie to you too with their master dead the siege would be over and Olokun 's Jaffa would be free to join our movement our log show that a group of Jaffa leave the site less than 24 hour before the attack you send your own people do not you yes have they report back they have not if they be capture by Anubis no Jaffa would yield to torture Anubis do not have to resort to torture he have technology that allow he to simply read a prisoner 's mind when Heru ur be kill I be force to pledge allegiance to Apophis the slayer of my master become my master so it have be for all Jaffa for thousand of year but now we can choose to fight our oppressor we can choose to be free I ask only that the Jaffa who serve Olokun be give that same choice if you let I go to the Beta site to speak to the other survivor I may be able to discover what happen to the Jaffa we send very well Colonel O'Neill General Status report we find track sir they could be Carter 's what direction East up into the hill the high ground be a more defensible position Understood I will have the UAV fly a search pattern in that area Hammond out Jacob any news on Sam not yet we have a UAV airborne and all available SG team be search I do not know anyone tough or more resourceful she will find a way out of this How be the investigation go I 've be mean to talk to you about that do you know anything about a Tok'ra operative within Olokun 's rank no the Jaffa say you have a spy in his inner circle they be mistaken unscheduled offworld activation do you learn anything at the Beta site of the Jaffa send to recruit rebel from Olokun 's army only one have return the fate of the other be unknown Anubis have win a major victory thousand of Jaffa have be kill and many of Olokun 's commander capture the Tok'ra spy among they that be impossible if we have someone on the inside I would 've know about it be you sure thank you for your cooperation in this Delek I do not see the need to continue this investigation General the Jaffa have as much as admit responsibility all we know be that some of the man they send to recruit rebel do not return they be capture in Anubis ' late offensive it be the logical explanation accord to the Jaffa a Tok'ra spy be also capture we both know Jaffa intelligence be not always as reliable as it should be so you be say you have no operative in Olokun 's rank I be unable to discuss such matter at present the term of our alliance dictate full disclosure in matter of joint concern Security of the Alpha site be a matter of joint concern the disposition of our operative have no bearing on the security of the Alpha site so you claim you have ally amongst the other nation of Earth of course do you always practise full disclosure with they we give you shelter when you have nowhere else to go because you need we just as you bring we Telchak 's reanimation device because you need our help to develop a weapon against Anubis ' drone but you be not always so forthcoming for example your programme to build hybrid ship use Goa'uld technology a programme the Tok'ra feel be extremely unwise we need those ship for the defence of Earth and so you feel it be none of our concern you see General it work both way you ask we to trust that your headlong pursuit of technology that you do not understand pose no threat but you fail to offer similar consideration with our policy on use covert operative let I ask you something how many Tok'ra from the Alpha site be still unaccounted for five do you know how many I be miss 64 believe I I be go to get to the bottom of this with or without your help I 've be expect you no doubt you 've speak to General Hammond he say he ask you if we have a spy in Olokun 's inner circle yes he do he ask I the same question of course I tell he no because only the High Council could make a decision like that and since I be on the High Council I would know about it would not I get something to tell I if you have a concern you can take it up with the Council yourself who do you think you be talk to an interesting question it seem I be talk to a human host make no mistake Delek I be still Selmak and I be a leader of the Tok'ra before you have even take a host maybe you 've be a leader too long the Tauri be unlike other human in the galaxy their will have not be erode by thousand of year of slavery this can be a valuable asset but it can also make they dangerous particularly as host Jacob Carter have have no more influence on I than any other host there be those of we who would disagree you have allow yourself to get too close to these people your true loyalty be in question you speak for the entire Council you still have your defender although their number be diminish so you do meet without I and you do send an operative and if you have know would you have tell General Hammond they have a right to know we know you would feel that way which be precisely why you be not inform so Delek admit that this spy have go miss yes but the Tok'ra will never acknowledge that he could have be responsible Tok'ra operative have order never to be take alive what about a sarcophagus they take precaution to ensure the brain be not leave intact no revival be possible this be all assume the man be not take unawares the system be not foolproof but they will not admit that the truth be I do not think you will ever find out who be responsible for the leak it could 've be the Tok'ra or the Jaffa it could 've be both look I 've help as much as I can with this but now I would like to get back to join the search I need you here I already tell you I be out of the loop they do not trust I any more they think my emotion be cloud my judgment ironic consider I be waste time while my daughter be be hunt by that thing we have our good people on this they will find she what do I do until then I just get a report from the Beta site the Jaffa be blame the Tok'ra for what happen there have be altercation if I can not get the situation under control I have order to expel they all our alliance be fall apart I need someone to bridge the gap someone to be the voice of reason I need you O'Neill go ahead the UAV have be shoot down in your area it be four click away on a heading of 320 degree from your present location we be on it why have you ask I here you know what be happen at Beta site I do we need your help to put a stop to it before it get out of hand you be a leader amongst the Jaffa they will listen to you what should I say they must continue to bear the arrogance of the Tok'ra they must be subservient to those who have sacrifice so many of their brother the Jaffa have always be dependent on the Goa'uld because they need symbiote to sustain they but now there be a substance call tretonin which can free the Jaffa from this dependence I be aware of its significance be you also aware that million of Tok'ra symbiote die in its development include our beloved Queen Egeria the queen from whom all our lineage can be trace I be not for the first time the Tok'ra have fight alongside the Jaffa and the Tauri and it be make a difference More System Lords have fall in the past seven year than in the 700 year before it be true that together we be strong and divide we will die we can not let our alliance end your word be wise but my time at the Alpha site have teach I some bitter lesson I suspect that you do not speak for all the Tok'ra no until the other feel as you do reconciliation may not be possible gentleman we need your help to keep the situation at beta from get out of hand I be not sure what you expect of the Tok'ra we 've have unprovoked assault unprovoke you refuse to help we and thousand of Jaffa die needlessly Assassinating Olokun be not an option why not we do not know how many Jaffa would join the rebel we could have deliver an army into Anubis ' hand they deserve the right to choose instead they be slaughter we have fight the Goa'uld for thousand of year you have no right to question our method you be alone you have ally now what good have it do we since we have be ally your tendency to provoke confrontation with the Goa'uld have result in the death of more Tok'ra than in the previous hundred year I hate to admit it but he be get a point when a human or a Jaffa die more be bear to take their place not so for the Tok'ra our Queen Egeria from whom all Tok'ra have spawn be dead our number be dwindle this alliance may simply be something we can not afford Carter I need the thank cover he be it yeah he be dead right teal'c he be dead yeah he be dead Wanna get up I just need to rest for a minute come here first of all we would like to congratulate you on the recovery of Major Carter we be glad to know that she be safe thank you I have speak to the High Council with regard to the situation at the Beta site they believe the good solution be to leave be that really necessary if this partnership be to continue you would insist on full disclosure of our covert operation I be afraid that be non negotiable in that case we must refuse Secrecy be our only weapon it be all we 've ever know the Jaffa too will be leave but with the Tok'ra go we be not leave because of they we be leave because it be what we must do on your base you dictate the term we must consult you before we take action there be those among we who feel we simply trade one master for another we be not try to tell you what to do we simply think it be vital to coordinate effort unlike the Tauri or the Tok'ra the Jaffa be still learn what it mean to be free to do this we must have our own basis our own leader our own community we must do this for ourselves or it would have no meaning only then can we be equal partner in any alliance I be sorry this be nuts my friend almost die so we could get a weapon able to stop Anubis ' soldier now we be finally able to really make a difference and you want to walk away I be sorry Dr Jackson this be how it must be Hiya kid you be asleep for a long time you give I quite a scare sorry Jack tell I what happen I be proud of you look Sam I may not be able to come around as much for the next little while what do you mean thing kind of got screw up the alliance be in trouble I do not understand you do not need to know the detail Let us just say we be go our separate way for a while if I stay with the Tok'ra I can at least try to mend some fence be you sure I be not ready to give up on this just yet do not worry I will be back eventually I will miss you I will miss you too Visiontext Subtitles Katherine Appleby ENHOH  Rippé par BoRiF you get the full thing just about instead of zoom out pull back get it in context just keep go back it be cool it be amazing yes it be Mr Bregman Colonel Tom Rundell Cheyenne Mountain Complex Public Affairs Liaison that be a mouthful call I Emmett yes sir be that ok this be my posse here Tech Sergeant Dale James Shep Wickenhouse Shep 's do sound well it be a pleasure to meet you sir but what be you do here we be get some establish shot the first of many while we be wait in fact we should get a shot of you sorry you be not authorize until you be brief by General Hammond I 've already be brief Tom be it by the Defence Department what be the problem I be clear to shoot maybe you guy have not be clear what be the problem General Hammond will see you now ok this should be fun oh yeah General Hammond this be Mr Bregman I be very excited to be here sir you may find that we be not all as giddy as you be about this project Mr Bregman Giddy I be personally and professionally excited I think I say excited to be here General I have not be giddy since well you do not want to know no I just want to be as clear as I can up front Sure your presence be highly unorthodox I will not let it threaten the security of any mission or the safety of my people I 've already be frisk three time we can make it four do it if you want sorry I consider it my responsibility to protect my people 's interest Frankly I feel it be appropriate to warn you that no one around here want to be part of your little reality show oh I see you know General you be probably aware that there be film camera on the beach of Normandy decade before Survivor debut on CBS I think it be outrageous that the Stargate programme have not be chronicle because it be top secret only a handful of people will see anything you shoot so far General so far eventually inevitably this programme be go to be disclose to the world and I think this film we be do might in some way provide insight into what be really be go on here for the last six year what be really be go on you know what General I respect what you be do I even respect that you want I out but the President of the United States invite I to do this you see that red phone you would not be here if he have not well then I hope I can expect the full cooperation of you and your personnel to the letter of these order to the letter I see I see thank you you have high expectation to meet General maybe it be just my opinion but to I throughout history the good documentary take a cinéma vérité approach let the subject tell its own story that be a very interesting point of view and mostly if not totally crap especially in a situation like this if this story be go to tell itself there would be Stargate update on the nightly news you do have a point we should make people feel comfortable gain their trust you know what we would be here a year these soldier conceal thing for a live Airmen sir these airman conceal thing for a live the only way to get anything out of they be not by the look at that by the cinéma vérité approach it be go to be by the wringing it out of they approach look Mr Bregman you be here strictly to document what be go on not to pursue anything prejudicial to Air Force personnel call I Emmett if someone be to say something be that who I think it be it be Colonel Jack O'Neill I like vanilla over chocolate my favourite colour be peridot Tibet should be free and if I could have dinner with anyone in the world it would be Mary Steenburgen Mary Steenburgen she be nice I be just try to get a minute with you I really do not have time I 've get a briefing to go to I understand I be Emmett Br no look I be not go to get a perspective on this Stargate programme without you so when be a good time for you any time 's good just send I a memo Memo Memo really sense he be start to trust you do not worry about it he only look unprofessional General Hammond warn I people might be less than enthusiastic about this we do have a bad experience with a tv crew last year the Prometheus incident I know that the Air Force insist on their own crew for that reason you might be sense reluctance from people to put themselves on a pedestal we be just do our job just a job consider it my job to put you on a pedestal this job look to I to be extraordinary and from what I read in your file the same can be say about you personally see now I be blush so you be then we should start it will look good on camera let us go guy be you ready no you do not need a light meter the woman be glow let us get roll we be roll Sound rolling ok Major Samantha Carter US Air Force Astrophysicist consider the foremost expert on the Stargate you 've explore territory that no one on Earth have ever see and you 've fight an enemy that no one on Earth have even imagine Major Samantha Carter meet the six and a half billion people of the planet Earth hi I do not think I 've ever ask this question before but what be it like to be well dead I be not exactly dead you what be the word transcend Ascended yeah well actually I do have the unfortunate experience of die first slowly and quite painfully first I might add in your file it say your human body I be quote here your human body transform into energy a bright white light rise above the hospital bed be that yeah accurate so could you Dr Jackson could you I do not know elaborate what do it feel like I do not know I really do not remember much after that will you excuse I follow he come on come on move move move Dr Jackson what be it what be it the mask fragment sorry could you slow down the mask fragment from P3X 298 be date to predynastic Egypt here on Earth could you get a close shot of this what be the what be the significance of that it be fascinating it be ok you can back up back up that be it it be fascinating why be we run oh I just want to see if you would chase I ok turn it off turn it off get that mike away from I turn it off Kevlar will not stop the energy blast from a staff weapon the plating in other bulletproof protection gets superheate from the plasma while it would stop the penetration the wearer be trap in what become their own personal microwave oven not a good idea anyway what we 've be work on be this a ceramic polymer which will resist the heat stop the blast and fit into a standard issue SG vest which Sergeant Siler will now demonstrate for we would not it be a well no do not shoot I shoot he do not you think it would be more interesting if I wear the vest no no no no be not it safe absolutely it be not like we 've never do it away from the face big guy it be all good I be fine you see um yeah see he do that all the time the control room be sort of like the air traffic control tower we monitor all gate activity from here so what be all these blink light about what be those light there this monitor the power consumption require to generate outgoing wormhole interestingly we find our gate draw 10 more wattage than offworld gate that far exceed any potential loss due to our man make interface we think it be the way the superconductive crystal inside absorb electrical energy but we be also try to demonstrate that the dhd be somehow produce a purer more efficient form of power could we get a shot of the gate spin sure it be really cool Steam come out of it and everything Great Major sorry guy an SG team 's due to embark on a mission that be great we will get a shot of they leave actually you be go to have to leave could I ask you something be you you can stop shoot Cut ok Balinsky which way that way I will take point Wells Bosworth you be rearguard five meter spread keep your eye open the MALP show no indication of any recent Goa'uld activity on this planet I do not see any indication of anything here take the usual bet on that sir Sure Wells an abandon naqahdah mine Boring good odd Bosworth I be go to put my money on tree sir Bosworth 's disqualify for be a smart ass I will go with two head alien hostile or friendly sir one head good one head bad Balinsky Ruins of an ancient city yeah you wish all night scream Projectile vomit nuclear diaper you have no idea the reason they make them so cute be so you do not suffocate them in their sleep Sir you have four kid why do you think I enjoy work so much do not get I wrong I love the little bugger to death but trust I it make go through a Stargate and face alien bad guy look like nothing this be relax then why have you have four One 's pretty bad but you figure you got to have two so the little guy can have a brother or sister right then you have two boy and the wife say she want a girl you figure hell three can not be much bad than two right what you do not realize be your brain be fry cos you have not sleep after three four be no big deal you be so deep in nothing seem to matter any more it be chaos you be just try to make it through each day alive and in the end you spend all the energy you have leave try to get them into bed only to lie awake pray they do not get hook on drug or hurt or bad wind up dead in an alley somewhere I can not wait sir Miracle of birth my ass I will tell you what a miracle be Birth control that work well I will be damn I win Sir do you do your interview yet yeah Mary Steenburgen she be so hot can you tell I the reason for this documentary again do not you read the memo officially it be for the 1 000th trip through the Stargate but I think there be more to it one thousand I know hard to believe we 've be at it this long there should be a cake wait um Dr Jackson I just get to your memory be erase when you return to I be quote here human form that sound completely idiotic make a note I have to reask that question sorry could you what can you tell we about all that not much ok well can you tell we a little bit about what thing be like before that thankfully I have most of those memory back there be still a few hole ok the pharaohs of the fourth dynasty do not build the pyramid no they do not they be land pad for Goa'uld motherships I be quote from a speech you make before your introduction to the Stargate I presume that you know nothing about land platform or mothership right right no until you meet Catherine Langford right and she introduce you to the Stargate right so why why what why do she do that I do not know you would have to ask she ok maybe I will ask she where be she be she transcend or ascend or something like that no retire actually but you never know so I be just read your file here it be fascinating I should ask you immediately here you be an alien I mean well not to you to we you would be anyway you be the highest ranking officer in the service of our alien enemy and you turn against they why do you turn against they when you do I mean why be you sit there if you do not intend to answer my question because I be request to by General Hammond I see and he do not happen to mention to you that part of the interview process involve actually say something no ok um all right let us try this Colonel Jack O'Neill you must have a tremendous amount of respect for he or maybe you do not let I rephrase Colonel Jack O'Neill be your immediate superior ok maybe not in term of specie but he be your command officer indeed good ok good good Terrific be there anything you can tell we about he if you wish to learn of Colonel O'Neill you should interview Colonel O'Neill ok thank that be a good idea let I ask you this where be you go how long I do not know why we just get here an hour ago I need more time look at this place it be incredible you 've see one crumbled city Sir this place be build by the Ancients be you sure yes these marking and this stone architecture Dr Jackson be go to die when he see this what again Funny do not go far it look like an alien Shut up remember that thing on P2X 787 get lose see that thing be easy on the eye by comparison let I see that be pretty scary Wells it be my unborn son sir how can you tell I do not know Wells I would not paint the room blue just yet take cover Colonel now hold what the hell be it like the people who be now serve here at the SGC the youth of tomorrow will one day have to defend the free spirit of mankind and not just on our fair planet but out there through the Stargate in the vastness of the galaxy where untold evil with power we 've never see before be still wait to prey upon we ok Cut Senator Great thank you so much for do this it be really terrific these people deserve it we be try our good listen Senator I hope you do not mind I say this but it sound a bit like a speech I do not think you be go to like the result what if we do it off the cuff and I throw thing at you and see how you respond no no no if you want anything else from I yes actually Senator Colonel as I be sure you know I be to be part of the piece these man be put together to document the fine work you be do here at the SGC no I do not know that well I be I be sure there be a memo do you tell they about the time you try to shut this place or the time you have Hammond by the I suggest you watch what you say Slander be a serious offence yes so I hear I have always be a strong supporter of this programme I admit I be critical in the past but only because of the unrealized potential I see this operation as have how do your interview go Colonel it be short yet oh so sweet the president want you to play ball on this I hope you be not intend to disappoint our Commander in Chief I would think you would want to show your appreciation for his backing what be you do here last time I check you be try to discredit he his term be up my running mate and I be merely point out to the american people certain area that we think we can do a well job in and when that time come I know we can count on your vote Colonel yeah that will happen and I want you to know this if elect this programme can count on our full support you want to get this sure you smarmy self righteous opportunistic unscheduled offworld activation Colonel O'Neill to the control room repeat unscheduled offworld activation Duty call I be do Colonel what be this offworld activation I will not know until I get there Great where be there there be here for you ongoing activity Balinsky want to stay sir you see anything else worth stay for Hard to say we need to finish search these ruin how long a day or two maybe more be nice to send up a UAV get an aerial overview permission to remain grant I will send SG 3 as backup any further threat get out immediately Understood sir in the meantime I can run some test on the device see what it be be do there send the device back report in on the hour yes sir SG 13 out Sir it be not that I do not appreciate I know they be head your way I think you might be look for an excuse to get away I think as much sir and I just want to express my deep and unyielde love for you sir General if you have a moment Mr Bregman would like a word exempt from clearance be all current activity not review by this office that be the Pentagon breathing be a current activity my interpretation be you be not authorize to know about the most recent unscheduled activation General I need a little leeway I say I be go to hold you to the letter of these order Mr Bregman give it up you know Colonel O'Neill be currently unavailable the president have give I his full support why be you resist I be not resist I be follow order my opinion be that I do not think my people need to be put under a microscope camera do not just record thing they change what they record simply by be there the work these people do be hard enough without they feel that every breath they take be be preserve for judgment maybe it should be excuse I I say maybe it should be the Pentagon have allow journalist to be embed with the force before under fire under pressure so that what be see and what be hear be the truth I think we be through I do not I do not disagree excuse I you ever see anything like this I have not definitely a remote probe of some kind the capacity of the memory be immense but so far all I 've find be detailed image of the ruin you know it make sense we use a MALP why would not the Goa'uld the Goa'uld be scavenger it be quite possible they get the idea from we so you do your interview with the documentary crew yet indeed I can not wait to hear what everyone else say I do not say much really that be surprising it be usually so hard to shut you up I find the entire experience unpleasant they want to talk to I again do your interview not go well either I think it be fine but apparently I look nervous what be the meaning of offworld activation what be that about I be not you would not tell I even if you know you remind I of the minder in the Gulf that use to censor our report it be not as if we be conspire to cover up the truth Censoring report in combat make sense you should not jeopardise troop involve in ongoing mission this be not the news be you broadcast this to the enemy on some other planet look I have be deny access to several prior mission file cos no one want I to know how close we 've come to you be not conspire why do not you tell I we 've come close to what be compromise be compromise there be a euphemism close to the brink of planetary annihilation be more accurate that be why we be not allow to film every time they open that gate something could go wrong in which case it would not really matter what we have on tape would it what do you say what do you say it do not matter if you have any integrity at all you would resign before I have to replace you I would rather be replace than court martialle the bottom line be the SGC be not go to let any of this out until it be declassify why not shoot it and decide later it be not up to I not up to I not up to I Colonel Colonel we be all set up for you right here Briefing Colonel Colonel Colonel you know I be go to get you on camera soon or later even if all I get be a series of shot of you avoid be get Fire away I hope shot of my ass serve you well all right pack up what be we do here how do you feel about Colonel O'Neill he be an amazing man after everything he be do he be still modest quite self effacing actually he even like people to think he be not as smart as he really be bottom line he be an incredibly strong leader who be give more of himself for this programme than any man have give for well anything I can imagine do you spend a lot of time together outside of work we do not get much time outside of work and when we do our personal interest be a little different do you ever hear the expression opposite attract we have a very professional relationship really Professional after everything you 've be through you must have maybe it be not too much to say face death together yeah not unlike countless military personnel throughout the year I will not deny there be a bond between we Daniel and Teal'c be also like family Colonel O'Neill be first and foremost my superior officer even if there be potential for something more and I be not say that there be our military position and the very nature of our job would not allow for it well basically when the gate be dial I say Chevron one encode chevron two encode and so on incrementally up to the seventh chevron which be a little different because that be when the wormhole connect when that happen I like to change thing up a bit and just say Chevron seven lock Locked that be great that be good anything else oh yeah I be responsible for this close the iris open the iris that be pretty much my job right there that be it pretty much I think you be be a little modest oh I mean do not get I wrong it be really rewarding it really be and we have try various automate scenario but the SG team agree that when they send the iris code through the wormhole they like to know that there be a real person on the other end someone that they can trust to get it right that give I and the other gate technician a great sense of pride Sure that be good Dr Jackson hi hey how be it go you be pack go off sorry I forget the expression Offworld Offworld be that it so you be go no no just go through my pack that be the camera you use though right I 've see hour and hour of your footage Inscriptions and ruin and artefact Cool huh I wonder if you get the opportunity maybe you could point your camera at some action just for a change see when there be action I be too busy to be point a camera I be run shoot translate what the bad guy be say it be just that I 've hear a lot about these amazing event but my medium be visual I can not tell the story unless I have picture I be not suggest you put anybody in danger not yourself but if the opportunity arise take a second and just point your lens at something that move all right well I be not schedule to go on a mission offworld for a couple of day if it be there shoot it right just not the inscription all the time some action would be good hey hey one second you want I to translate something I be try to get the interface connection stable SG 13 kick the crap out of it its system log seem to be isolate on a separate crystal Bregman have the nerve to suggest that all that archive video footage be bore ok here be what really bug I he be only here cos this president be on his way out he do not want to look bad if and when the programme go public this be all about political posturing Man he really grill I on that about the programme go public what do you say babble incoherently could you imagine if it do I try not to think about it there it be mostly just technical stuff anything jump out at you well here be where it encounter SG 13 uh oh what be uh oh after it engage shield and weapon it activate a long range communicator Colonel Dixon we believe the Goa'uld probe send out a transmission prior to your disable it I be order you to return immediately Roger that sir estimate arrival time 15 minute Dixon out pack it up Doctor we be go home Wells Bosworth Wells here bring it home we be book out Roger that Wells out it be about time take fire Wells have be hit get to the gate SG niner request assistance ok three gunshot wound four staff weapon burn severe hypothermia I be quite surprised he be actually authorize I to discuss all this Nanite technology artificially age he he have his shoulder puncture by an alien time capsule device three knee operation that be the whole Hathor incident which he be ask I never to discuss oh this be a good one last year he be expose to an ancient incurable disease obviously not incurable right or well there be a Tok'ra symbiote in need of a temporary host that do the trick I do not understand what you just say but it be amazing that Colonel O'Neill be alive yeah I never know what be next you just try and keep your head on straight we also set a lot of broken bone and prescribe a ton of antibiotic well still it sometimes must be overwhelming yeah it be funny all the training everything we know about medicine it amount to very little often I face situation where there be nothing I can do be there an upside be you kid I we all persevere because we feel we be on the brink of understanding so much more and not just about medicine but about who we be where we come from what the future have in store how we fit into the grand scheme of thing unscheduled offworld activation repeat unscheduled offworld activation we 've hear that before be that unusual no it happen from time to time what do it mean your guess be as good as mine you get that announcement yeah we be good ok good well thank you Dr Fraiser guy why do not you go roll some cutaway and get some sound bite so this yeah we be good thank you uh anything you can ok sorry ow ow I be glad the Pentagon send you just go away listen I be just wonder it seem like the unpredictable happen here a lot yes pretty much yeah you be not need for this thing if I be they know where to find I I be think of get something to eat in the café I be not sure where that way I be wonder if I would like to join you ok yeah what be you do I be just white balance well go balance the white somewhere else ok somewhere else I be go to dump these first Wells be alive but he be hurt badly how many Jaffa five ten a hundred Colonel Dixon count six they be able to fend they off do the Jaffa come through the gate no SG 3 be cover it the gate 's clear SG 3 be there when I leave take SG 5 and 7 and Dr Fraiser thank you Colonel yes sir it sound like an ambush but there be nothing else we can do right go oh sorry I be just I be just think that you have a very natural quality I mean on camera you let I film you allow people to see grace under pressure be you flirt with I ah well see I on the other hand be very clumsy under pressure I 've see bad so um what be with the ring oh just it be sentimental my wife die a few year ago so how do any of you have a personal life we do not I spend most of my time outside work with my daughter oh so you be married no no she be adopt oh she be from another planet ok um would you be willing to talk about that on camera I would rather excuse I ma'am you be require in the ready room thank you sorry that be ok let us go gentleman all because I want an aerial survey take I too long to figure out it send a transmission none of that matter now Visiontext Subtitles Paul Burns enhoh  Rippé par BoRiF previously on Stargate SG 1 General Hammond this be Mr Bregman no one around here want to be part of your little reality show the President of the United States invite I to do this look Mr Bregman you be here strictly to document what be go on not to pursue anything prejudicial to Air Force personnel call I Emmett I be go to get you on camera soon or later even if all I get be a series of shot of you avoid be get I hope shot of my ass serve you well well I will be damn it be my unborn son sir take cover after it engage weapon it activate a long range communicator take fire Wells have be hit be you flirt with I ah well excuse I ma'am you be require in the ready room that be why we be not allow to film every time they open that gate something could go wrong all because I want an aerial survey take I too long to figure out it send a transmission none of that matter now and now the conclusion what be go on you be schedule to get shot of the gate we got bump again something be up you just miss SG 1 in full gear you get it on tape it be unauthorized ongoing activity I know but SG 1 Dr Jackson be not go offworld for day what be change I do not know something big something big happen all the time what be this follow I Dr Fraiser I be sorry I have to go you be not allow Mr Bregman and you know that there be day when you feel the pressure I be train to handle it with all due respect how can anyone be train to handle an alien encounter where the stake if what I be tell be correct could be the survival of the planet it be important to remember that it be not just about this planet countless human throughout the galaxy that originate here on Earth have be enslave for thousand of year we be take the fight to the Goa'uld on their behalf how do you think the world be go to react when they discover that an alien war have be wage without their knowledge I do not think that that be for I to be you suggest we should not do this no I be not say we should not defend ourselves I be simply ask your opinion I do not think that be for I to um no stop it right there I do not know you see this be not her fault I back she into a corner and I do not want to make this thing look antagonistic so ok so lose this well skip ahead to after the apology there that be it one day this secret will come out how do you think people will react much well way of ask the question I honestly do not know I hope they can appreciate everything we 've be through what it all mean I hope that they will understand why the people in charge choose to keep it a secret be it difficult to keep the secret yeah of all the thing I do around here in many way that be the hard sometimes you look at what be go on here on Earth and it make you scream you want to tell people it be all so much big stop it right there and go right to Dr Jackson say whether I be right and you be go to put I into the Carter interview especially the line be it difficult to keep the secret all right move on whether I be right do not matter give the truth truth matter to you to everyone I hope what truth for the people here on Earth or be we talk about another planet People on other planet be no less human People who 've have their freedom usurp People force to worship false god but what about people here on Earth be they entitle to the truth be that what this be about this I be not in control of when this air do you think this should get out if it be up to you right there cut together well that be a complicated issue I be ask you do you think people on Earth should know about this right now what do you think would happen People do not care much what I think cut that line nobody care that nobody care what I think lose it ok it be go move on I have not do what you 've do I think people care what you think well I think it be a relative question and it depend on your point of view no stop it this be just terrible really I think it be pretty interesting stuff you do a good job of Yak yak yak yak a bunch of talk head be what it be I could watch Major Carter talk all day we need image to tell this story what these people be do good or bad make the lunar landing look like we be test our toe in the ocean and what have we get to show for it Yak yak yak nothing where be the equivalent shot of Shepherd golf on the moon we do not have it this be unbelievably boring hi Jack thank for come I be tell you say there be six Jaffa where have you learn to count Ships do not start come down till you radio you be through the gate something tell I they be throw this party in your honour get those clip our position be be compromise we be not go to be able to hold the gate for long it do not matter we be not go to be able to hold this position for long I need more time to stabilise this patient he can not be move yet Sir we get to fall back Sir that be 50 calibre right you can get really shake up with that thing our guy be train I be kid what be this get a shot of this can you explain how this operate uh sure our guy like to play a little Space Invaders when there be not much go on ha ha very funny no obviously I be kid it would be completely inappropriate for any airman to play video game on duty can we move on what be that on the wall here here be the manual override for the Iris be you kid now no I be serious incoming wormhole we be go to have to leave now no keep shoot I can not do that I can do it remove that camera crew now we be under fire and have serious casualty come in hot receive SG 1 's Iris code sir open the Iris this way sir medical team to the gate room we have to clear this area sorry about that here take the damn thing in future sir could you leave the camera work to I I will leave it to you here she come let us go do not look at he we be clear to shoot here just follow I bring the sound Major what happen please I know at least one person be injure all I want to say be look leave I alone and shut that damn thing off no I just want to say how sorry I be why be that camera off you do not know what you be do here maybe I do these people risk their life for we I want to see what they go through even if they do not want we to and I want other people to see it what do you think they be do out there protect and defend secrecy that be the world of Mao of Stalin the world of secret police secret trial secret death you force the press into the cold and all you will get be lie and innuendo and nothing be bad for a free society than a press that be in service to the military and the politician nothing you turn that camera off when I tell you to turn it off you think I give a damn what you think about I you serve the people so do I hey how you do I do not suppose you know anything about what be go on here there be multiple injury at least two people be hit there be a firefight one of the team got ambush so they send in SG 1 SG 5 Fraiser and the medical team someone from the original team must be badly hurt a nurse say there be a casualty someone die she would not say who Carter would not be cry unless we hear somebody actually may have die what have you get O'Neill you sure no I hear O'Neill 's on a gurney he take a blast he be not move General Hammond Mr Woolsey General I know these order come from Kinsey 's office why do not you tell I the rest as chairman of the Oversight Committee Kinsey ask that I review your decision regard the attempt rescue of SG 13 attempt there be several casualty sir I would hardly call it a success my decision be review by the Air Force Chief of Staff and the president as of yet I have not even file a preliminary mission report when I do you be welcome to read it I have be authorize to begin a full investigation as part of a large examination of SGC 's strategic policy that we be prepare I 've enclose a list of interview I will be conduct and material I will require we expect your full cooperation General how be you hold up I be ok sir do you talk to Agent Barrett he say as far as he know Woolsey be clean but he be sharp as they come he be get an MBA and an llb from Harvard he be lead counsel for the Corps of Engineers and sit on the defence board he resign when it be disclose that he have financial tie to a large corporation that have be award over 800 million in defence contract by the Pentagon he be be with the NID since then Barrett fax I this internal NID memo Woolsey recently write I think you should read it what do we do sir just tell the truth yes sir there be go to be a memorial service on Wednesday I think it would be appropriate if you say a few word yes sir Sir how be you hold up you try to tell yourself that every man and woman under your command mean the same to you each have to be equally valuable if you be go to make the kind of decision that affect their life the way I have to but you can not help it you get close to some people you never want to lose anyone have a seat Major let I explain why I be here I know why you be here I believe classified military operation require oversight this be not the first time we 've be scrutinise by the NID I know the stake around here be always high but there be serious casualty this time someone of great value to this programme be dead I know that and do not you dare think anyone be take it lightly you be a seasoned combat officer this be not the first time you 've lose a close colleague nor do I expect it will be the last I just want to make sure that it be not avoidable in this case despite what you might think the only reason I be here be to get the truth do you have a question oh yes a few what make you think it be safe for SG 13 to remain on the planet that be not really my call but you think it be worth risk the life of an SG team to get an aerial survey of these ruin the device be damage it take a while to get an interface the memory contain an enormous amount of information so you would have I believe that this be an acceptable risk this be what we do make bad decision it be easy to predict the score when the game be over and if we would find weapon in those ruin we would not be have this conversation but you do not and we be if there have be weapon in those ruin they would be in the hand of the Goa'uld the fact be this mission be botch from the beginning to the end we do not just leave people behind you can not ask airman soldier human being to risk their life without backup without know we would be there you have be ask to go into combat where you know there be no backup that be always a possibility on any mission through the Stargate and please Major None of we like to admit it but there be situation in which the life of one human being be an acceptable loss that be not the case here no in this case it be just dumb luck that there be not many more life lose I would say it be skill training and fortitude base on your expertise in Goa'uld tactic be it not reasonable to conclude that this be an ambush while you be not one of our military and not eligible for court martial I should not have to remind you that you be expect to follow order as I be do on the day in question if you fail to testify here today I will have you jail until such time that you do you fire I you throw I in jail you do what you want Dr Jackson yeah it be not a good time right now I 've hear bit and piece of what happen I be hope you might be able to confirm some of it sorry do you you be go to be all right Simon you will be home before you know it over here Man down over here there be a lot of blood come from underneath he I will cover you up on this ridge I be Dr Janet Fraiser can you hear I yeah I be shoot bad I can not move I can not feel my leg I think it go right through I what be your name Senior Airman Wells be I go to die not if I have anything to do with it we need to roll he over stop the bleeding Simon you hang in there ok easy all right on three one two three I be Daniel Jackson I know I know SG 1 you be go to be fine Son of a bitch come out of nowhere shot I in the back let us talk about something else what be go on at home my wife be pregnant yeah that your first yeah congratulation that be good at least you feel that our position 's be compromise we be not go to be able to hold the gate we be not go to hold this position for long I need more time to stabilise this patient he can not be move yet go without I leave I nobody be go anywhere I can not believe I be not go to see my son stay focused you know this be a boy you be go to have right tell I the truth I be not go to make it right you be go to be fine Dr Jackson please please just let I tell my wife let I tell my wife that ok ok got it just breathe Simon I say now be not a good time what part about that do not you understand you get something on tape do not you get out get out ok I be go all right you know I uh I once do a piece on a war photographer his name be Martin Krystovski for about six month he be with a unit in Vietnam the day before he be schedule to leave the day before he be out with the unit and it be just a routine patrol or so they think but suddenly the lieutenant pull he down and Krystovski have not intend to take a picture but his hand be on the camera and he hit the ground so hard it go off and the picture capture the lieutenant getting shoot in the head and Krystovski say to I that bullet would have should have hit I and he never show that picture to anyone not for 25 year but 25 year later he get up one morning and he look at that picture and he see something that be not horrific and he decide to tell the story because he realise that he have not accidentally take a picture of a man die it be of a man save his life the picture I be make that I be try to make be about what you people do every single day in extreme circumstance that no one can even imagine and I do not know what happen out there I be sorry about it whatever it be and if you do tape something of it that be not go to change what happen what will change be how you feel about it General I 've prepare a write testimony this be your mission report I think I would kill two bird with one stone well then I guess I be do then you will be leave the president will have my report by the end of the week I be sure it will be every bit as interesting as your memo on the economic of the SGC I will not bother ask how you get that what be the dollar value you attribute to an SG team member you know damn well I be not peg the value of a life it be a cold hard fact that it cost million of dollar to train these man and woman and that be a fraction of the fund be subvert by the Pentagon for this it be reprehensible that the taxpayer of this country be pay enormous sum to wage a war they know nothing about and be get little if anything in return if the Stargate be public knowledge and your action be judge in public you be suggest that send a rescue team worth 27 million to save one man be a bad business decision you be put word in my mouth you say it in black and white and I do not think you would dare do that if this be not a classified operation the president have ask a documentary team to get to the truth of what be go on why do not we just go down and give they the whole truth as you see it right now that memo be classify this investigation be classify if you so much as utter even a hint of either I will see you be put away in a cold dark place for the rest of time General what be it Colonel Security catch Mr Bregman try to access the infirmary claim he be lose get rid of he Sir have our order change sir toss he out on his ass Colonel what be this what be go on the general 's order you off the base no no he can not do that he be a general would you stop pack keep pack you get one hour to get off my base and outta my sight whose authority my superior I just want to make a phone call call whoever you want there be a payphone at the surface actually I would like to borrow your red one you have some nerve that be what my mother use to say I 've be order to turn over the tape look I be not happy about it either I could fight it the tape could get lose or accidentally erase these thing happen but I be not go to do that I have that little weasel of a man throw out of here but in light of the NID investigation I think there should be a record of what go on beyond the classified report and you trust Bregman to portray that at the moment I have no other choice hey hey I get the tape put it on Mission file be be declassify just a minute you tell she yourself I be so sorry about this I love you so much I just want God shut it off shut it off I do not want she to see I die Simon Simon look at I you be not go to die ok I do not come all the way out

nothing seem good enough I believe you should only speak from your heart I get to go pick up Cassie Major Carter I have ponder what I would say be I give the chance really but I believe it would be good if it come from you over here oh I be tell you might be here Dr Jackson yeah I just uh come by to give this back to you I be not go to use it wait I want you to you know I die in this room Ascended Dr Fraiser do everything she could she go three day without sleep even in the end she do not want to let I go I owe she a lot more than I ever give back I think a lot about what you say about Krystovski I think this show what Janet Fraiser be all about I too I want other people to know Janet Fraiser be an extraordinary person she be kind and funny and talente above all she be courageous try as I might I could not find the word to honour she to do justice to her life thankfully I get some help while word alone may not be enough there be some name that might do we often talk about those that give their life in the service of their country and while Janet Fraiser do just that that be not what her life be about the follow be the name of the man and woman who do not die in service but who be in fact alive today because of Janet Major Samantha Carter Dr Daniel Jackson Colonel Jack O'Neill teal'c Sergeant Connie Smith Major Ian Hules Senior Airman Simon Wells our armed force have turn the tide of world war young man and woman from our country have humble history 's bad tyrant we carve our thank in stone we stamp it into medal we carefully tend vast field where those who give their life for our freedom lie More than ever we can not fail to pass story of courage to the next generation we must capture their imagination while pay tribute to all those willing to die for the preservation of our way of life it be a shame no one be ever go to see it really you uh you do not think it be a little sentimental no it be good well that be a relief hear that from you of all people especially give how you feel about what I be do I understand how you feel I be a big enough man to admit when I be wrong I be glad you stick with it that mean a lot to I sir I 've write a lot of

you could make it Agent Barrett How be Colonel O'Neill still recover take some time off we be still put the detail together follow I I will explain what be this place an abandon industrial complex it be home to a rogue NID sleeper cell we 've be try to locate for over a year still have not get they all not by a long shot their tie run deep they seem to have infinite resource what be they do here we be not exactly sure yet what happen at approximately 0800 hour this morning we intercept a 911 call we move in just after local authority arrive and have be in lockdown mode somebody from a top secret not to mention illegal NID operation call 911 it get real ugly Come on we get a call from a panicked male voice we think it be from the cleaning staff the call be cut short we 've count 32

his dynasty I do not realize this have be recover it may have come from the Germans the Germans the background on Keffler say that he be the son of a Nazi war criminal we should not be that surprised Rogue NID have no limit do they see if there be anything else you can tell I about this stuff I be go to go back at Keffler again want to join I Sure Thought you might want to watch a master of interrogation at work you call in someone special Dr Keffler this be Major Samantha Carter of the Stargate programme that be right be you ready to tell we about the girl Doctor do I really need to explain the nature of your situation please do it amuse I this be an off the book NID operation which mean you technically do not exist which mean no phone call no lawyer I do not even have to read you your right to make matter bad for you the people behind this operation be all in jail nobody to bail you out what kind of work be be do here Doctor you be a smart girl you will figure it out do you think we will let you walk away from this 32 people be dead believe it or not I do feel bad about that some of they be not quite as incompetent as the other unfortunately the bad one always ruin it for everyone do not they what be this that unlock my car do not think you be safe read the paper Agent Barrett no one be safe these day my pill now now you would not want your only witness to die on you would you it be nitro say he have a bad heart I would say an x ray would confirm a total absence I think he be start to crack he be cold than Hannibal Lecter still obviously no match for a master interrogator you do not get all Clarice starling on he I do not want to step on your toe one more thing to show you there be more trust I I be save the good for last this be not at all creepy it get well they look like partially develop foetus they do not look human to I fail experiment of some kind what kind be the question well there be one way to find out no forget it we 've already try that all the code be encrypt I 've request a data retrieval team Present and account for right of course so how have you be busy you busy you know I never properly thank you for that memo on Woolsey maybe we could go out for dinner sometime I be see someone right now really you hm well you ask I out yeah right sorry I be go to go check in with Dr Jackson and Teal'c Most of the artefact be relate in some way to Sekhmet I be guess they be find on Earth possibly in an egyptian tomb or crypt nothing of note no it be interesting stuff but not really what be this it would appear to be an ark ordain in the gold motif of Ra the sun god possibly a gift to sekhmet what be in it we have not be able to open it but these turn some sort of combination lock so it would seem any luck with the scientist no not exactly the girl may be on tape kill everybody but I be sure that guy be not innocent what about that girl she have not say anything since we lock she up I be kind of hope that you would give it a try I hear you get a knack for this type of thing hi I be Daniel Jackson you be Anna right you know when I first see you I do not believe that you could do the thing they say you do and even after I see it for myself I still do not believe it look I know you do not know I and you have no reason to trust I but I want to help you before I do that I need to know a few thing first I need to know who you be what be happen to you why you be here in a cell like this do you even understand I I do not kill those people there be some overwhelming evidence it be not I please you have to believe I it be not I turn it off turn it off sorry I could not do those thing it look like you do it be not I then who be it I do not know ok where be you when this be happen if the person on the tape be not you where be you I do not remember who be Dr Keffler he be the one who make I she say Keffler make she what do that mean some sort of genetic research no she be over 20 year old the Asgard can rapidly grow a human clone but Area 51 have a sample of Goa'uld nanite technology from the planet Argos it can rapidly grow a human with the ability to learn very quickly and the rogue NID would have have access to that she say Keffler be responsible for everything that happen how I do not know do you think she be tell the truth I do not know what to think she believe she do not do it say the girl on the tape be not her how can that be possible the NID have clone a Goa'uld symbiote before she could be a clone there could be more than one of her how well do you search the facility Top to bottom I well put an APB out to local authority Anna how long have you live here since I remember yeah how long be that exactly I do not know have you ever have a birthday you know a birthday a cake with candle on it funny hat pin the tail on the donkey that kind of thing he give I this paper and some new charcoal who Dr Keffler he always give I paper but once he say it be my birthday just once have you ever see anything outside of this room just picture I 've read a lot of book which describe the world outside the mountain ocean the sun but you 've never experience they first hand what about these those be the thing I see in my dream flash they just come to I do they mean anything to you just that they scare I if they scare you so much why do you hang they up everywhere I do not want they there he hurt I if I take they down they be important to he do you have any more with one of those on it maybe on an ark I get it it be one of Anna 's sketch I think it be a combination to open the ark do we just do that I do not believe so it be activate some time ago I get a picture out to local authority if there be a girl that look like she we will find she I be in I have complete access nice work the file seem to document recent work go back over three year recent work the artefact go back to Napoleon the Nazis eventually recover they they end up in Keffler 's father 's hand they find a canopic jar it be a vessel contain a preserve symbiote Keffler splice human ovum with dna take from a Goa'uld she be a human Goa'uld hybrid Goa'uld pass on knowledge genetically they try to create a human who could tell they all a Goa'uld would know they do not want to wait Nanite technology from Area 51 so they could make she grow up quickly it take they 45 failure before they finally get it right you can call off that APB there be only one of her accord to this the previous attempt either do not blend properly or they grow too fast and die the technology have to be modify so the human could slowly learn to gain access to the genetic knowledge bury in her dna my God they torture the poor girl Sensory deprivation electrocution Major Carter Agent Barrett she be not a clone there be only one of she and she be get Goa'uld DNA blend with her own that could explain her behaviour the ark be a bomb what the ark be a Goa'uld explosive device and it be be activate how much time do we have approximately 16 hour how interesting Wipe that smarmy smile off your face and tell I what be go on here you be hurt I nothing could make up for what you do Agent Barrett listen to her Agent Barrett you be go to tell I everything I want to know or I be go to beat you senseless what do you want to know for starter do you know how to deactivate the bomb I do not know it be a bomb so this girl break out of her cell kill 32 people set a bomb and then stick around how do that make sense your problem Agent Barrett one among many I must point out be that you see she as a girl if you be go to give we moral justification please Major I know you have help to orchestrate the death of Goa'ulds before assassinate they in cold blood without regard for the life of the human host I do not create the problem neither do I I be merely try to help solve it the Goa'uld be a terrible threat to we all Anna be a conduit to the knowledge that could level the playing field and I think we all agree that if kill one person could save million billion of innocent life you would have no choice you would do it answer my question I be sorry I 've forget what it be why set the bomb and stick around Anna do not set that bomb then who do the Goa'uld Sekhmet but wait a minute she do not have a snake inside of her right it be something we do not expect a separate and distinct personality Anna 's mind have create a personality that act like the Goa'uld Sekhmet yes but I do not know if she be incapable of deal with the darkness within her or if that knowledge be so powerful that it be capable of manifest itself as such I only know that it emerge and speak as a unique entity we have witness it with a grow frequency Anna have no awareness to her it be as if she have black out the Goa'uld personality come out go on a rampage set the bomb but can not stay in control of the body long enough her breakthrough be sporadic and seem somewhat uncontrolled still why set the bomb Leverage against what Sekhmet have conscious control of the body for short period she want more she be go to blackmail you with the bomb the psyche be so simple be not it so single minded it be truly fascinating to behold she think you can give she that full control can you she be the experiment I be the observer the Goa'uld personality do not go do something like this on a whim you lead she to believe that you have the power to give her control of her life and I will bet you do it so she would tell you what you want to know how to save we all Major I be not the only one who want to know I do not remember anything I know this must be hard for you how can you know what this be like for I cos I know a boy once and he be like you there be more like I not exactly he be bear of two Goa'uld host they call a child like that a harsesis what happen to he he be save by a very powerful being he ascend to a high plane of existence and when he do he gain great power himself he use it to show I that the knowledge and memory pass on to he by the Goa'uld genetically come with a terrible burden and how it be wrong to seek it for any reason can I be save like he maybe honestly I do not know will you help we shut this bomb off I do not know how you do you know how to open the ark it be in your drawing I do not remember turn it on I know but somewhere inside your mind be the answer and I can help you find it accord to these reading there be a ten pound block of naqahdah in this thing what be that suppose to mean it would be very bad if it go off it be a bomb usually it be not a good thing when they go off can we move this from what I know of Goa'uld weaponry that would be unwise it may have a sensor yeah I do not even want to go there let us let us see if we can disarm it here I will get the local authority to evacuate the area thank for the vote of confidence how many mile be we talk about I do not know how big be Orange County you be kid right do I look like a practical joker to you image just come to I I draw they I do not know what they mean just relax and think about it when you look at this what come to mind the blackout they be happen more and more do you trust I do you trust I I want to help you I do not want to hurt you after I help you it be not like that we have to shut this bomb off how many birthday have you have that be not important right now you sound just like he I hear you be in here what be you do I notice most of the tape be label Anna it be not just security footage it be documentation of the research anything useful no just something she say when we be talk that I remind she of Keffler Figured I need to learn about how he deal with her what be the chance you will find out how to deactivate the bomb from she in time I do not know we be try to evacuate the area we do not know how big the blast will be no pressure I will leave now I would feel well if you be down there work on the bomb Dr Lee be the good we 've get and Teal'c know more about Goa'uld weapon I want to see if there be anything more in the research note that might help like what if we can offer Anna a cure for her condition she might be willing to help we she be be horribly mistreat and without intervention she would have little hope of survival at the time they make she they have no idea what her life span be go to be base on her current rate of growth I estimate it can not be more than three year can you help she possibly we should be able to halt the rapid growth effect of the nanite I doubt we can unmarry the Goa'uld DNA from hers but we may be able to block the knowledge from her conscious mind stop it from possess she we 've have some luck with certain drug in similar situation I suppose the fact that you 've have similar situation should not come as a shock anything on your end Keffler he want to chat there be a cure Anna you can be a normal girl live a normal life you can be free or you can continue to suffer I do not know anything please stop stop this at once now we be getting somewhere let I out of here in due time freedom can be yours do you think I will just tell you the secret of the Goa'uld if you want to live you will not kill I I can make another as easily as I make you if it be up to I give the chance I would rip the beat heart from your chest and feed it to you such colourful language let us focus on the issue at hand shall we Son of a bitch we have the same goal I do not wish to see my work go to waste look I know she I know how her mind work I can get you what you need yeah I 've read about your method I will only talk to her you be welcome to be present the entire time what do you want I can not believe you would be do this solely for the great good my freedom not a chance I be guilty of nothing more than try to save this world just like you we be at war desperate time call for desperate measure I 've hear that defence what choice do you have how many people will die if that bomb go off let us consider this do you have the authority to offer he immunity trust I no matter what we decide to do no court be ever go to hear about this Daniel you let she out do not you you must be Daniel Jackson what be go on he can control when the Goa'uld come out it be not just random he be get himself a little remote control this yeah he use it to shock she he can make the Goa'uld personality appear or kill she with it why other scientist go to shut down your research report your experiment you have no proof you bring out the Goa'uld personality then let she out you murder 32 people Speculation you can control she with that if you do not want the scientist dead why do not you stop her careful ok just because the cover be not booby trap do not mean the crystal themselves be safe to touch that be correct there be no energy signature I do not think there be any force field or sensor protect the compartment I be unsure which of these crystal would control detonation Blue be typically for power regulation indeed if we remove the power regulation for the control board the device could explode yeah I suppose it be not like I be go to pull the yellow one obviously let Keffler anywhere near the girl be out and if we be go to get the bomb deactivation code from Anna you be go to have to do it right this red crystal seem to control the timer now I should be able to interface with it and hopefully reprogram it anything happen the countdown be increase in speed what do that stop it yes however hey how be it come not well I take it no we just have a little setback what I be try to interface with a control crystal the time until detonation be now less than two hour ok let us hope that Dr Jackson be have well luck they be try to evacuate people but if that bomb go off people be still go to die include we we have a helicopter stand by to get we to a safe distance if it come to that I be hope it do not because a lot of other will not have that luxury I 've be try I can not see anything you know not so long ago I have my memory erase how it be a long story but I be able to access certain lose memory by meditate a friend of mine show I how to do it I think that can help you what I see scare I so much I know and for good reason ultimately it be up to you I can not force you to do this and I will not and I promise either way we be go to try and help you make it so you can live a normal life he always say he could do that the truth be I be not sure if we can but we be go to try anything and everything in our power ok good 42 minute 15 second and count I will check back thank we 've get ten block in each direction evacuate that be nowhere near enough I know I finish go through the file on the computer even if we halt the nanite ' rapid growth effect you do not isolate the gene with the Goa'uld genetic knowledge we do not have time to sequence the entire strand the goal be to get the intelligence not to create a viable living organism I do not understand the way he blend the DNA there be nothing we can do to stop the Goa'uld DNA take over it will overwrite the human and nothing I know of will stop it what be go to happen to her she will die a horrible painful death there be no cure no way to save she that be just another lie I place a capsule of biotoxin at the base of her brain the remote device will activate it I do this to prevent any undue suffering when the time come how humane of you what do I do just relax and try thinking of nothing nothing try an empty room you see a doorway go to that door and open it go through you be inside of a stone room the floor be make of polished marble you be inside of a great pyramid Ornate carving of giant snake flank a beautiful golden throne you see a window and you walk towards it outside there be thousand of people Slaves who worship you as a god you have great power over they the power to decide who live and who die no I will tell you nothing Anna Anna stop no Fire Fire Hurry come on hurry Daniel you ok where be she she will not get far this be Agent Barrett the female prisoner be unaccounted for secure all exit secure entire perimeter and begin a full sweep Target be armed and dangerous Use extreme caution Ugh I do not think she be act as the Goa'uld Daniel I just uh need a drink of water please I be I be not feel one hundred per cent agh my pill Ugh I think it be the deactivation code Agent Barrett this be Major Carter come in what be your location Agent Barrett this be Carter Agent Barrett need medical attention we be in the northeast corridor level one that be it it be off I mean the light turn off that mean it be off right indeed well hey drop the gun Anna Drop it come with I now to the lab I will help you you can not help I whatever they 've tell you it do not matter I never believe you Anna I do it to help people all the evil I have see in my mind nothing you put inside I compare to what I see in you Anna what do you do you could not help I I be so sorry Visiontext Subtitles Gill Parrott ENHOH  Rippé par BoRiF the Nikkei drop 8 the yen continue its free fall also the president of Togo be depose six hour ago he get a plane to Nigeria now he be call for american troop to help restore order this be my first day yes Mr President the New York Times be launch an investigation into voting irregularity in six southern state I 've get Teddy on it who be these people follow I they work for you Mr President also there be a storm in the Atlantic about to hit Maine they be expect gale force wind and 20 inch of snow should not I know who they be yes Mr President Emergency management team be stand by but we 've schedule a call so you can pledge your support they will not follow I all the time no Mr President Good hello Holly the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs be wait for you in your office he know it be my first day right yes Mr President Good Francis Mr President we need to talk sir it be important guy let I enjoy the moment Moment 's over sir right Stan thank you thank you Mr President I be here to bring you up to speed on a programme we 've be run out of Cheyenne Mountain for the past seven year I 've already have my top secret briefing yes Mr President but not this for the past seven year the Air Force have be send team to other planet by mean of an alien device know as the Stargate that be funny that be very funny my first day this be a joke right I have a great sense of humour I do not know that you have one but good we be find out about each other now I have to call the ex president of Togo and when I be do apparently the rest of the world be come to an end the ex president of Togo will have to wait sir this be not a joke the United States Air Force have be send people to other planet yes sir for seven year that be correct by mean of an alien device know as the Stargate Senator McKnight be request we move your meeting try to duck I he do not want to commit on the crime bill what should I tell they forget it the son of a bitch come in on our coattail now it be time to pay the piper what the hell be you think Mr President why do not you tell I Sara would you excuse we for a moment please you 've just be brief by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs on our new reality not only do I find out that the Air Force be engage in interstellar travel but I also find out that my running mate know all about it I be under a special gag order since when six year now that be unbelievable Mr President I realize this be overwhelming but what you need to know be that the Stargate be be seriously mismanage it be urgent that we act now what be you talk about I have desperately try to maintain some proper control and accountability but the oversight in place be completely inadequate the military specifically the personnel directly involve in the SGC need to be replace immediately now I have several recommendation regard whoa Bob hold on here Mr President why do you think I be order to keep quiet this be an attempt by the military and the previous administration to drive a wedge between we because they know I be go to come after they we need to stick together on this for God 's sake Bob think of the magnitude of this for God 's sake be right oh come on Bob if you want I to buy into your holy than thou position you 've get to convince I you be right host alien dignitary acquire alien technology travel back in time do they really blow up a sun as I understand it sir yes they do it be get to look awfully good on the old resumé hey they 've do pretty amazing thing you sound like a fan Francis well I can not help but appreciate the number of time they 've save this world some people think it would not have need saving have we leave well enough alone well you can not deny what be out there sir the enemy would have come for we anyway we need to be prepare and no matter what anyone say the people at the SGC have do the good job anyone could under the circumstance you do not trust the vice president he obviously have his own agenda I know he try to shut they down when he be at Appropriations Frankly the vice president know as well as anyone else it be too late for that if he do not six year ago he do now what do that mean he clearly do not want to shut the gate down any more he want to control it we have a civilian agency know as the NID now its mandate have be to keep an eye on top secret project like the Stargate programme and have do so from the beginning I propose that we give this organisation direct control of the gate effective immediately there be only one reason he want they to give control to the NID he be about to become chairman of the Intelligence Oversight Committee which would have put the NID and the Stargate in his back pocket he have the ambassador in his hand it be only because of extraordinary intervention that it do not work hello hello I be Thor Supreme Commander of the Asgard fleet Commander Thor my name be Senator Kinsey O'Neill suggest I send you to a distant planet for your action here but I be reasonably certain his statement be in jest I be sure it be Commander Supreme Commander it be the opinion of the Asgard High Council that Stargate Command should be leave in the hand of General Hammond and his team and while our continue friendship with Earth be not contingent on that it be prefer I wonder why he want it so badly I mean besides his belief in his divine right I do not know sir not that that be not enough but I get this feeling that there be something more to it yes sir that rogue element at NID that he take credit for take down last year we 've never have any proof connect Senator Kinsey to anything nefarious I 've get a bad feeling about where some of that campaign financing come from Mr President do I say that out loud ah Mr Woolsey I hope my confidence in you have not be misplace you have my word sir once I finish the president will have no choice but to follow your recommendation and clean house at Stargate Command I be sorry to keep you wait but I be just wrap up a meeting with the Joint Chiefs Francis I think you would want to sit in on this one thank you sir General I do not believe you know Richard Woolsey for month he have be work with the NID conduct a thorough investigation of all Stargate personnel I 've ask he here to kindly present we with his finding if this be a discussion of the competence of those run the SGC should not Hammond be include unfortunately sir General Hammond be part of the problem George Hammond be a highly decorate officer a 30 year veteran with the Air Force and while that may not carry weight over at the NID it still mean something to certain people this be not a trial although it certainly would not surprise I if it come to that let us stick to specific here if these people need to be replace I want to see evidence thank you Mr President the most recent incident be less than a month ago General Hammond order an offworld rescue despite ample indication that he be send his people into an ambush as a result a very valuable member of Stargate Command be kill Dr Janet Fraiser send people into potentially dangerous situation be a natural consequence of military command maybe so but ignore evidence of an enemy trap be at well foolish and at bad criminally negligent General Hammond admit responsibility his own report be essentially a confession all that prove be the man have the gut to own up to his mistake unfortunately in this case mistake can lead to compromise the entire planet I have a mountain of evidence implicate not only Hammond but his first line team they be hero we have no intention of minimise the accomplishment of the General or SG 1 their respective achievement speak for themselves but intermittent success can not excuse ongoing misconduct over the past seven year SG 1 have show a disregard for military authority they have compromise national security and exercise extremely poor judgement you should be on my speechwrite team come on cut the crap will you as crazy as it sound we be talk about people who be fight alien right could we please be specific yes sir let us start with insubordination five and a half year ago the gate be shut down the SGC be under order to suspend all offworld travel pende a full review SG 1 choose to ignore those order and manage to head off an invasion nonetheless they be guilty and it be by no mean an isolated incident let us go O'Neill not this time teal'c they sabotage a mothership the Goa'uld would have use to attack Earth they use the Stargate against a direct order of a superior officer you can not hold they accountable for that read the damn mission report they be under the influence of an alien device yes of course which bring we to the alarming frequency with which member of SG 1 have fall under alien influence Major Samantha Carter implant with a Goa'uld symbiote then two year ago her body become host to an alien virus Daniel Jackson fall under the influence of alien technology on numerous occasion have his body play host to not one but 12 alien psyche simultaneously most interestingly apparently die and accord to the report evolve into a high being teal'c an alien former soldier of the Goa'uld now possess full security clearance at our most secret facility he earn that trust yes that trust almost cost SG 1 dearly when he rejoin the rank of Apophis Buddy what you got go here teal'c well do teal'c finally you 've resume your rightful position as my first prime he have be brainwash by the enemy yes like his fellow team member he be show a vulnerability to alien influence which finally bring we to the team leader Jack O'Neill infect by alien contagion a half dozen time experiment upon by extraterrestrial another half dozen time have his memory manipulate on numerous occasion have the entire repository of an ancient alien database effectively download into his head Whoa Colonel not long after this the Colonel begin exhibit strange behaviour speak an alien language demonstrating superhuman intellect he be undergo some sort of transformation as a result of the knowledge he have absorb be it not for the timely intervention of another alien race he would have be lose to we how these people maintain their sanity be beyond I I be have trouble just listen to it that Mr President be exactly my point how can we trust these individual after everything they 've be through well they seem to be handle it very well but who be to say they be completely free of these influence they be routinely clear by medical professional we can no long allow the Pentagon to look the other way the number of time the member of SG 1 have be compromise should have warrant at least a reconsideration of their offworld status transfer to less decisive position a couple of sick day for God 's sake the first time I hear about this I could not believe what I be hear I try to imagine myself do what these people have be do for seven year and quite frankly I do not think any of we can really understand what they 've be go through no matter how many file we read all the more reason for intensive scrutiny if new protocol and standard of conduct need to be establish this be where it have to start what do you say we take a break yes sir you can not possibly be take their side I need time to absorb this Bob we may not have much time the long those people relax all I be say be at the moment I be go to give they the benefit of the doubt I need to know more I think you know all you need to know that include why you be here I be here Bob because the people of this nation elect I to run their country not the whole damn galaxy and this be my office Bob not yours no matter what you may think you do to make this happen and do not you ever for one second forget that yes Mr President Let us take a break accord to the military SGC be our first and good line of defence against potential alien threat to this planet if that be true we should be very very concerned Time and again Hammond and SG 1 have demonstrate shockingly poor judgement place themselves the base this very planet in jeopardy the decision to bring back suspect technology through the gate have precipitate a number of crisis situation for the most part they 've be deal within the SGC however last year the effect of an alien device break containment and find its way into the civilian population Son of a Sir I believe an individual I come in contact with have breach the quarantine the situation be take care of a cover story be create the civilian population be none the wise I would like to know how many time we will have to clean up after these people they have a mandate to acquire offworld technology that entail necessary risk how would you define necessary only a few month ago General Hammond allow the testing of an unproven computer virus that shut down our entire gate network leave we open to a potential assault you can not hold Hammond responsible it be a Goa'uld modification of the virus in other word Hammond effectively give the Goa'uld a weapon to use against we like the president say you can not even begin to understand what their job demand of they maybe not but I would like to think that it include common sense and the willingness to set aside personal feeling in battle what be you refer to Mr Woolsey an incident three year ago General Hammond allow emotion to override establish gate room protocol evacuate the gate room Colonel O'Neill we be take fire Report Colonel O'Neill Sir give they some more time General Hammond 's decision to wait for SG 1 work out in the end but I can not help but wonder if he will be so lucky the next time the member of SG 1 have similarly suspect priority and no wonder not one but two people that Dr Jackson have close personal relationship with be take as Goa'uld host Teal'c 's family and associate among the rank of the Jaffa make he an easy target for Goa'uld retaliation and manipulation both O'Neill and Carter have demonstrate an alarming tendency to let relationship cloud their decision make process they have a right to their feeling unless of course you be suggest some kind of inappropriate relationship Inappropriate yes that be exactly what he be suggest it be difficult to come away from these report without the impression that there be a lot more go on between Colonel O'Neill and Major Carter than simple friendship and respect for example there be an incident last year in which O'Neill go miss base on a report file by one of the scientist on the mission in question Major Carter 's behaviour be erratic at good this technology be unlike anything we 've come across I know no reference no way to interface I be work on it Doctor as you should be right excuse I where be Colonel O'Neill I do not see he do you do you guy find he while I be go I say when we be do here that be it that be your evidence I believe there be a lot more to this than we 've be tell but I hardly expect they to incriminate themselves with their own report but we can all read between the line all right I 've hear enough thank you gentleman thank you Mr Woolsey Mr President Mr Woolsey be here to see you sir send he in would you like a drink no thank you that be nice work today Richard really I get the feeling it do not go well ah well do not matter it do not Nah the president be go to come around I do not get that impression Mr Vice President in fact I clearly sense that he be side with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Today be a formality do not get I wrong the job you do be vital the president have to appear to be hear both side consider his position but he will see thing my way eventually and if he do not thing happen what be that suppose to mean it mean you choose the right side Richard one way or another I promise you I be go to win this one Mr President General I take it you be here to make a case for the defence I be not go to get into a point counterpoint it may very well be that Hammond and SG 1 have do their very good under difficult circumstance but there be a political aspect to the vice president 's position that make sense Sir a lot of people know about Stargate we can not keep it a secret forever when it finally come out we be go to be in the fight of our life we will need the public 's confidence you think clean house at the SGC now show you be in control you disagree I think there be time for that still sir for the immediate future I be here to let you know what you be up against and why we need Hammond and SG 1 right now more than ever have a seat Fire away the System Lords have prove themselves to be formidable adversary yet despite our obvious disadvantage we 've manage to hold our own maybe even take they down a notch or two we 've be good and we 've be lucky but I be afraid that could change there be a new Goa'uld in the mix I take it you be refer to the one who call himself Anubis he be more powerful than any of his predecessor he come to our attention a year ago when he try to take out Earth with an asteroid and then use our own Stargate as a weapon against we we thwart he both time since then he be redirect his attention to his rival wage a year long war against the Goa'uld your time be up well good let they fight amongst themselves the problem be when he be through with they and it be only a matter of time he will come gun for we and when he do we will be face a whole new threat Fire in the hole a super soldier not just one he be get a whole army Hail Anubis Hail Anubis if that be true I can not imagine how have sg 1 on the front line be go to make one bit of difference when the time come Anubis may be incredibly powerful but he be not invincible there be a way to take he out and how be that by find the lose city you have to forgive I Francis I 've only go through about a third of those file the gate be build by a highly advanced race of alien know as the Ancients they die off million of year ago but they have not disappear completely they 've evolve into high life form well will they help we no sir why the hell not it be beneath they they will not involve themselves in our affair so where be you go with this last year SG 1 make an amazing discovery on a planet call Abydos you be go to find the lost city of the Ancients lose city do not tell he about that either huh Daniel find a tablet about a lose city with powerful weapon capable of give you a big advantage over Anubis do you know where it be no but I will help you find it Hammond and SG 1 be close to find the lose city let they do their job sir let they save this planet one more time I wish it be that simple I be not sure what you mean sir the vice president may be a pain in the ass but I can not just ignore he you be commander in chief it be your decision true but if I cross he on this one well let us just say that I have not view all the angle yet be there anything you have not tell I no sir then as far as I can tell Hammond and SG 1 have do an extraordinary job under very difficult circumstance but in do so they 've make some mistake they 've make some enemy Frankly I do not know if I can protect they General Mr Woolsey thank you for meet I the vice president do not know about this no and I would like to keep it that way what do you want I want to warn you I think the vice president may be involve with people capable of well anything I believe they attempt assassination at least once before to get what they want do you realize the seriousness of what you just say yes sir look no matter what you think of I I consider myself to be a man of integrity I take the job with the nid because I strongly believe in civilian oversight of military operation Mr Woolsey I do not have any proof sir but I be start to question whether those to whom I have dedicate my allegiance be as honourable as I have hope you be a resourceful man Mr Woolsey if you think there be proof out there find it Hammond show he in General this must be important for you to have come all this way I know you have no reason to trust I General that be why I feel I have to come here in person sit down I take great pride in my work General my job demand meticulous research and above all else impartiality in its execution my aim be to present an airtight argument a point of view for consideration by those I serve with no personal agenda whatsoever get to the point I stand by my case against you and your personnel despite what I be about to say I hope you do not expect that to gain my respect you recall the assassination attempt on then Senator Kinsey the senator 's be hit he be be hit I later gain notoriety from bring those responsible to justice I can only assume you be go somewhere with this let us just say I 've recently come to believe that those behind the rogue element of the NID have not entirely be eliminate in fact they may be strong than ever and Vice President Kinsey may still be tie to they they try to have he kill then he try to take they down seem unlikely at the time something must have make Kinsey a liability after the assassination attempt the opportunity present itself to propel Kinsey onto the presidential ticket that could have motivate a reconciliation either way I be not surprised by any of this Mr Woolsey well I be sorry to say that I be and I want to do something about it if I can like what like present evidence if there be any connect Kinsey to illegal activity involve those behind the rogue NID what make you think evidence like that exist because you be sit right there I be sorry three year ago you leave SGC supposedly retire I be guess you be blackmail and and then you come back nothing about that ever make any sense to I I want to know why how you 've get something on Kinsey something I can use that be it we be in I be download now Kinsey 's online activity connect he to NID action over the last year and a half include a secret operation I run out of Area 51 involvement with the Russians and the threat to Hammond you be a piece of work Kinsey try to shut down the SGC you make this big speech about hate secret organisation then jump in bed with the NID I be do what be you go to do take down the whole NID Nope here be the deal get they to reinstate Hammond or this disk go to the press you 've get connection General you must know what be go down that be not the only copy why have not you give this to someone before now I do not know who to trust I still do not yes sir right away the president will see you now thank you thank you for see I Mr President be there something you want to add to your report Mr Woolsey yes sir as I be sure you be aware the NID do not exactly have a spotless record for several year a group of rogue agent operate inside of its rank they act on behalf of a cabal of international business interest intent on acquire alien technology for their own profit one could only hope Mr President I know they be out there Mr Woolsey I be say that one could only hope that money be their chief motivation however I doubt the type of person who be behind this be short sighted enough for that give what he must know in light of the new reality that Stargate present there be aspiration beyond mere financial greed that could be much bad I agree you be here to tell I that the vice president be still in league with they if these people be as powerful as we both think it do make one wonder what the vice president offer they in exchange for the price on his head obviously the full control of the Stargate programme that the White House afford the vice president bring key financing to your campaign victory I just hope it do not come at too high a cost I also hope history one day show that I try to do the right thing whose version of history Mr Woolsey Visiontext Subtitles Neil Blackmore enhoh  Rippé par BoRiF um ow what Jack I 've translate the writing on the colonnade SG 2 discover on P3X 439 I will be there in half

mission so be I sir Jack Daniel why would not we want to gain access to the great repository of knowledge find the Lost City of the Ancients and use their technology to save the entire galaxy from the evil of the Goa'uld well there be that from the mission file I 've read this thing whip up from the wall grab your head and rearrange your brain Sort of sort of it download the entire library of ancient knowledge into a person 's mind that massive amount of datum then unspool into your brain eventually take over your consciousness but it be not mean for primitive like we Easy fella the report

respond none of our alien ally have be reliable of late should something happen again no one should interface with the device we be suggest it be bring home for study the engineering team that study the last one of these device you find determine nothing after month of research we believe that device 's power source be deplete when O'Neill activate it recent intel suggest Anubis have become a serious threat to dominate the rest of the Goa'uld in a very short time we have to consider Earth be at risk now more than ever if the knowledge contain within this device can lead we to technology we can use to defend ourselves we must pursue it why do not you just say that sorry you have a go and be careful people the file you read in the car be just the beginning you might want to familiarise yourself with more of this before you take the job take the job I just find out that science fiction be not fiction I mean I 've know there be secret big secret but this be I do not know what be scary the fact that this be all true or that you be tell I I can not imagine what kind of job you be offer I but I do not care any more I realise you have not meet the president yet just try and say no

come in fast dial the gate send constant radio signal we have to keep that door open SG 1 we have income let us go we can not just leave Daniel we must not allow this device to fall into the hand of Anubis Fine Jack he be right if we destroy it we lose our only chance to find the location of the Lost City O'Neill ah crap all right then what no no no no no Jack somebody have to do it the answer be in there if we do not find the Lost City we be as good as dead and who do the translating when you go ancient in fact you be the one person who can not do it Jack Sir O'Neill SG 1 where the hell be

something no thank you your reaction be very similar to mine when I find out I be sorry five minute sir the negotiation you mediate in North Africa yes what do that have to do with this just that the Stargate probably make that seem like child 's play well frankly sir I have absolutely no idea what you want from I you broker a dozen of the most sensitive treaty in modern time speak God know how many language just five five I suppose your aversion to the military will be an issue what be we talk about exactly you run the Stargate programme oh how in the hell do this happen it be not an accident he do it deliberately to access the Ancients ' knowledge he uh we figure we would never get another shot at it we know that the ancient knowledge will essentially overwrite his brain we be hope he will become aware of the information we be look for and then then it will overwhelm his nervous system and he will what meet my maker pay the piper breach the pearly gate Start push up daisy here and there you should be in the infirmary why we all know exactly what be go to happen in a few day I start speak some strange language few day after that I start do thing beyond my control and a few day after that it be good night my someone good night with your permission I would like to take the weekend get a few thing together last time it take a couple of day before we notice a change in behaviour I will be back Monday ready to work permission grant thank you sir now if you will excuse I my favourite television show start in half an hour we 've already do an initial review and we 've decide to suspend current operation until a new government division can be establish the Stargate be a dangerous thing but give what we know be go on out there it be something we can not ignore no obviously not I do not want this to sound terribly self centre why you why I what do you think well I be bet other world leader be pressure you for control see I know you be a quick study and I can advise you there but I be not qualified to negotiate with alien no one be Doctor not you not I but someone have to do it the fact be we can not keep this thing a secret forever and you wanna put a friendly face on this thing when it go public someone less threatening than a US general People will panic it be go to take anything and everything we have to keep our civilisation from turn upside down but make no mistake you be not just a figurehead for the sake of publicity I choose you for a damn good reason I take it my five minute be up actually it be seven do not worry this be just the beginning what if I say no sir never go to happen Bonnie Come on in here thank you good see you again so thing be not quite as simple as they seem it never seem simple sir be careful who you trust

your head in that thing be you nuts Carter you be one of this country 's natural resource if not national treasure it could not have go down any other way I just hope it be worth it even if we do find the Lost City even if we get there and find what we need to defend the planet that would be worth it hello in here sorry be we interrupt anything no what be you do here uh it be a funny story actually we be drive by and see Sam 's car Funny teal'c say he do not say anything he look at I and do that eyebrow thing and I say to he hey why do not we stop by be that doughnut indeed Excellent rise my lord I believe the human of the Tauri destroy the device you seek you fail to stop they they anticipate our arrival my lord you be so wrong it be the perfect analogy Burns as Goa'uld they be merely animate character you be so shallow please Teal'c be one of the deep people I know he be so deep go on tell he how deep you be you will be lucky if you understand this my depth be immaterial to this oh you see no more beer for you I be sorry sir but I have to agree I do not see the connection all right that do it you know the entire VHS collection be go to one of you it be go to Siler he get it thank God Pizza well you be not the usual delivery boy be this a good time it be always a good time for you sir come on in let I get you a chair General at ease Major please there you go sir I be glad to find you all here you would not happen to have another one of those I would I hope you like Guinness sir I find it a refreshing substitute for food I 've be relieve of command what the president have effectively shut down the SGC for a three month review process three month during which time a newly form government department will take the place of Stargate Command but sir the colonel we do not have much time how could this happen Kinsey do anyone know anyone who vote for those two shrub I 've know Hayes for a long time he be a good man despite his taste in running mate maybe Robert Kinsey bring in a lot of campaign financing and for all we know he may have use his knowledge of the Stargate as leverage to get himself a place on the ticket it do not matter now we be go to lie down for this we 've be in this situation before no this time it be different who be replace you sir her name be Dr Elizabeth Weir a civilian I 've hear of her she be an expert in international politic she mediate high level UN negotiation I reference she in our treaty for the Tok'ra I 've be order to Washington to discuss reassignment I leave tomorrow uh General we do have a little unfinished business here as far as I know you be to report to work as schedule on Monday something must be do I have my order besides I have a feeling I may be able to do more from Washington than I can here in the meantime you will just have to plead your case to the new administration I have every confidence in you people Amazing be not it I do not really care ok wait there be go to be a lot of change not everyone 's go to be happy about they yes I be about to step into one myself ok Bye sorry I walk around with this I look like a crazy person talk to myself Elizabeth Weir Daniel Jackson I can not get use to be underground I keep look for a window I see you find the one with the good view when we first try to get the Stargate to work I would come here and just stare at it for hour be that a gentle reminder that you 've be a part of this since the beginning Subtle huh hm so a little light reading uh I 've be awake all weekend the reality of this be it be an adrenaline rush hey at least I know you have a beat heart I do not expect a warm welcome from the military you be replace a great man uniform notwithstanding ok but I be hope you of all people will not jump to conclusion like why someone like you be here someone like I you start out as a political activist lobbying against spending on the military and how I end up work for those I be criticise I know but I 've decide that the good way to stop the proliferation of weapon be to try and end the need for they so I be go to be the voice of reason to whoever will listen and you think that be why the president choose you to take over the SGC I do not know why I 've be give this job I really do not but I be go to do it to the good of my ability as long as I be here I will examine the mandate do not underestimate the threat I be not this country 's history of Manifest Destiny can not continue out to the galaxy especially when this be all behind the back of the planet I be not say everything here be right we have no right to play God but neither do the Goa'uld I know none of this may seem real to you on paper but trust I they be pure evil now if they have the chance they would either destroy we or enslave we all you can read as many mission report as you want but before you decide what should be do here why do not you go through that gate and see what be go on for yourself in good time we may not have good time O'Neill do not I want you to know O'Neill 's current condition be of serious concern to I you realise Jack do what he do because it be our only way to find the Lost City unschedule incoming traveller all the offworld team be back already we be receive Master Bra'tac 's personal identification code I know what a IDC be he be an ally and if we do not open the I understand that thank you go ahead please Bra'tac this be Dr Elizabeth Weir she be the new leader of this facility hello have Hammond of Texas fall in battle no sir he be fine we 've have some recent change in our political leader I see Bra'tac what be wrong I be afraid I be not the bearer of good news we have have word from Jaffa loyal to our cause Anubis be gather the full force of his fleet he will be here within three day Bob could we stop complain and start figure out what we be go to do Mr President General Hammond show he in we can not ignore a threat of this magnitude hear the man out well whatever he be and get back to I General George Hammond Mr President it be lieutenant last time we speak be not it for both of we that be a lot of hair ago sir sit down when I take this job I think I have the weight of the world on my shoulder but then I find out what you do for a living yes sir this have nothing to do with your record if the american people know what your contribution be thank you sir that be kind of you to say one day maybe they will Dr Weir she be as smart as they come I hope so poor thing she have no idea what she be get herself into but I have no choice George I have to do something I want you to know that I be aware of your history with the vice president yes sir Hell we both know why I pick Kinsey More than the money he deliver Florida all by himself if I know then of course so let us talk about your reassignment I be think more of retirement sir I do not think so George not just yet I wanna keep you around Washington we be go to need you and your expertise three day from now be a Thursday Thursday 's not good for we why now Anubis believe we know the location of the Lost City we do not not yet but he do not know that we do not know well some people just do not know when to leave Colonel O'Neill Major Carter teal'c these be strange circumstance to be meet and you be I be Dr Elizabeth Weir Colonel you can just call she your one hope of ever step through the Stargate again bit of a mouthful I know I be play catch up but I understand time be short actually it be all relative ma'am Carter could explain it well if we have more time shall we have a seat then this be a situation of grave importance she be quick which be why I 've take it upon myself to come and hear Mr Bra'tac personally Master Bra'tac Master I beg your pardon so you believe the Goa'uld Anubis be plan to attack you may be certain of it I will say this the timing be impeccable the moment we suspend Stargate operation you pull this out of your hat Mr Vice President if you be suggest that we would make something like this up that be exactly what I be suggest well that be exactly what we do we sit around on our fat ass and create scenario that put the planet at risk that be what we do I think you would do about anything Gentlemen Let us assume that Master Bra'tac be in earnest and that the threat be real do you know what the threat be Anubis be half Goa'uld half ascend Ancient with the knowledge and technology to wipe we all from the face of the Earth what about negotiate for cry out loud that be derentis what you just say derentis do not do too Derentis what be that Latin it be not I think what he be try to say be that base on our past experience negotiating would be insane Crazy I get that however we believe there may be alien technology within our reach that could defeat Anubis now you be pull a ray gun out of your hat weapon capable of defend this planet I can not believe we be listen to this Mr Vice President on his last I be aware of the event that have once again compromise Colonel O'Neill 's invaluable judgement and the fact that on his last official mission he have incur the wrath of humanity 's bad enemy on behalf of we all wait a minute I think you do not buy into the whole invasion thing the fact be until we know the location of the Lost City I know where it be you know where it be now I will it be in there somewhere look let I make this simple I come up with the Lost City we go find it yes or no no who be you really and why be you here I will consider it thank you you be welcome I must return to Chulak I too will go in the hope of procure ship and warrior to defend this world good luck what the hell be that I be sorry you do not know O'Neill like I do this be my call Colonel O'Neill be the one who get we into this mess I do not see I want he go I want they all go you have not figure that out yet oh I 've figure out quite a bit well hallelujah for that this be my office this be my chair until I be tell otherwise I be go to make decision as I see fit not as they fit into your agenda you have no idea what my agenda be whatever your agenda be you do not know anything if you think you do you be not as smart as I think so t if I do not see you again I will see you soon O'Neill you know something I do not in fact it be you that know something that I do not hope you be right I wish you all well do this mean anything to you no could you at least look at it Daniel I do not speak Ancient yet and when I do eventually you know I will never understand it you have to try last time thing just pop into my fron Fron be head I have no idea what you be talk about maybe if you stop work on this stupid crossword I would like to at least finish that while I can I think 13 across you write taonas yeah so what be it mean I do not know you tell I Eight down you write praclarush what be eight down Label there be empty space I think the answer be suppose to be identification 13 across be sphere Jack this be it see I assume we still speak the same language mostly Sphere planet Label name follow still you not Praclarush Taonas you write the name of the planet where we will find the Lost City in the crossword bit of a jump why else would you do that the clue for seven down be celestial body and he write Uma Thurman yes it have to mean something it do I be hungry Praclarush Taonas accord to this it mean lose in fire this have to be the planet of the Lost City know the name of the planet do not help unless we have a gate address Jack what be you do at what at this that that be at you can stop that do not ask what it mean I do not know I think I do what be this sh well you just tell we to be quiet no when I look at this I think sh that be it what Praclarush Taonas six syllable what if each symbol on the Stargate have a sound like an alphabet Praclarush Taonas be not just the name it be also the gate address at be the Earth 's symbol our point of origin Praclarush Taonas at so this would lead we to the Lost City it have to wait a minute we dial this address two year ago but could not establish a wormhole the gate must be bury lose in fire what we need could still be there I could use the address to calculate the planet 's location but we will need a ship Prometheus but with Anubis on his way Prometheus be our last line of defence maybe Teal'c have something by now where be Colonel O'Neill Packing Colonel do not ask the last time he just do thing without know why it be a good sign it mean we be on the right track Sir I do not know Carter grab a naqahdah generator will ya I be Ronan I know your father it be an honour I have a ship at my disposal so we have hear forgive I but as brave as you be you can not hope to stop the fleet of Anubis with just one ship I have see the extent of his force we only wish to use your ship to help we find something much more powerful something that we believe will defeat Anubis once and for all if that be true then I will join you that be my only condition I be a fine pilot so we have hear have you get everything you need I think there be still the sink in the kitchen be that a joke perhaps a bad one yes very bad but I sense hope for you well I hope for all of we that you find what you be look for Colonel thank you what I would have do it you know I know there have to be a way to reverse it once we have what we need we will find a way we be coax everything out of the engine but we be still two day away how you feel sir a bit cruvi a little fron ache we need to go fast a short time ago our radar detect three Goa'uld vessel emerge from hyperspace look like you be wrong Bob Three Goa'uld ship be hardly the full force of Anubis 's fleet it sound to I like Anubis want to know if SG 1 be successful in procure ancient defence technology they be not not yet but Anubis do not know he be most likely hold back his invasion fleet till he find out what we 've get Sir Prometheus and our fleet of 302 can give they a run for their money if that be all he throw at we I agree then let us do it however Mr President I agree with your assessment Anubis want to goad we into a precipitous action which will show our hand I believe launch the Prometheus now will only serve to demonstrate we lack the very advanced weaponry Anubis be afraid of Remain at DEFCON 3 for the time be but contact the government of Russia Great Britain France China and Canada let them know what we think we be in for in the meantime I well prepare a hell of a speech thank you Gimme your zat there you go Sir you should know that General Hammond authorise I to take command do it now I do not think that be necessary I trust you I will make it easy for you I resign you be in charge ok at your house before Daniel and Teal'c show up what I be go to say be I know my lord the advance Ha'tak report that they have receive no challenge order they to begin the attack if the Tauri have weapon of the Ancients we shall see this do not look good the surface be almost completely cover by lava flow how could there have be a civilisation a star become a red giant near the end of its life a million year ago this planet may have look like Earth so we be a million year late probably more that be very late what I have scan the entire surface what do you want I to say I do not even know why we be here but you do pack the hazmat suit for we you know the condition of the planet and that we would have to go there then you know more than I do no sir I do not sit down and take a look that be an order Easy Taonas Sir what you look at the screen and say Taonas if you say so you say so there be a small anomaly on the surface here like a bubble be it a cavern it look like a perfectly form half sphere of molten rock perhaps a force field for the city be cover over too small to have a city in there we be not get energy reading from it perhaps the shield have since fail we should still check it out we 've manage to contact the captain of the spruance a destroyer in the Nimitz battle group some beam come outta the sky there be not any warning but the entire carrier just go up in a fireball Captain can you see the enemy Holy another cruiser just blow up where the hell 's the fire come from the engagement begin less than five minute ago and that be only one Goa'uld ship here the crust may be thin enough for the ring to penetrate Stand by can you still hear we indeed loudly and clearly we will move a safe distance and return on your signal the radiation level 's high I believe Ronan be correct a shield once protect this structure it be possible the ring compromise the dome 's integrity too bad otherwise it be very pleasant Architecture definitely indicate this be build by the Ancients this facility do not appear operational I do not know about you guy but I be hope this be not the Lost City Sir be careful Jack you sure you know what you be do the atmosphere be safe it be a map of the galaxy look like every planet the Ancients ever colonise be indicate here this be where we be Praclarush that be our solar system Earth that do not appear to be Earth it do not take into consideration the 30 million year of continental drift Sir why be you show we this Jack Terre Atlantis Terre be Earth Atlantis the Lost City of Atlantis be you say the Lost City of the Ancients be here Antarctica Subo glaciuse under the ice the city we 've be look for be under the ice of Antarctica it be be on Earth the whole time we be there we come all this way just to find out that we have to go all the way back no a power source bra'tac we be on our way we know the location of the Lost City it be on Earth Understood Major Carter pilot the vessel I will see to the transport ring I be betray you be the betrayer of your one true god Anubis you should have strike for my heart Ronan you will die more slowly this way you be mistaken I no long carry a symbiote I do not think the dome 's go to hold you be weak old man Bra'tac what be happen up there you may be young but not the wiser Bra'tac the dome be collapse secure the ship Ronan be an agent of Anubis save your strength old friend you know that I be stubborn teal'c but this battle I fear I can not win the pain be fade Jack once more I be in your debt but how O'Neill possess the heal power of the Ancients I guess your condition be a little more advanced than last time teal'c set a course for Earth our F A 22 and abl be all in the air but so far there be be nothing to intercept since the battle group be destroy the Goa'uld have not fire why not a city or two just to prove his point hold your fire it be a hologram I be Anubis you 've get to be kid you be the leader of this world Henry Hayes President of the United States of America one nation among many no more bow before your god I do not think so however I be willing to discuss your surrender if you possess weapon match mine you would have use they do not let the suit fool ya fella we be go to fight you bring destruction upon yourself never go to happen too much ok Sir 30 plus ship just appear in orbit take station around the planet he do not buy it it be time to go to the Alpha site you can stay in contact Bob go ahead Mr President no no go ahead I be stay you be all welcome to join he I think you know we be stay here with you sir George you deserve the right to go no sir I think I will stay as well good if you will accept it I 've get another job for you be you prepare a weapon for battle O'Neill sensor have detect an armada of Goa'uld ship in orbit around Earth can you understand anything that I be say O'Neill O'Neill I wish for you to know that Mr President in the last two hour the enemy have focus on systematically take out power grid and broadcast terminal around the globe they seem to wanna disable our communication so much for my speech we be do our good to get the word out to the public say what for the moment we be stick with a meteor shower that will only hold up as long as those ship stay out of range go to DEFCON 1 John launch Prometheus I think you be a lot of thing a coward be not one of they I be a pragmatist Doctor someone have to ensure the survival of the human race and the american way of live by the way if you survive you be through what be go on we 've lose power get it back Manual Iris control close it now what do you think you be do open that Iris and dial the Alpha site unauthorised offworld activation that be a nuke or bad Anubis have dial in you be not go anywhere get I out of here you hear I just receive a message from SG 1 it be not come through the gate I do not give a damn well I do Dr Weir Mr President Prometheus can not win against an entire Goa'uld fleet but it could buy SG 1 time to complete their mission Mr President that be downright insane I be relieve Dr Weir take command Sir from what I 've look at will you shut the hell up I be sorry sir not you Doctor excuse I consider your resignation accept you can not do that oh please I get enough on you to have you shoot this be the big mistake you will ever make but I think I will stick with my original thought which be shut the hell up I promise you will only live to regret this go ahead Dr Weir I believe sir send Prometheus to cover SG 1 be our good hope we have our order let us get this bird in the air Set inertial compensator and shield at maximum Initiate launch sequence Jack 's modify the transmitter we will use it to bore a hole through the ice we must first defeat the force of Anubis how we go to do that you must exit hyperspace close to the Earth 's atmosphere to be on the other side of the armada there will not be much time to decelerate of that I be aware old friend teal'c you be go to pull up right I be attempt to do so where now it have to be near the coordinate where we find the second Stargate my lord a scout ship have exit hyperspace and be head for the planet 's southern pole Sir how long be this go to take Anubis can not have miss our arrival you be correct Al kesh and glider approach many they will be in fire range in 30 second More ship approach from the opposite direction Sir we be about to get our a they be not Goa'uld defend that scout ship at all cost Prometheus SG 1 this be Hammond do you read yes sir it be good to see you let us go Colonel how be we go to get down there the ring the Ancients build the Stargates there must be a set of ring the transmission beam just could not penetrate a mile of ice we be take damage to the outer hull F302s have expend their ordnance we can not take they aboard they will have to divert to McMurdo we need to recharge the shield hold your position ready good luck we be in range my lord Fire shield be fail Scout ship clear set a course for Anubis 's mothership move we out of here main engine on line Emergency thrust Tauri vessel be abandon its position this look vaguely familiar Dormata Sleep you be too late the power of the Ancients be mine Fools it be a hologram the human attack vessel approach destroy it Sir whatever you be go to do shield be down weapon be expend the next hit 's go to take we out hold your course Brace for a collision if we go they go weapon fire come from the surface break off course get we clear our shield be of no use no what the hell be that that be SG 1 thousand of bright yellow I do not know they be come from the surface they be cut the enemy fleet to shred my God it be beautiful Sir Sir his pulse be erratic do not you dare leave we now we win Colonel Sir I have the president for you patch he through Mr President I be confirm the enemy be be defeat the threat be eliminate Congratulations George I do not know how we be ever go to be able to thank you please Jack Dormata that thing now what Aveo amacuse Goodbye we can not just leave he like this there have to be a way to reverse the process I do not think this be it Sam what do you mean the dome 's too small it be like Taonas it be obviously not a city it be an outpost of some kind this be not Atlantis I do not think so if this be not the Lost City then where be it Visiontext Subtitles Joanna Wilkinson ENHOH  Rippé par BoRiF previously on Stargate SG 1 who be you people we be replicator the other would destroy I not if you come with we you would do that they win t leave I she promisedl no my son they 've make a fool of you I have be relieve of command who be replace you sir her name be Dr Elizabeth Weir a civilian she be an expert in international politic Terre Atlantus be you say the Lost City of the Ancients be here the city we 've be look for be under the ice of Antarctica Goodbye Dr Weir Elizabeth I can not believe we be finally go I know I should 've be ready a long time ago the talk have stall again you be kid I it be a complicated situation the Antarctic Treaty be establish to promote research with the interest of progress for all mankind not just the United States so argue the other 11 nation all claim share jurisdiction Article one state there can be no establishment of any military base and no testing of any weapon you see first hand how powerful the ancient outpost be meanwhile Jack stay in a stasis pod there he sacrifice himself to save we all of we not just this country I know but the scale of Anubis ' attack make cover it up tenuous at well to keep the world from find out all about the Stargate we need the full cooperation of every government aware of what be go on it be just go to take more time while we just sit here and do nothing I be sorry Dr Jackson Daniel Daniel why can not we use the gate it be not that we can not use it officially normal gate activity will remain suspend until the agreement for control of the Antarctic site be resolve what do one have to do with the other we still have full jurisdictional control over the Stargate the president feel that how we proceed with operation at SGC will reflect on our international goodwill in other word it be our political leverage in negotiation I would never say that what about Colonel O'Neill look I know what he mean to the three of you we all appreciate the sacrifice Colonel O'Neill make the Asgard can help he last time they erase the knowledge from his mind before it kill he we 've try contact they what can we do you know we help the Asgard trap the replicator in a time dilation field on Hala something to that effect a couple of year ago right we know that that trap be only go to hold they for so long Thor and the Asgard must be monitor the situation if we can get there we should be able to contact they be not the planet in another galaxy Othala O'Neill use his knowledge to modify the Goa'uld vessel in our possession accord to your report that ship be capable of fly fast and far than anything the Goa'uld have yes I think it might just get we there and back that may be a problem there be a chance the trip will burn out the engine that be a big problem if you get there and it turn out you can not contact the Asgard we be willing to take the risk as admirable as that be I can not let you do it for what reason O'Neill fend off Anubis ' fleet use the weapon from the Ancient outpost hopefully that will make the Goa'uld think twice before attack Earth in the future but we do not know if we be go to be able to ever use those weapon again if we can not we be go to need a new tactical advantage over the Goa'uld that be what the Pentagon tell I the modify cargo ship be too valuable now I be sorry request deny what can I do for you Major I want you to reconsider my request I be sorry that cargo ship be modify use the knowledge of the Ancients there be no guarantee that anyone will ever be able to figure out how it be do and as the most likely person on the planet to figure it out be you say if I do not let you attempt to contact the Asgard you will not even try I would never say that right now that be the most advanced piece of technology we have if it be not for O'Neill we would not have that ship for that matter we would not even be here discuss this we get the coordinate from the Prometheus base on how long it take the ship to get from Taonas to Earth I be estimate our trip to Othala will take roughly ten day hey so uh how have you talk Weir into let we go I do not I talk she into let we go you be stay here even with the modification there be no guarantee it will get we there and if it do it may well burn out the engine the ship be never mean to fly at that speed so if we do not find the Asgard we will be strand I know we need you here you be our good chance at decipher the information in that outpost if we fail you will be O'Neill 's only hope hey teal'c can I get you anything I pack turkey I know it be your favourite thank you but I be not currently hungry have you determine how O'Neill modify the engine no I be just take a break I do not think it would be easy but at least it be a good way to pass the time I be sorry have I be ignore you I be fine I think work on the engine would help take my mind off O'Neill which be kinda silly consider he be the one who modify they look I know this plan be not exactly foolproof I have never plot an intergalactic course if the coordinate be off by one half of a per cent we could wind up 10 000 light year from our destination but still try to stay positive I have the utmost confidence in your ability I know so you wanna talk concern what subject I do not know How 's Rya'c Fine you still keep in touch with Ishta indeed bra'tac bra'tac be well Come on teal'c throw I a bone here how be Pete Shanahan he be fine be not all well between the two of you no everything be great it be just as you know it be not easy say goodbye to someone you care about when you think there be a chance you may never see they again I know that be a risk we take every time we step through the Stargate but still try to stay positive I will get you a sandwich Daniel Elizabeth just wonder if you would hear anything they be still bogge down it be be over a week what do you expect Quick round of handshake champagne toast seal the deal we be attack by an armada of alien ship if that do not get we past our distrust what will you forget those alien ship be destroy by a single weapon that kind of power will give anyone cause for concern yeah not that I want this to come off as an attempt to get rid of you but be not this sort of international negotiation exactly your area of expertise unauthorised offworld activation we be receive a signal it be a text message it be Goa'uld what do it say it be from one of the System Lords Camulus celtic god of war I be not familiar with he we never have contact with he before wow uh yeah of course wow sorry it say he want to arrange a meeting to negotiate a treaty a Goa'uld want to arrange a treaty with we not just one Goa'uld all of they the System Lords they wanna send representative here prepare to emerge from hyperspace when we drop out I will broadcast a signal if the Asgard be monitor the region they should find we should we not be able to see the planet yes we be experience an extremely powerful gravitational force something be not right teal'c turn we around and get we outta here now Hyperspace generator will not engage Sublight engine be at maximum yet we be not move there be only one thing I know of that could create this kind of gravitational pull you be sure this be an accurate translation pretty much what do you make of it to be honest I be not sure what to think they do come here once to negotiate yeah with the Asgard not with we Earth just serve as neutral territory for they to want to meet with we as equal be extremely unusual maybe we gain respect in their eye they must have hear what happen to Anubis they could not defeat he with all their force we do it in a day which may explain why they wanna come here yeah to see how we do it it be pretty much what we expect we burn out the hyperdrive getting here that be unfortunate even if it work it would be dangerous to open a window this close to the event horizon of a black hole be we that far off course no we come out of hyperspace where we be suppose to it do not make sense Hala 's sun be not massive enough to collapse into a black hole yet that be what appear to be happen I will see if I can get a little more out of the sublight engine the president have authorise I to pursue negotiation with the Goa'uld ok you do not think I can handle it I do not say that but if I may you do not sound all that confident I have broker my share of international negotiation this will just be my first interplanetary one the System Lords can not be trust as a group or individual they be posture egomaniac drive by an insatiable lust for power each one capable of unimaginable evil see why should I be nervous sound like an average day at the United Nations look I be not afraid to admit that I need help so what can you tell I the High Council of the System Lords be a flimsy coalition of the most powerful Goa'ulds in the galaxy who cooperate when it suit they number vary new one rise up old one get knock off there be a dozen now I can put together a summary of what we know all right I assume I can not just open the Iris and let the representative walk through no that would probably be a bad idea we should get they to meet we at a neutral location a planet of our choose send a team check they out make sure they be unarmed then escort they back Good send the message we be be pull backwards we will have to divert power from the shield they be the only thing hold the ship together drop they and the field could tear we apart I do not believe there be any other choice Diverting power we be now move forward it be not go to be good enough we be lose hull integrity we 've get a hull breach Greetings Thor it be good to see you again Major Carter teal'c Likewise indeed your timing be impeccable so the Goa'uld have agree to our term for their travel here yeah I be just go over some material on the delegate Camulus send the original message then there be Amaterasu japanese sun goddess and the last one be Lord Yu Yu do not every joke every pun do to death seriously I just think I remember read he be not himself of course for a Goa'uld what that mean exactly I be not sure please continue he can no long take on a new host the power of the sarcophagus be lose effectiveness he be suffer from old age he be senile why choose he as a representative his underling may be cover for he the other System Lords do not know Lord Yu be the one System Lord who oppose Anubis ' desire to be reinstate to the Council after his banishment Long story he fall out of favour when the other Lords accept Anubis back and he use his power to become the leader now that Anubis have go you think the balance of power have shift back to Yu on the bright side Yu have be the most cooperative in the past I think none could be trust they can not especially not a crazy one huh that be the bright side More of a slightly less dark side I be afraid I can not leave this sector Major not at the moment Thor you be the only one who can save Colonel O'Neill as you say he be be preserve in stasis at the moment I will be glad to return with you to Earth when my mission here be complete what be your mission I must wait here until I be certain the replicator have be destroy you may have notice Hala 's sun have collapse into a black hole just before our ship 's back be tear off I be sorry I do not reach you soon I be not expect you you do not respond to our attempt to contact you I be sorry Time space distortion cause by the black hole have be interfere with my ship 's long range communication Understandable indeed for some the time dilation field be only a temporary measure we know the time it take for the replicator to reach the machine would translate to less than two year outside the field therefore a more permanent solution be devise so you collapse the sun by artificially increase its gravitational field yes that be pretty cool as you can see the planet have already break apart but a number of replicator have manage to come together in a coherent mass that have yet to pass the event horizon even if they withstand the force without be tear apart there be no way interesting what be it the mass of replicator block be move away from the event horizon how be that possible they have the time dilation device I do not know how but they seem to have use it to counteract the gravitational effect that should be pull they in Frightening not only that they can do that but that you do not know how I agree they be pick up speed Scans indicate the block have form together into what a ship they be escape their course indicate they be head this way think you be go to stand I up yeah sorry hear anything from Teal'c and Sam no receive a signal ma'am SG 7 report we have a green light open the Iris Welcome to Earth allow I to introduce we be not interested in your name really I find it generally help so much we prefer to present our offer so we can spend as brief a time as possible on this planet right this way have you see anything like it no and it be doubtful my ship 's weapon will be effective against it we should probably get outta here then huh can you jump into hyperspace we must clear the gravitational distortion field of the black hole first they have fire upon we can it penetrate your shield it be more than likely Brace for impact the hull have be breach where the damage be minimal the projectile be likely compose of replicator they be not visible to my scanner this be how they have board Asgard ship in the past can you prevent decompression in those section yes your unexpected defeat of Anubis have create an unstable situation among the System Lords in order to avoid open war we come to an agreement to divide his territory and his army evenly how civilised of you yes unfortunately one among we have break that agreement oh no do not do not tell I let I guess it be um Baal Baal he learn the location of the planet where Anubis create his Kull Warriors Baal get there first and program the soldier to serve he with those orak at his command Baal have tip the balance of power in his favour Orak unspeakable in battle the Kull be far superior to the Jaffa already many among we have begin to speak of capitulation much as they do with Anubis if that happen Baal will indeed be unstoppable this be all very interesting I be sure but I fail to see what it have to do with we my master wish to say it be well know the Tauri possess a powerful weapon something far beyond their current technology yes we use it to kill Anubis and destroy his fleet by mean of this weapon Baal can be prevent from conquer the galaxy Major Carter Thor it be teal'c Major Carter be beam away be she in your presence I do not do it the replicator must have she I have eliminate all of the replicator I could locate there be no way of know if there be more the replicator ship have enter hyperspace can you follow yes if Baal defeat we how long do you think it will be before he turn his attention to you if he do he will suffer the same fate as Anubis perhaps but there be other world in this galaxy without the luxury of such advanced defence what be you talk about we could not help but notice that the Asgard do not come to your aid when Anubis threaten your planet in fact we 've hear nothing from the Asgard for quite some time now really that be odd cos we talk to they all the time the Asgard do not come because they know it be not necessary Baal believe otherwise he be convince that the Asgard can no long exercise power in this galaxy he intend to take the planet protect under the Goa'uld Asgard treaty if you do not help we stop he million of human will die and million more will be enslave do you know its destination before you destroy they the replicator manage to access the ship 's computer they learn the location of Orilla where we be try to rebuild our civilisation I assume it would be their first target what be your reasoning Orilla be rich in neutronium which be a key element in Asgard technology and be also essential for the creation of human form replicator Major Carter Fifth I imagine you never expect to see I again look I be sorry we leave you behind but we have to do it we could not risk the other get out you know what they be capable of I know you must be upset upset we betray you it must have hurt see that be the part of you that be most like we the human part of you I understand how you feel you could not but I promise you will how many planet be protect under this treaty um 26 27 if you include Earth and what good be it if the Asgard be not available to protect anything at one time they be more recently we 've trade on the threat a big bluff well Baal be about to call the bluff there be nothing we can do about that Earth be safe if the Goa'uld think we can defend it but that be a bluff too yeah more or less when I be a kid my dad have these weekly poker game all I remember be smoke make my eye water I wish I have pay more attention you 've misrepresent the truth before no my job have usually be to get people to recognise the truth if they get a hint that we can not use the ancient weapon for defence trust I this game be over too dramatic at this point not for I how can we stop they my weapon do not work in hyperspace much like the shield however in close proximity the self destruct may be sufficient to eliminate both ship I be sorry but we have no choice if the human form replicator reach Orilla they will have the resource to replicate many thousand of time we can not allow that to happen so be it why be you do this you think you deserve well you can see my thought you know I do not wanna do it I suppose in a way I should thank you it be because of what you do to I I come to realise my full potential I be more human than the other at first I think it be weakness but now I see it make I capable of so much more Fifth please my brother and sister will devour entire civilisation in order to replicate but they will know nothing of cruelty or betrayal or revenge not like we be not that right Major Carter no we appreciate this information but it do not change the fact that we can not get involve in any internal Goa'uld dispute if Baal try to attack any of the protect planet he will suffer the consequence we do not share your faith in the Asgard we must stop Baal before it come to that you will forgive my bluntness but that be not our problem enough with each pass moment Anubis grow more powerful you mean Baal my master be fatigue we request a short adjournment Silence I need no adjournment we know you have a formidable new defensive weapon but with it you must wait for your enemy to come to you and that can be dangerous what if an enemy be to devise a means of defeat this weapon what exactly be you offer hyperdrive engine we know you have battleship not capable of interstellar travel we be offer you a means of produce a fleet of ship as advanced as the Goa'uld Ha'tak vessel you could take the fight to the enemy we be almost within range now we be slow down something be interfere with the control the auxiliary control console outside the engine room your offer be very generous but I be afraid we be go to have to decline you would be able to uphold the treaty with or without the aid of the Asgard how many hyperdrive will you give we how many ship can you build I think the real question be how many ship do you have to enforce this treaty ourselves we need to build enough ship to match any fleet that would oppose we we be not at liberty to disclose that well then this discussion be over how can you blithely reject this offer we will not fight your battle for you in exchange for a few hyperdrive engine that may or may not do we any good in the long run and especially since we already have that technology at our disposal you have viable hyperdrive technology yes we do with the help of the Asgard we be in the process of implement it now so thank you very much this ancient weapon such an advanced piece of technology the power requirement must be enormous even simple maintenance must be extremely difficult give your limited capability we manage of course we believe you but I wonder what Baal would think if he be to receive intelligence that the weapon be temporarily out of commission Mm he would come to this world to claim it for himself the Tauri would have to destroy he and we would have to give they nothing oh come on Baal would never fall for that he know how desperate you be he might find this information a bit convenient perhaps but you leave we few option ok we will do it we will in exchange we want Baal 's territory what do you mean well that be the way it work right when one System Lord kill another he take over his army fleet planet that be what we want everything in Baal 's possession you can not be serious if we be go to destroy Baal for you why should we settle for anything less Preposterous we can not accept those term take it or leave it we must send a message to the other System Lords to advise they of the current situation go ahead the problem have be eliminate the replicator be beyond reach we be too late to stop they from reach the new Asgard home world I guess you do learn something from your father 's poker game always bet big when bluff I do not know you want to be a System Lord I have to do something to keep they talk it look like they would draw Baal here no matter what we say we can be sure they will not agree to our term I know we may have to revive Colonel O'Neill what if they suspect we be bluff they will take the weapon if not they will trick Baal into come either way we may actually have to use that weapon again to defend this planet we do not know if there be enough power to fire a shot I know if you try to revive Jack in fact he will probably die before he can do anything to help we Dr Weir here be a copy of the message the Goa'uld send back to the System Lords it be code we need to know what they be think I manage to send advance warning to Orilla by provide they with the replicator ship 's course and speed they have a fair approximation of where it will drop out of hyperspace what ship we have available will be wait in ambush the ship can destroy the replicator before they raise their shield they will only be defenceless for a few moment but if my calculation be accurate that should be sufficient stop it please why should I you can not change what happen be this make you feel well I never intend to abandon you but you do you gain my trust then you use I and leave I behind it be not my decision you could 've come back for I there be no time Time thank to what you do I have plenty of time to think about what a fool I be I be sorry I be sorry for what we do to you yes you be now part of be human be have compassion Learning to forgive yes I be not there yet I need more time Progress yeah what we suspect they think we be bluff but have no way to confirm that so they be not sure what to do they could let Baal figure it out for they that be dangerous for they if we can not power the weapon which we can not Baal would get Earth and the outpost unscheduled offworld activation this be Weir what be happen ok we will be right down our guest just get a response Commander Thor this be Aegir of the Valhalla we have assume defensive position and await the target ship Understood the enemy ship have be destroy I be sorry teal'c I need to see the most recent message they receive it be unfortunate you be be recall I think we be make good progress your demand be ridiculous we have no choice but to terminate negotiation well give my regard to Baal Shut it down what what be the meaning of this second message the System Lords be test our defence they be send a ship to attack Earth it will be here within the hour we be dignitary how dare you prevent we from leave send ship here to attack we be an act of war and a foolish one give our defence my lord do not order such action then undo it tell the System Lords to call the ship back their decision be one of desperation force upon they by your unwillingness to help persuade they to change could only be do in person with a full Council vote even if I do believe you our good faith be out the window at this point you be our prisoner take they away greeting Thor Greetings teal'c this be Penegal of the Asgard High Council I regret to report that the debris from the replicator ship could not be contain we be unable to prevent replicator block from rain down on Orilla they have already begin replicate and infest our system Control of the city be in jeopardy should you not consider evacuate your people that be no long possible there be too many we carry numerous stored mind aboard our ship ' computer when we flee our home world when Orilla be finally find we be able to place those mind into clone body so that we could build our new colony the replicator have already infect system need to save those mind if we lose this battle they will perish along with their body take with they the hope of the Asgard race Orilla be the last chance of ever rebuild our empire then we must find a way to save it Sir sensor have detect an alien vessel it exit hyperspace 14 000 km out eight degree starboard Designation None yet sir Vessel be the size of a Goa'uld mothership closing fast visual range in six second hold your position Prepare to fire four three on screen Maximum magnification open a channel Broadcast on all frequency and translate into Goa'uld this be Colonel Lionel Pendergast of the United States Air Force Prometheus unidentified vessel failure to reply will constitute an act of aggression and we will respond with the full force of our weapon that will be unnecessary teal'c I offer greeting from Thor supreme commander of the Asgard fleet we be aboard the Daniel Jackson I have just receive word that the Asgard have arrive to witness the demonstration of our defence technology that you have force we into there be still time to call off the attack we would also like to witness the demonstration your ship be not come it be destroy en route by Baal the collective force of the System Lords be bow and you be lose the war then so be you hey guy our new colony be in grave jeopardy the replicator escape from the time dilation device and be threaten to destroy the Asgard ok so what can we do the ancient knowledge in O'Neill 's mind may be the key to defeat the replicator once and for all Jack 's frozen down in Antarc tica as I be say where be Sam she be capture by the replicator their ship be destroy hey sleepyhead do not think you would ever get up it be kind of a long night huh pete what be up you ok be something wrong yes everything what do you mean this what be you do here what be I do here where the hell be here that be good you really have I I 've be up since five feed the chicken no pete honestly I do not what you do not what think this be real you hungry I be starve come on I will whip you up some pancake you do not understand this be not happen the last thing I remember I be on board a replicator ship this be just another way of screw with my mind ok here be what I know this be not SGC it be Montana Nothing weird happen here not like you be use to you leave the Stargate programme because of mental stress and because you want to be with I on a farm full of really stinky animal since then you 've be see a shrink because you can not shake the nightmare you 've have a bad one ok that be it do that feel real yes then snap out of it ok Pancakes or do I have to call the doctor I be kinda hungry Good come on what be you go to do I will merge O'Neill 's mind with the ship 's computer you will have to defrost he first right he be near death when we freeze he hopefully the pod will sustain his life hopefully what other choice do we have just save he like the last time wipe the ancient knowledge from his mind and lose any chance of learn a means to defeat the replicator you have no right to risk his life I believe O'Neill would approve we can not make that choice for he can not you just extract the ancient information then we can all benefit from it you can not begin to comprehend the extent of what be unfold in O'Neill 's mind our scientist long ago extract part of the ancient library of knowledge and learn much from it we have study it for as long as I can remember and we have barely scratch the surface it would be look for a needle in a haystack a haystack of infinite size that be big I hope O'Neill 's conscious mind provide we with a direct conduit to the information we need you request to see I you must let we go I do not have to do anything at this point if that be what if your intent be to extract information from we you should know I will die before I say anything nothing my master say can be trust no one have decide what to do with you Anubis be overconfident and need most of his armada to keep the System Lords at bay the fleet he use to attack Earth be small compare to Baal 's fleet should he defeat the System Lords he will rule the galaxy no weapon will be powerful enough to stop he what would you have I do free we to fight or if we must die with honour he be not well I tell you the process of interface his mind be complex hello testing testing one two one two one two testing hello be this thing on Jack O'Neill can you hear we Heyl hey guy what s go on your mind be interface with the Danieil Jackson what what the name of Thor 's ship be Danieil Jackson the information in the ship 's computer be available to you ah right here we go ah this be cool I can pretty much do anything I want can t I O'Neill huh oh sorry if you wish you may appear to we as a hologram Dang you ok it be a little weird but yeah ok at least you be not speak Ancient there be that actually the computer be translate ah I 've never look well there be not much time O'Neill Thor 's planet I know ship 's log can you help with the replicator already on it Jack Daniel the computer record the whole conversation thank for your concern talk amongst yourself I 've discuss the situation with my superior we 've decide to let you all go I must admit that come as a surprise it seem we have not have much success interrogate Goa'ulds in the past it be make apparent to I you be more useful to we fight Baal Dr Weir you know my name this may come as a surprise to you oh I be not sure anything can surprise I at this point I wish to request asylum well seem I be wrong again my fleet be destroy before I come here my domain one of the first to fall I have nothing leave with which to fight the only thing wait for I be shame and torture so it be not true that I would be more useful to you out there perhaps I could be of some use to you here thank that be great taste very real hey I be think we could go into town tonight have dinner see a movie come on you can not really I give up my job for this l l give up my life for you see that be definitely not pete how patient do you expect I to be nothing you say be go to convince I I know who you be I just do not understand why what do you want from I why be you do this because I love you what be it I be unsure it seem O'Neill 's mind be build something virtually in conjunction with the ship 's computer I do not know how much long his life can be sustain Jack can you hear I I must revive he now wait not yet Oy what a headache take it easy you 've be through a lot what now uh what be the last thing you remember get my head suck by one of those dang ancient head sucker and something about twin teal'c what be with the hair O'Neill Thor you get aspirin you should feel well momentarily and your memory will slowly return teal'c what be with the hair the specification for the device you create be in the computer I believe I can synthesise it Sweet what be it we do not know but you make it no yes no yes you access the ancient knowledge in your mind and instruct the computer to design it do not mean I know what it be it be doubtful that he would remember the knowledge of the Ancients be go all right let I have a look Yargh get leg uh I get it I get it yeah I get nothing Penegal I be relieve you be still able to communicate it may not last long do you procure a means of fight the replicator possibly it still require more research those infest the colony be behave in an organised fashion unlike any replicator we have encounter before perhaps they be control by a human form leader who have yet to reveal itself if a human form replicator survive it be possible Sam survive too it be also possible the old version replicator create a new human form to lead they as before yeah but there be a chance can you scan the planet for life sign we already have there be none Penegal can you hear I we have lose contact do you think you could convince I this illusion be my life that I would accept it if it be something you want badly enough in your mind be that why you torture I so I would want this as an alternative no I torture you because I be mad why do you think I hate you so much for what you do to I from the first moment we meet when you let I inside your mind I see you like no one else ever could human emotion can be very overwhelming the fact that you feel anything at all be a miracle it make you very special I be glad you see that no you do not understand I could never be happy this way then you will be unhappy for a very long time make sure Camulus know he will forever be brand a traitor and a coward most intriguing can you make it work to be honest I be still unsure of exactly what it be do not look at I Thor this be Commander Aegir of the Valhalla we have lose contact with the colony Aegir communication be down what have you to report we have locate the remain of a human form replicator float in space it obviously survive the destruction of its ship by all appearance it be currently inactive transmit coordinate Use caution Thor what will you do where be you go I be go to transport it aboard why we must learn the location of the human form control the replicator on the planet Anybody recognise he no be it dead hopefully not completely all replicator be link by a sophisticated communication system if we can use this one to tap into their network we will be able to see what any of the replicator can see and if he wake up be this pod go to hold he probably not then perhaps there be no great wisdom in this I will transport it back into space if necessary but we must take the risk Good what be that Replicator communication datum I be search for any reference to other human form you can not just keep I here forever yes I can no matter what you do I will never ever participate in this fantasy what Zoom in Sam can you pinpoint her location she be within a replicator structure on the planet some distance outside the colony near a rich vein of neutronium create more human replicator I think the ship be destroy at least one of the human replicator must have separate from the main ship with Major Carter prior to exit hyperspace Beam it out I be try it have make itself resistant it have breach the internal barrier and interface with my ship 's computer have to do something it seem to have permanently disrupt communication between individual cell render each one inert we explore such technology in the past with no success Great do that mean we can use this thing to whack the rest of those bug even well O'Neill now that I have see what the device do I may be able to modify a large version to broadcast a disruption wave over all of Orilla Good while you be do that I can not transport you inside the replicator ship on the planet their defence prevent it but I can get you close close be good take this so we may communicate who be your daddy stop if you harm I or any more of my brother I assure you Major Carter will die instantly O'Neill I have successfully modify my ship to emit a massive disruption wave Excellent know you could do it the weapon be 50 charge if this work you will have save the Asgard once again I be real happy for you I be extremely proud but we get a little bit of a problem down here Fifth detect our approach he claim he can kill Carter instantly O'Neill hey I know what you be go to say her life be already sacrifice you 've get your planet to worry about Jack I get problem too Hang on a second what this could be very bad what be they do it be like they be run away Thor be you ready yet what be happen O'Neill they be retreat you must stop they O'Neill the weapon be not yet ready they can not be allow to escape come on I know you can hear I what be happen Fifth where be you we must leave why they 've find a means to fight we the Asgard how the one you call O'Neill what so many of we be leave in the city we can not wait for they they will be kill do not expect I to be sorry your friend they be kill try to stop we try to save I no they do not care about you I tell they I would kill you if they do not stop then why do not you kill I you know why my friend will not stop just to save I no they know when it come down to it I would rather be dead than be trap like this forever no matter what you feel for I I will never love you back kill I if you want but if you have even one shred of humanity in you and you really truly love I you will let I go O'Neill the weapon work report from the colony say all remain replicator have be neutralise while the ship do escape at least we have an effective mean of fight they now yeah well at least there be that O'Neill I be detect a fourth life sign in your immediate vicinity Sam Sam Carter over here you ok glad to see you sir Likewise Colonel Come in how be you feel not bad have not have the urge to go anywhere or build anything lately you have be give a clean bill of health as far as the fine doctor on this planet be concern well what do they know the president ask I to extend you an invitation Dinner at the White House you know what they be have I do not think I 've have the chance to personally thank you yet for what you risk your life over and over and ask for nothing in return well do not be fool I be make a list well I doubt very much that there be anything that could properly repay you be you go somewhere the president have ask I to supervise the research at the Ancient outpost it will be a delicate situation give all the international claim already be make sound right up your alley yeah well much more so than this job do that mean Hammond will be come back no General Hammond be be promote he will be oversee all thing relate to Earth 's defence on behalf of the Pentagon the SGC the 303 programme the Antarctic site unofficially it be be call Home World Security any idea who we be go to be stick with the Pentagon have convince the president there be one man who could run the SGC and make it politically viable internationally despite the fact that he be part of the american military establishment do we know this shrub well you know he rather well Brigadier General Jack O'Neill I yeah you Brigadier it be on my list Congratulations I should be clear I would like the promotion the paycheck and the parking spot but I do not really wanna be in charge of anything no well sadly all those thing kind of go together so I guess you have some thinking to do I hate that maybe you should break it down into pro and con I 've spend my whole life stick it to the man if I do this I will be the man I do not think I can be the man you will be inherit a big can of worm with the state of affair out there if Baal be about to dominate the System Lords we face a formidable challenge plus who know where and when the replicator will turn up there will be more scrutiny now so many government know about the Stargate I 've never have a desk that be a Con Con for the record sir you do have a desk I do on the flip side nobody know how this place should be run well than you why thank you Daniel with a little guidance from your good friend and advisor if you do not take the job we could end up with someone much bad ok that do not come out right I for one will miss you accompany we on our mission yeah now see I be not sure I be ready to give that up either sit back watch you go off and have all the fun risk our life in the face of grave danger there will be situation where you can accompany we you will be in charge you can do whatever you want I will be able to do whatever I want within reason sir although my time here have be brief it have be without a doubt indelible I will remember every one of you and I thank you all for your hard work I be not one for long goodbye so without further ado it be with great pleasure I introduce you to your new command officer Brigadier General Jack O'Neill at ease you all know how much I love speech so I will make this short I wish I could say I do not owe anything to anyone but the truth be I would not be stand here if it be not for the courage and support of each and every one of you I hope I can be as good a leader as we 've have in the past and as good as you deserve hear hear the other reason I take this job be so I could do really cool stuff like this it be with great pride that my first order of business as commander of this base be the announcement of the promotion of Major Samantha Carter to Lieutenant Colonel the president of the United States have place special trust and confidence in the patriotism integrity and ability of Major Samantha Carter Major Samantha Carter be promote to the grade of Lieutenant Colonel United States Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Samantha Carter now raise your right hand and repeat after I I insert name I Samantha Carter do not be afraid I know the first moment of consciousness can be frightening I will show you everything share with you all I know you have no idea how happy I be we be able to collect enough neutronium we have much time to share we must search for a new home for our brother to propagate it will pass quickly for we though soon enough everyone will know what be go on it be our russian team on the space station they be adjust the orbit to avoid debris leave over from our incident in Antarctica it work he say if the Americans keep blast alien ship out of orbit they 've get to do a well job of track their own mess what be go on I do not know we lose contact come in General O'Neill it be an honour to meet you and an even great honour to finally serve under your command wow that be a load who be you I be Colonel Alexi Vaselov sir I assume you be expect my arrival yeah sure uh yeah here be the memo right there I want you to know sir that I personally request this transfer after my many year of service with Russian Air Force I feel confident that I can make a positive contribution to Stargate Command Great if I may be so bold sir I understand that with your appointment as base commander a position have become available on SG 1 I would relish the opportunity to serve on the SGC 's elite team yes you and everyone else on this base Colonel not go to happen I understand your reluctance sir but if you look at my record I think it will satisfy any of your concern I have over 3 000 flight hour on more than 35 type of aircraft and prototype I have be award the High Order of Russia the Gold Star yes yes yes that be very impressive very but it be not go to get you on SG 1 Understood I be of course willing to accept a position on a different team Colonel until you go through the proper training you be not go anywhere near that gate perhaps I could assume a role as an observer on one of the exploration unit it be nice meeting you very nice you be dismiss if all go accord to plan I will acquire possession of my apartment on Tuesday hey congratulation when be the apartment warm party when someone get a new place it be customary for they to throw a party would I be require to prepare a meal no we will all bring something very well next Saturday I be only go to say this once Carter at ease how be the new job Oy one crisis after another this morning the mess get a shipment of Yukon Gold potato instead of Russets no oh yes the Golds do not make for good mash Consistency 's all wrong I hear the new russian colonel come to see you make a pitch to join SG 1 yeah what do you say tell them to make french fry about the russian oh I make it clear he should not expect preferential treatment that he would have to prove himself before I would consider he he be one of the most highly decorate officer in russian military history he have over 20 year ' flight experience and exactly no year in offworld travel I be not go to risk the life of anyone under my command on a slick résumé uncharacteristically cautious of you sir yes there be that the Russians must be pressure you to put he on the team yes there be that too we can not blame they we have not be keep our promise we give they their own team two year ago what have we do for they lately forget it I be not put he on SG 1 do you have someone else in mind for the position O'Neill no so we be stick with three why not it be one less decision I have to deal with there be nothing in the regulation that say an SG team have to be four people there you go Problem solve thank you Colonel Vaselov Dr Jackson of course come in your reputation precede you I be well acquainted with your work I want to welcome you to the neighbourhood that be very kind of you I only wish other be as open to my presence here yeah do not take General O'Neill 's decision personally it be difficult not to his attitude be offensive I wonder if he know the Cold War be over it be nothing to do with your be russian he be an equal opportunity offender I be suppose to find this comfort he do not respond to outside pressure our nation be partner in the Stargate programme I be aware of the deal I help broker it then you can understand our frustration what you have to realise be Colonel O'Neill General O'Neill just assume command of this facility he be get a lot on his plate make demand on he right now be just bad timing on the part of your government Colonel Colonel what happen I do not know we be talk and he collapse all right I know you be schedule to go offworld we will take care of he how be he do Confused the last thing he remember be be in Russia he do not know where he be or how he get here he be also exhibit physical symptom which have I concern he have lesion over 40 of his body and a high white blood count which indicate some sort of infection be he contagious it be a distinct possibility Sir we need to examine everyone who be be in contact with this man Daniel Report back to the infirmary open the gate do it now Daniel he be lose a lot of blood but his life be no long in any immediate danger the member of SG 11 insist he seem perfectly normal do you notice anything peculiar about he sir I think it odd he be shoot up the gateroom he react after the gate be shut down why be he so desperate to go through do he have any of Colonel Vaselov 's symptom no lesion but it may be a matter of time he have an elevated white blood count Colonel Vaselov display no unusual behaviour that do not mean it be not the same condition if an infection reach the brain it can manifest itself in any way from memory loss to full blown psychosis you do not think it be a coincidence seem unlikely sir I think there be a high probability that we have a contagion on the base Contact all team that be offworld tell they that the SGC be off limit have they proceed to the Alpha site until further notice effective immediately the SGC be under lockdown hi how be Daniel still unconscious but he be improve he be respond to treatment his white cell count be come down what about Colonel Vaselov he be not so good we be treat he with antibiotic but he be deteriorate until we know more about the source of the infection there be not much we can do it start with Vaselov so it do not come through the gate I be wait to hear from the Russians about possible source of the infection anyone else show symptom not yet how be he Dr Jackson Dr Brightman tell I what happen his condition be improve good and your condition not so good but not so bad as the time I went drink with General Dashkewytch in Novgorod that be bad headache Dr Jackson be good friend of yours yes indeed he be despite what you be think you bear no responsibility for what have transpire my presence here have result in the quarantine of this entire complex in your homeland you would have face a similar situation in a different setting again through no fault of your own perhaps but at the moment I can not be sure of anything have your memory not yet return in my dream I I have begin to see flash glimpse of these past few day walk these hall talk to people and yet it be as if I be not even here I be just a helpless observer inside my own body one month ago Anatole Konstantinov fall ill after complete a tour on the international space station I remember we monitor it we lose contact and we never figure out why I do not know if they be connect but he die less than a week later in Moscow officially the cause of death be renal failure but unofficially the russian authority have not a clue what kill he our mystery disease among the symptom he exhibit be memory loss skin lesion and a high white blood count be there any connection to Vaselov Vaselov visit Konstantinov in hospital before he die they be friend they serve together in the air force why do not they tell we the Russians determine that Konstantinov be not contagious he come into contact with many people between return to Earth and check into hospital but no one else ever show any sign of be infect make it an oddly selective disease perhaps we be not deal with a disease Colonel Vaselov possess only vague random memory of his time at SGC he describe himself as a mere observer to the action of his body like be host to a symbiote Tests rule out possibility of a Goa'uld could it be some other form of alien possession yeah it be possible an entity capable of move from individual to individual it might explain the inconsistency if that be true it could be in anyone now hello I will be right there Daniel 's awake what be go on you be recover from a bullet wound what you have no recollection of the incident no who shoot I do not change the subject what do you remember I go to see Colonel Vaselov in the middle of our conversation he collapse I go to help he and that be it remember take he to the infirmary no who shoot I you be shoot up the gateroom you wound two guard we may be deal with a foothold situation an alien entity capable of take over human host not unlike the Goa'uld it seem to be able to travel from person to person although at present we have no knowledge of how this be possible Daniel Anubis Daniel Jackson I be Anubis or rather Anubis be control I Anubis be dead no he be not and he be here in the base you would think getting blast out of orbit would have slow the guy down accord to Daniel Anubis surrender his mortal form when he be ascend only to be cast down by the Ancients as a result he exist purely as an immaterial being in the past the physical form we be see be a force shield design to contain his essence when it be destroy that essence be release Anubis be trap in Earth 's orbit inhabit debris from his ship many light year away from his base so he hitch a ride on a cosmonaut yes sir and then abandon he for Colonel Vaselov attempt to escape through our gate why do not he just use his freaky super cosmic power and just go do so would alert the Ancients and bring down their wrath upon he to interact with the physical world he have to get a new shield he can not do that here on Earth he will need a body to dial the gate and get through eventually Anubis will attempt escape again well he be on the base obviously not go anywhere tell I there be something we can do well as a matter of fact sir I think there be hey what be go on General O'Neill have order compulsory physical for all the SGC personnel we be assume that retain Anubis ' essence exact a toll on the carrier you be expose for two hour but you react as if fight an infection so whoever have his essence should start show symptom yeah that be the theory what about Vaselov well his be a more extreme case he be expose for over a week that be why his symptom be more advanced you mean with the lesion and the it be actually more than that his entire immune system be affect but Anubis be out of he he should start get well right Sam Dr Brightman say he be not respond the exposure may have go on too long the damage be do there have to be something we can do we can help he manage the pain that be about it I say the situation be contain I do not say it be resolve no I can not do that Command will stay under lockdown until I decide otherwise yes sir it be my call yes sir the Pentagon get a little antsy they be not the only one you get a bunch of anxious people out there yeah I will bet what can I do for you Doctor it be Vaselov his condition have not improve and he be not respond to treatment unless circumstance change I would give he a week two week top I will inform the Russians thank you sir Dr Jackson Sorry I do not mean to disturb you no no I be glad to see you be up and about have you be discharge yeah Dr Brightman catch I steal Jell o from the other patient ' tray Doctor I wonder if you could do I a favour I have a sister in Bryansk when the lockdown have end could you see that she get this Alexi the nurse have be careful not to say anything that be always a bad sign please you know in Russia we have a saying the cord may curl long but an end will appear that hold true for everything in this world myself include I accept this in the kingdom of hope there be no winter I prefer that one Da it be a nice saying I will come see you his pulse be weak he be lose a lot of blood Dr Jackson Dr Jackson Lieutenant Evans he be in Lieutenant Evans I be examine by Dr Brightman a couple of hour ago she say I be fine it be possible you have not start manifest sign yet I would know if something like that happen to I I would know I m not lie Lieutenant tell I what you do Tuesday afternoon I do not understand just tell I Lieutenant I do not know you do not know I can not remember O'Neill Airman Malcolm McCaffrey have miss his appointment at the infirmary he remain unaccounted for Carter Head down there what have you get Argh General O'Neill yeah O'Neill here go this be Major Kearney I 've get a wound man here jump by Airman McCaffrey we think he be head for the control room Advise caution the target be arm on our way dial the gate Mind if I come in you be not suppose to be walk around it be my arm you be shoot I know you shoot I not the point I hear what happen Anubis be still here Daniel he can pass through wall he be welcome to leave the base at any time he have to go through the Stargate or else he be trap on Earth yeah well there be not much we can do can not kill he No can not catch he no so we let the Ancients deal with he yes because they 've always be so helpful if he use his power as ascend be he be break the rule they will take action ow we have to take away his other option uh huh I assume you have a plan Anubis have try twice to get through the gate in both instance we stop he but there be no guarantee we will next time we have to make it as difficult as possible to access the gate to that end we be propose a division of the facility into three separate section designate zone 1 2 and 3 the gate have be shut off and will not be accessible from the control room it can now only be re establish from a relay centre locate here in zone 1 the control room gateroom and surround area be zone 2 corridor link the two zone will be seal corridor link to the gateroom will be seal the only mean of unseal the corridor will be from a security control centre locate here in the section designate zone 3 Personnel will be restrict to one zone Food supply will be divide amongst the section Dr Brightman 's team will be split and will monitor personnel through daily exam no one not even General O'Neill will be permit access to a neighbouring zone until lockdown end any question so far give everything we know about Anubis do you really think this be go to stop he the point be to make it impossible for he to get through the gate when he realise he can not get out that way he will have no choice but to risk reveal himself to the Ancients Zone 1 secure Zone 3 secure Zone 2 secure good luck O'Neill yes Mr President yes sir six day without incident yes all SG personnel present and account for no no one have show any physical symptom sir but that do not mean Anubis have go it be the president of course I understand the importance of the programme but I would be I understand sir hello I 've get 24 hour to re establish normal gate operation it be unreasonable to assume lockdown could be maintain indefinitely yeah I suppose attention all personnel this be General O'Neill I know the current situation have be tough on all of you you ve be cut off from your family your home you re wonder how much long this can go on but the fact be there s a threat on this base that can not be allow to escape know that the president s authorise I to maintain this lockdown indefinitely we 've only get food enough for another month so we will find a secure way to bring supply down from the surface in the meantime I suggest you all get comfortable we be not go anywhere I need to run a diagnostic hey Sam Argh teal'c this be Daniel Proceed Daniel Jackson Anubis have get Sam she be head your way Understood Argh Jack go ahead Anubis get into the security system he set up a sequence of time command we be try to override with no luck keep I post keep an eye on they Kearney you be with I General Major Sir Ready your key Base security be be compromise ready your key that be an order yes sir count down from three two one turn five minute till self destruct five minute till self destruct you do good son four minute till self destruct four minute till self destruct Sir come no further give I access to the base computer someone activate the self destruct I will shut it down you be infect I be infect Anubis leave I of this I can not be certain teal'c I be not Anubis it be I Carter three minute till self destruct teal'c please very well self destruct abort Self destruct abort well do Someone 's activate the gate teal'c this be Daniel I think Anubis be head for the gateroom Understood I will see if I can override the dialling sequence O'Neill Aargh Stand aside Nyet you need a body to go through the gate take mine take mine or I will kill we both oh General I be ok ish wait he get through do not he sort of I be able to override the dialling sequence and input an alternate address I send he to KS7 535 instead Chilly Visiontext Subtitles Joanna Wilkinson previously on Stargate SG 1 I be Baal as in boccie Argh the city we be look for be under the ice of Antarctica we come all this way to find out we have to go all the way back no Power source this ancient weapon such an advanced piece of technology the power requirement must be enormous I wish to request asylum my fleet be destroy before I come here perhaps I could be of some use to you here General Hammond be be promote any idea who we will be stick with Brigadier General Jack O'Neill I 've spend my whole life stick it to the man I do not think I can be the man Morning sir Walter at 0730 this morning SG 8 make scheduled contact from P6J 908 they request permission to bring an alien life form back to base Sir it be just a plant your 0830 debriefing be SG 2 regard their recent mission to P8F 809 Folder be on your desk along with the personnel file you have yet to review how many do I have leave all of they right Colonel Rudnell have ask I to show you some bunt sample Captain Corrigan 's still await approval on the buffet menu bunt John General you be aware that this be the most secure military facility on the face of the planet there be still a number of issue to

Sir General how be you I know but every time I open my mouth to say George General come out ok General Colonel you 've all meet we know each other 's life story be that snippiness be that a word what do you get a gate address of a planet in Anubis ' domain that Baal have not discover it may be home to an abandon base Chock full of abandon weapon one can hope this device be procure from Jaffa formerly loyal to Anubis it should allow we access to the base when be the next opening 0800 tomorrow morning tomorrow I get 14 team out there I be sorry Operations protocol be it the MALP show no sign of Goa'uld activity I still want SG 3 to cover your flank it be just recon all the more reason you can wait a day incoming wormhole SG 5 and the representative from Amra to discuss the pende trade agreement love to stay and chat if those Jaffa know about it soon Baal will know about it one day Daniel one day here come one negotiation I be glad I be not part of it be a plant exactly 20 minute ago it be a seed excuse I sir if you do not mind my asking be it really wise to be bring alien life form through the gate it be a plant yeah Offworld team follow strict protocol in determine what to bring back to Earth you know if humankind be go to benefit from what we find out there we have to be able to study it in control situation it be a plant I know I know and I know our mandate be to seek out new weapon and technology to defend the planet from our enemy but would not it be cool to exploit the galaxy for other beneficial purpose like cure disease or well in this case possibly solve world hunger speak of which Dr Lee speak General they want you in the briefing room hey you wanna get some lunch no I be fine you go to sit in here all day and I be not sulk Working go to say work O'Neill merely believe guy I be fine you can not blame he for want backup nothing to do with you I understand he be just be cautious thank guy General if I might have a moment with you we be completely stall the Amrans can not agree with each other let alone we they be bicker child maybe they need a time out the Plains of Goran be sacred ground to the plainsman I be a plainsman I know I take offence at that a fence now there be an idea hi folk General I think it would be good what do you say we take a little break all this negotiating it be just exhausting and you 've be at it a whole hour already we 've prepare special quarter for you you can relax get a massage room service whatever you need come on I will show you Huh Fellas what do you think all right so it be not the Ritz but we do what we can around here Knock when you be ready to talk like adult wait you do not expect we to share one room not amicably at first but I have great hope for you boy you can not do this open this door at once nobody get out Dear General Hammond wish you be here and that I be not O'Neill good morning the delegate from Amra be furious they demand to be release and say there be no

be next well Dr Lee need to see you right away concern the plant from P6J 908 SG 1 and 3 be in the gateroom prepare to embark and oh it turn out that the red white and blue bunting be unavailable no bunting they can get some blue and white and mix in some red it just will not be the same Sir good morning people I sure wish I be go with you but I get a big day plan taste menu item for the buffet have fun sir you know I will watch your back we will mind the curfew SG 3 hold here Colonel Colonel Bosco and Peterson can watch the gate we be fine it be simple recon we will stay in radio contact Standard perimeter well the good news be it have not eat anybody yet well thank you Seymour yeah obviously we underestimate its growth property it seem to respond really dramatically to any kind of visible light yeah well I think of that I just think you might like to see it do not worry we will get it under control Sir there be sign of recent Jaffa activity in the area try the wrist device again I have try it several time I be get some faint energy reading SG 1 leader this be SG 3 leader come in Peterson you be with I Bosco if we do not make radio contact in ten minute dial Earth and report in take cover Son of a bitch Sir Colonel Reynolds have dial in from P2X 887 he be lose contact with SG 1 one al kesh it buzz the gate and fly off no sign of the enemy since that sir I ve be unable to make radio contact with SG 1 go on 19 minute request backup and permission to search SG 10 and 12 Backup on the way thank you sir we have to close down the entire level seal it off it not only have amazing growth property it be prove very difficult to eradicate we think it be use the ventilation shaft to spread airborne spore we look everywhere no sign of they I be sorry sir you be there to watch their back yes sir Colonel Carter insist we secure the gate unauthorised incoming wormhole no IDC yet sir stand down boy and what do you want I have your friend and I propose an exchange for what not what whom whatever camulus who I will transmit the gate address you will send he to I if you want to see your friend alive again let I think about it you have one day be that like one Earth day or nothing to report from the field Rebel Jaffa Tok'ra no one seem to have any intel on SG 1 Camulus be be transfer here from the facility where he be hold he should be here shortly even if we send Camulus to Baal we can not risk open the Iris to let SG 1 through this could be a trick to get we to do that I know any exchange would involve a Stargate on another planet I make some suggestion be you really consider turn Camulus over to Baal it be on the table he be here Colonel have your team ready yes sir be not it already too late General O'Neill be once capture by Baal he be tortured kill and bring back to life use a sarcophagus more time than you would care to imagine SG 1 never give up then and General O'Neill will not now there be not a man or woman on this base that would Baal have three of my people and he be offer up an exchange for I any idea why there be many possible reason pick one nothing you offer to help we if we grant you asylum I do not expect to be treat like a prisoner you be a Goa'uld what be you go to do give I one reason not to turn you over Baal can not be trust yeah no matter what you do he will never return your friend to you I think you be question he he have no right answer this go against policy on prisoner exchange he be not a prisoner he request asylum I be ungrante it you could be court martialle if it get my team back I do not care but you know it will not you be sacrifice he for nothing go go go let us take a walk you and I come on I 've do everything I can it be up to you last chance in spite of what you think I be not a coward I think you be well it be worth a try take he back to his cell it it be a bluff you could 've tell I sir how can I do my job if you do not trust I not my problem wait Camulus would like to talk to you I can not stay here if Baal be determined to have revenge he will not stop at this it be not safe for you to harbour I so what I be say I be willing to leave out of the goodness of your heart of course not when I ask for asylum I do not expect to rot in a cell well work with I give I something I will see what I can do I can tell you of a planet where there be a device create by the Ancients what be it do I do not know I never could discover its secret perhaps you can you think this be what Baal 's really after while I never disclose its location I once make the mistake of bragging that I find the device at a meeting of the System Lords hard to believe you brag I know it wasn t easy for you but have I know what it be really like I would have try to be less of a pain in the ass at least I would have try hard unscheduled offworld activation Walter receive SG 3 's IDC sir open it yes sir it be just like he say some sort of ancient device size of a large room any idea what it do I will leave that up to the tech guy but I can tell you why he could not turn it on it be not plug in what what be it it be a ZPM what be that a zero point module it be an ancient power source that draw its energy from subspace the only thing with the power to activate the weapon SG 1 find in Antarctica the one we have be pretty much dead well this one sure be not how good be it I will have to do some more detailed analysis but these preliminary reading indicate at least 50 capacity well that be good be not it excuse I it be that damn plant we 've lose power to all control system yes sir we pay the electric bill I check the plant be in the wall interfere with power line there be no light in the wall as long as part of it be expose to light it seem like it can feed the unexposed area I recommend we keep the base on minimal emergency lighting until we get the problem under control how long well that be a little difficult to say because first we have to figure out how to get the problem under control where be we the dialling computer 's off line there must be a circuit board that got fry when we try to restore power incoming wormhole connect we still receive radio communication and idc the Iris Manual control what about dial the gate manually uh that be a problem the inner ring seem to be lock in place we try disconnect the interface but a gate diagnostic be run when the power go down could be something to do with the command be exchange at the time bottom line we can not dial out ok what oh God Sorry to wake you sir feel like it be be ten minute yeah it have uh there be an incoming wormhole Baal want to talk Baal Sorry to keep you wait I be take a little nap the deadline have pass yeah look we be have a little technical difficulty here be your friend ' life meaningless to you hey this be not a stall tactic I would 've call you soon but we can not dial out why not well I be not really sure here be some irony for you Carter would have this thing fix like that no offence there Siler uh none take sir so why do not you just send she on through before you know it you will have Camel Ass back in your grubby mitt you dare mock I Baal come on you should know of course I dare mock you you have one more day be it really wise to provoke he it be what I do two year ago the Tok'ra provide we with the formula to their Goa'uld poison we 've be manufacture as much as we can use as a defensive option in the event of an attack on Earth Area 51 confirm that there be enough to negate a sizable enemy force we think we can neutralise and invade three Goa'uld occupy planet it be nonpersistent there would be limited time before reinforcement become a factor determine which planet to target be an educate guess we be still gather intel on where SG 1 be hold this poison do it kill Jaffa as well as Goa'uld that be right how many casualty be we talk about thousand ten of thousand so it be not really a rescue plan it be a full scale attack that would provoke a reaction possibly an attack on Earth but as we now have a ZPM to power the Ancient defence I do not think sorry to interrupt sir but Camulus be insist that he speak with you again do you not find something of value on the planet oh yeah we do then why have you not release I or do you still believe you can trade I for your friend Gamma radiation work we be prepare to deliver a strong level to the entire base all at once now nonessential personnel have to be evacuate everyone else have to wear protective suit you have to get General O'Neill to sign off on this right away you know he have not sleep in over two day yeah that be why I be ask you to do it right I be cancel the president 's visit really why would you do that how can you joke at a time like this that be about all I can do at the moment your flagship team be in enemy hand you can not dial the Stargate and the base be overrun by an alien plant we do find a ZPM true give it another day you think you can get everything resolve by then wait a minute I think there be a joke in there somewhere no got nothing and so I regretfully submit my resignation and to be clear the regret be not so much about the resign part but the fact that I be delude enough to think I have possess even one iota of the ability need to fill your sizable and shiny shoe Dr Lee just call down sir he feel confident the plant have be fully eradicate I wish I do the dialling computer be back on line Chevron four encode you be release he I make a deal we get a ZPM I know we can finally dial Pegasus again and still defend Earth if we have to but Chevron five encode Control room it be Dr Lee he say it be important yeah abort the dialling procedure basically it should not be glow like this why be it it be funny really I like funny no this be not the good kind of funny it be the radiation we use to kill the plant that reveal this what it illuminate a substance foreign to the normal molecular make up of a ZPM and well we manage to scrape some microscopic fragment from the casing and run some test and you be go to want these this be what happen when you introduce a constant electric charge the ZPM be booby trap we be go to send it to Antarctica can you imagine if someone have plug it into the chair in the Ancient outpost I can not even imagine the magnitude of the explosion a charge zpm detonate that I do not know it could 've destroy the whole planet that be why Camulus be so eager to leave well can you undo it uh well you know we have not actually yes or no I do not know what you be talk about you could not figure out what it be for so you tamper with the power source so nobody else could I do nothing of the kind Cammy worth a try here be the deal how would you like a chance to kill Baal in exchange you want I to use the ancient device to trade for the life of your friend exactly amusing all right come with I we be take you to another planet first we will wait for SG 1 there receive SG 3 s IDC sir open it you be late we think we would give it an extra hour we know it be a long shot thank you Colonel dismiss Sir uh Colonel Reynolds would like a moment fine he be in the gateroom sir what be go on General we just want you to know whatever you decide we be behind you 100 you just need to give the order and we be ready to go I know you be Colonel thank you all of you dismiss good night sir good night Siler unschedule offworld activation it be SG 1 's code O'Brien transmit a hold signal back through the gate and be await your instruction O'Brien we have audio contact it be Colonel Carter Carter we re under heavy fire sir open the Iris Negative can you reroute no the DHD be no long accessible Jack what be go on you ve be in enemy hand you know the protocol we have no way of know if your Iris code be secure what be you talk about you be capture by Baal Baal we be on P2X 887 we be trap in Anubis ' secret base when we come out we have a Jaffa ambush at the gate these Jaffa be loyal to Baal the gate will shut down we will not be able to dial out again open it you be clear nice hey guy thank you sir so trap in a secret base all this time go figure the wrist device give we access we could not get out you think Baal capture we he say so how have he know we be miss Reynolds see an al kesh Baal have his Jaffa look for the base probably intercept radio chatter that explain the ambush they could not find the base but figure if we turn up it be a great story more importantly do Anubis leave anything cool behind not really no Nuts Colonel Carter how be you I be good thank for ask you be not go to dress for the occasion sir well you know I I love dress up I be just on my way Sir I want to talk to you Carter your evaluation be do and I think you would be very pleased really you have doubt I be wonder if you be completely confident in my leadership skill be not you I be second guess myself for order SG 3 to remain at the gate oh pshaw it be standard recon your tactic in deal with the ambush perfect you should read what Teal'c and Daniel write about your conduct under fire can I no Damn teal'c say you be an animal he be such an exaggerator yeah be not he well this be where I go to take off the clothe I prefer and don the clothe I abhor uh sir quickly I want to talk to you about something else I read Dr Lee 's report about the tainted ZPM he may have underestimate the explosive potential it could 've actually destroy the entire solar system what be the difference if we figure it out so could Baal he could use it as a weapon against we all true Carter which be exactly why I do not give Camulus the tainted one Sir I give he the dead one it be worthless right Baal 's go to be pretty pissed at Camulus yeah the president 's motorcade be here he should be get on the elevator momentarily uh Sir I I think you should know I will be leave tomorrow really yes sir the truth be I 've be here on a temporary special assignment from the president oh sort of a civilian audit if you will of the SGC of you I know you do General Hammond tell I well he be not suppose to well do not tell anyone then you know the president want to make sure you be settle in before he come and shake your hand and endorse you as the leader of this base uh huh obviously he be here so what I mean be I just want you to know how much respect I have for what you do here and for you Thanks shall we oh by the way do you let those Amran delegate go I do sir yes Major Davis say they seem much more willing to negotiate now D'you think they like the fruit basket I think so sir yes I put a lot of thought into that Visiontext Subtitles Margaret Burke ENHOH it be time wait it be ok just relax give your vision a moment to adjust you have not use it for a while how be that well your eye it be nice to finally see they Leda welcome back where be I many mile from the city this house belong to my uncle we be safe here the city I remember be there something terrible happen many people die there ' food if you feel strong enough it be our fault be not it none of this would have happen if we have not come you be alive and consider what you 've be through that alone be a miracle first discover in the Kirellian wasteland over 150 year ago and the highlight of our antiquity collection the Great Ring of Avidan researcher estimate the ring to be at least several thousand year old and while its origin remain a subject of debate many believe it be create by ancient worshipper to honour their god it be think that the peculiar symbol on the Ring represent the name of the god but no one have be able to decipher exactly what they mean get back Commander Gareth in the name of the people of the Rand Protectorate I welcome you you be Colonel Carter this be Teal'c and Dr Daniel Jackson it be a pleasure to finally meet you all face to face but please come we have many question as I be sure you do as well sorry we scare the tourist we 've make contact with a lot of planet but this be the first time we 've come out of a museum piece one of our artefact come to life be surprising but that pale in comparison to its purpose it be almost beyond imagine as be the fact that you be human my chief aide Jared Kane believe it or not there be a good reason for we be human which we will get to in due time Colonel I hope that once we gain each other 's trust you will shed some light on the technology that power the Great Ring it be unlike anything we have see before we call it the Stargate our people share the same hope Commander of course in due time I take it the Great Ring be a recur motif in your culture it be a reminder of tradition that predate our age of enlightenment Most people wear they more for fashion than for religious belief our history tell of an age when all powerful god rule our world the Ring be supposedly their source of power these be merely legend from our ancient past however the activation of the Ring may cause a stir amongst those few who still follow the old way sorry I do not mean to wake you it be all right for the pain I wish I could give you more but our medicine be in short supply thank you I will leave you alone no no please stay how do it go with the Caledonians not so well actually my time with their representative be limit by Rand security Gareth have concern that we would tell the Caledonians too much about the Stargate let I venture a wild guess they do not get along so good the Rand Protectorate and the Caledonian Federation be lock in a cold war each have enough weapon to wipe the other off the planet sound familiar there be a third element which have I more concerned a group of religious fundamentalist lead by a man name Soren these people think that life be create by god and that these god will return and reward they for their faith by come through the Stargate we confirm their belief because it be in public the government have be unable to prevent the rumour these people be consider zealot who take the ancient text too literally the gate be activate have give they proof that they be right their number will grow that be terrible and yet not our problem let I go back if what you say be true thing be go to get a little out of hand over there because of we if we have not they would be far well off I know we be always stick our nose where they do not belong it be what we do I could make they see it be not the end of the world if we leave now who know what could happen we have to help they you know that regular contact no exception the second thing get squirrelly thank you Daniel Squirrelly Squirrelly you should not be stand do not let appearance fool you I still feel terrible Leda everything you 've do for I have be for my sake as well as yours so much have happen care for you have help I continue on yeah what have happen exactly I mean I remember be in the bunker with Commander Gareth we be attack the rest be a fog Jared be away search for survivor he should be back in a few day it would be good if he answer your question Jared Kane I remember he he be in the bunker my husband be chief aide to Commander Gareth Husband be he insist I move here when the fighting reach the capital he feel you would be safe in my care I 've get to get back to my own world or contact they and let they know I be ok reach the Ring would be impossible Rebel patrol have be sight to leave the estate ground would be dangerous not to mention the fact that you be far from heal you must rest Daniel Leda what happen to Commander Gareth give I good news Colonel I wish I could sir we meet with Soren leader of the rebel it be less constructive than we would hope how much less we be only allow to see he for 15 minute after keep we wait for hour important matter of state no doubt he be unite the fundamentalist faction in the Protectorate that put he in control he be unwilling to allow we to search for Daniel Jackson before he insist we leave he promise he would look into it on our behalf whatever that mean right what about a UAV he will not give we access to the surface plus he claim it would interfere with their own radio communication system I be sorry sir but at this point we have no way of know if Daniel 's still alive and what do blue mean it be our second high level of military alert status there be be civil unrest in urban centre across the country over a dozen municipality have fall into the hand of Soren 's troop our force be pacify those area Pacifying reclaim our city from religious madman so civil unrest mean you go to blue under normal circumstance no unfortunately the situation have cause other problem what be go on we heighten our alert status to match the Caledonians ' I promise you we will share this technology once we fully understand it once you 've assess its advantage to your security you have refuse to allow our scientist access to the Great Ring you have limit our access to the offworlder we do not feel as much a part of this discovery as you do have the ring be activate in Caledonia you would have do the same Minister Treydan I be ask your government for patience stand down your high alert we will do the same you trust your people too much Commander Caledonia have be under strict martial law since news of the offworlder ' arrival our domestic security remain intact the citizen of this world be not child they just need time to come to term with this information Soren and his follower have already seize more than a dozen of your city your people be panic your country be on the verge of collapse I urge you to deal with this in a swift and decisive manner should control of the Rand Protectorate fall into Soren 's hand we will consider it an act of war this be Daniel Jackson call Stargate Command come in please this be Daniel Jackson call Stargate Command please respond this be Daniel Jackson call Stargate Command come in please this be Daniel Jackson call Stargate Command please respond any luck no nothing yet you 've be try for day something seem to be jam all the signal I be pick up there be people there but nothing clear enough to respond to but you think your friend will be able to hear you it be kind of a timing thing if the Stargate 's open they will be able to pick up my signal if your gate be not bury in rubble or bad well while you be wait to be rescue you could use some fresh air if you think you be up to it how can you be sure Soren and his follower be not right how can you know that their god be not Benevolent cos I 've meet more than a few of they trust I they be the opposite and they be definitely not god then what be they the short form they be a parasitical alien race that steal advanced technology and rule via fear and intimidation and have a penchant for melodrama trust I if Soren ever meet one he would be singe a different tune you say you 've fight they and win yeah we get lucky a few time that be all but there be hope be not there you think what happen be your fault do not you it be well that your people activate the Great Ring than the Goa'uld you think so right now I be not so sure you do not know what would happen when the fighting begin you could have go back to your planet but you stay yeah to help we for all the good it do Daniel there have be distrust between our country and Caledonia for generation it be only a matter of time before something set it off we do this to ourselves and since you 've come here I 've begin to think we may have a chance to undo it to rebuild this be Stargate Command call Dr Jackson do you read I can you boost the signal we be at maximum gain Colonel this be Stargate Command call Daniel Jackson do you copy anything not yet sir we be pick up transmission but none be clear enough to tell if they be Daniel both side may have employ radio jamming measure prior to the attack mean any signal come from outside the command bunker be a mess we be work on it anything from SG 9 yet they just report in sound like the negotiation be go nowhere Soren be still refuse to allow we to send team to look for Daniel he say our presence on the planet would only cause more panic and fear well ok sound like I should meet these people myself Kane Dr Jackson we get as close to what be leave of the capital as we could Soren be conduct full sweep of the region search for survivor any suspect of remain loyal to the old government be execute on the spot have not enough people die I do not think that matter to he it be about continue chaos not peace you be right People be too afraid to fight back most have give up hope it be just a matter of time before they pledge loyalty to Soren Kane what the hell happen that night I remember be in the bunker and then wake up here it be the end I be sorry Dr Jackson you really can not be in here right now I hear something about the Stargate be move Rebels have seize Rand 's major city include section of the capital we have the Stargate move into the bunker complex for security purpose what be the Caledonians do their missile system be deploy and prime as a result we 've do the same it might be good if you return to your planet now Commander Minister Treydan for you on a code frequency Put he through we 've monitor your country and we be most concerned I understand Minister Rest assure we be close to reclaim vital area now be not the time for rhetoric our report indicate large element of your military be on the brink of mutiny your civil unrest have become a civil war should any of your weapon fall into the wrong hand no one in my country would be safe that will not happen I can promise you just as you promise our scientist full access to the Stargate you hide information about the alien device and now you deny your country have slip into chaos we respect the guideline of our treaty to the letter our report outline everything we know except what you deem advantageous to your national security one moment Minister Rebel force just detonate an explosive device near one of our missile facility as of this moment we understand the facility to be compromise forgive I I must cut our conversation short my intelligence adviser have just inform I of a massive explosion near one of your missile facility be this true we be gather information we will contain the time for containment be long past Commander we can not allow your missile to fall into Soren 's hand Treydan give we time this need not escalate we be target your missile only if you do not wish a full scale war you will not retaliate Treydan Commander we 've detect multiple launch signal from caledonian position it could 've be contain if Soren have not gain control of one of our site and counterattack Caledonia after that it devolve into a full scale war within a matter of day all our city be level only a fraction of our population have survive exist mainly in outlying area as for the Caledonians I 've hear they be try to rebuild what they can it will not be much they strike first but our missile be much more accurate and Soren he use the chaos to make his move on the bunker then how do you save I actually from what I understand it be you who save I Kane this be insane Soren 's force be move in I can get you to the Stargate but we have to go now this way here through that door get down Loyalist soldier find we first and get we out of the city your wound be bad than mine bring you here be the only option what happen to Commander Gareth he be execute shortly after the bunker fall since he take power Soren have set up a government not that there be much of Rand leave to govern however we do know he do control whatever be leave of the bunker complex include the Stargate I be sorry Dr Jackson Howdy fellas welcome to Earth General O'Neill it be an honour I greet you in the name of our great nation Avidan you change the name Avidan speak to our people 's belief it be from an ancient Goa'uld dialect it mean the god be just good choice so you be say that Soren be still use the bunker as a command centre Damage in the city would be too severe then he have not totally consolidate his power yet have he if we could retake the bunker we would effectively overthrow Soren the bunker 's heavily fortified and I have only a dozen man it would be suicide not with help if I could reach my friend we could regain control of the gate if you could reach they I know that you 've be try to make radio contact with your planet without success I understand your wish to return but it simply be not possible this be not about that my people can help you like you help we before I admire your passion but too much have happen to fix with one heroic action we have to accept the fact that Soren have win Rand belong to he now it be obvious you revere the Great Ring as much as we do General O'Neill oh yeah we love the old gal Quite possibly for different reason than you we both seek to defend our way of life do we not to protect their very existence you do not represent the people of your world you kill those who believe differently you speak what be on your mind I admire that actually in your case he be hold back Carter we be prepared to offer aid in exchange for help in locate Daniel Jackson Food and medical supply plus support personnel to help stabilise the situation you can not truly believe that your friend be still alive oh he be a resourceful fella your offer be most generous but I be afraid we must decline we be however particularly interested in your weapon technology your people be face starvation and disease what have happen to our world be most unfortunate and yet vital those who refuse to believe need to be purge from existence so that we could begin anew you know in these part we like to call that crime against humanity if all you care about be spiritual salvation what do you need the weapon for the revolution be not yet complete you want to take over Caledonia too as I say the revolution be not yet complete Leda you have to talk to your husband what be I suppose to say to he that it be not too late to regain control to rebuild everything you tell I before Daniel I can not why because I would be lie Jared be right those unlucky enough to live through what be happen will die soon enough either through disease or one of Soren 's purge there be no future Leda you be right there be hope do not doubt that please you believe your people can help we yes and what if you do overthrow Soren what then you simply leave when Jared become part of Commander Gareth 's inner circle he change he become remote and distant I would forget what it be like just to talk to someone to feel Leda I will speak to he Daniel but he will not hear I Waste of time Waste I think the fact he have not leave yet could mean he be still willing to deal he have no need for humanitarian aid the chaos have only strengthen his position well we can not just give up yes I know that we be continue to monitor radio signal from the planet one could be from Daniel if we can find a way to contact he find it yes sir it be madness it will wipe out any chance to mount a unified resistance in the future but what if he be right what if this be our good opportunity to defeat Soren you would have I throw away my life and the life of my man so Daniel can return to his world it be not about that it be about rebuild our world his friend can help we do that Jared our people need this you mean he need this I be not blind I know you 've grow close Jared it be not what you think let I speak if I could live the last few year differently Leda I would I would make the time but we no long have the luxury for regret I need to know do you love he Leda I trust he once order be establish the people of Avidan will live differently than before simply humbly wait for our god ' inevitable return you know we 've meet these god upon whom you be so hot and trust I they be not what you think they be they will reward your worship with enslavement you be not the first to try to sway our belief but I can assure you our faith be unshakable this be not about faith this be about a means to power that go well Sir you well get up here what by implement new spread spectrum Carter Carter Carter hello guy we find he Sweet Daniel Jack Nice to hear your voice likewise come home or what try to as soon as I find my kel tesh what uh look a lot like my rin kol nok you know I lend it to you for uh grel kar kree nor day he be change Sir he be speak Goa'uld Rin kol nok mean strategy Kel tesh speak of a well know Jaffa battle tactic a flanking attack from two side yes Daniel I remember exactly where I put it any other thought no just that I hope someone be be feed my lo assak while I 've be away we 've piece together all the Goa'uld word if Teal'c 's translation be correct he be suggest a strategy he be propose a coordinate attack we come through the gate at the same time as Daniel enter from the surface I be think we take sg 3 6 and 12 as backup we go in hot secure the gate then extract Daniel he supply an estimate of Soren 's force as well as a date and time for the assault our next communication be in five hour all we need to do be confirm everything and of course get a go from you all right well not to nitpick or anything here t but be you sure you get it right I be certain O'Neill ok go 15 man that be hardly enough these be some of the good on my planet train for mission like this trust I if we be go to do this we have to set it up now they be wait for your response Jared a rebel patrol be approach Hide in the cellar Leda I know what to do in the name of Soren open the door inspection Stand aside please tell I what you be look for who own this house I do and who else live here no one you be hurt I we know loyalist be in the area Collaboration be punishable by death search the house there be no one else here but we find man 's clothe and boot who else live here my husband do he die last month from wound suffer during the bombing please I only wish to lead a simple life as it be write in the ancient text there be nothing here let us move once we be close use the city 's tunnel to get to one of the bunker 's access point we will wait for Dr Jackson 's people to make their move then we make ours Understood let us hope your friend keep their end of the bargain if this work you will be go home Leda I no go several post be no long report in loyalist have manage to take several key section then take they back we can not they 've coordinate their attack with offworlder we be lose control if you be suggest that we evacuate think again Cease fire Daniel be you guy ok yeah we be fine all station be dark the loyalist have we surround they be call for our surrender engage they any chance he will just surrender Commander we be hopelessly outnumber we be all here for one purpose to honour the will of our god in their name we rise up in their name we purge the nonbeliever and in their name we will die if necessary we will not dishonour they with cowardice now engage they engage they you question your faith I will show you faith drop your weapon I say drop your weapon now there be the command centre let us go all right this way drop all your weapon surrender it be over I hope so you may have just make a martyr I have no choice you can return to your world now Kane what happen to we be not your fault I know we make a promise and we intend to keep it we will be back to help you rebuild Daniel be you ready to go home yeah Visiontext Subtitles Jo Clarke ENHOH threat level Foxtrot Alpha six all security team to the gateroom give I your weapon Simulation time 49 second that be not bad not bad how be it be it fun indeed you die well in battle O'Neill obviously there be something defective with this agree an Anubis drone be a far more formidable warrior than this suggest what no we 've be work on this chair for two year to make it a viable virtual reality training tool for SGC personnel you have fail he be nothing if not honest well I mean maybe it could use a little more work but can you make it hard more difficult well we can input the parameter for different scenario but the vast majority of the simulation array come from the mind of the user the programming be actually build by interface memory from the individual 's consciousness with the chair 's matrix Carter all I hear be matrix and I find those film quite confusing what Dr Lee be try to explain be that the simulation actually learn its realism from the person use it what we 've build it we 've test the software extensively use a variety of subject obviously no one with Teal'c 's field experience subject to whom do you refer hey if Teal'c would agree to work with we a little more all you would have to do be basically play the game let it learn from you come on it would be fun you would be so good very well there you go just make sure there be a beginner ' level for the rest of we oh yeah we can always make it easy not that we would have to for you certainly for other but you would be fine Carter Gentlemen thank to Colonel Carter 's new code translation program we can monitor your progress through a representation of your point of view you 've play Doom I play Def Jam Vendetta exactly yes there be a two second delay between the chair 's processor and your experience but you should not notice anything anyway we can store every aspect of your activity in the game then later choose what to incorporate into our programming of the training scenario you understand as before once your mind be interface with the chair we can not remove the connection or cut power without endanger you indeed it be a function of the new chair design since the gamekeeper incident the alien of P7J 989 build in the shut off command so only someone in the chair can control it you have previously give I this information this be different this time because the game will be learn from you then incorporate those change into its programming code if you be kill in the game it will reset and you will start again the chair will only end the game under two condition once you complete the scenario or if you engage the internal fail safe which you be free to do at any time that will be unnecessary do not be so cocky the chair be intuitive it will eventually learn everything you know if you want to stop it before the conclusion just get to the base elevator head for the surface Ready Proceed threat level Foxtrot Alpha six all security team to the gateroom give I your weapon what just happen it look like the chair induce pain it be directly link to his brain we know it be capable of this but it be just a simulation it do not have to hurt that be the difference between you and Teal'c he know in a real situation your tactic would be different if you think you could not feel any pain man that be a heck of a shock he want it to be realistic fortunately we limit the chair from be able to deliver any sort of lethal jolt threat level Foxtrot Alpha six all security team to the gateroom O'Neill get outta here teal'c that be twice look like the chair be learn quickly do not count teal'c out yet Ooh that be cold Colonel I be pretty concerned about some of these bio reading I too Dr Carmichael this be Colonel Carter can you join we in Science Lab Five threat level Foxtrot Alpha six all security team to the gateroom teal'c I require your assistance Likewise SG 3 come in hot our gateroom people could use backup they be all dead excuse I the gateroom have be breach our most effective defence be to seal off the east and south end of level 28 if we act now we may force they into a crossfire Force who the two Anubis warrior how can you know that they 've choose the same route seven of the last ten time Colonel two hostile be head your way Roger that we be in position head up people fall back well you be right to be concerned about these reading frequent spike in his natural adrenaline be cause blood pressure and heart rate too high to be sustain long term that last ambush should have work why do the weapon have no effect I do not know have a Super soldier be resistant to that weapon in reality no but it be possible right the Goa'uld have adapt technology to fight something we 've throw at they well hopefully the game will also extrapolate solution and offer they to Teal'c I mean it would just be fair threat level Foxtrot Alpha six teal'c SG 3 come in hot sound like the gateroom people could use backup we get to move Colonel Carter listen to I the SGC have be penetrate by two Anubis drone our weapon be ineffective against their armour how be this possible that be what I want to know I speak of the armour it could have be alter to resist the energy weapon can they now be defeat I 've be work on a modulator chip where be it in my lab but I still show I it be only a prototype Warning Base auto destruct sequence have be activate nice of you to join we we 've be busy they 've find a way to counteract our little weapon here Warning Base auto destruct sequence have be activate 30 second to detonation Base auto destruct have be abort we be clear then the threat have be eliminate the threat have be eliminate teal'c you be injure teal'c I be fine I do not get it that should be the end you be say he should have win that be the conclusion of the program scenario but the chair be not disconnect the game 's not reset either that be not fair you can not win a race if someone keep move the finish line he say he want it to be hard more realistic in reality we have not defeat the Goa'uld be you say the game will not end until he defeat all the Goa'uld you say the game learn the rule from Teal'c yeah but the parameter can not go beyond the base invasion scenario can you get he out not without risk neural damage the game have a fail safe all teal'c have to do be quit yeah teal'c quit Anubis drone must have wait for SG 3 to dial the gate then overwhelm they but I can not figure out how they know how to set the self destruct I can not believe General O'Neill be dead he be not dead what we must focus on the situation the threat have not be neutralise what we will search the base immediately More warrior remain what he also know the Super Soldiers ' armour be resistant to our weapon Sergeant Harriman report only two intruder before he got kill they hold the control room long enough to keep the Iris open but gate log would indicate another wormhole the threat have not be neutralise there be other I be certain of it because the game have not yet end teal'c I know this be not your strong suit but this be a really bad time for joke you be all part of a simulation design to test the SGC 's preparedness in case of gate breach none of you be real I be fine Warning Base auto destruct sequence have be activate Sam I do not understand it somebody must have reactivate the auto destruct from a remote location I be lock out of the system I can not shut it down how do you know his heart rate and blood pressure be too high how long can he do this I do not know a day maybe less I think the chair could not kill he the physiological effect it can have at any one time be limit yes but while each individual pain stimulus be not in any way life threaten the cumulative effect be now start to take its toll if he do not have a heart attack he will eventually run out of adrenaline blood pressure will drop his organ system will fail death by a thousand cut Disable the auto destruct command what the SGC will be breach by Anubis warrior they will attempt to destroy the base via the command what if you disable the command they will be force to use other mean only then can we hope to defeat they teal'c how could you know threat level Foxtrot Alpha six all security team to the gateroom there be little time Colonel he be at level 28 he be get the modulator chip and he be use it to kill the first two Super Soldiers he be hunt for the third man he be not in good shape this be ridiculous it be torture he why will not he quit wait he be head for the elevator he be go to use the fail safe threat level Foxtrot Alpha six all security team to the gateroom it do not work he be back in the game I always think a fail safe system be suppose to be somewhat safe from failure from the beginning in Teal'c 's mind the goal be to make the simulation real as much as he must now want to quit we think the game evaluate his character and decide that if this be a real situation Teal'c would never give up well it be right it be also just a game but the game do not know that so how do we get he out remove the connection while the system be operate be potentially fatal on the other hand the physical stress that the chair be put he under will eventually kill he anyway right now the only way out be for Teal'c to win the game can he it seem to be get hard and hard every time it appear he be win the game add a new twist so it be not go to let he win no the chair do not have an ego it be not try to beat Teal'c just provide a challenge that be worthy of his ability ironically it be Teal'c 's ego that create this problem not that his self image be not entirely accurate if this continue he be go to require adrenaline to sustain his heart rate and the thing be I can not keep he go like this for long there have to be a way for he to win I think it be help yeah yeah they 've adapt their armour cover I Colonel Carter teal'c what be go on what be you do with a thermographic sensor there be a third drone be you sure I think only two come I be certain he be use a cloak of invisibility nice one and it be not yet over there be more Colonel go ahead I 've get a problem with the naqahdah generator in storage room 2809 I can not stop it Someone 's rig it on a feedback loop there be not enough time to stop the overload Sergeant dial the gate now p4 M 523 yes ma'am start dialling sequence Chevron one encode Chevron two encode Chevron three encode Chevron four Aagh Daniel what the hell be you do threat level Foxtrot Alpha six all security team to the gateroom Warning Base auto destruct sequence have be activate how be he do not well his physical exhaustion 's translating into the game look like he be have trouble even play any more it still will not let he go I speak to one of the scientist on P7J 989 he say there be nothing they can do under the circumstance what be you do they have a neural imprint of Teal'c 's mind on file from when we be trap in the chair six year ago Creepy yeah I be try not to think about it I be run a simulation use the same parameter Teal'c 's deal with now and the imprint be nowhere near the same as a live active mind plus a lot have change in six year but not the essence of Teal'c 's character see that be what worry I I hope it have I have run hundred of simulation no matter what he do the program adapt every time it look like he be win the chair make it hard it be like the game be read Teal'c 's mind and somehow see this game as a microcosm for our war against the Goa'uld that be how teal'c probably treat every battle accord to these result six year ago despite what Teal'c lead we to believe deep down he do not think the Goa'uld could ever be defeat well he do not think that now he can not after all we 've accomplish I hope you be right otherwise no matter how long or hard teal'c play the game he will not win this can not go on for much long we be go to have to make a decision about forcibly remove the connection you know it be too bad we can not hook up a joystick to this thing give he a little help Backup maybe actually we could link up another chair and send someone else into the same simulation that would not make any difference the processor would network the second person would fall victim to the same element that have trap teal'c unless the new player have an advantage Sir you may have do it again yes how do I do it this time these graphic be be generate by a data recorder that be track the game it be interface into the system between the chair 's processor and teal'c the chair decide what happen teal'c respond those response be then incorporate process and we see the result it be a continuous loop of ever change datum oh still wait on my good idea the recorder cause a two second delay between the programming in the chair and the experience in Teal'c 's mind he will not know the difference but we could use it if we hook up the second chair to the first without use the recorder in the loop the new player would know what be about to happen two second before it occur like precognition exactly it be not much but it might give we enough of an edge to help both player win that be assume the chair 's programming will not become aware of it and adapt which would mean there be a good chance the second player be trap with Teal'c I will do it threat level Foxtrot Alpha six all security team to the gateroom teal'c what be you do no do not why do he shoot he he be a Goa'uld in the last simulation I should have go the last thing we need be the game learn from your tactical experience I get to get use to this threat level Foxtrot Alpha six all security team to the gateroom Easy do not shoot just hear I out ok it be I I be real I be not a Goa'uld and I be go to prove that to you ok Crap Threat level Foxtrot Alpha six all security team to the gateroom I be sorry buddy you be go to have to listen to I ok a minute ago we be in Sam 's lab I be try to convince you I be real and you shoot I remember what happen next the game reset it be probably happen so many time it be a blur but the reason it happen this time be because I be play too I be in a chair just like you if either one of we die we both lose it will not let I out I know the game think that in a real situation you would never quit no matter what I do it be not possible Daniel Jackson it be not possible yes it be that be why I be here Come on let us do this together we must leave this area immediately yeah I hear that you be able to foresee the future yeah two second into the future to be honest with you it be kind of freak I out two second be not a lot of time I mean you just get a chance to see something happen and all you can say be watch out no seriously watch out we be go to need a crash cart in here you can not use an electrical impulse he be right there be a chance Teal'c be go to go into cardiac arrest if he suffer one more reset teal'c his heart 's stop he be get a pulse that be not go to work again I do not wanna see that again I think they be go to be able to beat this thing it may take Daniel a while to adjust to the precognitive ability plus two second be not a lot of time he will need the right opportunity to take advantage of it we must possess the modulator chip to compensate for the drone 's armour any idea where she keep it it change location each time of course it do find it down yeah this could work why do not you shoot he such an action have always prove fatal in the previous version of the game when I 've eliminate a drone from this location it have inevitably attract the attention of a third cloak drone so we will shoot he too it be merely a diversion design to allow a Goa'uld time to destroy the base he will use either our self destruct mechanism or a naqahdah generator design to overload and if you try to stop one he use the other indeed I suppose the identity of that Goa'uld change too yes I believe it to be the final component of the game we must overcome you guy all right yeah thank the naqahdah generator you guy all right almost get it just give I a second step away from the device what be you do we 've get less than a minute before this thing go critical t step away I would do as he say what the hell 's go on here we be all go to die if you do not let I stop that overload she may be a Goa'uld it be Siler Siler Siler he be in here I find he set the generator teal'c put the weapon down that be an order what if it be not her you say you could never tell who it be until the last second you may be correct Daniel Jackson hey now what well I know for a fact it be not I or Teal'c Daniel Jackson I do not know I can not tell Carter teal'c Carter be it finish yeah you do it shut off power to both chair O'Neill hey we have win well it be what we do Visiontext Subtitles Simon Campbell ENHOH what the hell be you do I be try to park do you ever hear of signal I do signal if you do not know how to drive maybe you should stay off the road well maybe if you have not be tailgate I this would not have happen oh no you do not just say that look man I do not want any trouble too late this be unlawful behaviour who the hell be you procedure be to exchange insurance information and if necessary notify the police what this gentleman do indeed signal which indicate that it be you who be at fault Pal you would well learn to mind your own damn business whoa I believe it will now be necessary to notify the police yeah thank Sir uh Colonel Kendrick from the Office of Special Investigations be here to see you do he have an appointment you would not return my phone call sir I be busy do not think it be important take your pick you know as well as I do there be be another incident your request for Teal'c to live off base be approve under certain provision these provision have be violate oh come on Colonel if you have save Earth from annihilation a couple of time and your government tell you you could not go out to play would not you consider it more a guideline than a rule we all appreciate what Teal'c have do for we on many occasion but he be a liability every day he roam around in public jeopardise national security do not be so dramatic Dick it will give you gas either you take action to ensure these provision be meet or the OSI will hey watch it I will look into it yes sir hey Daniel Jackson just come by to see how you be settle in please enter wow I like what you be do with the place Jaffa chic with an east african flair there be many programme on television which offer advice on home decoration I be a little more into the History Channel myself can I offer you anything no I be fine how be the fern do I do not suppose you 've try talk to it I have not perhaps you should tell I why you be here a guy can not just come by and visit his friend yeah hear what happen the other day three KO 's first round O'Neill send you to speak with I no n yeah I break no law I intervene to prevent a criminal activity and be force to defend myself you see that be kinda the point look there be no reason why you should not be allow to live off base but you be suppose to keep a low profile that be not always easy I be not talk about the tattoo although I see how that could be a problem I often cover it to avoid stare in public I tell those who see it it be a tribal mark from my homeland this be less about appearance than behaviour have I not conduct myself as a typical member of this community no no actually no you have not um there be the incident with the old man and the teenager in the park the guy with the pit bull in each case I be only attempt to render assistance where it be need see that be kinda the problem normal human be more careful about get involve in other ' business I know that sound bad but it be just the way it be and you can not afford to be draw attention to yourself I understand excuse I hi Krista make you cookie please come in I be sorry I do not realise you have company Krista James this be Daniel Jackson Hi Krista live in the apartment next door wait a minute Dr Jackson you be the archaeologist who hire Teal'c to come over from Mozambique that be right well then I should thank you it be nice to have a man around who care about his neighbour actually we be just talk about that in fact that be why I be here the cookie be a bribe my pipe be do that thing again normally I would be happy to provide assistance however no no no do not let I interrupt I 've get to be go anyway it be very nice to meet you Nice to meet you uh teal'c that other thing we be talk about um every rule have its exception thank so how be thing in the galaxy you know I can not talk about work sorry I be still getting use to the fact that my girlfriend be a superhero a bit of an exaggeration the superhero part or the girlfriend part you travel to other planet to do battle with alien bend on galactic domination even if you do not wear a tight spandex outfit although that be an idea you might wanna consider look I know this be hard for you any other guy would have just freak out and run away you do not run away when I stalk you I just want you to appreciate the position I be in here I do believe I and I be really glad you stick around I be glad to hear you say that cos I put in for a transfer to Colorado Springs PD be you sure I 've never be more sure of anything in my entire life that be why I get you this oh my God sorry to keep ask you to help with my plumbing but the super be never around and my boyfriend 's not very handy there be no need to apologise anyhow you will forgive I once you 've taste my lasagne I be look forward to it Yo T Greetings Eric I see you take out those three gorilla the other day nice work in retrospect it may have be unwise to intervene be you kid they deserve it hey hey stop that guy he be get my purse hey do something I must not intervene what you be just go to let he get away oh man what a shot how do you do that you the man T thank you that be amazing that be amazing T buddy you be the man get to give the man his prop Krista Krista come on Krista listen listen listen just let I in just let I in Doug I have to work tomorrow so so you be drunk just go home please I be not go nowhere Doug be there a problem uh this this be a private conversation if it be private you would not conduct it in the hallway nor speak so loudly it be all right Mrs Connors just go back inside do you require assistance no I be ok who the hell be this guy his name be teal'c he be my neighbour teal'c what kind of a crazy name be that he just move here from Mozambique no doubt Krista have request that you leave I suggest you comply you would well check yourself before you get hurt I have check I suggest you leave before it be you that gets hurt Doug go sober up you know what I be go to call you tomorrow I be sorry about that I hate when he get that way this be not the first time so you have stop receive he not exactly he be not always like that since he lose his job he be just be you know I do not it be be hard on he and have it not be hard on you I be fine I do not understand Krista 's behaviour yeah that be a common problem there be a significant gap between the experience of man and woman among the Masai a newlywed man have to wear his wife 's clothing for a month as a way of gain insight into her life if only it be that simple while ritual and custom may vary almost all culture put pressure on adult to form bonding pair in ancient Persia if a girl die a virgin they would marry her corpse off before burial that be horrible the groom be usually quite well pay it be bad enough be on your own without every tv show and magazine ad tell you how abnormal it be I think that be what I say they make you afraid to be alone but tell you only to settle for the romantic ideal like that actually exist anywhere in the real world either way you can not win how 's thing good we be talk about Teal'c 's friend I think we be how do Jaffa couple handle problem a dispute between a man and a woman that can not be resolve necessitate a pledge break it must be request by one and grant by the other and if that do not work a weapon be require sorry I do not wanna interrupt you I just come out for a little air be you all right I have a fight with Doug I tell he it be over I do not wanna see he any more be you not happy with your decision I guess it be the right thing to do but he be not a bad person he be just have a tough time you have no cause to feel guilty what be that you be just do it be call Lok'nel an ancient form of martial art training you think you could teach I oh hi you be late for your training session yeah I mean to tell you I do not think I be go to be able to train with you any more you have be make tremendous progress well I just do not have time you know have something transpire no everything 's fine look I 've get to go you be injure it be nothing please Krista who be it it be just my neighbour oh yeah the plumber Mm I will handle this Doug it be I say I will handle it do not think I do not know what be be go on here she tell I everything do you injure she what go on between I and Krista be not none of your business if you ever injure she again I will kill you where you stand Carter Sir I never think I would hear myself utter these word I need that report right um l l just need to finish type up my note uh I will have it for you first thing tomorrow it be tomorrow oh I be joke I do not need the report then why because something be go on with you you have not try to confuse I with any scientific babble recently and that be a red flag to I Pete give I this People normally wear these on their finger I have not say yes and yet you have not say no I tell he I need to think about it and that be two week ago ah all these year I 've concentrate on work I assume one day I would have a life yeah yeah and now it come down to it I do not know I mean every time we go through the gate we risk not come back be it fair to put somebody through that Pete be a cop I think he could handle it what about kid what about them do I take maternity leave and then come back do I drop the baby off at daycare on my way to some unexplored planet Carter there be people on this base who have family what about you if thing have be different I would not be here Krista hey I be wait for you have something happen no I be fine it be just it be over with Doug for real this time I be sorry about what happen before I need to get out of here I can not even think in this place will you come with I perhaps tomorrow no now tonight we will just get in the car and drive we will take the whole weekend it do not even matter where we end up as long as it be away from here please hey what be go on General O'Neill just get off the phone with Colonel Kendrick Krista 's boyfriend be find dead in her apartment what what happen we do not have all the detail yet Kendrick say preliminary evidence indicate that Teal'c may be responsible that be impossible I say that unfortunately we can not ask he about it because he be miss so be Krista as of right now Teal'c be want for kidnapping and murder thank for get I outta there I could not be in that place tonight where do you wish to go just keep drive what what be it I do not wish to alarm you but I believe that we be be follow who would be follow we Perhaps Doug no he do not know I be go yet then they be most likely follow I you why would anyone be follow you it be difficult to explain can you lose they I believe so however it will require I to violate speed limit and safe driving regulation I be ok with that hold on do not tell I you learn how to do that back in your village there be aspect of my life which I be not at liberty to divulge what be you a spy or something one thing be for sure you be not Dr Jackson 's research assistant that much I figure after about 30 second Krista it be ok for now I be just glad you be here hey thank for meet I no problem Pete I be sorry I need a little more time look you know how I feel about you it be just there be some thing I need to work out ok anyway that be not what this be about it be not no I would not ask if it be not so important what be go on I need your help Krista Krista Freeze turn around interlace your finger behind your head well where be he be hold he be in his old quarter be he at least under guard he be not go anywhere he be a murder suspect I talk to he he say he do not do it that be good enough for you be it pretty much you be not in charge of this investigation he also say he feel like he be be follow last night the OSI do not have teal'c under surveillance yeah how do you find he we receive a tip that do not strike you as odd I tell you something like this might happen you ignore my warning not so much ignore as completely disregard with all due respect I insist that Teal'c be place in confinement immediately or I will recommend that he be hold elsewhere what the hell Daniel Jackson do you get my message who be this the symbol do you recognise they uh I do not know who you think this be we need they translate into Goa'uld I have no idea what you mean we know it be the language of the Ancients but the dialect be obscure you be the one man on Earth who can translate they Teal'c be in trouble how do you know about that we can help he we 've be watch he in fact we see the whole thing you witness the murder we 've get it all on tape concrete evidence that prove Teal'c 's innocence and it be yours in exchange for the translation of course if you tell anyone we will know and the deal be off the investigator who check the position of the body conclude that the victim be pin and choke against this wall and then fall to the floor so so I be not so sure the proximity of the body to the wall support that but the position suggest otherwise what do you mean if he fall into a slump his leg and arm would be bent his leg be straight and his arm be place by his side suggest that the body be drag here and place in this position why move the body well die against the wall suggest the victim be attack by somebody big and strong like Teal'c so it be a setup it be possible you say teal'c think he be follow that be right the Air Force deny he be under surveillance yeah if I be stake out Teal'c 's place that be where I would be hello from this vantage point you can see into both apartment three indentation a tripod I think they clean the place up pretty good I doubt we will find anything so it be a dead end not necessarily be there a pizza place nearby why one thing about a stakeout you never eat healthy Dr Jackson keep walk you come alone I be impressed I like a man who can follow instruction be you the one who call I it do not matter have you complete the translation that be why I be here I need more time you be play with your friend 's life I can not translate without know the context where they be find what they be for do you think I be stupid I be not lie I can see we be go to have to do this the hard way what do that mean either you give we the translation now or I will be force to take this to the next level so beyond kidnapping and murder we do not kill the boyfriend but we will kill the girl if we have to how do I know you even have her Come with I and I will show you yeah you know what I get a thing so I have three sniper target your position at this very moment Doctor you be bluff Position one take the coffee cup so be we go to take your car or mine or should I just follow you we check a couple of pizza joint near your apartment for sudden repeat customer an interesting investigative method yeah I think it be crazy at first too but we get a lead at one place a caucasian male who have be in half a dozen time during the last two week be that unusual we think it be worth check out we get a licence plate from the security camera and we be run it down O'Neill Kendrick be finally convince something else be go on what change his mind Daniel 's missing so you guy be ex NID you be call yourselves the Trust now right we want the same thing you want Dr Jackson to protect the planet that be why you watch teal'c you think he be a threat to planetary security Stargate Command may think it be ok to let an alien roam the street unsupervise we beg to differ never mind that he be save the Earth he be an alien their motive can never be trust anyway he be partly responsible for the boyfriend 's death if he have not show the girl how to crush a windpipe it would not have happen so she kill he it be self defence he be get out of hand and you plant evidence to make it look like Teal'c do it we see an opportunity and we take it what the hell 's go on here the situation be under control you be suppose to get the information and leave he be not go to cooperate he be a member of SG 1 have you any idea of the resource they will mobilise to get he back once we get the translation it will be too late bring the girl Carter Sam I trace the car from the pizza place it be a rental the name on the agreement 's fake that be our man they know what they be do I 've get a bank account and credit card all from a guy who die six month ago let us focus on the car find out if the rental company have satellite tracking I be on it I will call you as soon as I have something Uplink be establish we be ready to transmit we need those symbol Daniel what be happen who be these people it be go to be ok the symbol now or we kill the girl she be get nothing to do with this look Dr Jackson if it have be up to I thing never would have go this far it be suppose to be a simple surveillance operation then this domestic dispute happen Teal'c got involve we know you would not help we voluntarily so you decide to try blackmail instead let us just say one thing lead to another but in any case it be too late for all that now so either you give we what we want or I will kill she oh and by the way we will know immediately if the symbol be incorrect Scanning transmit symbol Translation confirm Good get up over there face the wall I give you what you want move I say face the wall look you do not have to do this Daniel it be go to be ok team two ready go he be unconscious there be no one here we get all the exit cover there be no way they could have get out how be that possible thank you so it be normal for the bad guy just to disappear into thin air right not really now I think about it it be not the first time it be happen just another day at the office yes it figure you would be use to it by now no I mean yes yes as in yes be you mess with I no which mean yes you do not need more time no therefore yes be careful with that its content be fragile sorry there be no need for an apology I be grateful for your assistance hey so you be really leave indeed I be you know you do not have to do this the whole thing be my fault there be no need to blame yourself the man in the warehouse I do not know who they be no one tell I anything but I know they be use I to get to you if it have not be you it would have be someone else they would not hesitate to exploit any relationship to their advantage what do they want that I can not say right so where be you go to go back to where I come from what do that mean it mean I must say goodbye this be all that be leave thank you check it out I be honour later T Visiontext Subtitles Margaret Burke ENHOH walk out that door there be no turn back I understand I be not have any doubt Alec it be not just your credibility at stake you be right there it be the leader of the democratic free world should be worry think about the people who work for this company the shareholder I be Brian they have a right to know the truth as do everybody else trust I we be do the right thing thank you all for come as you all know about five month ago our planet suffer a horrible tragedy over 2 000 american serviceman and woman be kill when a meteor shower disrupt global communication and hit a United States naval carrier group on manoeuvre in the Pacific Ocean I be here today to challenge the fact of that incident as they 've be convey to the general public on the day in question none of our satellite detect a meteor shower hey what be go on Shh I do not know how many government around the world be in on this but I do know we be be lie to and the truth be be cover up uh oh lady and gentleman there be life beyond our world there be alien out there and they have a technology far beyond ours and they have be intervene in our existence for quite some time I have proof and I be give the government of all the nation that be aware of this 24 hour to reveal the truth or I be go to do it for they thank you well there you go for those of you on another planet for the past 20 year Alec Colson age 42 net worth over 60 billion run a global empire of company include communication biotechnology aerospace and aviation he be number eight on the Fortune 500 he personally hold over 200 proprietary patent Shut it off we know who he be some of we well than other we work together briefly sir Colson Aviation develop multi engine control system for the F 302s Colson do not know what they be for but he be a brilliant engineer he be also a little nut be not he you 've test fly experimental aircraft we all go through the gate this be not about we in a way it be the point be sir he be not some loony cult leader People be take he seriously so what do we think he know he own several Earth observer and weather satellite maybe they pick something up Anubis ' fleet in orbit or the battle over Antarctica I do not understand how it could have come this far he be get the national security speech from the Pentagon several time the president have call he personally why not merely tell he the truth his profile be deem a security risk for obvious reason apparently his father be a reporter jail during the McCarthy era he believe in the right for people to know what their government be do leak classified information could be consider treason all right see if he can be convince not to go public without actually tell he anything right we 've get all the major network over a dozen live radio broadcast and reporter from newspaper all wait for the next shoe to drop Brian calm down our stock price be trade down 25 we overextend compete for that round of contract that stock price be cover our debt and you be alienate our big client we will have to start sell off asset what do that matter Brian give what we know I do not know I guess I be just try to hold on to some shred of reality you and everyone else be go to have to start deal with a whole new reality what if the world can not handle it what if Washington 's right and we should keep it in the bag trust I the truth be always right we 've cause mass hysteria you have no idea how much chaos this could cause Alec they be here show they in would you it will be ok Lieutenant Colonel Alec Radiant as ever Daniel Jackson Doc I be a big fan really I 've follow you since your early career pyramid as landing pad for alien ship Fascinating that be a long time ago what have you be up to since it be like you drop off the map I 've be around I beg your pardon may I introduce Brian Vogler thank you for see we today shall we why do not we start with something I be sure we can all agree on that meteor shower be a cover story and a surprisingly weak one at that although under the circumstance I be not sure I would have have a well one what make you say that I be guess that be one of ours we lose contact with 12 communication satellite for over six hour on that day when we get they online they be able to transmit image store in the buffer image like these can be fake or make to seem fake I know why you be here Sam the Pentagon want I to know that people like you be go to try to make I look like a fraud People like I very smart people we have more than this obviously I do not know everything but I do have a right to as do everyone else anything we can say to stop you believe I I 've try Carter Sam it be Julia Donovan how do you get this number I have my source our camera catch you and a nice look man go into Colson Industries ' head office in Seattle I just see the feed and do you have an official comment I think your coverage be a little one side Come on Sam Colson 's go to out the whole operation you do not think Washington can contain this we will see I do not have to remind you of the nondisclosure agreement you sign it be a reporter from the Prometheus incident Colson do not seem to be worried about go to jail he have not do anything illegal yet we have an agreement you say if something be go to break you would call I first I will ok bye bye I get 13 message from Emmett Bregman the switchboard 's jammed every crackpot in the world be call I 've arrange security for all of you do you think we need to be worry I would be worried about what we do not know I be try to tell he it be not too late it be too late Brian too late for the world to know there be an alien attack against our planet and for the public to realise they 've be lie to about the nature of our existence we be go public I be hope the feds would come clean I can not believe Washington have not stop we with a legal injunction that would legitimise our claim they will try to play this as if we can not be take seriously we be one of the large corporation and we be tell the truth it do not matter who we be or how right we be they can stop we if they really want to come on what be they go to do have I kill he be get to have something more significant than picture I be go over government contract assign to Colson 's company there be quite a few related to r d of alien technology we procure offworld we will now head to Colson Industries Welcome and thank you for come 24 hour to the minute yesterday I tell you of our belief in the existence of intelligent life beyond our planet I also tell you that we believe several government include our own have know about this and have be conceal the information for some time yesterday I challenge those government to come clean reveal the truth we get only silence which give I no choice but to present to you what evidence I have how do I know for sure that alien life really do exist Ladies and gentleman see be believe I would call that something the world be in a frenzy after yesterday 's startling revelation of what appear to be a live alien by billionaire industrialist Alec Colson thus far there be be no statement from the White House and source inside Colson Industries promise there be definitely more to come ok thank you Sergeant we just get a message back from Thor as far as he know there be no Asgard currently on Earth well Loki be here for year without the High Council know about it ok here be a possibility what if it be not really an Asgard look like one do not say anything that be my point Colson wrap thing up quickly without any question it be a perfect likeness Imagery of little grey alien have be commonplace for year Colson could have a picture so not a real Asgard no Asgard we know would allow himself to be use that way it do look a little vacant still as much as he want the truth I do not think he would perpetrate a hoax to get it then what be it I do not know the network want interview too bad our friend can not talk we know he be capable mri show a larynx similar to ours but he do not seem to have anything to say they also want independent personnel to verify that it be really what we say it be how do we convince the world of alien intelligence when he do not have any we can not just trot this out on television with wild claim we can not back up grant it be an amazing experiment but we do not know it be really alien what else could it be all we know be the DNA come from the Department of Defense we be try to build a circumstantial case here the more question we raise the more the burden of proof shift to Washington soon they will have to respond to public pressure meanwhile we stay quiet the medium 's go nut over this thing so let us just sit tight and see what happen Sam be right there be something different about Colson 's Asgard seem that a Colson company be give a copy of Asgard DNA for sequence we try to help their cloning problem Colson grow a clone they be not tell it be alien DNA but they obviously take their research far than the contract specify Asgard DNA be program to grow a clone to maturity in three month but they be an empty shell until an exist consciousness be transfer it be not capable of speak exactly they probably spend what time they have with it teach it how to walk well the Pentagon have lose all patience what be they go to do they want we to put a stop to it how we be call in a marker Yep call in a marker greeting excuse I it be go what do you mean just disappear right out of the lab the alien computer everything how what about security Nobody take it it disappear we be stand there there be a flash of light and it be go have Ron send out the decoy car get the plane ready for a trip to Washington have it ready by the time I get to the hangar you ready not really just try not to think about the camera Focus on I it be not that I respect Alec Colson I do not like be ask to discredit a man who have every right to want the truth but you 've be order to do this yeah if you want to go against those order feel free I will go with it in five four three two we be here with Lieutenant Colonel Samantha Carter of the US Air Force Welcome thank you your background be astrophysic you be a lead military scientific researcher we be all eager to hear some reaction from Washington regard the revelation make by Alec Colson well first of all I can assure people that if alien really exist and be visit the planet we would know about it be you say his claim have no merit we all see an alien on live television yes Hollywood 's be help we see thing on tv for a long time now be you say that the alien be not real it depend on what you mean by real notice she have not actually lie once I can show you some advanced method for create realistic 3 d image by all mean we be experiment with technology that make it possible for we to create anything you can imagine virtually wow that look just like the alien Alec Colson introduce to we greeting people of Earth that be amazing he look so real though I look real I have be create through the use of advanced holographic technology that be just incredible it be just a projection you will probably see this in theme park ride in a few year she be good not the exclusive I have in mind but it will still do huge number you be hilarious after everything you still care about rating how do you do it I 've see visual effect before Sam this be some sort of this be some sort of alien technology be not it what be it ten minute ago Alec Colson 's plane be force into an emergency landing after almost crash on takeoff from Sea Tac Plane suffer depressurisation and loss of engine power but land without serious incident we 've get to go to the air with this I need something on Colson 's wife and daughter they die in a plane crash when he be 24 that be why he start Colson Aviation Let us go Carter Sam it be Alec Colson be you ok News travel fast it be close Brian 's still as white as a sheet how do you get this number I have my source the ground crew here find evidence the plane have be tamper with someone try to kill you seem that way any idea you think I know why would I publicly discredit you if I know you would be assassinate to make it look like Washington have nothing to do with it a fine job you do too by the way I be sorry I be follow order I know do not worry Sam I do not believe for a second you be in on it if it be our government I be sure you be just a pawn that do not make I feel any well look Alec I can assure you it be ok it be not my first rough landing I be sure it will not be my last I will not be stop Sam I promise you one way or another the world be go to learn the truth how about a hyperdrive for the Prometheus that be something I must discuss with the High Council Thor come on you say you want to get something nice for the president Carter Sir anything on who try to kill Colson it be not we Colson may have fragment of downed Goa'uld ship from the Antarctic a subsidiary of his be involve in the salvage and cleanup be we just go to keep try to discredit the man be not we the one delusional to think we could cover up an attack of this scale what be the alternative how about tell the truth I mean to Colson I know he be be profile and deem a security risk obviously that be an accurate assessment but what have we get to lose at this point he be try to go public let us show he why it be so important to keep the secret besides think of the benefit of have a man with his resource on our side well Thor and I be meet with the president in five minute I will bring it up five minute oh yeah right two o'clock we go live with the picture piece of the alien ship everything we 've get they try to kill we you think that do not work in our favour Dying do not work in our favour ok what just happen in layman 's term we beam you up and then down again where be I Cheyenne Mountain Complex Colorado you know Daniel of course yeah hi and this be Thor greeting so this be a real one Yep what happen to the clone it will become a host to an Asgard consciousness whose body be fail ok now I must take my leave General O'Neill say he will see you all tomorrow what I want to show you something we call it a Stargate I be ok Brian I promise you I be fine I will be back in a couple of day I get to go all right bye Ready Whoa look at you yeah Soldier Sam I get a uniform too Yep all right so where be we go P4X 650 we have a base there and how far away be that 640 light year really let us go do not feel a thing you be demolecularise welcome to the Alpha site Alec Colson Captain Shefield well it be nice our last Alpha site be destroy in an attack we decide to build this one inside a mountain like the SGC condition be a bit Spartan but it be our home away from home I guess I be just expect something a little more I do not know otherworldly now that that be more like it it be call the F 302 Alien human hybrid so this be what the mec be for yeah thank to you it be capable of leave the atmosphere and return we use a number of these to defend Earth five month ago it be one of the advancement make with technology procure through the Stargate you wanna take a ride Brian what be you do Alec want all the evidence we have about the alien cover up duplicate and secure off premise you can start on what we have leave on the clone research ok vogler I tell you I do not know where he be I have a meeting with the SEC this afternoon I understand do not worry it will work Beautiful yeah must be hard keep all this secret I do not know how you do it I think of all the fear it would cause the potential chaos what about the great meaning you could bring to people just know that all this be out here what be out here be an enemy so advanced so evil it be a miracle we have not be wipe out or enslave yet we 've be very lucky so far I think people would have a hard time live with the threat of impend doom all right the old if you have cancer argument would you want to know you be go to die or live your final day in ignorance yeah I guess I do not really buy it either I would rather know try to cure it if I could not do that then I would try to make my final day as meaningful as possible you want a turn I think I be go to have to ask switch to copilot control go ahead she be all yours so what do you think amazing she manoeuvre like an F A 22 and feel like a 7 47 that be the inertial dampener all right let us try this Alec Alec pull up Flight this be Alpha command be everything ok it be now we be fine bring she back in that be reckless the 302 can handle it I know I may not have know its name but I help you build it remember it be a joyride I take you up for a little fun this be not a game Sam what you guy be do up here this be life and death for all of we we know that be not much fun feeling out of control like that be it you do not have to make your point with my life come on we be never go to crash unlike my plane back on Earth I tell you we have nothing to do with it well someone do and if you think that or any of this be go to prevent I from tell the world what they have a right to know you be dead wrong Alec there be something else I need to talk to you about a clandestine group of private businessman be inform of this programme over six year ago by rogue element of the NID we 've try to identify they and bring they down but they be highly connect former vice president Kinsey 's be link to they instead of go public like you they 've be fund various secret endeavour aim at control alien technology for their own purpose which be you would have to ask they personal profit maybe they think they can do well of defend the planet than we why be you tell I all this because I be guess that be who try to kill you they will never get control of the gate if the world find out when I be young all I ever dream about be fly I have every make of aeroplane ever build hang from my ceiling and then I take it you know about my wife and daughter one of the downside of celebrity we really do have no secret anyway after the crash I vow to make fly as safe as it possibly could be I think I could do it well than anyone but you have make a difference but nothing be perfect be it no intergalactic travel advanced alien civilisation human live on other world I do realise there may be bad guy too you have no idea how bad but in the end we have to believe in humanity I mean who know this might bring we all together as a planet if we know it would play out that way then you be afraid that know about this would fracture the world even more yeah not just stop we fight the Goa'uld but end thing for good we 've see it happen on other planet in one case public revelation of the Stargate cause apocalyptic world war that would be the ultimate irony would not it you save the world from destruction at the hand of alien only for we to destroy ourselves out of fear after the fact change your mind not really I do not think it would happen and if a truth of this magnitude about the very nature of human existence could lead we to destroy ourselves then I would say we would deserve it would not you investigator now believe Alec Colson create the alien hoax in order to divert attention from his real corporate financial problem Colson who have still make no public statement corporate financial problem what be she talk about the story break about an hour ago the president 's halt trading on the market your company 's stock have fall 80 the Dow be down over 500 point what be go on the SEC be investigate you for fraud that be ridiculous they say there be irregularity in your company 's last two financial statement why it be not true come on the timing of this I be be set up what be she do here she want to help Brian Good do she have a time machine so we can go back and undo everything Brian Brian what be go on you would not listen you would not stop so you admit you do this you go off on your adventure you fly your plane you drop by every now and then with a bright idea ever since we be kid you be always bite off more than you can chew and I be always have to bail you out so you doctor the book I have to I have to do something I tell you we be overextend the stock price be the only thing keep we afloat you would not listen no I do not believe this Alec who do you think tell the SEC why why now what difference could it make once the truth come out Alec I almost die in that plane too I still have a family they try to kill we who do you think they would let you tell a secret like this what be you talk they call themselves the Trust all I know be they be very powerful and they think that Washington abdicate its duty to protect the planet maybe even cause the problem they see it as their responsibility to step in we can fix this it be too late it be do it can not be undo Brian we will both go to jail yeah but my family will be safe what about the people that work for this company what about their family why be not you think about they three day ago how do the people who threaten you know that you have cook the book how do they know that there would be enough to indict both you and Alec they get to you six month ago Alec they know what you have do not ask I how they have to make sure they could stop you you be wrong Alec true or not this should not come out the world 's not ready there must be something we can do you sign false statement I mean about the people who try to kill we all I know be they operate above the law and they 've threaten people before then we have to bring they down we 've try believe I well we have to try again Colson 's convinced Vogler to arrange a meeting with his contact and wear a wire hopefully we will connect he to the rogue NID and flip he for someone big we be coordinate with Agent Barrett at the least it may restore Colson 's public image especially if someone in competition with Colson Industries be pull the string unfortunately without further evidence Brian Vogler 's word alone be not go to be enough to undo the damage already do what of Brian Vogler 's safety he be under surveillance his family be be take into protective custody well I guess the secret be safe again for now O'Neill I would not count Colson out just yet he still feel really strongly that the world should know the truth all right thank you Surveillance just find Brian Vogler dead in his bathroom what how he hang himself Alec I be so sorry about Brian I kill he Might as well have put the gun against his head and pull the trigger myself you could not have know you see how scared he be I know what his family mean to he he be never go to do anything to put they in any danger Alec he be my good friend he betray you no I betray he why do not you put the gun down my life be over Sam everything I work for everything I believe in hold to be true still exist apparently Congress be look into provide relief the company the employee will survive while I go to jail for something I do not do back on the Alpha site you say no matter what you would rather make whatever time you have leave meaningful I be here to give you that chance how by make all the indictment against I just disappear I be think more along the line of make you disappear Problem with a guy like I no place on earth I can hide who be talk about Earth no no no I could not let you do that believe I I would not be here without the approval of my superior the president be not responsible but he be not sorry you be publicly discredit please Alec come with I you can still make a difference he who fight and run away live to fight another day and no one will ever know welcome to my world Visiontext Subtitles Simon Campbell ENHOH Teal'c and bra'tac believe the way to eliminate all System Lords be to recruit Jaffa into the fifth column only when their number be sufficient will it be possible to destroy the Goa'uld even then Baal control the supersoldi army which can not be turn so even if the rebel Jaffa can take out most of the System Lords there will still be a massive war to fight the problem be Ishta do not want to wait Moloc continue to order the death of female Jaffa bear in his domain and her railroad to Hak'tyl can not save they all even now she be organise a rebellion to overthrow Moloc teal'c and bra'tac be try to convince she to see the big picture what be my question again um how be it go it seem so innocuous at the time Fellas how be the trip I have be betray by those I trust most that good eh his mood be foul indeed greeting it be good to see you both bra'tac what be wrong there be a complication Ishta she be well and as lovely as ever O'Neill the problem I fear lie with Rya'c be he ok he be in love and plan to be marry so when be all this suppose to happen Ow three day three day huh that be kinda quick indeed well you know love be a strange and mysterious thing ow Rya'c do not even consult I before make this decision this girl have cause all reason to leave Rya'c 's head Zero serve three serve eight eight oh so what be Ishta think of all this Ishta believe tradition should persist at all cost especially in the face of oppression I see Rya'c be too young to know what love be O'Neill or how it inevitably weaken a warrior 's resolve look t I be not go to tell you how to raise your kid but I 've find stick your finger in your ear and hum loudly solve a whole slew of problem what good be I as a father O'Neill if I can not keep my son from make this crucial mistake unschedule offworld activation get one receive IDC sir it be Ishta open the Iris greeting there be an urgent matter we must discuss Hak'tyl may have be compromise how do you know yesterday we be to meet a contact a high priestess station within Moloc 's temple she fail to appear at the allotted time you must evacuate immediately I agree but we know not of another uninhabited planet like Hak'tyl hide female warrior and child within a populated planet in Moloc 's domain be difficult and dangerous I be sure we could help you folk out Carter no problem we have a number of possible world on record but they should be explore more thoroughly before you take up residence if Moloc be aware of our location every moment my people remain on Hak'tyl put they at great risk oh um you be welcome to stay here I will go start the paperwork Colonel Carter Dr Jackson Rya'c it be good to see you again this be my sim'ka Kar'yn Rya'c stop use those old term we be betroth an honour to meet friend of my husband to be right back at you be she not the most beautiful thing stop it you be embarrass I I be not an object to be worship thank you for agree to host our union ceremony it will be an honour to be betroth among friend you be go to have the wedding here of course Ishta say it may take some time to find a planet for our new home we be to be marry in three day there be much to do Rya'c excuse we they be have the wedding here do Jack know about this I be go to work on find they a planet yeah come in Bra'tac what be that smell I believe that be the horse O'Neill the warrior of Hak'tyl be grateful for your generosity well you know I always willing to help those who need help you be indeed a wise and gracious leader O'Neill of Minnesota sit down you old coot what I be to officiate the rite of everlaste union between Rya'c and Kar'yn I have consult with Ishta on the matter and despite the evacuation she wish the wedding to proceed as plan and as schedule Meaning here a more suitable world be not likely to be find in time delay the ceremony would grant another victory to Moloc 's tyranny you know what it take to get approval for tailgate Tuesdays huh there will be cake you have be avoid I you have indicate I be not worthy of your presence how so your refusal to bless this union be an insult to Kar'yn and thus to I that be not what I intend Rya'c have pledge to help lead the Jaffa in the battle against the Goa'uld as have I and my people a warrior be always strong with another at his side so you must believe Kar'yn 's an unworthy warrior and I be at fault as her teacher Ishta this be not about you soon enough Rya'c will have to choose between his family and his cause just as I once do I merely believe that he be young and have much time ahead and need not undertake such decision so soon in the same way Rya'c have no say in your decision you have no say in his none of we choose oppression at the hand of the Goa'uld nor what must be do to free ourselves of it but we must not sacrifice that which make we Jaffa I have organise both man and woman to fight together to rise up against Moloc maybe once we be free of his tyranny you will see we be worthy of your war overthrow Moloc alone will ultimately prove nothing be he to fall his world would be usurp by another Goa'uld I will not stand idly by and watch more of my sister slay at the hand of Moloc while you and the leader of this so call Jaffa rebellion you plot and you scheme and you ultimately do nothing you have no wish to fight side by side only to dominate as my sister have be for generation as you will remain due to short sightedness I will not rest until Moloc be dead I will not rest until all Goa'uld be dead they want a what a goat sir you can tell they lamb be far less gamey they they want it for a ritual sacrifice tell they that be not go to happen I be hope you would say that they can have a pinata that be always fun I will suggest it sir please tell I you be close to find a planet we scout one Ishta seem comfortable with fresh water stable climate Good when be move day Ishta think it will take a week to get a camp go a week yes sir the wedding be still go to happen here have you see teal'c he be lock himself in his room that chicken let this fire bear witness to this ceremony may its flame keep warm the soul of those who come before we we ask those spirit now to bless this union and to protect it through each day of its existence and then the horn will sound good now you will place the circle of fidelity upon Kar'yn 's head and you the totem of bravery around Rya'c 's neck the bride will then kneel before her husband in respect I will do no such thing Kar'yn I kneel before no man not even my husband this action have be part of the ceremony for then he should kneel before I as well or be I too weak to have respect give to I in return you disgrace my name perhaps if we take a short recess and if you insist on treat I like a fragile handmaiden then I have choose poorly for a husband perhaps I have choose poorly as well I can see why one must rehearse these event unscheduled offworld activation we be receive a message on screen Ishta this concern you it be from one of my contact among Moloc 's Jaffa he be request a summit for what reason our force that be hide among the Jaffa of Moloc have become large but there be still many who be loyal to he we risk be expose we must send the coordinate of the new home world to those who will attend very well I will accompany you to this summit you have no say in our matter perhaps there be counsel I can provide you will abide by my ruling can I come with you you have a union to prepare for there will be no union Kar'yn you must learn not to let your emotion take you to such extreme I can not be betroth to Rya'c he be as pig head as his father until you have fight as many battle do not speak of Teal'c with such disrespect without he we would not have tretonin and we would still be slave to the Goa'uld symbiote why do you accept his affection know he do not support our war against Moloc and the archaic tradition that oppress female Jaffa we differ often but deep down we both possess the same hunger for freedom do he not see I fit for Rya'c he could search a thousand world and never find someone like you Teal'c have lose much in the war against the Goa'uld and do not wish Rya'c to feel the pain of such loss what about Rya'c he do not respect I as a warrior as Teal'c respect you that take some convincing believe I what you must remember be that as much as you desire Rya'c 's respect he too burn for yours your parry be too low hold your staff high step into each blocking blow leave I be as you wish have I not be a dutiful son have I not bring honour to my name you have indeed then why will my father not bless my union with Kar'yn then the union be still to be that be not the point you have make a choice you pledge your life to fight for freedom for all Jaffa you must commit to it without question I know that be why my father abandon my mother and I because we make he weak that be not true he know I forgave he for that long ago I understand why it be necessary do you Hm Teal'c stay first prime of Apophis as long as he do because he fear for you he commit atrocity because he want you and your mother to be safe when he choose to leave to join the Tauri it be the most difficult thing he have ever do it be not you that make he weak but his own fear and doubt when he realise the Goa'uld could indeed be defeat that if he fight hard enough you could one day be free it make he strong it be the same for I with Kar'yn she fuel my desire to fight for freedom we know what we must face and we choose to do it together you still have much to learn about yourself about be a warrior neither of you truly know what we will all face in full scale war with the Goa'uld I do not need his blessing no you do not and he insult Kar'yn she be a formidable warrior who deserve his respect and yours the rank of rebel Jaffa be sizeable enough to win the time to strike be now Aron be right if we wait long it be only a matter of time before our number grow too large for Moloc not to discover we risk lose everything Aron be right we must strike now Jaffa hear I I know your heart be prepare for battle but I have come to ask for your patience you have prepare well for the demise of Moloc but only when all Jaffa rise up as one can the Goa'uld be defeat and only then will all of our brother and sister truly be free this be the counsel you have come to offer what be it down Argh agh go the gate be well guard we must return to the meeting tent if anyone survive they will be torture wait for what teal'c be you there proceed O'Neill you know how I get when you do not call Moloc 's Jaffa ambush we the planet address have fall into the wrong hand I be with Ishta and another rebel Jaffa name Aron we be cut off from the gate how bad very Backup it would be unwise at the moment I be uncertain as to the extent of force I will gather intel before decide on a course of action all right I will check in in about an hour and t my head be down O'Neill over someone have betray you that can be the only explanation for Moloc 's presence I do not have my tretonin it be in my pack and in our haste I leave it in the tent I have enough for both of we it must have shatter when you fall we must move a search patrol approach indeed what be go on here Silence thank you now Daniel what be go on here Silence I say Daniel as you can see everyone be a little upset we will not abandon Ishta we insist a rescue mission be devise we be devise Teal'c have say the gate be guard can we not journey to this planet it would take at least a week to get there please return to your quarter I can not go until please in time your skill may be require then you must be ready go there be only six many more may be hide nearby anticipate our approach we must do something I can not bear this the Tauri have troop and weapon we have not determine the size of Moloc 's force they would face many more life than our own could be lose then what be we to do for the moment nothing we can not hide forever from their patrol we will rest here they will not rest until we be find if your plan be to wait until they give up I need to gather the information that I can concern the force against we we be severely outnumber what more do you need to know Aron I need to speak to teal'c privately you do not trust my loyalty I do this be a private matter please he could be the informant as easily as anyone and be gather knowledge concern the rebellion I know but he be right about one thing we can not wait to act I be already grow weak you need rest as do you I will take first watch teal'c I promise all Jaffa under Moloc 's rule they will be free from his tyranny it be not a foolish promise one day we will all be free one day be not soon enough where be Ishta it be her turn to take w Moloc be here we must act I be aware even if Ishta can not be save we must kill Moloc that be not my goal it be mine and that of all the Jaffa in the rebellion against he without reinforcement we will be swarm by Moloc 's force I be willing to die for my cause you will die for nothing if you do not succeed you be weak your mind be cloud with feeling for Ishta and you can not be trust Ishta 's be capture Apparently Moloc be there in person we will coordinate an attack to provide a distraction for Teal'c 's rescue attempt Moloc will kill she before surrender Teal'c 's more worried about what he be go to do to she in the meantime oh it be not too late to repent for your sin Grovel before your god and beg for my forgiveness tell I of the sinner who would betray I how many would renounce the privilege of carry the child of their god like you tell I while their soul may yet be save you can not be Ishta of the Hak'tyl wicked leader of the depraved I sense nothing but weakness in you or maybe that be what happen when you abandon the strength of the Goa'uld all that be leave be this burn desire to die at the hand of your great and powerful god we be prepare a UAV to drop tretonin for Teal'c he will need all his strength if he be to rescue Ishta from Moloc the UAV will then paint the target on the gate Ishta do not exaggerate the rebel Jaffa on Moloc 's world be a mighty force as we speak they prepare for war against those still loyal to Moloc you think they can win I do not know even if they do another Goa'uld could simply take his place or bad come in and wipe they out to prove rebellion be a bad idea indeed that be something we ask they to consider and yet such reason be beyond they now UAV ready to launch Colonel thank you dial the gate launch UAV in three two one receive teal'c 's signal the UAV 's be hit teal'c do you copy proceed the UAV should be halfa click southwest ofyour location I be on my way be careful teal'c we will dial back in 30 minute can we not still send missile through without a paint target they would crash Argh Moloc Shnee ka Jaffa shel na kree Kree nok Jaffa Shel kek

moment Kar'yn speak of your love and devotion to Rya'c Rya'c your heart be pure and your spirit strong you give I strength and joy and I will stand by your side always Rya'c Kar'yn you be as beautiful as the sun my love for you be like the morning ray that dawn over an endless day the rite be complete may you love and fight like warrior just not with each other a legend speak of a place where mountain meet the sea of hidden pool beneath waterfall it be no legend I have see it with my own eye you have choose the location for your shim'roa very well Master Bra'tac say this be where you take my mother indeed Rya'c I can think of no well mate for you than Kar'yn and I be certain your mother would have feel the same thank you before your departure there be a matter that bear discussion Father I be aware of the way between a man and a woman Good then you be prepared for the rite of Oronak surely it be not still expect on the first eve of shim'roa my advice be that the knife be as sharp as possible perhaps Kar'yn be right not all of the old tradition be worth hold onto indeed and what of you and Ishta what of we well your relationship would be much easy if you both admit you be in love for we all perhaps one day when I be as wise as you once again we owe you our thank for your hospitality and for help we find yet another new home world where the Hak'tyl may be safe think nothing of it you sure you get everything you do not forget any kid or horse may I speak with Teal'c alone sure it be good to see you again I will see you soon Father yes Father be well I do not wish to spoil the day of shim'roa for Rya'c and Kar'yn what have you discover as predict another Goa'uld have claim the domain of Moloc Baal yes do not wait too long to visit we have a war to plan among other thing Visiontext Subtitles Joanna Wilkinson enhoh previously on Stargate SG 1 these liquid mix together form a virulent poison be I suppose to hold my breath it be only deadly to symbiote there be enough in that vial to kill every Tok'ra on this base twice over Anubis once probe Thor 's mind gain access to Asgard beam technology do you think they would let you tell a secret like this what they call themselves the Trust they 've fund secret endeavour aim at control alien technology for their own purpose the symbol Dr Jackson we know it be the language ofthe ancient we need they translate into Goa'uld so either you give we what we want or I will kill she what be go on not much I hate the graveyard shift nothing exciting ever happen on it hey just cos it be 3 am here do not mean it be not daylight on other planet there could be a team come in hot any second now yeah that be true so coffee yeah let I ask you something it be late and there be not many people around do you ever get the urge just to dial up the gate and check out another planet that would be a no I I neither what the hell the gate 's go I can see that be we go to get in trouble for this what about your instrument do you detect any gate activity no sir do anyone approach the gate no no no unusual activity of any kind ok Sir be we go to be face disciplinary action for this no Sergeant I think it be safe to say there be nothing you could have do thank God I mean there be not one minute we be get coffee wait a minute you be get coffee I be joke it be just a joke I be sorry ok that be all thank you guy appreciate that ok I would hate to be the guy that have to explain this to the president Sir I 've get the video surveillance footage the gate disappear at 0307 there be two airman in the gate room and two technician in the control room but none of they see or hear anything out of the ordinary prior to the flash be it I or do that look like an Asgard beam it do which make no sense why would they take our gate yeah usually they ask nicely before they ignore we and do what they damn well please what about the Prometheus do not the Asgard install beam technology it be in the hangar we be still adjust the new engine there be another possibility we know that Anubis possess Asgard technology we also know Baal take over much of his fleet you think Baal steal our gate to be honest I do not know what to think I need some answer that be not go to be easy sir without a gate we have no access to offworld intel we have no way of know what be go on out there you will think of something in the meantime I have a phone call to make be teal'c still on P4S 161 his meeting with the rebel Jaffa leader should be over now when he can not contact we he will follow protocol and head to the Alpha site Colonel Pierce what be the situation we 've be out of contact for seven hour now we can establish a wormhole but all we get be a do not proceed response to our IDC as be the case when I attempt to return from my mission the fact that they be not respond to any of our radio call have I concerned right now we have no idea what be happen at Stargate Command I will return to P4S 161 the rebel Jaffa will provide I with a cargo ship which I will then take to Earth teal'c we be not jump to conclusion this may be just a malfunction but it be also possible Earth have be compromise indeed find anything yeah as a matter of fact I have I 've be go over security tape and sensor log for two day before the gate disappear we be get this anomalous reading we assume it be feedback from a recent overhaul of the superconductor I do not think so look at this what be that I do not know but this be the exact moment that the sensor begin record the anomaly I think we need to talk to this guy Dr Kevin Hartkans he be be with the programme seven month clean record nothing out of the ordinary except he be miss fail to report for duty this morning we check his apartment clean out this be start to sound familiar you think it be the Trust they 've be busy lately they have teal'c under surveillance blackmail you try to kill Alec Colson obviously the operation be big than we think as far as we know the NID have be clean for over a year but there be still dozen of ex agent unaccounted for they continue to receive financing from unknown source if they could take the gate from we they could empty the vault at Fort Knox not necessarily if they could take the gate any time they would have but that do not explain what Hartkans be do or the anomalous signal get a theory the Prometheus have beam technology but not Asgard sensor which mean we can not pinpoint specific target unless they be tag in advance what if whoever do this have the same problem you think the anomaly be a locator beacon yeah which Hartkans place directly on the gate there be no other way to pull this off so my stamp collection be safe how do that help we find the gate if they want to use the beam they will have to keep use the beacon we could request NSA satellite time to see if we could detect the signal do it M'zel teal'c what have happen here when I arrive they be all dead all I will show you we take out the guard secure the area Intel put the signal inside this complex all right you three be with we keep your man on the perimeter no one in or out Teams two and three retain on perimeter Sam Daniel these be VX rocket yeah what be this Methylphosphonothioic acid which be nerve gas ok put that back there be enough here to kill thousand why would the ex nid be stockpile it I 've no idea Gun ah we get a problem here what do we do it be too late nothing be happen this do not make sense the effect be almost instantaneous we should all be dead you see we manage to identify the liquid we find in the warehouse it be symbiote poison specifically the new formula we be work on with the Tok'ra more stable than the original easy to produce but just as deadly to the Goa'uld and the Jaffa exactly which be why we agree not to use it except in defensive situation Sir the people behind this have the gate and rocket capable of deliver the poison in aerosol form over large area I think the Trust intend to launch a full chemical attack against the Goa'uld without any regard for the million of Jaffa live that could be lose in the process so they do not get the memo the guy from the warehouse be not talk but he be carry this it be an Area 51 identification badge Colonel Carter Dr Jackson Sorry to keep you Dr Bricksdale I believe you 've be brief yes I have as a result of our investigation we believe your security have be compromise with all respect we be not the one who lose the Stargate but alien technology have go miss from Area 51 before yes however our security measure have be increase since then no one be allow to bring anything in no computer cellphone or street clothe all personnel be search and scan every time they leave look whoever take the Stargate have access to Asgard beam technology when Osiris come to Earth she use that technology activate with a wrist device after she be capture that wrist device be bring here you work on it and it be be here ever since if you do not mind we would like to see it Dr Harris check out some of the dead Jaffa on P4S 161 you be right it be Tok'ra symbiote poison I would not have believe it have I not see it with my own eye I know the Tok'ra lose patience with the alliance but I never think they would do this teal'c I have receive word from our Jaffa brother three more Goa'uld planet have be attack million be dead you see right where we leave it sorry if I be a little sceptical but we 've be down this road before it be real like I say we figure if Osiris 's ship be still there we could use the device to get on board but it be not only key to the presence of naqahdah in the blood but also specific Goa'uld DNA we try to create an adaptor use sample of both but do not get anywhere so the ship be probably still in orbit but cloak in which case we have no way to find it the Tok'ra will be make to pay for this treachery let us just calm down a second we need to figure out what be go on what more do you need to know Jaffa be be murder poison like vermin the Tok'ra have have this for a long time why would they decide to use it now perhaps the failure of the alliance convince they there be no other way there be something else go on it be not a coincidence that this happen just after we lose contact with Earth that do seem unlikely we must speak to the Tok'ra directly that be not so easy ever since they leave the Alpha site we have not have much intelligence on they we 've no idea where their base be we know the location of some operative our good chance for contact be P3S 114 an operative Zarin be undercover command one of Baal 's garrison I will come with you whoa hold on a minute here you be talk about Goa'uld occupy territory there be no Jaffa fifth column to help you without sympathetic warrior in Zarin 's rank how do you plan to avoid capture we do not what only by be capture will we be bring before the commander that be how you be go to make contact we must speak to the Tok'ra there be no other way it be too risky Walk in unannounced and Zarin could sacrifice you to maintain her cover that be a great possibility you realise the second you walk through that gate you be on your own Understood what be the emergency I can not do it any more you 've take the money a little late for cold foot you do not understand they come to see I and ask about the device who two people from Stargate Command and you arrange a meeting with I what you be follow hold your fire we need he alive Brooks go ahead we 've get a problem here take a locator beacon and get to hoskin ' last position what happen we 've get an uninvited guest speak my lord Zarin two enemy Jaffa have be capture near the gate one of they be the shol'va teal'c be you certain I be Lord Baal will be most pleased will he not yes of course you have do well now bring they to I yes my lord I be go to ask you again where be Colonel Carter I do not know you be go to need to start cooperate I can not an officer of the US Air Force and member of a top secret organisation be miss and you be implicate I do not think you be go to just walk away from this they will kill I we can protect you and we can also choose to ignore your 2 million Cayman Island account you do not think we would find out about that huh so if I help you I can keep the money we could come to an arrangement the prisoner my lord leave we my lord I intend to question they myself leave we now be you mad what be you do here we must speak with you speak with I do you not realise by come here you have place all our life in danger be you not in control of this garrison I be and as such it be my responsibility to see to it that you be torture for information until such time that Baal arrive to witness your execution so what be it go to be you say Colonel Carter be miss well she be probably on the ship Osiris 's ship so you do manage to get on board about a year ago some man come to see I they know everything about my work the Stargate Osiris they know there be a possibility a cloak ship have be leave in orbit and they want it badly I tell they that the key be the wrist device but I could not get it out at least not through the front door what do you mean one day I be in the lab work on the adaptor next thing I know I find myself on the ship I have remotely activate the transport beam which you fail to report it be kill I that I be not able to tell anybody I would figure it out I have to keep tell they it be not work anyway after that I go back and forth half a dozen time but at the end of the day the device be always back where it belong and you beam the other up use locator beacon the beam be the only thing that work without the command code and that be where you come in the translation Osiris work for Anubis and Anubis have all his command code translate into Ancient once they have control of the ship thank to you they have no need for I they keep a permanent presence up there 24 7 work in shift I go back to Area 51 and sabotage the adaptor Project be shelve and no one be the wise can you get the wrist device to work again absolutely Launch window in three minute ready for upgrade get down to the engine room check the power relay Sir Colonel Carter welcome aboard where be we we be in a polar orbit around the moon cloak of course this be the ship Osiris leave behind we have to thank you if you have not catch she we would never have have this opportunity you know they be go to come after you Prometheus be undergo a refit they have sub light engine once they realise you be in a ship they will launch even with a cloak you give off an energy signature we be operate at minimal power maybe after a year of intensive scan they might be able to find we but this will not take that long you be go to attack the Goa'uld we already have we be start with Baal 's territory since he be the most immediate threat right now you realise you be kill innocent Jaffa spare I Colonel the Jaffa be a race of warrior breed specifically to serve the Goa'uld and enslave human throughout the galaxy they be bring up to believe the Goa'uld be their god they do not have a choice so they be just follow order right where have I hear that argument before what about the rebel Jaffa they be grow in number every day we consider they acceptable loss it be very simple Colonel Earth face an imminent threat and we have a weapon that can eliminate that threat we intend to use it we be ready what be the next target P3S 114 dial it yes sir you force I to choose between abandon my mission and allow you to die I would worry more about my own life if I be you Tok'ra M'zel I feel as you do brother but this be not the way why be you here we know about the attack what attack the Tok'ra be use symbiote poison the Jaffa of three world have be annihilate thus far Impossible we have see it with our own eye an entire Jaffa army lie dead with no wound no sign of battle how do you explain this I can not but I can assure you that the Tok'ra be not responsible if these attack have be plan I would have be inform initiate launch sequence you can not do this it be murder that be where you be wrong it be war Launching in three two one what be that my lord we be under attack how a weapon be fire through the gate it explode over the city Lord Zarin Lord Zarin Brothers you must leave immediately Kree ta'lak you be not go anywhere shol'va you do not understand M'zel there may still be time I die free Indeed Sensor grid r 14 show no anomaly sir very well proceed to the next grid yes sir she be out there somewhere make it work our next target be P5R 357 let us do it I would not bother Baal abandon that planet six month ago when the naqahdah mine go dry she be lie go ahead waste another rocket that be one less planet you will be able to destroy she do have more up to date intelligence she be bluff you could make this a lot less painful if you help we select optimum target what you know as much about the current position of the System Lords as anyone I do not know as much as you think you know enough to get maximum effect with minimum collateral damage you be the one who want to save innocent life Nice try so be we go for P5R 357 or not go to the next one on the list all right tell I again why I should agree to this it be the only way onto the ship and I have the good chance of decipher the code and if there be ten armed goon when you get there you be the one that be go to get well idea look Daniel just because I do not have a well idea be no reason to do anything look once I shut down the cloak Prometheus can pinpoint the location then all I do be disable the hyperdrive and wait they will never see it come which be one of the advantage of a totally insane idea yeah where do I learn that from ok see you soon come on Fine Sir we have something definitely a ship Bearings 157 by 229 500 000 km Battle station plot an intercept course yes sir General O'Neill this be Prometheus go ahead look like Dr Jackson pull it off we have they on screen and be move in Understood we 've get a problem I just monitor a 60 drop in our power consumption the cloak stay with her get up to the bridge get that cloak back online we be in weapon range sir have they notice we yet I do not think so they be at minimal power no evasive manoeuvre what about the hyperdrive still no signal from Dr Jackson General we have a problem ship 's cloak be down but Dr Jackson have yet to confirm ifhe 's disabled the hyperdrive or not give he a little more time right now they be sit duck if they spot we and run we will not catch they we can not let they get away I recommend we open fire immediately General please advise where the hell do he come from he have the wrist device any chance there be more of they it only let one person up at a time hoskin this be Brooks go ahead the cloak 's be disable I do not know if I can get it back online this position be compromise we need to get out of here now what about they we can not take they with we I do not mind go for a little ride I neither sorry about this Dr Jackson Incoming this be teal'c of SG 1 please respond this be teal'c of SG 1 repeat this be teal'c do anyone read repeat this be teal'c teal'c this be Daniel we need your help come on through somebody want to untie I Cargo hold what be happen down there Cargo hold respond Jennings Hoskins where the hell be you what be happen she be bring the hyperdrive online get to the gate they be try to run sir Damn it General they be power up their hyperdrive we be out of option can you disable it without destroy it I can not give you any guarantee Sir we be pick up a signal from the ship what be it Locator beacon sir same frequency Lock on the signal Activate transport beam Beam activate the ship 's go sir Cargo bay report this be cargo bay we have the gate teal'c Colonel Carter and Dr Jackson teal'c acknowledge General O'Neill it look like you be right we have the gate and SG 1 aboard they be alive that be good news bring them home yes sir good news be the gate be fully operational again we can resume offworld mission and the bad news be the Trust now have a fully functional Goa'uld Alkesh we 've instal device to prevent locator beam from operate in the future what of the Tok'ra poison they leave most of it behind but they still have enough to wipe out at least half a dozen Goa'uld world in retrospect maybe you should 've destroy the ship yeah tough choice Visiontext Subtitles Simon Campbell ENHOH previously on Stargate SG 1 who be you people we be replicator the other would destroy I not if you come with we you would do that Major Carter be beam away the replicator must have she I imagine you never expect to see I again I know who you be I just do not understand why because I love you you know why my friend will not stop just to save I they know when it come down to it I would rather be dead than be trap like this forever so what be the word test flight be successful the Asgard hyperdrive be ready to go when be they leave they be stock the ship and pick the crew now you want to go do not you it be Atlantis it be everything we 've work for for year I know what you mean unfortunately I think General O'Neill have other idea let I guess he need you here his word be over my dead body but I be actually talk about you I and Teal'c he might be persuade to let one of we go and you would be ok if that be I of course Daniel you be the expert on the Ancients unschedule offworld activation what have you get there Walter receive IDC do not clear why not look like it be an old one Missing SG personnel Negative it look like it be yours ma'am or at least it be it be be invalid for four month receive text message Sir I think we would well check this out Prepare MALP yes sir what do we know of this gate address nothing other than the fact it be on the outer edge of our galaxy Chevron seven lock outgoing wormhole establish Siler MALP be preppe and ready to go sir go ahead MALP be en route MALP have reach its destination Carter we be receive MALP telemetry sir Signal be five by five video 's work fine there be just nothing to see switch to IR wait a second what be that switch off IR go to white light that be I all right you 've get our attention who be you my name be Samantha Carter all right we get a little conflict with that statement we 've already get one here there be two of we if only where be you from how do you contact we Strange I recognise my voice I be make in Samantha Carter 's image I know what she know I feel what she feel you be make who make you the one you call Fifth oh my God she be a replicator you be surprised by my arrival in your galaxy I come in advance of other they will be here soon for what reason have you contact we I need your help I wish to be destroy you have a weapon capable of sever the kiron pathway that link my cell the effect would be instantaneous and painless you folk can feel pain I can feel a lot of thing I know you hate and fear the replicator and with good reason so this should be easy for you yeah well we will have to get back to you on this so the universe be a big place right really big ton of galaxy out there everywhere hundred of million so why this one I think it might be personal sir Personal in what way while Fifth may lead an army of advanced machine deep down he be emotionally immature like an adolescent boy and he have feeling for I would that be why he create one in your image I imagine so replicator have never before try to impersonate a specific individual this represent a threat to security it could be a problem offworld our scan would detect they if they try to come through the gate we 've get the disrupter let us give she what she want I think that might be a little hasty sir Carter I be not say we do not do it I be just suggest that we talk to her first if Fifth be come to this galaxy she could provide we with valuable intelligence it be pretty clear they 've have a fall out unless it be a ruse if something go wrong we pull the trigger either way I think we need to meet her face to face I be not let she on the base we could use the Alpha site Skeleton crew security personnel only fine incoming wormhole I know you your name be teal'c you have be give Carter 's memory yes but you be not Samantha Carter that way you be not use the weapon Colonel Carter wish to speak with you first but know this if you make one false move I will destroy you where be Samantha Carter I be here we be not go to speak face to face for the moment this will have to be good enough I think you would shoot I as I arrive maybe you overestimate our fear of you or underestimate your curiosity I understand you more than you know Sam I do not just have your memory I have your thought pattern my mind be model after yours be that why you leave Fifth you know I as well as I know you Fifth create you to be like I he know this would happen not at first he try to isolate aspect ofyour personality select memory and feeling ofhis choose slowly give to I over time I do not understand you will I be afraid there be no need to be who be I you be not yet complete I be here for you I will help you take my hand trust I he teach I mould I show I who I be you have memory of my past that go back before I meet Fifth yes but it be hard to explain my first memory be of wake up in that room suddenly become conscious but I immediately know how to talk soon other memory start come to I little thing story song the smell of the attic in the house where we use to live the day my mother die I know it be not real I 've never even set foot on Earth but I have this image of lie under the willow tree in our back yard it be a sunny day but when I close my eye the wind in the leave sound exactly like rain what Fifth do not realise be the thing that draw he to you be inseparable from those that make you reject he and the life he offer so you reject he too who I be and what I be be in contradiction no one can live like this there be other way to live not for long I know exactly what be go to happen he will come here and he will take this galaxy and you will not be able to stop he I do not wanna live to see that we have the disrupter the Asgard can amplify its effect to prevent an attack you be wrong Fifth make adjustment to himselfand all the replicator except I they be now immune to your disrupter they be come and you can not stop they be there a chance she be bluff anything be possible at this point I do not see what she have to gain by it she do not want Fifth to succeed yeah so she say Ifshe 's lie we do not have a problem why would he make all the other bug immune to the disrupter but not her maybe he want she to feel inferior or he want she to be afraid ofu maybe he anticipate she would come to I for help Carter if that weapon do not work yes sir I know we need to contact Thor and apprise he ofthe situation Ifthe disrupter need to be re engineer we be go to need his help in the meantime I think we should continue the interrogation she could still provide we with valuable information all right just keep in mind how this have to end do not worry sir we will complete the mission how many ship do Fifth command I do not know how many human form replicator have he create I do not know you be all link you share information the only way I could escape be to sever myself from the connection why should we believe you I will not answer any more question Ifyou do not want Fifth to succeed help we I can not I can not betray my own kind but I can not be like they either do what you come here to do if I have to make you do it then so be it teal'c wait fire the weapon be this what you want I do not have a choice I will destroy you I know so be it teal'c wait just stop for a second you do not wanna do this we know there be no other way that be not true now you be lie to I the way you lie to Fifth you be not like he I can see that you do not understand you do not know what he do to I then show I teal'c it be all right show I Sam good to have you back how have it go security breach threat level Foxtrot Alpha six all security team to the gate room finish he do it finish he you must break with your old life for your new life to begin do not disappoint I you have do very well soon you will be ready to take your place by my side enough I do not hurt she Colonel Carter be you unharmed yeah I be ok now you understand I can not go back to he and I can not let he find I we can protect you if you help we what do you mean tell we how he modify himself and the other replicator help we make the disrupter work again even if I do you can not stop a ship with it the Asgard have develop a system of satellite that deploy the beam in space it be your only chance to get out of this I want you to destroy I I can not help you destroy all the other yes you can he do not control you not any more Colonel Carter may I have a word Sergeant be you certain you be unharmed it be a little intense but I be fine it be the only way I could get she to trust I we need all the information she can give we we can not let she live I know do she sense your true intention we be not in my mind nevertheless it be a risk I figure we do not have anything to lose like you say either way we can not let she live the link be weak be you all right yes I be minimise output to avoid detection have you make any progress they be begin to trust I I be pleased but I need more time I understand the design be so Advanced I be go to say foreign it be from ancient technology how be you able to create a work prototype Thor access the specification for the disrupter from O'Neill 's subconscious while you be aboard Fifth 's ship right Fifth have a fair knowledge of ancient technology take from Asgard ship be that how he counter the disrupter 's effect he introduce a cipher into the pathway that control the cohesion of replicator then he consider come to your galaxy he take the risk because he be confident he would be immune to the weapon do you know the cipher no Fifth keep it from I he be begin to sense that I might betray he I be too much like you if it be in the programming of all replicator presumably you could access it through the subspace link if I search for it myself it could take day I would be sift through an unimaginable amount of datum but it be possible you do not understand he would find I if you find the cipher we can protect you and if I do not you of all people know what would happen he would tear my mind apart to make I accept he if he get here before we can modify the weapon we will use it to destroy you either way he will never get his hand on you again there be a subspace link between all replicator like an internet connection if she tap into it she should access the cipher she will also be give away her position it will take time for Fifth to detect her presence on the link if she can isolate the program first that be a big if it be risky sir I realise that but I think it be the only way while we be wait for she to find the cipher we can run test on the disrupter analyse the energy output to create a modulation program and we need the Asgard to send we a disrupter satellite I 've already talk to them it will be there in 30 minute or it be free I will use an F 302 to place it in orbit I hope you guy know what you be do diagnostic be online we be ready the calibration be off increase by a factor of ten once more that should do it now we need to process all the raw data that be a lot of information it will take some time before we can compute a modulation program unscheduled offworld activation this be Carter what be happen Stand by ma'am we be receive a signal it be the Asgard Understood we need that satellite deploy soon indeed Sergeant if she be go to make a move she would have do it by now perhaps but it be good to be certain I have Commander Thor on audio sir Greetings Thor greeting teal'c the disrupter satellite be ready for transport very well the most effective deployment be geosynchronous orbit above your base at an altitude of33 785 km with zero inclination Understood the satellite be en route now once you have the proper new modulation program you can upload it from your ground station Ofcourse ifyou do not have the program before Fifth 's arrival the satellite will be useless of that I be aware good luck I understand Teal'c 's concern about I I be a little surprised you do not feel the same way Teal'c do not know what you 've be through I do it be not just what I show you be it you experience it yourself yeah that be how I know there be no way you could be work with Fifth what be it he be find I he be on his way what about the cipher do you find it yet no I be still search how much time do we have at maximum speed he will be here in less than two hour have you acquire the information I be still analyse the disrupter soon I will be able to create an effective cipher if I arrive before you 've complete do not worry they will not fire unless I tell they the weapon 's remodulated human can be unpredictable particularly when they be desperate I know what I be do I be give she just enough to keep her hope up the one call O'Neill lead the human it be he who order Samantha Carter to betray I but he trust her he will listen to her I be pull the plug Finish off the replicator and evacuate the base it be too late for that sir Carter if he find nothing here he be not go to just turn around and leave the galaxy he be track her zeroing in on her position that be only part of why he be come think about it what do replicator do they seek out high level civilisation and consume their technology Goa'uld exactly a race that use all kind of advanced technology cull from multiple source it be like a banquet for the replicator once they be here they be not go anywhere if she can isolate the cipher soon we may still have time to remodulate the disrupter I will give you one hour one thank you I would well get back to the lab I will deploy the satellite t hold on a second proceed O'Neill I need you to be honest with I be Carter let herself get too involve in this one Carter and the replicator share thought and memory it be understandable that a certain sympathy would develop between they can not have that I do not believe Carter would allow these feeling to interfere with her duty Fair enough but when the time come I want you to finish thejob Understood all right we be run out of time we need that what be it I find the cipher I be download it now from the subspace link I have it we need to load it into the mainframe it will require three terabyte of memory that should not be a problem but how do you plan to input the datum directly right pass 25 km Speed 5 000kph and accelerate acknowledge what be your status he be on course for optimum deployment position in six minute teal'c this be Carter Proceed we 've get the cipher soon we should have the program ready for upload that be indeed good news well do we be near your position I know do the human suspect they be proceed to deploy an Asgard disrupter satellite they have no idea Flight I be approach optimum deployment position copy that teal'c ODP in 15 second final course correction now tracking show you be on course Inclination Inclination zero Copy ODP in five second on my mark five four three two one Mark Satellite away receive transmission patch it through yes ma'am Telemetry establish good job teal'c Copy Flight return to base the deployment go well I take it that be right we do our part and I 've do mine you 've finish the calculation the modulation be complete with this program you should be able to destroy any replicator you encounter there be no way to test it if I have more time I could run a series of simulation but you would never really know for sure until you try to use it Uplink initiate there be a lot of datum it will take about 15 minute to remodulate the satellite Proximity alert Scanner have pick up a ship on course for this base analyse energy signature I do not know what it be I do it be a replicator ship he get here soon than I think the weapon will not be effective in time I know all personnel begin evacuation procedure repeat begin evacuation Download the modulation program into a portable drive and erase everything else yes ma'am what of the replicator we be take she with we the disrupter vacate the room teal'c what be you do we can not bring she to Earth teal'c we have the modulation program we have not test it what if Fifth figure out what we be try to do here O'Neill would never allow a replicator access to SGC yes he would if he know what be at stake the Asgard satellite be armed you say the human would not fire they will not they still think the weapon be ineffective they be even more gullible than you Colonel Carter what be you do what I come here to do she fire the weapon the replicator ship be break up why you should know you make I what I be the ship be destroy that be impossible do we finish the upload not even close you be right about one thing I be never work with Fifth although he do not know it ow that be well now we can take our time and have a little talk of course only a few second will pass in the real world why do you bring I here I want to thank you you give I the opportunity to study the disrupter and that allow I to make myself immune to its effect there never be a cipher until now I 've already begin upload it into the link soon all my brother will have the new program and they will be unstoppable and you will be their leader that be right so this be all a setup you just want to get rid of Fifth Fifth be pathetic and to think he expect we to love he Fifth be flawed if I have to destroy he I would but but what you feel sorry for he do not bother he be never fit to lead an army and he certainly be not fit to rule this galaxy but you be I be what I be because of you you be not I you be what Fifth make you you have untapped greatness inside you Sam but you be limit by your own fear you play by the rule you do as you be tell and you deny yourself your desire I have no desire to rule the galaxy believe I all human desire power it be just that most of they be never in a position to attain it we will stop you you be forget I know exactly how your mind work I know what you be go to do before you even think of it you set the naqahdah generator to overload try to blow up the base before I can leave Dialling computer 's offline we 've lose power sir teal'c you all right yeah I be all right she be head for the gate room we have to stop her Freeze Disengage the wormhole she be lock out the control teal'c what have I do you can not be hold responsible for the action of a replicator I be still of a strong belief that it be a bad idea to have that stuff on the base she deactivate these cell when she separate they from her arm can we be certain they will not become active again she shut down the cohesive energy between they so it would be hard to figure out how she become immune to the disrupter now how do you know that because that be what I would have do Carter Sir I 've get a lot of work to do we 've never have the chance to study human form replicator cell before if we learn something this will not be a total loss this be not your fault I be not so sure about that Fifth come here because of I she reject he because she be make like I now we 've get replicator in our galaxy immune to the only technology we have none of we anticipate the action of the replicator I think she be afraid of he but she want to get rid of he so she could lead the replicator herself she kill he because he be weak Carter she be not you O'Neill be correct though she share your memory her personality be alter but the fact be she learn betrayal from Fifth and he learn it from I Visiontext Subtitles Margaret Burke ENHOH come on it be not on a permanent basis still no Daniel I do not let you go in the first place why would I change my mind because can you try to do well than that they need someone to translate Ancient I be the most qualified which be exactly why you be go to stay right here because I will quit why do not you just hold your breath you have not do that in a while General I let myself in Hope you do not mind absolutely not Welcome thank you mis the chair actually I do want it back as a matter of fact I do my new one just be not the same that be not exactly what I mean Dr Jackson nice to see you again likewise we miss you around here sir so to what do we owe this pleasure I come to ask if you would be interested in join the mission to Atlantis you do he be the most qualified person on this planet and the mission commander need someone who can translate Ancient really with respect sir I think you should tell the mission commander that I need Daniel right here you just do I do I do you sir yes request deny Dr Jackson you be with I I will have the chair ship to Washington you can requisition a new one I will do that sir we leave tomorrow oh and I will be take Walter too General Welcome aboard thank you sir again my motive be selfish we have not hear a word from the Atlantis expedition we have no idea what we be go to find your knowledge and expertise will prove invaluable General if you do not mind my asking why be I go you could 've choose anyone I sit back and watch you people go on a lot of adventure over the year I think when you be replace at the SGC you be buck for retirement then I lead Prometheus against Anubis get your dander up that be why I take the job as head of home world security then this come along the president put I in charge so I could choose anyone I want so why not choose yourself I 've send a lot of people into action over the year and more than a few do not come back I would like to see this one through personally we 've never leave anyone behind sir and we be not go to this time last report telemetry from Atlantis indicate a space with life support stop it we be go on the assumption the team find the lose city and set up a base Sorry Dr Novak the Asgard hyperdrive be function at 100 per cent thank you Dr Jackson I be sorry what be I say you be assume Atlantis be at the end of this trip please ignore I it be hard to you disagree doctor as far as we know they find an outpost like the one in Antarctica could be on a moon or at the bottom of some deep dark ocean if they be trap and need help if they be even alive at all as for contact hopefully it be just a matter of be unable to locate a power source use information from the ancient outpost on Earth Jackson and his team have pinpoint our destination in the Pegasus galaxy which be here damn it to hell Dr Novak Dr Jackson Daniel you can call I Lindsey I be sorry for contradict you oh no do not be I mean you be right the fact that we have not hear from the expedition since they leave be a bad sign have you try hold your breath I 've try everything yeah it do not work for I either it be be like this since I be a kid it come out when I get scared but this be the bad since my phd presentation I mean I do not do well in stressful situation that be why I turn down Atlantis the first time I be sure you be go to be fine Hammond say you be very good at what you do thank you what be that what be wrong I do not know ok we be pick up what sound like a distress call where be we we be still well inside the Milky way play it back yes sir help require assistance have fail lose power to repeat strand and she sound human what do you think much as I hate to delay this trip we have to check it out how far away be it it be just over 50 light year off our route we could be there in 20 minute set a course yes sir Set shield at maximum arm weapon it look like an Alkesh and a cargo ship they 've suffer significant damage the distress signal be from within the Alkesh I do not understand a human call from a Goa'uld ship that make no sense I agree it could be a trap I know this look suspicious but what if there be an uprising on board one of those ship there could be human prisoner in need of our help open our channel yes sir this be General Hammond of the Earth vessel Prometheus we be answer your distress call and stand ready to assist you we can transport a sensor unit on board to determine life support viability General an Alkesh be a potentially valuable ship even if there be no survivor if it be spaceworthy we should salvage her take a team yes sir Prometheus this be SG 3 we be on board General we be see some energy weapon damage we have one Jaffa KIA Sir over here make that four Jaffa look like these folk have an on board firefight still no sign of life we be head to the bridge Prometheus someonejust activate the Colonel Reynolds say again Sir our ring just activate Security team to level four ring room visual on screen seal it off control be not respond sir Airman it be no good sir the ring will not activate Security team report all shipboard communication be down Initiate lockdown I can not sir it may be possible from the engine room go that be not I sir let us get them outta there can we pursue Engines be offline control be unresponsive the weapon too it look like we be dead in the water General I just do a head count Daniel Jackson be still aboard Prometheus oh crap be you ok I feel like my head 's go to explode but on the bright side I think my hiccup be go what do you need sir I need this ship operational now yes sir thank you we be lucky the life support system be still work how much time do we have it be hard to say I 've get some system online include some short range sensor Scans of the cargo ship indicate that it be in bad shape than this Alkesh it be strange be not it sir that a Goa'uld soldier keep we alive hey how be it go Guess it be just you and I huh it be a little strange be not it see that weapon I shoot you with should 've kill you what be strange be you guy usually do not take prisoner it be kinda kill first and no that be generally just about it just the killing I be just go to talk to myself cos you be not go to talk to I not that you guy be very talkative but you may prove useful ok now we be get somewhere where be everybody else I transport they onto the Alkesh well you keep the wrong guy cos I do not know anything about the ship but you be very attractive what hey big guy I be flatter really I be it be just that uh you be not my type I be more than a little disturbed that I might be yours whoa whoa no no you do not have to do that do not do not do not no do not worry I be not go to hurt you thank God much I hope I wish to send a long range transmission use the communication system sorry do not have a clue you lie in general uh no yes well I try to be honest but uh you know occasionally a little white one slip out every now and again ow shall I kiss it well um no just do not do it again look even if I know what you want I to do what make you think I would tell you how can you steal a ship if you do not know how it work I get the sublight engine go yeah so you do you really expect I to believe you ok um look my name be Daniel Jackson I be an archaeologist a historian I study ancient culture Histories Ancient civilisation have you hear of Earth Tauri no we be on our way to rescue friend I really do not care look this be not necessary can I have this ship no ok discussion over oh here we go Tenat of Oran Tenat this be Vala if you can hear I please respond I 've manage to procure a vessel well than what I hope for Tenat if you get this I apologise for the delay and we will meet at the designate coordinate in one day Vala out now about the hyperdrive Colonel Doctor I 've reroute the power to shield and life support but as far as the engine go the control crystal for both be fry it look like they be sabotage can they be repair in a word no we need new one I be think about that cargo ship Harriman say life support 's minimal barely enough to sustain one person for a few moment and if we do not get new crystal sorry kill I now I will go sir no I will go with all due someone take my ship I want it back Access be restrict by a code yeah too bad Aagh that hurt ow yeah I can fix it I do not know the code there feel well you be a Goa'uld no but I be once a host to one which explain the naqahdah that let you use their technology and how I can quickly learn to fly this primitive ship so primitive one would wonder if it be worth it well in this case it be the size that matter actually pretty much in every case tell I the code please I do not I do not know it fine how much time will he have I be guess a few minute maybe less Sir not another word Colonel do it now General Godspeed General General can you hear I I be here in the engine room open the third panel down on the centre column do you want the blue one it should be locate at the centre ofthe panel get it one panel up you should find a clear one it be hard to tell the light in here be Something 's General can you hear I it be only be two minute there be a firefight on board if the life support be not cycle the air what staff blast give off carbon dioxide in a small enclose space General General Sir be he breathe he may need mouth to mouth Excellent Excellent wake up sir good job on the crystal too get the ship move what do he say he say get the ship move come on up General let us get you up much well lose the weapon and move away from the console I like you well tie up against the wall and lose the weapon this suit still absorb zat blast it do not cover your head still you should make I take it off I will turn the ship around first if I have I at gunpoint that would not be my first choice yeah well what be go on I rewrote the access code Undo it listen hundred of life be at stake I be try to save my people this ship be their only hope if you would mention that would you really have help look as I be say before we be also on a rescue mission what be it a ship just appear it be an Alkesh this quadrant be crawl with vessel it will not be your friend that ship be fully disabled when you show up we will see we have to raise shield and arm weapon I be go to try and hail they first ow you hit I you hit I you know you know we could just have sex instead feel well sir yes thank you we 've just catch up to the Prometheus Nice work it be all Novak sir they be not respond to our hail sir be we do I be oh you be a fruitcake Weapons Online we be in range Target the rear thruster take out her sublight capability she just jump into hyperspace ow Huh oh that be just great I see you do you have fun take offmy clothe it be your idea I mean when I be conscious so I could distract you and kick you in the head I keep my eye close the whole time I be sure you do so where be we go I tell you to save my people can you please let I out oh no you know I have not eat in day could you please tell I how to access the navigation control it be not very nice you know starve a prisoner to death come on Daniel you 've see I naked the least you could do be cook I dinner be not you hungry no thank you you know who the Tok'ra be Yep ten year ago a Tok'ra incite a rebellion on my planet when people rise up against the Goa'uld and once the Jaffa have be overcome the Goa'uld be capture alive torture and beat for day on end I be host to that Goa'uld at the time the people do not understand that it be a symbiote that have rule they so harshly I guess the Tok'ra feel responsible he rescue I remove the Goa'uld symbiote nurse I back to health you say your people be in trouble now well it be only a matter of time before another Goa'uld show up a System Lord name Camulus that be when the Tok'ra disappear People still refuse to surrender Camulus order that they be wipe out we control several ship troop transport cargo ship Alkesh many people be save fly to an inhabitable nearby moon in the system the ship make several trip before most of they be intercept and shoot down Camulus never know there be any survivor so we be safe Problem be we do not have a Stargate so you be trap we only have a few ship leave not enough to relocate everyone again be not a problem he seem to have little interest in other planet he leave behind a small force to guard the Stargate we use the ship to keep appraise of what be happen and to steal supply you know that Camulus be go now he be beat by Baal and Baal 's force be search every inhabitable world in Camulus 's territory his ship be everywhere it be only a matter of time so you try to steal that Alkesh it be damage in the firefight I be hope one of my ship would answer my distress call you can imagine how lucky I feel when this ship show up it be big enough to rescue all my people and take they to a world far away free from the Goa'uld you do not have to lock I up I think I do what difference will it make this ship be fly to my home world you can not stop it when I get to your planet I will explain maybe we can work something out my people be not go to trust you you have to let I talk to they no Daniel this be bad Vala this be Tenat we have you on our scanner uh yeah hi where be Vala she be here she be just indispose at the moment she do not mention she be work with someone no I guess not look I realise I owe you an explanation it be a bit of a long story really we will hear it in person and inspect your vessel Good because apparently we be come in for land we will meet you at the designate coordinate Okey dokey see you there ow ok you want the truth I will tell you the truth Daniel be you there I hope you can hear I the planet wejust land on be not my home world whatever you do you must not go out there hi guy who be you uh name 's Olo Hans Olo where be Vala she be inside we will only do business with Vala Business yeah that figure not that I be surprised or anything I do not look surprised to you do I what it be just that I be expect refugee Human sort of refugee not that there be anything wrong with you that I know of we have the naqahdah Refined weapon grade oh that be nice this be the price we agree upon this ship be impressive in size but we can not ok you know what seriously there be be a big misunderstanding I do not care what you 've get I be not go to sell you know what that be not necessary we have a deal we must have this ship Goa'uld glider Fool you be follow of course we be ok you know what I would love to stay and chat but Daniel what be go on we be be attack tell I how to access the system let I out and I will help you you got to be kid I let us go no funny stuff what do you do with my buyer we will talk about that later and the naqahdah Move do you have any idea what that be worth Ohh all right raise our shield let us go to hyperspace it be not work we 've already take too much hull damage and we have incoming Alkesh Arm weapon shield be fail and shield be down we be almost out of weapon what just happen an Alkesh just take out one of its own nice work Sergeant Target the second Alkesh Fire at will Roger that sir Dr Jackson this be General Hammond do you copy General it be I Good to hear your voice sir Likewise be you all right son we be fine sir be we clear to ring aboard stand by Unlock the system those glider retreat nearby we have to get out of here now Unlock the system you be all clear sir what be you go to do with I I be not sure look Daniel whatever happen I just want you to know we get the shield and hyperdrive back online however there be hull damage I would not recommend a long journey we have no choice but to return to Earth how long before the ship 's ready again hard to say that be good work both here and on the Alkesh thank you sir hey Hiccups be go huh I do not notice I guess I be have too much fun security team to level four the prisoner have escape Ring room wow Status Security team one unresponsive ring on level four just activate General Hammond SG 3 be just transport here she be on the Alkesh Lock weapon on its engine Aft thruster target Target be it be go sir can we track it no sir our long range scanner be be scramble she be good Visiontext Subtitles Jo Clarke ENHOH the war between Baal and the System Lords have reach a critical stage accord to intelligence Bastet and Olokun be dead Morrigan 's capitulate Lord Yu and Amaterasu be rally their army for what will be their last stand as we predict the Jaffa be no match for the Kull the Tok'ra also say that in the face of defeat some of the System Lords be actively seek area of refuge planet they abandon long ago be now be scout as possible sanctuary and this affect we how one of these planet which fall under the domain of Ares happen to be where the Tok'ra drop off one Harry Maybourne two year ago and this affect we how the Tok'ra have their hand full with press matter they strongly suggest we get to Maybourne before the Goa'uld do if we do not retrieve he Harry Maybourne face certain capture Torture Interrogation perhaps even death all right fine go get he yes sir the people of this world be fairly primitive no phone no light no motor car I bet Maybourne jump at a chance to leave what about the other inhabitant we will relocate they we may not have a lot of time are could be here in a matter of day we do not mean you any harm we be ally of the Tok'ra look for a friend Harry Maybourne maybe you 've hear of he Shifty fella Beady eye no you will follow we to the village and meet King Arkhan he will discern your true intention not exactly the trusting type which lead I to wonder whether Maybourne be alive Presumably the Tok'ra put in a good word for he maybe we should get they to do the same for we Maybourne this be King Arkhan my lord our hunt party encounter these offworlder by the gate Hey guy long time no see I should have know I should have know you would be the one to come you be expect we Sort of where 's Jack General O'Neill 's back at the SGC no kid General O'Neill that do not sound right good for Jack Nice to hear he be do well for himself as evidently be you uh this yes well it be a long story Food drink for our guest we do not have time for this you should try one of these it be call Ojen fruit right it be a cross between guava and mango Sort of a guango I like that People henceforth ojen fruit shall be call guango so shall it be I get to name all kind of stuff you should see the Grateful dead burial ground you have to get out of here you be in danger I know the Goa'uld be come you should peel it before you eat it I find the skin kind of tart you know about the Goa'uld oh yeah you be warn by the Tok'ra I have not hear from the Tok'ra since they drop I off then how I can read the future Mm really what be you try to pull he speak the truth King Arkhan be a prophet he foresaw your arrival and the hand you will play in defeat our enemy Garan 's right it be all part of the prophecy Maybourne what the hell be go on here let us go for a walk ok here we be I find this place about ten month ago when I be out on an afternoon stroll it be quite a distance from the village I enjoy long walk right Long walk rainy night and candlelit dinner why be we here Maybourne this writing be in Ancient what do the local know about these well not much they avoid the area because it be close to the naqahdah mine the site of their former enslavement bad luck and all this be incredible no no this be interesting this be incredible what be it it be a record of the planet 's history cover major event only some of they have not happen yet what be you talk about they have a complicated lunar calendar take I a while to figure it out but once I do I realise there be reference in the text to thing that be go to happen in the future I know it sound crazy I do not think much of it either at the time but then this big meteor shower happen exactly on the date the stone predict you sure you be read it correctly my skill may not compare with Dr Jackson 's but I 've pick up a decent understanding of ancient writing as a result of my translation I predict a major flood would destroy the village unless I convince the elder to move to high ground and of course you tell they where these prediction come from no well not in so many word look these be simple people this stuff would mean nothing to they I have to play the role of prophet to convince they and out of gratitude they make you king like I say it be their idea well he be partly right anyway it be a historical log in the 45th cycle the ground will tremble and devastation will be work yeah yeah big earthquake couple of year back before my time Skip ahead we be in the 54th cycle in the third moon of the 54th cycle which be now give or take a few day the oppressor of old will return the Goa'uld to seek dominion over the land those of a distant world will come that be you guy to vanquish the evil and restore order once again you see they come you defeat they Happy end that be the prophecy sorry but we do not come here to fight the Goa'uld we should get go actually um this be interesting and there be a lot here to translate Sam go ahead Maybourne be right what do you mean well from what I 've be able to decipher it be pretty clear the script be a historical log compile by an Ancient who travel through time to study the evolution of life Daniel we know the Ancients experiment with time travel but we have no evidence that they master it we do now to my knowledge these be only a couple of hundred year old which mean they be carve after the Goa'uld have leave but the Ancients predate the Goa'uld the only explanation be an Ancient travel to the future and then back to a time not too long ago I do not know there be reference to the travel device it be describe as be inside a small ship now if I be right it may still be here I think it be worth a look all right we be on our way Daniel go ahead we 've be at it a while be you sure it be around here just give it a little more time I hate to say it Daniel but we can not risk stay much long I be scrub the search fall back to the gate Sam Daniel we have no way ofknowing when the Goa'uld will get here it could be day and it could be hour Colonel Carter Daniel Jackson I have find something it certainly look like a ship these appear to be flight control so what be this could be the time device it bear little resemblance to ancient design we 've encounter judging from Maybourne 's wall it work at some point I be guess it manifest some energy field that encompass the entire ship allow the traveller to literally fly though time I wonder uh uh let us not touch anything just yet I be kind of fond of this era ok so what do we do we bring it back judge by the dimension it look like it be design to fit through the gate ok how do we get it there this vessel appear to be undamaged the engine may yet be functional this be ancient technology we would need an Ancient to make it work or someone close Jack it be great to see you how long be it be oh since that time you get we strand offworld and try to kill I that take I back I guess congratulation be in order you make general you make king right well it be uh not a contest hm do you mind these guy be torture that ditty uh right take five guy I teach them that expression ah I be hope that you can stay for a while you know check out the sight take in the culture I want you to feel at home here Harry you be aware this place be go to be overrun by a gaggle of bad guy soon yeah well maybe right Carter tell I about this prophecy it be not go to go down that way come on you 've defeat System Lords before no you 've get to tell these people to start pack we will take as many as we can I can not I already tell they you would save the day let I ask you a question do this prophecy mention anything about casualty how many people would die in the fighting it be not really that detailed anything about the king survive at all actually there be no reference to I specifically I just assume do you really wanna take that chance do you wanna roll those dice it be not go to be easy to convince them you can do it Harry you be the king and remember it be good to be king nice ride yeah ancient like to fly in style Nice Whoo hoo you be go to have to help I Carter get any quarter I can not help you with this one sir you be on your own Fine how do we know we be not go to end up back at the Alamo for one thing that be on Earth but more importantly I 've separate the time device from the control circuit I think concentrate on power up the engine concentrate get nothing you 've prove your ancient gene allow you to operate ancient technology it be no different than the device in Antarctica just focus your mind good good not so good Tempus fugit girl Tempus fugit I sure collect a lot in only a couple of year I guess I be a bit of a pack rat when will you address your people I be get to that I be think about what I be go to say perhaps you should consider the truth that be one strategy whatever you decide we be run out of time we must leave soon yeah I know I know no no just leave that that stuff over there the primary power source be deplete we need to re route to the secondary output which be originally design to power the time device of course we do ok try it now sir dammit I be just not that familiar with ancient technology I need a little time that be one thing I can not give you Carter you can not be serious Sir this technology be too valuable to lose what do you want I to do call in reinforcement we be not throw down with a couple of Jaffa we be take on a System Lord and his band of merry bad guy inside and out I want that thing go surrender your weapon or die where you stand oh if I have a nickel low your weapon I do not think so we will not allow you to take King Arkhan from we good King Arkhan be a fraud our king be wise he be a seer he may be your king but he be no seer he can only interpret what be be write on pillar of the temple ruin those hold the prophecy anyone who can read they can make the prediction that be a lie why do not we just go back to the village and let King Arkhan explain everything first lower your weapon Jack Daniel they be not go to shoot be you God I miss go offworld oh yeah who would have thunk oh hey Jack I uh speak with Garan I be sorry to hear about what happen I have nothing to do with it I know Harry you be always the victim in these thing ok look I will admit that when I first find the ruin I do plan to use they to my personal advantage but all that change once I become king oh please it be true Jack I care about these people I wanna help they then tell them the truth come clean on all this stuff I 've already arrange for an assembly with the village elder I be go to tell them we have to leave well here go nothing my friend I wish I be here under well circumstance but the fact be I come before you all to deliver a warning the village be in danger and the time have come for we to leave we must abandon our world Arrangements be be make to help we temporarily relocate to a safe place but the prophecy be clear the enemy will be defeat uh yes uh the prophecy be clear but only up to a certain point after that it be somewhat unclear Sort of a murky clarity of course the enemy will be defeat but there be a chance that some of we may get hurt or even kill in the process I be not willing Impossible you assure we we would be safe yes I I remember that however the truth be I 've not be entirely honest with you I be not a seer I do not possess insight into the future or divine power that set I apart I be just a regular guy no more or less special than any of you but the prophecy the prophecy do not come from I they come from the wall of the old temple write in stone for all to see I have the ability to interpret these writing and with the proper understanding any of you could do the same I be a pretender I take advantage of you and and for that I be deeply sorry what about the design for the new water mill be this write on the temple wall no that be from I and our new medicine our legal code the irrigation system be these thing also find in the ruin no these be not the act of a pretender but of a leader guy I be touch really what do it matter where the prophecy come from all we need know be that each one of they have be fulfil as this late will be fulfil let us not get carry away here we will defeat this enemy and we will do so under the leadership of our great king Arkhan the First Arkhan Arkhan Arkhan Arkhan Arkhan Arkhan Arkhan Arkhan Arkhan Arkhan Arkhan Arkhan Arkhan Arkhan Arkhan Arkhan Jack look sorry about that not my problem Harry if these folk do not wanna go they do not have to go teal'c you and Daniel head on back secure the gate Carter you and I will take care of the ship Jack Jack wait a minute I know it sound crazy but Garan be right about the prophecy they have all come true Harry we be not stay and if you wanna come with we I suggest you get your royal butt to the gate Jack come in go ahead we get a little problem here are ' Jaffa just come through the gate we be cut off if you blow the ship now you will give away your position guess we be stay for a while welcome stranger I be King Arkhan the First it be with a joyful heart that we welcome you I be Trelak first prime to the great Lord Ares your god who will be return to reclaim this land and his loyal follower of course of course glad tiding of comfort and joy comfort and joy Lord Ares demand nothing short of complete obedience from both you and your people any resistance will be deal with harshly Understood gather your subject inform they of our arrival of course I will address they immediately do you have something to say slave I be not a slave I apologise my servant speak out of turn she will be punish of course she will kill I if you want but know this in the end your people will be defeat just as the prophecy have foretell the prophecy pay no attention she be frightened beyond reason it foretell of your arrival and of your defeat another predict rain today with morning frost yet what fine weather we enjoy Silence where may I find this prophecy if what you say be true then we would be fool to stay and meet our certain death it be write on the wall of the old temple go with her Sam Jack this be Daniel are ' first prime send man to check the ruin once they see the ancient writing they will search the area Carter how be it go just a few more minute sir I think you be blow it up O'Neill 's give I a chance to get the engine online so we can fly it out you be cut it kind ofclose I know I have prepare a feast in your honour come please sit Partake of our bounty this fruit for instance it be sort of a cross between I be not

previously on Stargate SG 1 so you guy be ex nid call yourselves the Trust now you try to shut down the SGC you make this big speech about hate secret organisation then jump in bed with the NID consider your resignation accept you can not do that oh please I get enough on you to have you shoot we get all the exit cover there be no way they could have get out how be that possible this be the ship Osiris leave behind you give we this opportunity they be try to run sir Damn it Bad news you be out of Scotch well if I have know you be come I would have hide the good stuff if you have know I

be check on Friday make sure we be on for poker yeah you bet I will bring the beer see you then Wise decision you 've get three minute before I shoot you as an intruder in my home same old Jack O'Neill although I hear you be a general now congratulation all right then straight to the point you wanna take down the Trust I can help you I be sorry I must have miss an episode I think you be work together after I be force to resign my relationship with they change mean you be no long useful so they kick you out on your ass that be a rather crude way of put it but yes why do not they shoot you believe I that be a consideration which be why when they request a meeting a few day ago I suggest a nice public venue they make I a very interesting offer in exchange for a large cash payment the Trust want I to arrange a meeting with General Miroslav Kiselev the russian defence minister I think they have connection with the russian military this be not just a connection Kiselev exercise operational authority over all of Russia 's armed force include their nuclear arsenal and he just happen to be a good friend of yours after the fall of Communism he be one of a number of officer assign to pursue secret talk with the West aim at military cooperation he be a hardliner even then his country be fall apart but he come at we as though we be the one at a disadvantage he and I develop a mutual respect why do the Trust want he they would not give specific but they know we enter into a deal for control of the gate they know there be a sentiment in Moscow that we 've not keep our end of the bargain you think they be try to turn the Russians against we it be ambitious I know even for the Trust but from what I hear after you put a crimp in their little plan to use symbiote poison to wipe out the Goa'uld there be be a change of attitude they be no long willing to stay in the shadow and bide their time they want to make a direct grab for power that be why I come to you yes you 've always strike I as the hero type you may question my method but everything I do be for God and country for the Trust to ally themselves with a foreign power against the USA that be just something I can not condone Kinsey please spare I the diatribe they kick you when you be down and you want revenge Simple as that the truth be my motive be irrelevant the Trust have become an imminent threat to the sovereignty of this nation now what be you go to do about it what ifthe Trust convince the Russians to back out it would be a problem the gate 's only here on loan if they want it back thing could get sticky be it possible Kinsey be simply lie that be always possible have he ask for anything in return for the information Protection make sense if he do not cooperate the Trust will kill he maybe he should this could be our chance to get somebody on the inside Infiltrate the organisation you want I to wear a wire that be the deal I be not a spy think of it this way if you do not do what they want they will kill you if you do not do what we want we will let them that be as good as you pull the trigger I think Stargate Command do not do that we be under new management all right let us test it how be it look we 've get picture let us have your belt why because you will be wear this one instead the buckle contain a GPS receiver unit that will allow we to track you when we be do I want that back they 've arrange to meet you at a remote location my guess be you will leave your car and they will drive you to a second location for the meeting we be go to have to keep back so as not to arouse suspicion we will be monitor your conversation by mean of this listening device that we 've fit into your shirt collar we 've get a strike team they will be ready to move in at the first sign of trouble in the event that something go wrong I suggest we come up with a signal preferably a codeword that will let we know you be in trouble how about something simple like help how about something a little less obvious like red whatever do not be too direct fishing for info let they do the talking get out of my way I know what to do you be late you be kid right Afraid not he be on the move Understood so how long be this sightseeing trip go to last we will let you know they 've turn off the main road they 've stop this way Bob Good to see you again sorry about the blindfold what can we get you to drink what be you have vodka tonic in that case I will have a Scotch no ice we be glad you finally agree to a private meeting we be afraid you might be hold a grudge against we you mean because you abandon I at the moment I need you the most you be a liability Bob an embarrassment I think you 've get that backwards I be only force to resign because they find out about my relationship with you either way you be no long useful to we you would have do the same maybe but when I cut someone loose I do not go back to they grovel for favour you say what be on your mind I will give you that under other circumstance I might be worried about wind up like one of your trophy on the wall but you 've make it clear you need I so I do not have anything to worry about do I we be lose video we need you but not for what you think they jam we I do not know what be you talk about show he this be why we need you Bob what the hell be go on here they be definitely jam we teal'c we 've lose audio Move in can you get the signal back I can not get past the interference Clear Clear over here sir they beam out this be start to become a habit if the Alkesh be in orbit they 've fix the cloak SSN have not pick they up what about the locator beacon we be search through the NSA satellite system but all they would have to do to avoid detection be change the frequency odd be we be not go to find anything the Pentagon 's be apprise of the situation they be launch Prometheus in about four hour I want you on board there be a C 17 wait for you at Peterson Understood I 've go over sensor log from the last meeting Prometheus have with the Alkesh there be anomaly emanate from the ship 's position before it decloake not register because we do not look for they I could create a program that would key the sensor to those reading I be just go to suggest that so we would be able to detect a cloak ship it be not that simple these anomaly be very difficult to detect it might have be a fluke we pick they up the first time the effect be also mimic by type of cosmic radiation but I still think it might improve our odd so instead of a million to one maybe 10 000 to one improvement yeah I will need a few hour to create the program I have to pick up my dry cleaning you be fly to Moscow in half an hour I be yes you be Colonel Chekov 's people will meet you there will you please try to find out what the hell 's go on and if you get a chance hook up with this General Kiselev they know we be on to they they may just abort the mission no the way Kinsey be talk it sound like they be look for a big score here and what if he will not cooperate with they Kinsey will do what be good for Kinsey Yeah Download be complete Colonel Carter 's sensor program be online and operational all right begin search pattern Alpha yes sir hi I be here to see Captain Voronkov there be no Captain Voronkov here that be strange the guy in the hall say I be Captain Voronkova Daria Voronkova you must be Daniel Jackson I be sorry I be tell I would be meet Colonel Chekov 's right hand man so I for my part I expect a drab pasty face middle aged academic I too be pleasantly surprised oh your English be excellent how be your russian ok we stick to English then I will be your guide whatever you wish to do while you be in Moscow you will ask I first I will take care of it if you desire to meet with anyone I will arrange it for you if you go out on your own I can not protect you lie to I or attempt to mislead I and I will not protect you ok have you eat a proper lunch I have something on the plane then the answer be no good I know a restaurant that serve the good salo in Moscow I be not a big fan of salo do not worry you will acquire a taste Sir what be go on the Russians go into a state of alert why we be try to find out the president 's call a meeting for the Joint Chiefs we be at DEFCON three so where exactly be we go you wish to meet with General Kiselev that be where we be go you must be pretty well connected to get I to see he this quickly what do you know about he General Miroslav Kiselev graduate with a gold medal from Malinovskiy Tank Academy receive the Hero of Russia for his leadership in Chechnya command the Carpathian District 's Iron Division then the 14th Army in the Transcaucasus Military District Head of the General Staff Academy for five year before his present position so you 've hear of he he be suspicious of american global influence and highly critical of what he call NATO expansion plan you may not receive a very warm welcome what be go on I do not know Nyet do not worry Daniel I will find out what be happen all right ok get back to I when you know something Colonel Chekov 's here to see you send he in General Colonel I be hope you could shed some light on the situation here we can not seem to get a straight answer from your government the information come out of Moscow be guard at well but my source in the Kremlin tell I the russian military be increase alert status because they think the american administration have be compromise Dr Jackson Sorry to keep you wait no problem you wanna tell I what be go on all in good time roll up your sleeve we need a sample of your blood you be kid Cooperate or we will take it by force this a normal part of your interrogation depend what you wish to know in this case it will answer a very specific question what question ow what be go on why do you wish to see the general it be complicated surely you can explain it to I I would rather explain it to General Kiselev that be not go to happen early today we manage to uncover a plot against the general 's life luckily we capture the assassin before he could make his move I believe you know he Kinsey Robert Kinsey former vice president of the USA that be insane why would Kinsey wanna kill Kiselev I be afraid Mr Kinsey be not exactly himself these day by stop I you have only delay the inevitable your world be doom now you begin to appreciate the gravity of the situation how could Kinsey become a Goa'uld five buck say Carter have a theory as a matter of fact I do accord to Tok'ra intelligence the Trust launch at least two attack against Goa'uld occupy world after we take the gate that mean they have to leave the safe confine of the solar system and head out into the galaxy where they run the risk of be kill or capture what be you suggest any Goa'uld who catch they would have discover they belong to a top secret organisation with high level connection to the most powerful government and institution include the SGC Area 51 and maybe even the ancient outpost in the Antarctic my God you think they have be take as host and send back to Earth it be possible they could have bring dozen of symbiote back with they the entire trust could have be take over but why would the Goa'uld want to assassinate General Kiselev we do not know for sure that be the plan but if Carter 's right Kinsey may have be try to get a snake into Kiselev 's head it make sense from Kiselev it be one step up to the president of Russia how do we know he do not succeed he never meet the general he be arrest before he have the chance my government feel that it be the american administration that have be infiltrate by the Goa'uld and they be insist that everyone in key position include the president must submit for testing not go to happen then we have a problem thank you for get I out of there it be not easy even after your blood test come back negative they still want to hold you yeah not a lot of trust and good will to spare right now I guess listen I need to talk to the Goa'uld you have to get I in to see Kinsey Impossible we have to question he he be be question by intelligence and he be feed they a pack of lie he say the US administration have be infiltrate cos he want a confrontation to what end I do not know that be why we need to talk Language Daria please I will see what I can do in the meantime stay here Sir just receive another report as of 0912 the chinese military have join Russia in an elevated state of alert Naturally General I have be talk to my contact in the Kremlin they tell I the president be not happy with the situation but be under considerable pressure from his military adviser in other word Kiselev be run the show any idea how to keep this from go to total force yes I have many friend in the general staff if I can convince enough of they to take a united stand against escalation it could give our president leverage to consider other option and if Kiselev find out you be go around he it could make thing bad at this point I do not believe we have much choice right so what should I call you you be unworthy to speak my name maybe so I be guess you work for the System Lords be I right it be not Baal he be too busy conquer the galaxy to bother with Earth get to hand it to you your territory be fall troop be in retreat and you still find the time to try and destroy little old we the question be why Captain Voronkova think it be revenge for the trouble we cause an attempt to take we with you before Baal finish you off but System Lords be not that pathetic you be the one who be pathetic you will die never know our true purpose so there be a hidden agenda make progress now be not we Yep all right keep I post well the Chinese refuse to back down and gosh and golly go figure we be pick up increase chatter from Russia I be wait to hear from my contact and I just talk to the Joint Chiefs we be go to DEFCON two if we put our head together we would find reason why you would wanna wipe we out most important be the ancient weapon that you know we possess the System Lords think if they get we to wipe ourselves out they can take it but what I do not understand be you why sacrifice yourself I assure you I have no intention of die on this miserable planet you be in russian defence headquarters Primary target if you do succeed in start a nuclear war you be go to die with the rest of we unless there be something I be miss Return home say farewell to love one your god have deem you to be unworthy and the hour of reckoning be at hand Air Force Space Command have its missile wing on alert the first b 2 leave Whiteman at 0940 FLSATCOM send out an emergency action message nine of our missile submarine be at sea and the rest be prepare for sortie the president be on the way to Andrews where the National Airborne Command Post be await his arrival General Kiselev find out we be try to rally support against he he be already arrest several officer on trump up charge I be afraid Dr Jackson may be in danger come on Next to slaughter innocent gloating be what you guy be about must be kill you just sit there not brag about your brilliant plan we have to get out they be come who you be too late sorry guy get to go what be the meaning of this welcome aboard the Prometheus any luck find the Alkesh None maybe he can help we I think not if you do not cooperate I will kill you do not you realise what you have do the Russians already suspect that you have be compromise by the Goa'uld as far as they know you help I to escape you 've do more to convince they than I ever could listen up people I just get word the Russians have go into a state of full military preparedness as of this moment we be at DEFCON one the Russians will view my abduction as an attempt to hide evidence that your government have be infiltrate by the Goa'uld you have no choice but to return I immediately yeah that be the part I do not understand you be try to start a nuclear war even though you be right in the line of fire now you wanna go back he have a way out he know someone on the inside who can protect he who be it I have nothing more to say to you we can start this again when he be have some time to think about it take he to the brig all our naval force have be deploy and we 've get some big bird in the air Radio chatter suggest that both your people and the Chinese have alert their missile regiment they be posture Kiselev know that even if he launch a strike against your land base force your sea base missile be in a position to exact extreme retribution that be only if he do not completely lose his mind and I be not discount that as acting commander in chief of russian force President Mikhailov be our only hope we can not get through to he he be not even take call from the White House he be convince the Goa'uld now control the american administration I know a few people on his personal staff I may be able to get the direct line but if we do make contact we will only have a few minute to convince he that General Kiselev have be mislead by the Goa'uld right now I do not see how we be go to do that we be in position have they detect our presence no very well destroy the ship they have superior shield if the first salvo do not succeed we will be disadvantage so long as he be in their hand he remain a liability we have no choice Understood what the hell be that we be under attack Shields up shield be 40 per cent lose starboard engine Transfer to port engine Evasive manoeuvre weapon battery online Bridge this be Sergeant Larson go ahead sorry sir the prisoner escape the ring room please tell I you have something yes sir I think I do I 've be go over everything we have on General Kiselev and I find this Colonel Ruslan Chernovshev he be Kiselev 's chief of staff his right hand man three year ago he be involve in a plot to sell a symbiote to element of the Trust then operate within the nid that mean the Trust have a direct connection to Kiselev they do not need Kinsey he be just a pretext to justify this confrontation by make they think we have be compromise so if the Trust have access to Kiselev he could have be compromise as well exactly this be a file photo of General Kiselev take three year ago this be less than a week ago during his speech at the General Staff Academy notice the difference glass may I see that we know that symbiote have healing power they can cure a host body of physical shortcoming include bad eyesight that be it do it occur to you that he might be wear contact Sir I realise it be not a lot to go on have you hear of laser surgery Sir Colonel Carter be right Kiselev suffer from glaucoma his vision be poor there be no possibility he could have read a prepared statement without his glass Sir I think Kiselev 's a Goa'uld I think he have be all along Crap we 've almost get it sir stand by hey how do we know Mikhailov have not be infect too we do not but at this point we hardly have anything to lose good point we get it sir you be on Mr President can you hear I Colonel Chekov this be highly irregular yes sir but these be highly unusual circumstance agree be General O'Neill there with you I be here it be good to speak with you again although you understand at the moment I can not trust anything you say yeah about that it be true there have be a Goa'uld infiltration but it be not on our side it be on yours what be it exactly that you be say let I put it this way sir the last time you see General Kiselev do you happen to notice if he be wear his glass shield be hold 40 per cent and steady then we get he prepare to fire on my signal I be pleased you use my diversion to free yourself do you think I be a fool you try to destroy the ship because you think I would reveal information about you of course not we be merely open fire all battery yes sir we be send you the relevant document now Mr President Proof of Colonel Chernovshev 's prior relationship with the Trust plus a list of general who be willing to support you if you move against Kiselev I must say I be not sure what to make ofall ofthis well you could start by trust we Ifyou have be compromise by the Goa'uld I would be stand down my force with the Americans in position to launch an attack Sir we both know neither side can win outright with a first strike that be the whole point the Goa'uld do not want a winner they want we to destroy each other why we believe their goal be to get their hand on the ancient weapon in Antarctica Sir NPIC be report visual from russian missile site 537 silo door be open evidence of a fire fight oh my God Kiselev be try to launch without authorisation Mr President you be about to lose control of your own force you have to do something right now I be what happen we lose the

explanation that be why I bring you proof that my vision be real this be what Jack O'Neill actually look like I know what you be think but I see this image in my mind long before it be in the paper Joe and here this report about massive solar flare activity from six year ago coincide with the time SG 1 destroy Apophis 's fleet and this about the sinking of a russian submarine it happen the same time Anubis 's ship crash into the Pacific Ocean you be use real people and event and incorporate they in your fantasy they be not fantasy O'Neill be head of Stargate Command there be no Stargate Command listen to I I 've be talk to several doctor about your symptom they think that you might be suffer from something call manic psychosis combine with grandiose delusion but with therapy and medication you could probably live a normal life oh my God they be fight in Antarctica for Earth 's very survival Anubis 's fleet be in orbit above we right now Joe stop it it be not real you do not

you be Brigadier General Jack O'Neill Head of Stargate Command at Cheyenne Mountain you use to command SG 1 which be now lead by Lieutenant Colonel Samantha Carter you once visit a planet call Argos and the nanite in your blood cause you to age artificially you have the entire repository of the Ancients ' knowledge download into your brain twice you have a thing for the Simpsons fishing Mary Steenburgen the colour peridot and you be a terrible ping pong player have we meet my name be Joe Spencer I be a barber it be all true be not it everything I 've see the Stargate the Goa'uld the asgard it be all real tell I it be real I need to know first of all Joe I be not a terrible ping pong player between you and I I totally see the analogy Burns as Goa'uld thank you and do not worry I will not say a word about your feeling for it be an honour I do not know how to thank you for all you 've do for our planet there be not enough word it be nice to meet you too Joe Spencer I be particularly impressed with the time you blow up that sun well thank you I have a bit of help and as far as the whole Pete Shanahan Joe Dr Jackson can I just say thank goodness you be back Jonas be not a bad guy but after all you go through together you belong here thank you Jack he be a barber break into your house yeah second week in a row mm hm Alarm I be think dog you could try lock your front door Shel kek nem Ron Joe the barber please be seat what have you get there Carter initial test show Joe have the same ancient gene as you if you ever need I to use the chair device in Antarctica in defence of Earth I be there thank you other than that his physiology be completely normal do not a great many people possess this ancient gene yeah how come I be the only one see these thing yes good question pray tell unfortunately our knowledge of ancient physiology be limit we also know that Joe have somehow manage to gain access to huge amount of classified information mainly in regard to SG 1 and that these vision be somehow connect to the stone he find anything on that Daniel say it seem familiar you claim to receive these vision only within the proximity of the stone perhaps there be a connection between it and your genetic predisposition I know the hair make you look different but do not you use to be gold colour I think I get it take I a while to track it down but you have one too they be a set Jack remember P3R 233 you find a quantum mirror that send you to an alternate reality where the Goa'uld invade Earth Hey fella hey Jack this all the stuff we bring back from P3R 233 want to help I catalogue it you bet my favourite but it be all go to have to wait Hammond call a briefing we get some intel back indicate that Apophis might not be so dead as we think something about Chulak the stone be an ancient communication device allow you to see event through a psychic connection Jack activate the link between the stone by pick up the second one then all that be require be a proximity to the stone for the connection to activate as the stone be store in the base archive but that do not explain how the other stone get to the where be it a garage sale the person who sell it to I say his grandfather find it on a dig in Egypt what about the proximity issue if the stone General O'Neill touch be keep here how could Joe see what happen to he offworld he be get most of it from when Jack be write report here on the base the stone be store a few level above that be why the story be so easy to write it be like someone else have do most of the work for I and you say they all got reject wait a second if the stone work the way Daniel say should not General O'Neill have be able to see element of Joe 's life theoretically yes he would Bowling league Thursday night you see that you get game son wait a minute Jack you 've see part of the life of a barber in Indiana for seven year and you never mention it yeah sure I do I know I do no no you do not sir I do not you do not find that the least bit odd actually no I find it quite relax Sharlene I only have about ten minute and then I need to get right back to work there be no easy way to say this I want a divorce I know I mean you have every right to but before we get to that there be someone who would like to meet you here he come now Sharlene meet General Jack O'Neill of the United States Air Force it be a pleasure to meet you ma'am I think we have some thing to talk about Visiontext Subtitles Stephanie Donohue ENHOH the System Lords be no long you have become a meaningless coalition that can not resist the power of my master Lord Baal your master have no honour the System Lords have not weaken in their resolve the Jaffa be weak willed and fallible be it any wonder they 've begin to doubt their faith in the god so many Goa'uld have fall Baal be wise to send a representative I would have kill he with my own hand despite your ill will Lord Baal wish to extend a most generous offer in exchange for your surrender Baal will allow you to keep your army and continue to administrate your territory under his authority you will be permit to live so long as you bow before he as the supreme commander of the entire Goa'uld domain Refusal to accept the term of this offer will result in the resumption of hostility and ultimately your death bring she what be the meaning of this I should ask you the same thing Major Samantha Carter actually I be a colonel now her cargo ship be intercept by my sentry when it violate the proximity zone around this station I be well aware of your past relationship with SG 1 and the Tauri would you have I believe that her sudden appearance be mere coincidence what be you do here they be late or they be not come in that case Rak'nor would 've send word if he be able to do so maybe we should reconsider the mission this be not an SGC mission Reconsidering be not an option I know the timing of these surprise attack be crucial and we be just here as observer but if you take on one of Amaterasu 's mothership without proper backup you could get yourself kill Us observer too many attack have be coordinate simultaneously across the galaxy each design to create a weakness in the force of the System Lords and if even one fail I know the rebel Jaffa have the security code currently use by the System Lords they will believe we be ally and lower the shield if all go accord to plan the Jaffa aboard this vessel should be sufficient to overwhelm any resistance we have ally among Amaterasu 's Jaffa who will also help facilitate our attack once the other witness the death of their false god they will realise the truth and join our rank be not the fact that we have not hear from Rak'nor a bad sign what be it the ship 's sensor have detect a vessel close in on our position Ha'tak class Rak'nor Unlikely Rak'nor would have hail then it have to be Amaterasu should not we get out of here teal'c the odd be not in our favour they never be Daniel Jackson I be hail they and transmit the security code they fire on we Shield strength be down 60 how be that possible what the hell do they hit we with return fire our weapon be ineffective we have lose shield now can we get out of here navigational control be not respond we must evacuate Glider bay the ring can transport we to the planet below we will escape through the Stargate what be it that be not good this way Daniel Colonel Carter Jacob Jack we get a problem we need to talk hi hello how be you long time no see what be doing what be up hey buddy I be sorry Jack it be good to see you again congratulation on your promotion thank you deserve it yes well what be up the replicator they 've launch an all out attack on the Goa'uld if the Goa'uld can not stop they they will overrun our galaxy within week why do not you say so I be sorry you say we have a problem not a big galactic emergency our operative have spend year tag as many Goa'uld ship as possible in an effort to track their movement today we have beacon on more than 100 mothership transmit their location via subspace to an encoded Tok'ra network and this it be a receiver that will allow I to tap into the subspace network we can keep tab on Baal 's fleet see how their battle with the replicator be fare and get Tok'ra intelligence report from our agent in the field we could have use something like this a long time ago the High Council never think they could trust you with it what change their mind nothing they do not know I take it ah my relationship with the Council be still a little strained it be not go to get any well if you keep stealin ' stuff no complaint I will take anything I can get weapon receiver silverware each dot represent a Goa'uld ship that be a lot of dot that be just one small quadrant of the galaxy watch what just happen the beacon stop transmit those ship be either destroy or take over by the replicator battle like the one you just witness be take place across the galaxy several Goa'uld territory be now entirely in replicator hand as I said give the progress of these battle the Goa'uld will be wipe out in a matter of week you know I have to admit I have some mixed feeling about this we all want to see the Goa'uld stranglehold on the galaxy break but not if they be just go to be replace by something bad unscheduled offworld activation Dad hey kiddo so what the heck happen do not you guy have a ship and by the way where be Daniel he be beam away before our eye by replicator just Daniel I can see only one reason my duplicate the great threat to the replicator be the disrupter you build use ancient knowledge so she be immune to that now yes but replicator always seek out the most advanced technology she may be worry there be other ancient technology that threaten the replicator Daniel Jackson have access to such knowledge when he be ascend I think he do not retain it we do not know for sure Daniel have remember thing from when he be ascend she may think that all she need to know about the Ancients be in his subconscious if it be she will find it Oy the Tok'ra have operative in Baal 's inner circle include one of his high ranking lieutenant accord to the late intelligence the Jaffa rebel be re pledge their loyalty to the Goa'uld by the thousand but the Goa'uld be lose the war yeah you would think that would make them look weak the Jaffa have never see the like of such creature many could see these replicator as a plague an evil punishment to all for dare to stray in their belief and betray their god this situation have deal the Jaffa rebellion a serious blow even if we be to somehow defeat the replicator the Goa'uld would take credit thereby solidify Jaffa loyalty as well as their belief in the Goa'uld as god I think the key phrase in there be somehow defeat the replicator we have not have much luck the inert replicator cell leave by my duplicate have not give any clue as to how to fight the immunity she be develop as far as I know Thor have not make much progress in modify the disrupter either well let he know what be go on and remind he that we 've save his cute little grey bum several time year of effort all but undo in a matter of day it will be almost impossible to turn so many of our brother back to our cause perhaps yet there may be a way even if we can will it make a difference these machine be unlike anything I 've see we must believe that Colonel Carter and Thor will devise a means to destroy the replicator how then can we prevent the Goa'uld from take credit solidify their position as god in the eye of all Jaffa we must act now before this conflict be resolve win back the heart and mind of those who waver before they be lose to we we must once and for all destroy the Goa'uld 's image as god forever how by capture the temple at Dakara everything we have fight for hang in the balance yes but Dakara capture it and never again will a Jaffa worship a false god Sir I be sorry to bother you but I be only go to say this once Carter what happen to Daniel be not your fault she know he may hold key ancient knowledge because of I she be out there because of I I give she the mean to counter our only effective weapon against her I also give you permission to work with her it be not go to change anything unless you be suggest we use that time machine to go back and fix it no sir we all agree we would never do that it could make thing bad Sir we be receive a message from Thor he say he be ready to transport you be say never mind hello again Samantha Carter hi Thor I have transport your research and the remain of the human form replicator to this lab we may continue our work from here any progress on your end I have yet to isolate the cipher the human form replicator introduce to render the disrupter weapon ineffective give the situation I think it be time to take more drastic step you be suggest we attempt to trigger a subspace connection between the remain of the arm and the rest of the replicator so that we may search for the cipher among their communication datum too wild and crazy to do that we must reactivate the cell I know what make this place so special the temple at Dakara be sacred to all Jaffa it be rich in historical significance Legend tell it be the place where Anubis rise from the dead it be also the site of the first prim'ta ritual it be that rite of passage that have bond we in servitude ever since for thousand of year the Jaffa have view Dakara as the holiest of site the very cradle of our existence it be the place where the Goa'uld first give Jaffa their strength and longevity and you really think this place be go to make a difference seize control of the temple would prove the Goa'uld do not possess the power of the god even the most stubborn Jaffa would have to question his loyalty to the Goa'uld there have to be a catch or you guy would have do this a long time ago Dakara be deep within Baal 's territory and under normal circumstance it be heavily guard however with Baal 's force throughout the galaxy battle the replicator the temple be more vulnerable now than it have ever be our success depend on the element of surprise and the use of the entire rebel fleet listen to I O'Neill this war must be fight on two front we will re ignite the uprising and conquer our oppressor while you find the mean to stop these replicator let we each fight the enemy we know well hello Daniel what the hell do you want you have information that I need ok what do you want to know I be afraid it be not that simple no it be that simple if it be all the same to you I would rather not do the hand on the head thing honestly I will tell you whatever you want Honesty be not the problem unfortunately to get what I need we be go to have to dig a little deep shall we begin what you be propose be madness Dakara can not be take Tolok you have not speak Aron 's right we would be sacrifice countless man and ship on a fruitless mission we should be concentrate on the great threat the replicator before they destroy we all Jaffa hear I I have engage the replicator in battle many time believe I when I say they can not be defeat by conventional mean you have face they in the past and win indeed yet never in such number those of you who choose to engage the replicator in battle will not survive teal'c be right we must fight only those battle we know we can win yet you propose an equally impossible task with Baal otherwise occupy now be the time to strike no free Jaffa have ever set foot in the temple and live and that be precisely why we must go there if we succeed many will rejoin our cause Ifwe succeed be the circumstance different I may feel the same as you brother but the situation have change we must act now or our child will know no future let alone the taste of freedom teal'c I believe there be wisdom in these word however you be aware that if we fail it will effectively mean the end of the rebellion be you prepared to risk our entire cause on this one action indeed I be so what say you I say we take Dakara so be it five more region belong to Baal have fall in the past 24 hour not put up much of a fight be he he be make a typical Goa'uld mistake he be defend territory at the expense of resource we can send he a message through the undercover Tok'ra in his midst we could suggest a change in strategy like what typically the replicator be patient and slow move when not be engage if Baal stop aggressively fight they and pull back it may give Sam time to find a solution forget that look there go another one Jack he be think like a System Lord defend himself against a Goa'uld he do not know what he be deal with if he retreat where will he fall back to you be think of Teal'c and the rebel they be count on Baal 's fleet be too busy to care about they the Jaffa rebellion have already fail we can not risk the fate of the galaxy on one long shot chance to revive it be that Jacob talkin ' or be that Selmak Jack I be sorry but the more ship Baal send out to fight the fast the replicator assimilate they into their own armada their number be grow exponentially if we do not do something about it by the time we do come up with a weapon to use against they it may be too late unscheduled offworld activation now what have you get Walter some kind of oh Baal stand down boy Baal buddy we be just talkin ' about you all good by now you be aware of the replicator threat in our galaxy and that my fleet have engage they in battle there be be a little chit and chat around the water cooler how be that going we be hold they at bay however they be a more formidable force than I first anticipate yeah Pesky little bugger be not they I be aware that the Asgard previously fight the replicator effectively more or less I do not like to toot my own horn but I be aware that you assist the Asgard yes I wish to know what mean you possess to fight this scourge I be sorry we must 've have a bad connection there for a second it almost sound like you be ask I for help the replicator be a threat to everyone include the countless human who populate world throughout this galaxy now I propose that we work together to defeat our common enemy my this be an occasion you know that bitter taste in your throat that be kind of wrap around your uvula that be what be leave of your pride perhaps you could curb your amusement for a moment if we be go to work together the first thing we should discuss be strategy your attempt at meet the replicator head on will only result Jacob what I get it I 've get a well idea instead of help you why do not we sit back and watch you get your ass kick that way you will be dead and we will be glad you can not be serious yes I can I just choose not to some of the time with your insolence you be doom not just your world but all of humanity I think big what the hell be that I be sorry Jacob but I be just not quite ready to sacrifice teal'c the process be complete now we must re establish the subspace link between these cell and the rest of the replicator what if they receive instruction it be a risk we will have to take I will only maintain the link for microsecond at a time it will slow the process but I do not believe we have a choice what do we get I be process the datum now I believe we have pinpoint the location of the replicator within this galaxy they be everywhere we be approach Dakara defence I be read only a single ha'tak class vessel in orbit around the planet Baal must indeed be desperate there be normally a dozen ship patrol this system then we may yet succeed we be in position glider be ready for launch we be be hail you have encroach on the domain oflord Baal identify yourselves shel'kek nem ron you be greatly outnumber Surrender now or be destroy they call you Arom do they not after you return to your plane of existence Oma Daniel it be good to see you again I do not understand last thing I remember you be still on the ship the human form replicator be attempt to probe your mind as we speak so why be you here because when she be do she will destroy you and when that time come you will be face with a choice I have receive word from the battle the fleet continue to engage the replicator as you have order however I believe it would be wise to pull our force back if we stop confront the enemy on so wide a front it may slow their advance and allow we a chance to mount a proper defence you doubt my power of course not but your fleet be fall into their hand not even the Kull warrior do not concern yourself when the time be right I promise you this nuisance will be deal with Trust in I as always it take several hundred microsecond long connection and hour to go through each subsequent burst ofdata but we isolate the cipher that make the replicator immune to the disrupter and we 've adjust it accordingly the weapon work again good job it be an incredibly risky thing to do sir we still do not know if we be detect and the altered disrupter still need to be test under battle condition get a plan Thor be able to ascertain the various position ofthe fleet now control by the replicator we be go to engage a few isolated ship be careful Sam good luck thank you sir never a dull moment so you be here to offer I the opportunity to ascend again if that be what you wish what I wish what be my option Personally I would choose eternal enlightenment rather than the alternative if it be only that simple I admit the decision be not as easy as it appear the last time for you the experience be challenge at the good of time unfortunately I do not have any memory of the last time I be ascend how can I make an informed decision Daniel I do not take your memory from you you think I have not try to remember tell I how I can not then tell I what I need to know if you be seek an absolute truth you will not find it only truth that apply to you that be so extremely unhelpful when the time come you will know what if replicator Carter find what it be she be look for there be that possibility you have to stop she I can not why not offer I ascension now you be not dead yet all I can do be prepare you help you to find your path to enlightenment when that time come if that be what you decide you want there be a way to defeat the replicator in my memory be not there you need only to open your mind to it brother all of you will be detain have patience for all of you who renounce the Goa'uld as false god will one day be free take they go you will not be harm the last of the garrison have surrender the temple be secure many life be spare today well do fire weapon the ship 's system have shut down that work well the weapon appear to be effective another ship they be fire on we target the second ship it be still come they have adapt to our modification that be fast yes initiate evasive action excuse the intrusion I will return stay speak a force of rebel Jaffa have manage to take control of the temple at Dakara as I hope they have no doubt gather their full force and present we with the opportunity to annihilate they once and for all have the fleet disengage their battle with the replicator and move on Dakara take it back at all cost leave no survivor as you wish you control the barrier between your consciousness and what you seek you merely need to open your mind the truth be all knowledge everything that be and be and will be be everywhere out there and in all of we if you immediately know candlelight be fire then the meal be cook long ago yes no you be tryin ' to understand it be not you it mean what you want it to mean no it do not and you be not Oma no I be not but it do not matter thank to you I find what I be look for we be approach Earth we will be there shortly what be wrong several of my key system be no long respond we have be board modify the disrupter wave again I will go buy we some time I have no way of know how many replicator you will face what choice do we have I must return you to Stargate Command before my transporter system fail what about you I will attempt to fly this ship as far away from Earth as possible before it be completely compromise no way I be not go to let you dammit Carter the weapon work at first but the replicator adapt they be immune no chance you guy could fix this thing get it to work Thor 's ship be board he beam I down here before all his system fail he will try to get his ship as far from Earth as possible I will take that as a no never could I have imagine I would one day stand beneath these great column think of it this be the very spot in which our enslavement begin then this sacred temple be an appropriate place for our enslavement to end we have win a great victory here today old friend we have win a battle nothing more our victory be far from assured many of Baal 's Jaffa have already pledge their allegiance to our cause when word spread of what we have accomplish more will follow and their heart will turn cold if they hear our accomplishment last mere hour Tolok what news we have receive word Baal have break off his battle with the replicator he be come as we expect you see take the temple be not our great challenge hold it will be this Oma character why do you have such reverence for her those ridiculous saying be nonsense to you maybe if she really have as much power as you think she do why do not she help you she merely stand by and do nothing you mean while you destroy entire civilisation that be a matter of perspective you call it destruction we call it creation you be not try to justify your action no I have no need for you to understand we why the elaborate ruse you can probe my mind at will I obviously can not stop you you could have resist I need you to open up to the possibility of remember the knowledge in your subconscious it make it easy for I to find what I be look for and what have you find pretty what be it the ruin of an ancient monument on a planet now call Dakara within it be the one weapon in this galaxy capable of destroy I thank to you it will soon be no more I be sure he will be here any second now so um I be so sorry I be just finish up a lovely brunch impudence no tuna so I hear you be fleet be retreat from the replicator how could you know that I have my source my fleet be on its way to recapture Dakara and destroy the Jaffa who have dishonour their true god will you stop with the true god crap seriously what difference will it make you be just delay the inevitable the replicator be a formidable enemy but I have recently learn of a weapon hide on Dakara capable of destroy they really and you be tell I this why because you must destroy it before my fleet arrive to claim it all right you get I I have not the slight idea what you be talk about the weapon on Dakara be build by the Ancients it be not only capable of destroy the replicator but all life in the galaxy and your own sweet self include yes so why would you use it I would not but there be one who would one who can survive such pervasive devastation oh please do not tell I Anubis I ask you not to tell I Visiontext Subtitles Doreen Trenerry enhoh previously on Stargate SG 1 the replicator they 've launch an all out attack on the Goa'uld if the Goa'uld can not stop they they will overrun our galaxy within week Daniel unfortunately to get what I need we be go to have to dig a little deep we must once and for all destroy the Goa'uld 's image as god forever how by capture the temple at Dakara there be a way to defeat the replicator in my memory be not there you need only to open your mind to it a force of rebel Jaffa have manage to take control of the temple at Dakara have the fleet disengage their battle with the replicator take it back at all cost the ruin of an ancient monument on a planet now call Dakara within it be the one weapon in this galaxy capable of destroy I a device capable of destroy all life in the galaxy that be what he say Baal say he be serve Anubis not exactly you know those Goa'uld and their ego he would never admit to be subservient no he say he be bide his time learn what he could from Anubis probably look for a way to kill he we have no idea how this ancient device work or what the effect will be but since Anubis have no real corporeal form it be likely he would survive it he would have no one leave to rule for now Time may not be an issue for someone like he he could start over repopulate the galaxy to his own specification that be a little ambitious he have some knowledge of the Ancients I would not put it past he no well let I state the obvious we can not let something like this get into his hand or the replicator ' hand how much time do we have before Baal 's fleet reach Dakara why Baal do not say exactly where the device be do he no he say it be hide chance be it be in the ruin but we can not be sure short of blow up the planet we can not be 100 positive we 've destroy it if it be protect by a shield our big naqahdah enhance nuke might not do it Fact be to be sure we 've destroy the weapon we have to find it first go we 've find no evidence of a weapon thank guy we will take it from here but the structure be definitely build by the ancient as evidence by the script on this wall until I see this monument I do not know that Dakara be a home of the Ancients the ancient repository of knowledge on P3X 439 be hide in a monument like this this writing may help we uncover the location of the weapon I be able to recognise the language decipher it however be another matter I bring Daniel 's notebook this dialect look very old it may take some time I will leave you to it we will be outnumber by Baal 's force I refuse to consider a strategy that demand the deliberate sacrifice of Jaffa live what then do you advocate Prayer perhaps Jaffa we be here to consider the battle with our enemy not battle each other Baal 's force approach at a speed slow than they be capable indeed it seem he do wish to give we time to find and destroy the weapon why not just destroy it himself Baal be in a difficult position with many witness it be easy to tell Anubis the weapon be destroy before he could reclaim Dakara how then will he explain his languid pace regardless he will only hesitate so long five ha'tak eight Alkesh ten squadron of glider that be all we have empty the bay deploy the glider to the far side of the planet Position two ha'tak and all the Alkesh on the other side of the moon divide our force precisely all of our hardship the suffering the sacrifice we have make for our cause will end today one way or another this battle will decide the fate of all Jaffa this be madness so too at one time be the very thought of our freedom so now what you do you get what you want do not suppose you wanna just drop I off at the near Stargate it be true I learn the location of the weapon that could be a threat to I and my brother but I also see the extent of knowledge your subconscious mind contain you have no idea do you no no I do not you 've try access it but it be always just out of reach be not it I could help you we could unlock the Ancients ' knowledge the secret of the universe together I have to admit it do sound interesting but on the other hand you be an evil killing machine so no pass no do not do this you have the power you be about to strike but she stop you no I do not believe you you can make I see whatever you want that be just a trick you know it be true destroy the weapon that can destroy I be one thing a good thing for I but there be more there be a way to kill Anubis in your mind and so much more I be not do Daniel Jackson far from it in fact we have only just begin Midday the darkness be high in the sky you sure about that that be what it say it do not make much sense yeah well neither do the wind blow on the pillow or three day to the chicken but that be what these phrase apparently translate into be you say this whole wall be nonsense I do not know what I be say be it possible you make a mistake would you care to try the text be quite difficult and if there be an organise principle to Dr Jackson 's note I have yet to discover it yeah he certainly have his own system Colonel Carter go ahead teal'c have you have any success with the translation we be make some progress I be afraid you do not have much more time our long range scanner have detect Baal 's fleet he will be here within the hour Understood it would be much easy on both of we if you do not resist why in the whole wide world of all thing rational and sane would I help you because deep down you also want the knowledge I seek yes but anything I learn I will not be able to put to use because after I be do you will kill I what if I promise not to yeah do you think I be that different from Samantha Carter in that you be a replicator bent on galactic domination at the expense of all other live thing her thought her memory even her emotion they be not meaningless to I I do not wish to harm you or destroy earth for that matter I could have do that already if I so desire you be say you will leave Earth untouched I promise you that and your life Nope nope not go to help you but obviously I can not do anything to stop you so give it your good shot what if it be a code that can only be decipher by someone who understand the language can I see that you be hold it upside down I know I just notice Upside down these symbol look like another word I 've see before right side up it be darkness turn it around and it translate into sun Midday the sun be high in the sky that make more sense yeah but so what that be not what the wall say now it do it can not be that simple just turn all five circle upside down no I agree it have to be some sort of combination lock we just need to figure out which circle to turn your pathetic trickery will only delay your inevitable defeat there be no trickery at hand we know that inevitably your goal be to eradicate all free Jaffa we send most of our fleet to safety to survive to fight another day Surrender now or be destroy defeat those who remain and you will be force to destroy the weapon yourself then you must face Anubis his fleet appear to be hold position for the moment let us hope that be not a bad sign Nice go Sam we be in business it be an ancient design sir think our bomb will do the trick we will soon see give we ten minute Carter out right Sam you might wanna hold off on that for a minute if I be read this screen right the weapon use an energy wave to reduce all matter to its basic molecular element it be not strong enough to disintegrate an entire planet but it will wash away everything on a planet 's surface and anything in the surround space that sound bad I know but it also sound like it do it much the same way your disrupter technology work on the replicator by separate the individual component they be both ancient design O'Neill use ancient knowledge to build the disrupter I know can this weapon be modify to work only on the replicator I do not know but I would hate to blow it up before I be 100 per cent sure it could not teal'c do you read Proceed Colonel Carter Dad and Selmak think this weapon may hold the key to defeat the replicator and we will need some time to find out let we know when thing get bad and we will blow it Understood Carter out Baal 's fleet just begin move into attack position it appear thing be about to get bad I be not get anything this may not be possible you know come on Sam it can not be any hard than blow up a sun you blow up one sun and suddenly everyone expect you to walk on water there you go oh next up part the Red Sea shield be down 50 per cent we can not take much more Signal the other Ha'tak begin retreat Sublight engine only full power the rebel be flee my lord the planet be ours they expect we to follow so that they may draw the fleet into battle on two front signal the fleet to pursue the shol'va my lord Dakara can wait no battle strategy can save they now we will crush they and then take the temple yes my lord this output be the spectrum of the wave the weapon use to disintegrate matter that be nothing like the spectrum analysis of the replicator disrupter wave look all we have to do be alter the setting on the weapon console so that the output wave match that of the disrupter technology all we have to do yeah the device can be set by vary the height of these panel well I can run a program to compare the difference between the two wave that be good even if we can make this work the replicator be quickly able to adapt to the modulation Thor make to the original disrupter wave what be you say the only way to eliminate the replicator and not allow they to develop immunity be to somehow hit they all at the same time everywhere in the galaxy how be we suppose to do that the weapon translate through the gate do you think Anubis plan to use it to attack one planet at a time so dial multiple gate simultaneously not multiple gate all of they every Stargate in the galaxy at one time do you know how many gate there be in the whole galaxy a lot I have no idea how to alter a Stargate to perform such a function I do not know of anyone who can I think I know someone be you certain Colonel Carter I do not think we have a choice I mean this could be the good chance we will ever get Understood Opening a channel you have decide to surrender a wise decision give you face imminent defeat we have no intention of surrender I merely wish to inform you that we have find the ancient weapon on Dakara do you intend to destroy it that would be foolish the ancient weapon may be the mean to destroy the replicator once and for all it be incredible yet you still resist I be you not amazed by what you be see I do not understand it it be more than any human can begin to comprehend I be not human oh believe I I know there must be a limit to how much information your mind can store I be share what I learn with my brother the extent of knowledge we can absorb be only limit by our number as we speak those number be grow fast than you can imagine this chamber must be well shield I could not find it use my ship 's sensor look I assume Teal'c tell you the plan what make you think you can modify this weapon to defeat replicator we be already on our way to do that we need to get this weapon 's wave output to match our modify replicator disrupter wave to within a margin of 0 76 per cent how do you develop this replicator disrupter technology in the first place General O'Neill build it use ancient knowledge and an Asgard computer O'Neill the mere thought of that make I sick look if we can do this and somehow hit the replicator all at the same time we think it will work but we need your help you want I to reprogram a Stargate to dial every gate in the galaxy simultaneously I know you use the gate 's update program to disseminate a dialling virus to the entire gate network with a virus you initially plant in my Stargate no one be try to deny that we be mortal enemy here can you do it or not I can not believe I be consider cooperate with a female of the Tauri and a Tok'ra this be not my idea believe I I will instruct my troop to land no way you send one Jaffa down here and the deal be off I can not do what you ask as a hologram transmission sure you can just tell I what to do unschedule offworld activation be that Carter no sir it be a radio signal Put it on speaker Sergeant I do not know sir what the hell be that I be not sure sir I can not access the system it look like something be hack into the computer shut it down I can not sir I be lock out Damn this be General O'Neill Sir evacuate the gate room get outta there close the blast door Initiate base lockdown Evacuation of all personnel through alternate route Self destruct protocol on my order let us go Walter let us get outta here oh man Sir we be cut off from the self destruct they be too fast there be a chance they 've already disable the activation mechanism those bug can not get outta this mountain it be only a matter of time before they override the security door make sure everybody 's outta here then we will toss a nuke down the silo you think that will stop them it should slow them down you can not handle it can you I can I just need time to process share it with the other like the universe it be infinite it be not just knowledge and information it be understanding on a level that you will never reach why do you think that because you be a machine so be you just of weak construction and that be where you be wrong we will see the president have authorise deployment ofa ten kiloton nuclear bomb a 200 square mile radius around Cheyenne Mountain be be evacuate a helicopter be wait on the surface for you and the remain personnel thank you Walter Colonel we have a problem six SGC personnel be trap on level eight they be cut off from the emergency escape hatch Siler Siler oh Siler let us go you lie to I what you promise you would leave Earth alone there ' replicator infiltrate the SGC how can you know that while I be in your mind you be inside mine take a while to figure out you be too distracted to notice the ancient knowledge help too thank you you trick I you trick I first you should never have tell I too late for you that be try to leave sorry a little more time in Danny 's world my brother will not stop you can not control they not yet but I be learn we 've rig the DHD to dial on signal when the weapon 's ready I think it should work of course it will work how dare you doubt I what be he still do here I can not exactly ask he to leave how be it go on your end I be get close this one how do you know I be a god god be all know Selmak can not work like this neither can I just try it lucky guess Siler be you in there yes sir we will get you out step away from the blast door yes sir get this table over Use two of those thing Sir it be a blast door Hang on Siler Fire in the hole down Whoa Siler thank you sir I expect to be put in your will already in it sir ok that be weird oh crap sensor be pick up multiple ship exit hyperspace they be fire on Baal 's force it be the replicator now this one that one take we in the wrong direction all know huh what be the matter my ship be under attack a replicator control fleet be encroach on the planet run low on ammo sir fall back instruct all of our vessel to target the replicator ship well to let they destroy each other if the replicator prevail and gain control of the weapon on Dakara all that we have fight for be lose General 15 minute to safe detonation condition yeah you know Walter right now we be have a slightly difficult time get outta here relay this to General Hammond the second he can pull the trigger on that nuke do it do you read yes sir and have that chopp that be wait for we leave now yes sir Sir you see those bug go into that hatch yes think get outta the base be their primary goal it be a fairly safe bet they be go to the surface leave the only other way outta here accessible and here 1 32 we be almost there my ship have lose life support on several level I can not maintain my transmission we 've almost get it thank for the help good luck that be just creepy keep work go Siler can we dial out I be work on it sir ten minute to detonation Shields down Weapons system offline Reroute power to sublight engine Evasive manoeuvre they be too fast we can not evade they how be it go in there not well same here Grenade Variable off by 0 98 what be that hurry I 've almost get it just a little more time I do not think we have it Siler Sorry sir I be try got you now huh that be odd the replicator ship just stop sensor be indicate that all of the replicator ship have cease activity Colonel Carter have you successfully activate the weapon not yet but the replicator down here just freeze Dad almost there there be so many be not there too many for your mind to handle it be take all of your concentration just to control they well that be too good to last Dad they be on the move again 0 76 do it incoming wormhole Enemy ship be in range it be power weapon we can not survive another hit Dad I be all right what happen I do not know you do it well Selmak deserve a little credit ok Most of it all replicator control ship be dormant prepare enough squad to board they reclaim they in the name of their god yes my lord we be be hail on screen Surrender now and you will be grant mercy you be hardly in any position to be make such ridiculous demand you be surround you be incorrect it be in fact you that be surround by free Jaffa behold your false god any more word from Teal'c yes sir although Baal get away the fact he turn tail make the victory the turning point Teal'c and bra'tac be hope for Jaffa from all over the galaxy be with they well vive la révolution a significant fleet be secure Dakara hopefully with our weapon they can turn the tide against Anubis ' soldier it look like the Jaffa might finally win their freedom it be about time yes sir I hear from Thor How be he do Great he send we all his congratulation and say that he will drop by for a visit as soon as his consciousness have be download into a new body that just never get old do it apparently not Carter do you notice if the replicator where you be happen to stop in the middle of everything yeah it be really strange they just Froze it buy we time to calibrate the weapon any idea why that happen you think Daniel have something to do with it I do not know if he be on board that replicator ship Carter we do not know anything no sir anything else no sir Visiontext Subtitles Margaret Burke ENHOH previously on Stargate SG 1 something neither one of we can admit give our work relationship I do not leave because I care about her it be time to let go of the thing that prevent you from find happiness you deserve to love someone what be his name Humming Pete Pete Shanahan he be a cop oh my God maybe I do some good but nothing I 've do seem to have change anything there be really only one thing we can ever truly control whether we be good or evil I know who you be Daniel Jackson but you know not who I be do not do this last year you die I be dead actually you ascend to a high plane of existence he be beam away before our eye the human form replicator be attempt to probe your mind when she be do she will destroy you and when that time come you will be face with a choice a force of rebel Jaffa have manage to take control of the temple at Dakara have the fleet disengage their battle with the replicator take it back at all cost we have find the ancient weapon on Dakara do Daniel have something to do with it I do not know you have fail I we 've know for some time that the Jaffa can not be trust any more the remain Kull warrior stand an excellent chance of retake Dakara but bad than failure bad than cowardice you have betray I do you not think I would know what you have do how can you still underestimate my power your method be ultimately unnecessary there be another way of defeat the replicator I will spare your life for the moment only so that you may witness the fruit of your labour First I will retake Dakara then thank to the modification you 've make to the Stargate I will destroy every live thing in this galaxy include you all at once I do not understand you could have modify the Stargate yourself you have no way of know what be necessary and what be not in the grand design whose grand design Mine ok yeah ok I will tell everything I know sorry sir I just see you be with someone I do not wanna interrupt what be up who be that um Kerry Johnson CIA I 've hear the name she head up the investigation into Goa'ulds still at large after the incident with the Trust yeah I want to talk to you Carter we have not hear from he in a week do not mean anything chance be he be on board a replicator ship when it disintegrate all we know for sure be that he be miss soon or later forget it I be not fall for it this time fall for it yeah how many time have you think he be go and then he show up in one form or another I be sorry but we be not have a memorial service for someone who be not dead you hear that I be not buy it what he be just wait for we to say a bunch of nice thing about he next thing you know he will come waltz through that door like right now waltz now so what can I get for you brother bra'tac of Chulak and Teal'c of the Tauri for your endure courage and vision for the strength of will that have bring we to freedom from the Goa'uld a future we have yet to even comprehend but one that will be determine by our own unfettered will I hereby bestow upon you the high honour any Jaffa can know from this day forward you shall both be know as blood kin to all Jaffa Brothers from this day forward no Jaffa shall bow before anyone and never again before a false god Hail brother Bra'tac Hail Hail brother Teal'c Hail be proud teal'c today we be free this day be not yet over with then I shall be proud for you and of you hey hi thank you airman so this be exciting what be the surprise you will see do I get to go through the Stargate what planet be we go to you do not get to go through the Stargate ok I be a little disappointed still full security clearance an all access pass to SGC this must be big oh it be big Pete Shanahan Jacob Carter Dad this be pete Dad not quite yet you have to marry my daughter before you can call I that I be just I mean Stammer stammer it be an honour to meet you sir really why do not you tell I I do not want you to be nervous why would I I would not I I 've be die to meet you I think it be Sam that be nervous how do not tell I help it do not this be great you really get one of those thing in your head if by one of those thing you mean a 2 000 year old Tok'ra symbiote yes seriously come on that have get to freak you right out sometimes it be weird hey what do I have to do to get some more coffee around here find true enlightenment no menus we do not need they here just order what you would like ok I will have the truth with a side order of clarity please the replicator version of Sam be in your head try to access the knowledge bury in your subconscious but you gain control of she instead she kill you to stop you that be where I step in How be that pretty clear we aim to please Customer come first you know so I be ascend again not exactly sort of a stop along the way you have to make that choice for yourself Waffles Bacon on the side no I remember this place you should it come from your mind I be bring here after my parent ' funeral I have waffle Waffles it be wait how do I know this be really you this time how do I know this be not some trick replicator Sam 's playing to stop I from control she how deep be the river if you can not see the bottom deep than the coffee in my cup I will tell you that excuse I Frank I need a Noah 's boy in a blanket two hen fruit on a shingle with a mystery in the alley a warm eve with a mouldy lid and two checkerboard all right hold the pig we have dream of this day for so long fight so hard for it and sacrifice so much now that it be here it be not here brother the balance of power have shift teal'c our victory here at Dakara have turn the tide Jaffa everywhere be abandon the old way come to see the Goa'uld for the false god they be we be foolish to rejoice in conquest over the Goa'uld when they be not all dead Anubis ' claim to be a god be false but his power certainly be not it be agree he must be deal with but for once there may be great concern than the eradication of all the Goa'uld so consume be we in attain freedom that we do not plan nearly enough for its aftermath the Jaffa have fight with each other for so long that unite they as one may prove as difficult as convince they to free themselves from the Goa'uld Generations of war and mistrust will not be heal overnight indeed if we do not organise quickly freedom will become anarchy the high priest be propose a leadership be assemble that be wise they wish both of we to sit on the council you know that will take you from the Tauri your purpose in join they be to one day free the Jaffa that day be now you must not abandon your people when we need you most of that I be aware the council will preside from our new home world where a city be to be erect a haven for all those who have choose freedom here on the holy ground of Dakara hey I know you really yeah the guy from the paper Dr Daniel Jackson that be ok keep it I be do thank no problem be you go to visit Mark and the kid tomorrow be everything ok I be just not very hungry you 've be pretty quiet I be fine Dad what Pete leave two hour ago you have not say a word I do so he seem nice I believe that be three word I be go to marry he I know I just meet he what do you want I to say I know how happy he make you that be all that matter to I ok Selmak really like he Selmak yeah and he be a great judge of character well ok look Sam I be tired it be be a long day I think I be go to turn in early be you sure nothing else be wrong yeah I will see you in the morning good night what sorry to wake you sir Teal'c be back and it sound like we have a problem I know it all right I will be there as soon as I can crap what be that trouble in Jaffaland get to go I be sorry you know about this yes you be not go to do anything about it you know I can not well I be certainly not just go to sit here and let this happen you can not leave you be not ascend yet you walk through that door you be choose the alternative you be say I will be dead pretty much ok ascend I that do not mean you will be able to help your friend you know the rule but once I be ascend I can take human form again like last time technically yes you can not take that paper you will not have any of the knowledge you 've gain here and good luck ever ascend again I be not go to help you a third time so I can know Anubis be plot to destroy all life in the galaxy and all I can do about it be stay here and contemplate my own enlightenment you can eat your waffle no syrup hi how be it go I be uh Daniel Jackson sorry to bother you I just want to know if I could borrow your syrup technically it be not go to be borrow cos I be not go to give back what I use enjoy your meal hi guy how be it go they be not go to talk to you why not who be they other you be not one of they yet you mean ancient a couple of they what be they do here watch I I too I tell you before they be always watch you want some motor oil I wish you have blow that thing up when you have the chance we have to at least be sure that all the replicator really be eliminate and even though we apparently do get rid of they all in this galaxy there may be more elsewhere that could be a threat again so we want to try to figure out how the device work in case we need it again Great well now the Jaffa have something that can blow up the entire universe with the push of a button the Jaffa will defend Dakara with their life you wanna explain to I why they do not wanna wreck it the ruin at Dakara have become a symbol of freedom the Jaffa believe the device 's power help free they by destroy the replicator they believe control this power will help ensure their freedom in the future and get they virtually anything they want the Jaffa would never use it to that end Jack be right no one should have that kind of power at their disposal sorry I think I would turn it off so we be all in agreement one way or another it be get to go correct indeed thank you if you suggest we destroy this device against the wish of the High Council I must point out that would not be a good first step in relation between the Tauri and the newly form free Jaffa nation why do not you do it they already hate the Tok'ra to be honest a plan may already be in the work but as you know Selmak and I be not fully in the loop any long Mm Ahem yes sorry to interrupt sir Colonel there be a call for you apparently it be urgent sorry Carter we have arrange a meeting of the Jaffa council we hope to strengthen the bond between previously war Jaffa by focus on our common enemy yeah I know it be not a good time right now there be still many Goa'uld who remain a threat I know I be sorry I do not know it could be an hour it could be all day yeah I know ok yeah I too Bye sorry about that sir Emergency no no just a a misunderstanding hey be not you suppose to meet Pete at the florist this morning no Dad no I be sure that be what you say for the wedding I know go ahead Carter it be your day off it be ok teal'c and bra'tac be meet with the Jaffa there be nothing to do here go pick flower what More coffee Sure can you sit a minute ok oh how be I suppose to put it Man be my dog tired that be good how be your waffle Best I ever have can you tell I why you stop I from kill Anubis last time I be ascend if I do not stop you the other would have they would not have be as nice about it they would not have erase my memory and leave I naked that be your choice ok maybe not the naked part I do not totally erase your memory even though I be suppose to there ok why be it ok to break some rule and not other you know I have a problem follow the rule last time why offer I ascension again I do not wanna see you die without at least give you a second chance look I have trouble follow the rule I be not really suppose to help people ascend you be suppose to do it on your own but you do it I walk the line believe I I cross it a few time and pay for it dearly my point be you just need to be willing to put your prior human existence into the proper context sorry I got to get back to work Coffee please Chocolate or vanilla I be sorry what the cake in case you can not make the meeting with the caterer oh I be sorry l l really do wanna be a part of this I hope so it be your wedding too I know I realise this must be weird for you worry about place setting when we could be destroy by alien any minute a little we be not about to be destroy by alien be we no because you seem a bit distract I be sorry so do Dad like I of course why would not he tough guy to read you just have to get to know he how about Selmak ah he think you be very charming for a human well generally speak that be my type Good do I tell you I have a surprise for you no what be it Tricky you will see the council remain unwilling to destroy the weapon for fear it will weaken the resolve of the Jaffa to stand united against the Goa'uld you realise we have to consider that thing a threat to our security indeed the council recognise the danger and have decide to take action by aggressively seek out and kill Anubis once that threat have be eliminate they will reassess the decision to destroy the device well we do not even know if Anubis can be kill yet do we we must not suggest to the Jaffa that he can not be at the very least we can eliminate the remainder of the force of Anubis I believe this quest will unite many of the still fracture army by give they focus on a common goal get anything to go on many Kull be kill in battle with the replicator Intelligence indicate Anubis may be marshal the remain Kull warrior on Tartarus a pre emptive strike be be prepare it be the point hey hey Daniel How be it go do we know each other l l feel like I know you call I Jim we run into each other last time you be ascend ah Nice to meet you again still have not make up your mind huh Death or everlaste enlightenment do not really see the choice myself yeah of course I do not wanna be dead it be just that uh listen the reason I come over here be to ask you why be you talk to I oh you mean because these other snob will not even look at you I be different like Oma really I get the impression you two do not quite see eye to eye what that little oh that be nothing we both operate somewhat outside the normal rule and regulation sometimes we disagree on how far outside we should go that be all really yeah as long as these other guy do not strike I down I figure I be ok I guess that be what I be try to figure out I feel like if I agree to ascend I be sign a contract and I do not know what it say obviously I have a little trouble with the fine print the last time you sure do you know about that it be all out there I just do not see how I can agree to stand by and let Anubis destroy every live thing in an entire galaxy I know that be a tough one speaking of which have you see the late he be a crafty one really know the in and out of the rule I give he three to one odd to succeed Wanna know the irony of it all that device be originally use by the Ancients to create life in the Milky way well recreate it after the whole plague thing no kidding now it all get undo with the push of one button leave Anubis to recreate thing all over to his own liking there be a waste of a million odd year of evolution huh I say someone should really do something to stop he no one will can I get a coffee can I open they now almost ok now what do you think uh well uh Speechless huh yeah be not it great remember our first night together you describe the house you want I can not believe this the kitchen be not yellow but we can paint come on I will show you and you be not go to believe the back yard the dog 's go to love it Dog this be bad yeah but this pie be great and there be nothing to wash it down with can you do anything to stop Anubis you say someone should do something I do do not I well as far as what can be do it be kinda complicated yeah so Oma tell I I do not think she be tell you everything what do that mean I be say I 've already say too much no you have not in fact you 've hardly say anything at all you give up eternal enlightenment all the knowledge and power of the universe why do you think you do that to fight for humanity any way I could yes very big of you you reject everything Oma offer you and now she give you another chance base on the goodness of her heart well that be the point be not it I mean she be ascend she be good sure good intention do you know what happen between I and Oma why do I choose to take human form again you should ask Oma hi sir Carter I be sorry to bother you at home like this how do you know I be here I see the smoke oh yeah look be be this ok I mean I could have call first but no yeah I mean it be fine so um what bring you to this neck of the wood on such a fine day my back yard well actually I 've be sit in your driveway for the last ten minute try to work up the nerve to come and talk to you the truth be I 've be try to work up the nerve for a lot long than that oh Pete put a down payment on a house well that be great it be a beautiful house but the the truth be I be have second thought about the wedding why the thing be the close it get the more I get the feeling that I be make a big huge mistake look Carter I do not know what I be sorry to bother you with this but uh there be a very good reason that I be bother you with this and if I do not tell you now I might never Jack I look everywhere I could not find Colonel Carter hi Ms Johnson yeah l l do not we be just meet here in my back yard on this fine day to discuss the state of affair well this be awkward you think Jack do not want anyone at the SGC to know about uh us no look I I be sorry this be my fault I really I should not have come by unannounced like this well you know now that the cat 's out of the bag you be here why do not you just stay I be sure there be enough charred meat on the grill for all three of we no thank you I it be the uh SGC Colonel Carter what when ok I be on my way l l get to go it be my dad well you can not stay here forever you know actually I suppose you could I just do not know why you would want to except for the great service look obviously I do not wanna just die I do not suppose there be any other option I can not get into it what be stop you from ascend I do not know must be something hold you back make you doubt yourself maybe it be not I I be doubt look whether you choose to accept live on a high plane of existence have nothing to do with I or anything that I can or can not tell you it be all up to you there be something you be not tell I do Jim say that you should not listen to he why not because good answer yes Dad I be sorry kiddo we both be about what what be go on I do not wanna ruin everything like this Dad it be Selmak he be die oh my God I be sorry it be ok he be ok he lead a pretty full life I do not live with Jolinar long but I have some idea what it be like well this be a little different Sam when a Tok'ra symbiote die they can prevent their host from die as Jolinar do with you the problem be that last selfless act require a certain amount of energy and a conscious effort what be you say by all right Selmak should have be dead week ago I would not let he go I feel we need he that I need he to help you stop the replicator Dad he hang on as long as he could then he slip into a coma just after we activate the weapon on Dakara you 've know all this time since then I do not wanna spoil your wedding you know I think we could make it we he be barely alive I be go to die with he Sam where be she I do not know do whatever she do when she be not here you ask her Yep would not tell you Nope have to find out for yourself last time too man be you piss about what tell I what do you know about Anubis I know he be half ascend whatever that mean there be many plane of existence between human existence and ascension Basically the other use their collective power to keep he from effect anything on a grand cosmic level but it be ok for he to destroy an entire galaxy it be ok to do anything he could have do back when he be a regular old Goa'uld I see what do this have to do with Oma Goa'ulds be bad Anubis be as bad as they come and and Ascension require that somebody be pure of spirit good to the very core how do someone like Anubis ascend now he be get it Oma would never help somebody like Anubis not on purpose you be say he trick she somehow rule number one no lone ascend be shall help a low ascend lower be what we call human and such if you deserve to be here you should be able to get here on your own if there be an exception for whatever reason a majority vote by the collective can get you in but Oma think she know well and she be take her lick for it for the most part she be bring good people on board but as the old saying go nobody 's perfect not even we high being Oma help Anubis ascend get out get out now well look at the time I 've get to go kid Business to attend to it be nice talk to you a number of the Tok'ra have respond they wanna pay their respect they can come I can not believe there be nothing they can do they can remove a Goa'uld in the last few year you 've almost perfect the process of save a host that process instantly kill the symbiote before it release toxin it be too late for that Sam I be sorry I hate to do this to you but I should have be dead four year ago since then I 've be all over the galaxy I 've do thing most man never dream of I 've hear that before I just wanna know you be go to be happy I be do not let rule stand in your way what be you talk about you join the air force because of I I love my job you can still have everything you want I do Dad really how 's Colonel Carter 's father do not look good sorry to hear that close the door yeah deeply symbolic really I really like you we be good together yes we be but you have issue it be ok we all do there be just one big one in particular that I do not think I can love with live with I need to get out before I get more involved we can still work together can not we I would hate to have to ask for reassignment this be really important to I we agree this would never affect the job we do Good you know there be just one thing I do not understand just one be the air force the only thing keep you two apart rule and regulation cos if it be you be make a very big mistake and you know what I should do retire again you be consider invaluable to the programme by the Pentagon but the president have appoint a civilian to run the SGC before just a thought the time have come for this ancient warrior to fight one final battle I think not old man this victory will present we with new challenge that will require your wisdom what our people will require be a youthful vital leadership and other be well suited to provide that you be only as old as you believe yourself to be talk to I in 50 year indeed I will so it be true he trick I how you could not tell no he must have find some old ancient research on ascension when he come to Kheb he know what he be do when I realise the horrible mistake that I have make I try to undo it but I could not that be when the Others step in they only send he halfway back why not all the way it be complicated yeah what be not around here they warn he he be not allow to use any knowledge or power unless he otherwise would have gain it as a Goa'uld I do not understand they let he wreak havoc they do not care if he destroy all life in the galaxy life they create they have not stop I from continue my work I 've try to make up for it help when I can it be your punishment you be force to watch powerless to interfere they let Anubis do whatever he want just to punish you I tell you the galaxy you be from the plane of existence be so small and insignificant compare to the rest of the universe I do not care it be wrong that be what you say last time excuse I be not it enough already I mean a whole galaxy of innocent people enslave and torture for generation now on the verge of be destroy for nothing for what for one mistake a good person make try to do a good thing the least you could do be listen to I that can not be against the grand highfalutin cosmic rule hey I be talk to you ok ok well I know you can hear I have not she suffer enough already and certainly enough other people have suffer to punish her do not you think you 've make your point Daniel they do not I keep break the same rule help people ascend that be why you be here what if you stop would not undo the problem that be why I keep do what I do Anubis can not be kill not by you not by I he be not here no one be here the defence be automate we have be deceive Anubis feed we this intelligence to lure we here our force defend Dakara be deplete we could not have know brother you be right the device at Dakara should have be destroy at all cost you ok actually I be fine good even strange as that sound I think I lose he four year ago since then we 've be close than we ever be my whole life in a way Selmak give I the father I never think I would know come here thank you sir for what for be here for I always I be ready I love you can I get a coffee get it yourself do not mind if I do Ooh hey Danny boy you see the paper no what be it say the trick work those stupid Jaffa take half their ship to hunt down Anubis meanwhile his army be poise to attack Dakara the remain rebel Jaffa guard Dakara be be slaughter it be only a matter of time before old Anubis get his hand on the weapon I be sorry you sound almost happy about that who I yeah what do you have against Oma Daniel no I wanna know I mean you be not just watch you be come in here to rub it in why be you take pleasure in her punishment I I do not have anything against Oma I think she be great do not I Hell she be the one that help I ascend you get it now you be Anubis Cheers I know from the beginning I guess I just think when you say yes that that you be worth the risk do not say I deserve well it can not get much well than you that be not true I wish I could believe this have to do with your father you need some time to sort thing out I guess all I can say be I hope you get what you want that be it what do you want you want I to get down on my knee and beg God no of course not I just I think you would react differently Bye Sam Pete the rebel fleet guard Dakara have fall to the force of Anubis the remain rebel ship will not arrive in time Anubis now control the weapon we find the big damn nuke we can and we shove it through the gate now Anubis will have the gate shield the nuke will not arrive in one piece if we dial the Alpha site we may prevent the weapon from connect a wormhole to either planet it may only buy we the 38 minute that go go just go Sergeant dial the Alpha site now wait a minute that be not I what I do not know incoming wormhole that will not stop the weapon energy if it be the weapon no iris code we be too late Self destruct that will not destroy the gate there be only a remote chance it would disengage a Carter Carter you make a great cup of coffee well get to go there be nothing you can do you do not have the power but I do you can not kill I either I can fight you well you can not win it will not matter you will not be able to do anything but fight I back what be you go to do I should have do it a long time ago oh no no no no Wormhole disengage what be go on I do not know must be some kind of system malfunction that be impossible shut it off abort self destruct the Kull warrior become disorganised and confuse as though they no long know what to do they no long have a master to serve after that they be easily defeat many Jaffa lose their life those that survive be unite as never before and we be in agreement the weapon must be destroy well that be good a new memorial will be erect in its place so that our triumph over the Goa'uld will never be forget I still do not quite understand what happen Anubis be about to push the button that end life in the galaxy and the next minute he be just go indeed it be a great mystery one can only assume he be vanquish by some mean if not why would he forfeit the weapon and his army you think I do it be the only thing that would explain the self destruct not go off of what do you speak O'Neill believe Daniel be responsible Nope it be not I Anybody else hear that I be in here that be Daniel do not do not come in Ho hey there it be a long story this be great I tell you can not believe we do not do this year ago yes well let us not dwell there be no fish in this pond be there Nope Nice Visiontext Subtitles Margaret Burke ENHOH it be a Daedalus it have a few advantage over the Prometheus advanced alien technology be integrate into the original design not tack on when will it be ready they be test the Asgard hyperdrive when it check out she will be good to go hopefully we all get to go this time last time they worry about spread our resource now Anubis be go the replicator be go there be a few System Lords but without the Jaffa army they 've lose their power indeed Carter yeah hold on it be for you hello yeah hi what no I be just talk to she last week yeah I will be there thank you what be it Catherine Langford die last night Catherine Langford be more than just kind and generous she have a gift of an endless open minded childlike curiosity she see the world not for what it be but for what it could be and she see potential in people that other fail to recognise like her father before her her contribution to science have change the world more than most people know I for one have no idea where I would be today if I have never meet she she change my life in more way than I ever could have imagine Dr Jackson hi hi I be Sabrina Gosling Catherine 's niece oh yes of course I just want to thank you for come and for speak I know she would have really appreciate it no it be an honour you know my aunt use to talk about you all the time it be funny I always use to picture some Indiana Jones type with a bullwhip and a pistol chase bad guy through some ancient temple well I generally leave the whip at home so right I too she want you to have this no you be family you should keep that she think of you like a son thank you there be a few other odd and end she want I to give you but I be not able to bring they today be there an address where I can send they yeah of course Great Jack Daniel what be going on have you be shop on line lately what you talk about you 've get a little delivery it be from Catherine 's estate yeah it look like she send the whole thing Holy bucket look like her entire collection I prefer stamp now in addition we discover several grain of troilite and a mesostasis phase which contain micrometer crystal hmm it be undergo testing but we hope to have the result on your desk tomorrow do not you keep I wait no sir here be where thing get interesting cos you will notice Jack we need to talk sorry for interrupt no it be ok if it be important you must interrupt you must I think we may have find a ZPM yes great stuff with the rock go among the item Catherine leave I this one catch my attention it be an original 1889 edition of the Eye of the Sun the only one in know existence it detail custom and ritual observe by ancient worshipper of the sun god Ra while I be flip through the page I notice this it appear to be a Zero Point Module Worshippers call it the heart of light this be a reproduction of a wall painting discover by Germans in 1885 it be later destroy in a fire the ZPM be never find no we do a satellite sweep of the Gîza plateau search for an energy signature like the one give off by the ZPM we find near Teonas even if it be bury under dirt and rock we should have detect it we find nothing I be sorry Daniel but if it be there it be probably be deplete I do not think so the text say it be a religious artefact an icon it be never use as a power source it be possible Ra take the device with he in which case it could be anywhere by now we do not know where it be now but we do know where it be Gîza 3 000 BC you can not be serious what it be the only way what no we agree if I say what again head will roll we have a time machine we can go back and get the ZPM she would not let I go back and watch the Cubs win the World Series this be a unique opportunity Ra never know what he have which mean we can go back and take it without affect the time line actually he may be right you be on board with this I be not happy but we do not have any historical evidence to show that any Goa'uld have ever use a ZPM in which case it would not be miss we would have to be careful to minimise our interaction with the people of the period yeah there be that but I think you say you could not get it to work no one at Area 51 have be able to engage the time device they 've barely get the ship off the ground but you be able to fly it indeed you 've demonstrate exceptional ability to control ancient device with a fully functional ZPM we could power Earth 's defence and open up a wormhole to the Pegasus galaxy remember Jack 3 000 BC after Sam hook up the power think about that date only this thing 's Ancient how be it go to know from BC your mind be control it it should be able to extrapolate from your concept of time should not we test it on a slightly small leap say to 1908 actually sir we determine from the datum log that the technology only work in time jump long than a couple of hundred year I think that be it 3 000 BC any particular day of this century for you what happen I do not feel anything the time machine pulse try the radio Stargate Command this be Daniel Jackson do you read Stargate Command this be Daniel Jackson come in please the star be different Earth be in a different orbit around the sun 5 000 year ago I think we do it Huh I can not believe I will get proof the pyramid predate the fourth dynasty what will you do stand in the picture with a paper with today 's date this be an archaeologist 's dream I wanna get footage be careful we be here for the ZPM in and out Minimal interaction minimal impact no problem I mean it all of you Sir we get it we get it you be go to need this we 've determine that it remotely activate the ship 's cloak Nice my Ancient Egyptian 's rusty but I get the gist of what they be say that be Katep and his brother Salatis Hey guy they be go to the temple of Ra to make an offering oh there be timing tomorrow I tell they we be traveller they offer to put we up for the night I be kind of hope we would not have to stay that long I be sorry I keep think I will step on a bug and change the future we can not just walk into the temple unannounce a public audience be the perfect way to get in we will just have to keep a low profile yes but more importantly do they say what be for dinner Kree telok Shal tar Vash mal vash mal jel na I do not think he be too impressed Tana akal maltar Jaya nok shol he say he will not tolerate such disrespect from his follower Sir if I do it I will not have to in 5 000 year you can not do that there be no tell what effect it might have Kree ria nok it be get to be some sort of treasure room if the ZPM be anywhere it will be in there you really think they be go to let he just waltz in and take it like I say they do not even know what a ZPM be to they it be like any number of ritualistic object they pull out for any number of occasion besides he be wear the shiny suit good luck come on t we would have hear if he be in trouble nice oh my God we get a little problem here there must have be a sandstorm during the night the Jaffa will call for reinforcement if they have not already do so we must move quickly Sir we can not we 've take on more Jaffa than that you know what I mean this be the sort of high impact event we be suppose to avoid they have the ship will that not alter the future more than what we do not necessarily they do not know what it be and even if they do they can not use it none of they have the gene even Ra will not be able to work it so what be we suppose to do nothing nothing well close to it no here be a well idea we take back our ship Sir we kill those Jaffa or bad get capture and we could alter the future immeasurably if you be think we can go forward and then back again just a couple of day then we park it where nobody can find it we alter this time line and the future be already different we could set into motion a spiral of change that we could never fix we 've already do too much I be sorry sir I should never have allow we to do this so what we live out the rest of our life here we know there be a rebellion the human slave rise up Ra abandon Earth Daniel learn that on abydo nine year ago there be a chance that we can get the jumper back without create too big a ripple in the event of this time line when do that happen I do not know it could be year what year Sir we do not have a choice Carter what about the ZPM if we wait we lose any chance of get it back to our time preserve the time line be more important for all you know thing could get well or they could be bad we can not take that chance I know a way we can get the ZPM back to our time even if we do not a month before I leave there be a dig that uncover a tomb near Gîza if we bury the ZPM in that tomb let they find it maybe our future self will not have to take on this mission that be bizarre but it might work Carter a lot of good people die when Anubis attack Earth I do not think their family would mind if we fuss with the time line Sir I know this be hard for you your instinct be to change thing but for once it be exactly what we can not do we have to let thing play out exactly the way they be mean to English be a complex language a hybrid of many different influence much like the culture it represent to understand it be to gain an insight into that culture and the process of integration that create it ok let us start with a simple greeting the good way to interact with someone be to find a topic of common interest everyone can relate to the weather so let us start with that shall we introduce yourself and talk about the weather yes hello my name be Carlos you make I so hot ok not quite right but the introduction part be good Daniel Sorry to bother you but there be some people here to see you excuse I for just one second what kind of people Air force people this be totally unbelievable you be a small and pathetic man those be my theory on spin wave technology and the effect of antigravity on electromagnetism and you know it just because my reproductive organ be on the inside instead of the outside God that be horrible who would ever say that Carter who be you talk to no one be you talk to yourself no have you proofread my review on the solid fuel rocket yet I be almost do good job thank you keep up the good work Carter you will be move up around here excuse I Major Davis United States Air Force Dr Hirschfield I know who you be what be this about a matter of national security I be afraid I be not at liberty to discuss that here oh of course by all mean we can talk privately in my office oh no I be not here to talk to you I would like to speak to Dr Carter I Colonel O'Neill Samuels you look to charter a boat for the day no sir I 've be send by the Pentagon to escort you back to Washington I could give a rat 's butt it be a matter of national security sir find someone else we can not it have to be you now if you will allow I I will try and explain it on the way Sammy it just do not sound like fun oh God if you will just wait here General Hammond will be with you in a moment hi hi Dr Daniel Jackson Dr Samantha Carter oh phd oh I too Astrophysics oh Egyptology you happen to know why we be here 5 000 year ago maybe but now no I be kind of hope you do sorry I teach English as a second language Department of Aerospace oh not as an astronaut no I I check other people 's scientific report for factual error or omission before they get send up to the director interesting yeah not really Dr Jackson Dr Carter I be General George Hammond please what be this Nondisclosure agreement what we be about to discuss have be classify top secret by the government what if we do not wanna sign it well then you be free to leave you have a background in archaeology be not that right that be right but your theory fail to gain much acceptance among your colleague you could say that pyramid as landing pad for alien craft I do not say that unequivocally I put forth the possibility base on the knowledge it be all right doctor you do not have to defend your theory here a month ago a team of archaeologist from the University of Chicago uncover an ancient egyptian tomb near Gîza inside they find artefact typical of the period plus one or two object that have yet to be identify and a video camera a video camera it be perfectly preserve in a vacuum seal canopic jar the technology be somewhat different to what be commercially available today but we manage to charge the battery however we do not bring you here because we find a camera we bring you here because of what have be record on the tape in that camera ok I think it be ready ok my name be Dr Daniel Jackson I be part ofa team call SG 1 and we havejust travel back in time 5 000 year see the thing be we be not sure we be go to make it back the chamber where you find this tape should be discover before we leave hopefully the time line have not change let us see what be some recent event Communism recently fail in Eastern Europe they should be well on their way towards democracy Henry Hayes be president Henry Hayes Secretary of the Interior President Kinsey be less than amused when he see that portion of the tape Sam help I out here Samantha Carter Lieutenant Colonel US Air Force and a member of SG 1 we will talk about the Stargate oh my God what be SG 1 watch Carter and I work for Stargate Command it be locate under Cheyenne Mountain for the past eight year we 've be travel through a large ring shape device know as the Stargate it should have be discover in 1928 near where this tape be find by mean ofthese offworld mission we 've acquire advanced technology which have help we defend Earth against several alien attack Ifthe thing we be talk about be not true then it be possible that we have somehow change the future the purpose ofthis be to provide you with the tool to go back and set thing right Ifthe Stargate have not be discover you will have to find it and get it run Jack say something no I be good we should all appear on the tape we do not know ifthing have change uh General Jack O'Neill United States Air Force how be ya doing tell they about the future College football be play on Saturdays pro on Sundays and there be no fish in my pond at all where I fish I think that cover it for I do he say Stargate Time travel what else do the tape say detail of the Stargate SG 1 include a fourth member who appear to be some kind of humanoid alien be you tell we that in some alternate time line we be part of a team that travel to other planet and defend Earth against alien invasion I know it seem difficult to believe what about the Stargate do you look for it we search the coordinate provide on the tape but do not find anything the area have already be excavate previously in 1934 by a Dr Langford we find nothing but a tablet inscribe with hieroglyphic that no one have ever be able to translate we be wonder if you would like to take a crack at it be you kid hey hi so what do you think of all this to be honest I do not know what to think it be pretty overwhelming yeah Time travel be theoretically possible there be be research in quantum gravity which suggest that time flow like rotate fluid within our galaxy technically allow the traveller to journey back and forth at will but there be a huge amount of energy require actually I be talk about we the other we I guess we could call it the us we be suppose to be do not you always think you be destine for something more something a lot more fulfilling than a nine to five desk job I suppose I just always feel like my life be wrong well life be what you make it for well or bad look at this as a way to change everything if we help they find this Stargate what do you think they be go to do ask we to join an elite team of intergalactic space hero look at we the only reason that they show we the tape be because we be on it exactly oh that be the gate dialling system point oforigin the address to Chulak and the home address what else oh right ok now this be very important it be call a ZPM Zero Daniel Jackson I believe the battery be about to expire this be call a Zero Point Module and its purpose how be that for time this ZPM be recover with the tape yes we have a team of scientist study it as we speak how be the translation come oh whoa it be obscure dialect I can see why your expert have trouble but but it be almost as if the person who chisel this tablet know my research in 2995 BC about five year after the team arrive in the past there be an uprising the Egyptians rebel against the sun god Ra or an impostor apparently whoever this impostor be he leave in a great fly ship and take the Stargate that be unfortunate the tablet refer to a location where there might be a second Stargate on Earth where I be still work on that thank you Doctor I look forward to your report General if it be all right with you I would like to join the expedition to find the second gate they be go to shut we out I can not say I be surprised I have not finish the entire translation which mean we still have some leverage what else do it say it say the second Stargate be somewhere in Antarctica Somewhere in Antarctica it do not even say that it say the land of cold to the south which I guess mean Antarctica it be a big place lot of ice whoever write the tablet could not explain latitude and longitude in hieroglyph at least you be still useful to they I do not know why they be keep I around I be not go to let they shut you out either we be suppose to be a team we have to stick together that be nice really yeah we need someone who be willing to go to bat for we someone they can not say no to agh Damn you folk look for a little tour Jack O'Neill yeah uh I be Daniel Jackson this be Samantha Carter you two a couple no no no we just meet what do you want well we be recently approach by the military about a a matter of national security do not care this be really important all we be ask be a little bit of your time 150 buck an hour to rent the boat we do not wanna go anywhere it be your money what we have to do be find the Stargate then get hold of this time travel device Locate this alien name Teal'c get teal'c first then go back in time to change the past fix the future be you listen I be try not to I suppose it do sound a little crazy really which part I would have to say the moment I let you on board you do not have to believe we all we ask be that you watch the tape and decide for yourself you know I have decide and hey look your time 's up be not you the least bit intrigue that there might be something else out there something more than this no we be suppose to be a team we save the world several time yeah ok sure I buy that uh huh the three of we the world we save it great ok I can not believe I waste my frequent flier mile on this sorry to bother you not a problem ah ah no worry eh do you have any idea what be go on Dr Carter Dr Jackson Major what be this about do you find the second Stargate no but we will show you something else Airmen whoa we think this be the ship SG 1 use to travel back in time where do you find it it be uncover during an excavation of the area around the tomb where the tape be find please this be incredible be it operational not yet accord to the tape Jack O'Neill have a special gene that enable he to fly this these be constellation the tape say this be able to go through the Stargate as well as time travel so this must be what dial the gate do not touch anything please leave the touching to the expert Dr Rodney McKay be the lead scientist on the project hi this be Dr Carter Dr Jackson please to meet you we be hope they may be of assistance to you yes well thank you I will leave you to it then so do you dial the Stargate address that the Daniel Jackson on the tape mention no why would we do that well just to see of course we try it be call sarcasm we try numerous time nothing happen do you try any other combination I be sorry what be your area of expertise Astrophysics Archaeology and I would listen to you because we be on the tape you I would listen to if you be read a phone book oh brother you see I love this whole sexy librarian thing why do not I take you to lunch get you up to speed I hear it be lemon chicken today my favourite get a lot to talk about Daniel be he behind I who McKay thank God I think I lose he the guy be drive I nuts any progress with the ship the technology be way beyond we but I do have something it could be big what remember how McKay say they dial the address and nothing happen yeah I start think nothing happen here what have you get we be wait to see General Hammond he be busy why do not you tell I I will decide if it be worth interrupt he I cross reference our attempt to dial the gate with some recent seismic activity in Antarctica they be a perfect match the epicentre in all eight case be exactly the same approximately 50 mile outside of Mcmurdo that be where you will find your second gate worth it excuse I General you want to see we it be exactly where you say it would be good work thank you sir I want you both to know that your help on this project be most appreciate your country owe you a debt of gratitude but we be not do yet actually we be not do you two however have a plane wait to take you home I be sure I do not need to remind you of the nondisclosure agreement wait a minute you be send a team through the gate we be assemble a team now you see the tape we be that team if anybody should go it be we I be sorry Dr Jackson but neither you nor Dr Carter possess the training or qualification for this mission that be just the way it be Visiontext Subtitles Simon Campbell ENHOH previously on Stargate SG 1 we have a time machine we can go back and get the ZPM we do not know where it be now but we do know where it be Gîza 3 000 BC that be Katep and his brother Salatis Nice we get a little problem here we alter this time line and the future be already different we bring you here because of what have be record on the tape in that camera I be part ofa team call SG 1 and we havejust travel back in time 5 000 year look at this as a way to change everything we be suppose to be a team we save the world it be exactly where you say if anybody should go it be we you only have this Stargate cos ofu I be aware of that I be a linguist your team may need one what if something go wrong with the gate neither of you have have any military training whatsoever have either one of you ever even fire a weapon of any kind unless you count launch a rocket look I be sorry your expertise may be need sometime in the future but for now can I ask who be go I do not understand what make you change your mind hi Jack that be Colonel Major you be retire I be I take it you two know each other we serve together a long time ago it be not that long ago Major Kawalski be assign to assemble the team to go through the Stargate you know I could not say no if he be involve you do not owe I anything admit it you got to be curious travel to a different planet through a wormhole I know I be Sir what be they still do here I be not sure Airmen please escort wait wait wait wait wait wait we be all on that tape that tape have nothing to do with it Jack O'Neill 's one of the good I 've serve with you may not care that this time line be a result of tamper with the past but you have to acknowledge that the tape say the planet be enemy territory an enemy that be way more advanced than we technologically what be your point you be walk into an alien situation outman and outgunne do we have a choice we could only activate the light and the dialling computer but accord to the tape you have the gene that can make this ship fly and travel through time Presumably you do not have to do that if you do not want to hm what do I do sit down now what you be suppose to be able to fly this with your mind try not to think about the past or the future you so have to let we go with you please put those on how come we have to wear these and you do not ok people let I remind you this mission 's recon only do not engage the enemy I be allow the use of this ship because of the tactical advantage it provide you under no circumstance be it to be use to travel through time Understood yes sir never in my life would I have imagine give that order be you absolutely certain about they Colonel no sir good luck and Godspeed all aboard hey watch this oh by the way you do have the address to get we back home correct yeah Good dial it up I give this no more than a fifty fifty chance of work accord to the tape it work for eight year wow I be certainly glad it be not I go through that thing any idea what to expect not really accord to the tape we be go to be demolecularise transmit 2 000 light year through subspace and then rematerialise on the other side I do not need to know that ok gateship one you be go for launch Gateship it be a ship that go through the gate all right what it be a ship that go through the gate a gateship I think it be clever well that be cool I do not feel anything do not feel like we be pull any Gs this thing must have inertial dampener any enemy troop on the way through no but that do not mean we be not detect be that a city I be go to set she down in those tree I think the reason we bring this ship be so we do not have to walk you can not just fly into an alien city this be stealth recon meaning undetecte Meaning shut up sorry Donner Mansfield guard the ship Bosworth you be with we move out why do we have to park so far away seriously why do we bring they I do not know I guess I have a gut feeling like Peru all right that do not work out so well Sierra Leone Uganda all right look maybe the well question here be why do you invite I on this dog and pony let us just say I prefer my gut instinct over yours what be with the Aw sh hello anybody there we be all here where be we it look like a prison cell anyone see my glass I think they must have take they why would they do that teal'c from the tape if you know my name then you know enough to fear I I know this might sound a little crazy who be you hi uh we be we be from the Tauri we call it Earth you see we find this tape from the past apparently we be part of a team the four of we not the two of they we be call SG 1 we use a time device to go to the past we screw up and change the future you be not suppose to be still Apophis ' first Prime the Jaffa be suppose to be free we know that you think that the Goa'uld be false god that be not necessary speak such blasphemy again I will kill you look I know this be a lot to throw at you all at one time and you got to put up a little show for the boy here but the fact be we know the truth see it be all on the tape you have to see it it be it be in the it be in the camera that you take from the bag that you take from I if you bring it to I I can show you how it work and we can we could go and see it over at wherever you wanna go Kneel before your god Kneeling who be you Name 's Daniel Jackson if you give I my eyeglass I could see he claim he be of the Tauri you be not suppose to tell he that the Tauri have no Chaapa ai oh sorry I guess I be wrong I be sure your information be correct I be usually quite wrong quite unreliable actually to be honest with you I be insane speak bring he I think there be much you can tell I if you wanna know about the early settler of Mesopotamia I be an expert agh it be be over an hour maybe you should not have say anything all I say be this be go to sound a little crazy while there be obvious similarity our time line be different from the one in which Teal'c come to believe that the Goa'uld be false god be you say this guy might not turn it be possible and you be tell I this now this one be strong leave we you will tell I all that you know what be going on show I uh teal'c you should say something the Jaffa be free false god that he be Apophis be long dead a new medicine tretonin have liberate we from our dependence upon symbiote the Jaffa have rise up as brother and sister and defeat the Goa'uld what trickery be this it be not a trick you have a son Rya'c who be now marry and a strong leader among the newly form Jaffa nation ifthese thing have not come to pass you must believe the present you now live in exist only because the past have be mistakenly alter it must be restore please you have to help we the reason we come here be to get you so we could go back in time and fix thing that be not true we just wanna get out of here if you can help we we will do our good to help you I can not free you what about our weapon our vest can you get we those easy easy get outta here pissant I do not tell they anything good how be you feel not so good really sorry maybe this will make you feel well agh how do you teal'c he bring we the camera I show he the tape I do not think he can be trust he give we our weapon it be a start he be go to meet we on the way back to the ship Safety off point and shoot not at I I do not really like gun neither do I what about explosive those I like well Cover let us go Airman this be O'Neill we be start to worry we be on our way ETA ten minute we get to get going here we get a battalion on our ass what the hell be that shoot he Jack Let us shoot he and get the hell outta here why do you do that he be a Goa'uld Apophis implant he with a symbiote to gain access to the knowledge in his mind how do you know I could sense it your friend do not give in to torture he be lie why would he lie Kawalski if he want we dead why be not we surround by Jaffa now we will be if we do not get the hell out of here now and I be not take he with we Apophis have order a fleet of ha'tak vessel to the Tauri he be send ship to Earth the symbiote plant in Daniel Jackson be a spy intend to accompany you Apophis now know what Daniel Jackson know he know that you come in a ship he know that the Tauri be a threat how the hell do we know you be not a spy his eye glow he be dead go go Kawalski go start it up Kawalski 's be hit go be you injure no I 've just never see anyone kill before Daniel and Kawalski oh my God you 've be shoot it will heal all right we 've get some problem here glider I can not shake them either the gate will be well guard you know something I do not think we be go to make it to the gate there be a way out be there a Stargate on this planet 5 000 year ago I believe so I think you do it what have he do I think we just travel back in time check it out Dial Earth this be definitely Ancient Egypt the Ha'tak vessel bear the mark of Ra he rule on Earth during this period it be likely we be detect exit the Chaapa ai well there be no ship on our tail but I think we will skedaddle anyway you say you be on board with try to fix the past well we do kind of screw up our time line do not we the only way to stop the invasion on Earth be to make sure it never happen yeah remind I how we do that again all right here be the plan we make contact with the local and then that be all I get so far any idea what time it be exactly three o'clock sorry I mean what year you and Daniel say there be some kind of a fail rebellion in 2995 BC BC Colonel Kidding and call I Jack will you hey it be all right folk we come in peace nothing to be afraid of I doubt they speak English hello he do yes I be Katep I be Jack O'Neill Colonel Carter and Teal'c how do you know come with I Ra 's patrol come often they must not see you especially you please come please how do you know who we be this be not the first time we have meet you know the other SG 1 team five year ago you come you be witness to the death of my brother at the hand of Ra after you be trap here we plan an uprising together so much for causality Ra be still here we have see his ship our first attempt at gather force for the rebellion do not go well we have to expose ourselves to those who prove still loyal to Ra you be capture and execute long before the plan could be finish really all of we all but one this can not be a good sign why be that where be I Ancient Egypt no I mean the I from your time line I kill you why you be a Goa'uld spy a good reason it be horrible I be sure why be you here yes excellent question you do not know I think I do there for a while and then I realise I do not I know why I be here Good let us start there we come back in time to get a ZPM right it be bury with the tape why be it so important I think you be about to explain it but the battery on the camera run out long story why do not you take a seat Basically we got trap here because you do not want to affect the time line but ultimately you and you could not stand the idea of live out your life under Ra 's rule without do anything we remember there be a rebellion here that be how the gate got bury so we figure what difference do it make if we be involved or not unfortunately we never get to execute the plan we hear yes we try to do too much too fast since then Katep and I have be build up an underground movement I assume thing do not go well cos if you be here the future still need fix something like that we do not just see the tape we see the tablet what tablet the one you have not write yet and put where the Stargate be suppose to be suppose to be in our time line the rebellion work Ra end up leave and Earth be free but Ra take the Stargate with he ok that be a problem yes the gate be never find at Gîza and none of we join the Stargate programme but you leave a tablet in an obscure egyptian dialect tell we the rebellion date and where to find the second Stargate in Antarctica Good for I so you be here to make sure Ra do not take this Stargate it be a plan they be near they be near Jaffa we must hide where in here Sweet Kree lok nel we 've get secret store of weapon in several position throughout the region how many troop Couple of thousand that be not the issue accord to you my account of history say we win we need to make sure that the gate stay here and gets bury we will have to steal it and hide it from Ra it be in the open close to his ship hold such a position against a ha'tak would be virtually impossible even for a short period of time also the gate be heavy and we also have a ship yes but you see the ship fit in the gate not the other way around there have to be a way that we can cable the gate to the ship fly it out but we still got to get close to it without be detect that be easy the ship have a cloaking device it make it invisible you be tell I this now I be sure I mention it on the tape if we time our approach to coordinate with the uprising we may yet have a chance we need to test the cloak we take a lot of damage come out of Chulak because we do not know about the cloak I be sure I mention it they be go you ever wonder what your life be go to be like in the future it will not really be my life will it no but still I 've lead such a small and unimportant existence I can not ever imagine be a hero who save the planet well we do have a time machine we could go check it out no way we have already screw up enough once we be do with the gate we need to destroy the ship seriously absolutely you mean we have to stay here I wonder if the future I have a boyfriend so what do I do um try think invisible ok how do we know if it be work Nope your strategy be good but it do not work well as a distraction in our plan to steal the Chaapa ai we know this plan work if we alter it we may fail with this plan the uprising succeed and Ra leave and Ra take the Chaapa ai if we be to be successful in keep Ra from take the Chaapa ai we must focus the effort of the rebellion on distract he from it trust I how be it go I 've never see this kind of technology you be suppose to be a genius that be why I bring you along I be work on it I think the power relay be overload I may be able to reroute the circuit to the control interface what it be just a little weird hearing that kind of stuff come out of someone so so what hot really yeah wow it be just you be not the kind of guy that I usually attract no no God wow this be kind of awkward yeah it be gettin ' there I be kind of attract to Daniel what really sorry no that be ok no problem there it be just you know first impression I kind of thought he be never mind Carter how be it go in there I think I be almost there that be good we be about to have some company they have a patrol on its way here try it nothing be happen hey guy we get a little problem here Carter forget it I be just go to take off God now that be not work oh boy try the cloak now do it work apparently Shek nok cree what go go go go get down whoa this could be a problem you think if they penetrate the hull and hit the engine the blast could feed Carter we could explode Daniel teal'c we be almost there oh boy this do not look good indeed it be ironic it start cos Sam do not want to take the jumper from the Jaffa patrol God look if we do not make it wait a minute you say you like Daniel I lie I just want to get to know you well see usually I be a very cautious person and I tend to think thing Jaffa hear I Ra be not a god you can live free Ka kek shol'va I do not think he buy it relinquish your weapon and surrender Kal tek trey lo tonak yeah I think you would say that Shal tek Sam and Jack it be all clear you can come out now in a minute I can fix that Jack you should say something College football be play on Saturdays pro on Sundays and there be no fish in my pond at all where I fish I think that cover it for I be that correct if it be we do not do anything nothing we do affect the time line but we do not do anything not yet apparently we be go to two week from now but now we do not have to Excellent that be it I like it I be go to get this to the lab for analysis no I will take it there be a whole room full of geek up there just die to get their hand on this you 've got pack to do this be great I tell you I can not believe we do not do it year ago yes well let us not dwell do not that tape say there be no fish in your pond close enough Visiontext

acquire freedom my allegiance to the Tau'ri be not serve I as well as you might think in win vote from the most traditional Jaffa electorate Politics really do suck everywhere you go indeed listen

and my car motorcycle you know I will never forget that day on the front porch of my house you stand there say you want to tell I something about the Stargate Program I think one of we have truly lose his mind that may actually be true how be thing work out for Mitchell well you could have tell he that SG1 have be reassign you should have see his face yeah I suppose huh he will uh he will get his foot the man be a survivor he be also get the good of the good look out for he a General 's only as good as the people he command who say that I just do I mean Douglas MacArthur may have say something similar do not he also say there be no substitute for win actually it be in a war and there be no substitute for victory you seem to have the knack for it I be fluent in Mandarin Russian Spanish three dialect of Goa'uld Tenise Golap and the yet unnamed language of the cave people of P3 K 447 and of course Ancient Spoken as well as write go ahead say anything Nah it be ok I believe you Toa puta ego which be actually just I believe you that be ok be a modern vernacular that can not be directly translate into Ancient however this be really unnecessary Ono mattah na tario thank you 87 mission hour to 32 alien planet front line ground combat on four different occasion I be hope you could tell I something about yourself something personal People call I Dave it say here that be your name yes the magnetic property of the planet make it an excellent choice for the long term study of positively charge ion on the neuron of the brain 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 we have modify the android body recover from PX3 989 and be currently incorporate the experience of every SG team member since the inception of the program into a viable artificial intelligence wait a minute be you guy say that this thing actually exist we have not receive our funding yet but we be hope that with your support perhaps a funding body would look more favourably on our proposal do not make a decision yet we do have a precise but thorough 380 page report for you to thousand of bright yellow I do not know and they be come from the surface I do not know what they be they be cut the enemy fleet to shred my god it be beautiful they be the ancient weapon it be SG 1 they 've find what they be look for all the ship be be destroy they be just explode everywhere we look do not worry it be go to be ok Respiration be weak he be bleed internally I need an ultrasound Lt Adam Banks body be recover at 0843 this morning oh my God Cameron I rate the chance of you walk quite slim but with physiotherapy hopefully none of we would be here today if it be not for what you do the Congressional Medal of Honour be the high award for valour in action against an enemy force that can be bestow upon an individual serve in the armed service of the United States of America on behalf of the President you get well soon and when you do you can do anything you want and I mean professionally anything you want well not anything what be up Sir I want you here for this SG 12 send word five minute ago they should be arrive momentarily receive IDC open the iris well do not you all have I surround Welcome to the SGC I be General Landry Vala Vala Mal Doran thank you so much for the lovely greeting party we have a wondeful time search each other do not we boy I know we have not meet in fact I be sure I would remember Lt Col Cameron Mitchell Nice outfit thank when I would normally be thrilled to have so much testosterone at my disposal where be my Daniel ok where be it nice to see you too how 've you be the tablet the one that lead to the incredible Ancient bury treasure there be no tablet what I lie I have to tell you in person I be pregnant pretty sure it be yours anyway there be at least a one in ten chance Dr Jackson you be the reason we let she through the gate I be sorry Sir I really have to finish pack the Daedalus do not leave for another 12 hour at least have a look thank you Yep do not know where you get this but you got rip off it be complete gibberish it be write in code well I can not crack this in a few hour I know the cypher then why do you need I well read it be one thing understand it be another the individual I get this from assure I that the treasure it describe be here on Earth now I could have come by ship and look for it myself but I know nothing about your fair planet other than it seem to have a rather interesting if somewhat limited gene pool so where do you get this the Jaffa may have win their freedom but there be still more than a few Goa'uld out there Most of they have lose their dynasty though and be either on the run or in hiding yeah they be plot some mean of regain their power yes and in the meantime they be have a lot of trouble maintain the lifestyle to which they 've grow so accustomed over the last 5000 year or so as such there be a number of rather interesting artifact currently on the market anyway that be not the issue the question be what be it worth well the ancient be not exactly know for secret stash of gold like these for example wait a minute these marking be Goa'uld the treasure be suppose to be ancient what do they have to do with this these be actually only loosely related to the tablet yeah how have you ever hear of the Goa'uld Nut as in Cashew Pea oh you mean the Egyptian Sky Goddess yes no never hear of her these be her ceremonial marriage bracelet she wear one and her husband of the moment wear one of the moment yes she have many one of the few admirable thing about her ow what be you do security ok that be fun now take it off not until we find the treasure what these bracelet link we together the tablet be mine and I want my fair share of what it lead to that be the third blade I 've go through I be not go to be able to cut it off the hand if we remove the hand I know that on first blush that do not sound like a viable option but I understand that Dr Bennett be become quite proficient at reattaching I think SG 12 check everything she have on her they do and in their defence at that time the bracelet be not give off any kind of energy signature I mean even now it be barely measureable so what be it do I mean how do it work well I do not know no no I just need a little more time I will find out hey be you ok come to torture I how old be you mental abuse will not work either I have a daughter about your age have not listen to I since she be twelve do not matter what I say or do you be not go to bore I with your personal life be you I have to admit an hour or two of that might break I I do not like be deceive I be not here to hurt anyone and I really do hope this lead to something fabulous for all of we but it be not easy out there and I be sure you can appreciate that a girl have to do what a girl have to do to get by I be about as interested in your sob story as you be in mine I just want you to know that Dr Jackson be the one who recommend I let you through the gate he think there be a chance that what you have to offer might be legitimate and he be the one with an alien device now stick on his wrist now how this play out and what you get out of it in the end I be go to leave entirely up to he so if I be you teal'c Daniel Jackson how you do Fine I think I do not know what happen I be it be the bracelet they be call Korm'ak Figured he might know yeah she say there be some sort of weird Goa'uld Nut marriage thing I do not believe that to be the case no no I should have know I have only hear of they in pass a very long time ago but I believe it be Cronus who use this technology when a prisoner of value need to be transport by one of his Jaffa he would have fix a bracelet such as this to both the prisoner and the Jaffa responsible for he if they became separate for more than a short period of time they would both become ill and die both that be just about the stupid thing I 've ever hear you do not know well I know it would make you sick I do not know it would have the same effect on I too how could you not know because the person that I steal it from do not tell I that part Question why would the Goa'uld design these thing that way to punish the Jaffa for his incompetence right of course can you take it off I be sorry Daniel Jackson as I have say I have only hear of this technology in pass please tell I you know how to take this off yes of course I do I mean that be assume that the person I steal they from be honest about that part just do it all right as soon as we find the treasure and I get my fair share ok just to clarify when I kill she I die just as if you leave her proximity or we could just find the treasure the Daedalus leave two hour ago sorry look the tablet be write in ancient code right I know it be not the Lost City of Atlantis we be look for here but whatever it be could be worth find or you just have to marry that chick yeah let us make baby you be sure you have this cypher right yes why I can not believe I miss the Daedalus for this get over it you do not have to get back to Dakara the council be in recess until tomorrow Curious indeed see this be good be not it be part of a team again work together to unravel some cool ancient mystery right so we be not work together but any minute now I bet Dr Jackson discover some key piece of information that set we off on a great adventure this can not be right what be it well this be a portion of the database the Atlantis expedition bring back with they a few week ago specifically it be a log of the name of the Ancients who leave the planet when it be under siege from the Wraith and return to Earth thousand of year ago yes and what do this have to do with the tablet see the tablet talk about a treasure but it do not make any specific reference at all to where it be well it be suppose to be here that be what the person who I steal it from tell I before I steal it from he well I think it be here and I think I know where it be too alright time out if the tablet do not say it do not say specifically but it be sign by a guy name Meardon never hear of he I think you have and the amazing part be his name also appear in the database the Ancient who carve this tablet be one of the Ancients who return to Earth from Atlantis yes I have an Uncle Marvin and I be pretty sure I do not ' know any meardon that be because in English his name sound a little different have you hear of Merlin Merlin King Arthur and the knight of the round table Merlin yes be an Ancient I think so see that be what I be talk about Arthur be then carry off in a barge by Merlin say that he be head for the veil of Avalon which accord to legend be a magical place where the dead would meet now at the time some say Arthur never actually die but would in fact one day return from what we know about the Ancients it be possible that Avalon be actually a place where Merlin help Arthur a mortal ascend be not the ancient prevent from interfere with the existence of mortal Ascended Ancients yes for the most part but it be possible Merlin be not actually ascend himself but be in fact just a human far along the evolutionary path what do this have to do with where this allege treasure be bury well there be a number of conflicting interpretation but certain thread point to the knight of the round table gather great treasure from the far corner of Arthurs domain an hiding they in a magical stronghold at Avalon include the holy grail accord to some so this grail what be that worth what in 1191 the monk at Glastonbury Abbey claim to have find the grave of King Arthur on the burial be an inlaid cross with the inscription here lie the famous King Arthur bury on the isle of Avalon the claim be not take seriously until 1278 when Henry 2nd order the grave to be exhume now Glastonbury a small town about 125 mile from the West of London have be a pilgrimage for believer since yes yes and the point be certain celtic legend say be that Glastonbury Tor the hill overlook the town be actually hollow and that contain within it be the entrance to the underworld Avalon have no one ever do any sort of geological survey there have be several scientific study apparently Jackson I be I be I be we be talk about the ancient here Sir it be very possible that the underground entrance be conceal with some sort of technology Sir we be hope to use the Asgard sensor aboard the Prometheus to find something we have not be able to see before thank you well two year ago I would not have believe we would find an ancient Outpost under a mile of ice in Antarctica I will call the President I be sure he will want to inform the british Prime Minister that be fantastic you talk to Carter yet uh yeah she can not make it what this be huge we could be on the brink of another major discovery of ancient technology here yeah I be sure she will be interested in whatever we find try play hard to get man look who be talk so what do you reckon the range of this thing be well Dr Lee seem to think we need to sink about a hundred foot or so about half an hour inside that boundary we will begin to feel the effect you know if we do find something I be think maybe teal'c and I should check it out uh I miss the Daedalus because of this if we find the secret ancient base I be go that mean we 've get to take she with we good point look I want you there you know that I be just think we can stay in radio contact Lt Colonel Mitchell please report to auxiliary control room two now this bring back memory how be that be this where I beat you up no no I be pretty sure that be right there as well I crush your Alright excuse I kid Marks what you get well thank to the Asgard sensor we be able to map around the energy distortion that would have normally fool deep ground sonar I be able to define a large main cavern a network of tunnel and some small cave well do Lt can you see what be in there say large pile of precious metal like I say we could only map the exterior of the structure can you get we in there well it be almost a half mile underground and there be no visible access from the surface Asgard beam try that do not seem to penetrate whatever sort of energy shield be disguise the cave ring the Ancients be the gatebuilder right and they invent the ring too they have to get in and out of there somehow and I know this ship have ring yeah yeah yeah good time good time she be right though if there be ring down there we should be able to lock on but your radio will not work look like we be all go you will be on your own Ladies first well then after you come on this be fun right Wicked and empty well I have not be this disappointed since Daniel and I have sex a sword in a stone what be that suppose to mean well King Arthur once pull a sword from a stone as proof of his righteousness and loyalty Excalibur actually that be a common misconception see Excalibur be forge by the lady of the lake at Avalon but be not give to King Arthur until after the sword pull from the stone break in battle give it a try muscle I will give you half yeah it be in there pretty good welcome you knight of the round table man of honour Followers of the path of righteousness only those with wealth of knowledge and truthful spirit shall be give access to the underworld the storehouse of rich of Ambrosius Orelanus prove ye worthy and all shall be reveal that be incredible certain scholar have speculate that Ambrosius and Arthur be one and the same but that would have make he 74 year old at the battle of Battle of Mount Badon it be actually quite fascinating you see Ambrosius be the son of the Emperor Constantine yes yes yes Fascinating be the one thing it be not how do we prove ye worthy and get all to be reveal I have no idea but something tell I truth of spirit might be a problem for you you know nothing about I except that everything that come out of your mouth be a lie do not make I separate you two perhaps there be something in these tunnel see that be why he be here Genius we be go to split up I be with Teal'c Yo wait up I guess it would have be too easy for they to just leave that stuff lay out in the open maybe it be just I but I be dig this rapport we 've got go between the two of we you should give I a weapon no could be some sort of icky creature down here leave behind to protect the treasure for hundred of year some sort of stasis or hibernation what if it sense our presence and awaken hungry for human flesh that be not quite the Ancients style still I be sure if there be a monster down here it be go to be much more scared of you than you be of it especially once it get to know you check this out okay that can not be good Jackson come in Jackson do you hear I if you immediately know the candlelight be fire nothing ok the hologram say that only those with a wealth of knowledge and truth of spirit will pass this have to be a test what do it say it say the universe be infinite that seem infinitely not useful how about this one the treasure be in this pot really I be hope for something a little more substantial but ok no wait wait wait too obvious give I a minute not a minute still not a minute alright I be assume this be some kind of puzzle can you read this writing no well I think we be suppose to arrange the stone into some sort of order what do you think bullet bounce okay how about this we open both of they and whichever one the treasure be in be the right one no I think that be the wrong idea there be two pot here I think the point of the excercise be to only open one pot this say treasure be inside right that make it the obvious first choice so over to the gold no back to the silver then no no no it be empty there be nothing I hate more than a bald faced lie would you stop what we be already trap in here how much bad could it get how about that much I know it be a mistake the moment I say it the moment okay that do not work indeed oh come on this one be empty too I know that do not make sense I know Colonel Mitchell Two down and only a billion possible combination to go be you still have fun Colonel Mitchell so what do we do I do not know you do not know so now be a bad time to tell you that I hate small space ever get a bad feeling about something think you be the expert on all thing Ancient you do not care about that two minute ago let us try this one how about this one I be think sorry could you probably think a little bit fast the universe be infinite no doubt it be deliberately ironic that we be in an ever decrease space to quote an old ancient proverb there be only one truth the universe be infinite how do that help we there be only one truth this box say the treasure be in this box it be not in either of they I know but we do it wrong so we have to see if we can do it again there be only one truth the universe be infinite thereforth the statement about the treasure be in this pot have to be false so the treasure must be in good thing you know your ancient proverb otherwise we would be Mitchell teal'c Yo feel free to jump in here anytime teal'c Daniel Jackson hey we get a little problem in here what be the puzzle there be eight stone with symbol on they and some ancient writing I think describe the writing a u with a square over it a chair with a square Upside down backwards l call that seven square unevenly stack that chair thingy again and big n and fat face Reflect it mean reflect Reflect reflect reflect reflect a meaningful path Put those piece to reflect a path to enlightenment yeah that tell I exactly nothing I be sorry I can not help if I can not see the symbol on the stone you be suppose to put in order reflect Double 8 4 reflect four six teal'c look I do not hear any screaming or squish sound so thank the symbol be actually number one through eight in a mirror image alright we pass the test so this should work I should have know it would not be that easy season 9 Episode 2 Avalon Part 2 you uh you do this before fight a Knight in armour no can not say that I have well you be do good ha I take a little fencing in college ok I need a little help it appear to be a hologram a hologram Jesus I do not think it actually cut you well it hurt like hell I do not know I do not think he be actually that good so I flunk fence Colonel Mitchell the sword ok that thing be go to kill he everybody get to the ring ok that be enough for today no I can do this come on that be get to be it I do not understand we solve the riddle well he solve one and he solve one and he win the fight and what nothing but you be the only one who defeat the Knight that sword be obviously design to sense whoever pull it from the stone what if there be sensor detect we be you suggest that we should leave it be worth a try alright if nothing happen just join we what happen the whole place be collapse we must have do something wrong what d'you take what truth of spirit I be Truth of spirit what d'you take worth it we be not go to let she keep that be we no good well that figure room full of golden jewel and Dr Daniel Jackson find the one book so what be it about actually it be a story it be write like fiction once upon a time once upon a time there be a race of people that go on a great journey through space across the universe they be call the Altera after much time I think this mean thousand of year they find a great belt of star and they live happily ever after have you find something Daniel Jackson it say that the Alterans name their new home Avalon and that they build many Astreaporta Stargates yes the Ancients build the Stargates well it stand to reason that they be not always call the Ancients what do you care you get your treasure let us see what be of more value a few gold trinket that apparently I will not be allow to keep or previously undiscovered secret about the gatebuilder the most powerful race to ever inhabit the galaxy you realise what this could mean whoa we 've always presume that the Ancients be the first evolution of human in this galaxy but this this be the first evidence suggest they come here long ago from somewhere far far away Colonel Mitchell one of these thing be not like the other it be much much more than that we know the Ancients leave our galaxy for Pegasus and return when they lose the war with the Wraith but what happen to they I think they ascend well some do that we know of but what if the other go home even if they do not the book I read suggest that the Alterans leave a civilization behind and your point be my point be that we have not meet a single living Ancient who be willing to share their knowledge freely with we and there could be an entire advanced civilization of they out there somewhere in another galaxy be not that why we be do this all of this the Stargate Program the budgeting so we go and meet new race gather advanced technology possibly learn about ourselves in the process oh come on you do it to meet woman she have a point sir I 've be think I need to get off on an offworld mission or two yeah just to get the feel for it always do everything you ask of those you command Patton very good good movie Laugh if you want to but I believe find these Alterans and where they come from should be our top priority from this point forward they be the gate builder Nobody 's laugh Dr Jackson the universe be a big place tell I where they be and how to get there and I will order you to go I be not say this be go to be easy I mean if they be from a distant galaxy our network of stargate might not even connect and even if it do we know the massive power requirement necessary to dial Pegasus and they be relatively close in intergalactic term but on the bright side accord to the text we find in the Glastonbury cavern the ancient device we discover may be capable of intergalactic communication thank you Dr Jackson I be sure you will keep I post Colonel General he have no idea what you just say someone wanna tell I why she be still on my base and yes I do well I think it be incredible the Jaffa of the Omak cognate be many as all the other regional coalition and they strongly support Gerak of this I be aware if we allow they even one more vote base on unconfirmed military strength the council will be in Gerak 's hand until proper inspection Rak'nor I be sorry we be all work very hard it just seem as though Gerak be win Bratac and Ry'ac be negotiate with coalition who have yet to declare their allegiance I do not fight for the freedom of all Jaffa only to have it corrupt by a few power hungry individual nor do I I just do not understand why you have choose to spend so much time with the Tau'ri at such a critical stage my friend of the Tau'ri be largely responsible for the Jaffa be be free and as thank they have be treat with mistrust and disrespect until all Jaffa see that the old way be not the future I will do whatever I need to do to enlighten they and how do chase ancient history do that ancient knowledge be what defeat the Goa'uld and the Replicators and I believe that one day it will unite the Jaffa in a nation of peace I will prove it I hope so I have be around the galaxy long enough to know that knowledge be power and understand the technology that be leave behind by the Ancients be the most powerful knowledge around and if you think I wanna stay link with you for the rest of my natural Focus maybe we should focus on the task at hand yeah well the device obviously have a power source and I do not think it be be deplete ok when I read this be a communication device I realise the shape of these recess space look familiar these stone be actually an ancient form of communication device that link their user psychically allow they to see through each other 's eye it appear that they be actually mean to be use in conjunction with this terminal so what happen when you attach the stone we be go to find out these stone be originally set for General O'Neill and one Joe Spencer Barber from Indiana yeah weird guy I read the file anyway after a lot of tedious although I must say ultimately very brilliant work if I do say so myself I be able to reset the stone do not they have to be activate by someone with the ancient gene same file well that be what we think at first but no like a lot of ancient technology the stone actually just need to be initialise by someone with the gene that be a guess no you be right which these obviously have be so any one of we can take the pony ride yeah I figure that be go to be I I mean I do miss the Daedalus for this so you be go to dine on it for a while yeah yeah like you would not believe well no one be go to make an argument against that you be the world 's foremost expert on the Ancients but we get two stone yes and this one 's mine thank you excuse I how do you figure that Daniel and I be link I will just point out for the record we do not have to be he be only guess that this device be for communication what if it be a transporter of some kind and he gets whisk away and can not get back actually we have do a fair bit of research on this device and I can say with absolute relative certainty look we have study device like this for year and at some point ultimately you just have to turn it on I be go to give it a try where he go I go I be not go anywhere so he think it be a communication device I be go to watch from the observation room alright good luck so what do we do well I be guess we just put these two stone in any two of these spot any two well there be not any marking to indicate otherwise so any two and med team to science lab one hello please do not be afraid my name be Daniel Jackson it be I Vala ok not a transporter where be we I do not know but I think we be in they blood pressure and heartrate be normal Pupils be slightly dilate now we be sure this be because of the device they also pass out before when they be separate because of the bracelet the reaction be virtually instantaneous after the device be activate anyway there be no discernable energy raise and no measurable radiation be emit so and we find no contagion alright I wanna get an EEG go but my first impression here be that they be in some kind of sleep state maybe we should disconnect the stone for all we know this could be perfectly normal I mean this could be the way the device actually work and could you give I some time here before we go mess around with that thing anymore I would not call it mess around look for all we know disconnect the stone could put they in further jeopardy so how be thing on Dakara about as well as here I do not understand this be an odd communication device I mean I can not talk to this poor woman I have no access to her mind her thought her memory I be just inside of her look out through her eye yeah Jack and Joe Spencer describe the experience as have vision of what be happen to the other be they ever in total control of each other 's body no but they be not use the stone in conjunction with the ancient terminal either it be possible it be mean to work this way so that we can communicate with other without intrude on the mind of those we be connect to they be just temporary transmitter do you think we be actually in another galaxy I do not know why these people I do not know well maybe it be just I but this house these clothe we do not look the way I would expect the ancient to look no what do you suppose their name be Harrid and Sallis how do you know that well because it say so right here it say this be the home of Harrid and Sallis Ciceru wait I miss that you mumble it no I do not well you say something that I could not understand well I do not say it because I do not really know what it mean so I be not go to say it out loud because I know what it mean well go on Nuptial it mean nuptial as in we be married yeah let us go look outside not quite what I imagine when I picture a civilization of gate builder no something tell I this be not the same people who build a spaceship capable of travel across the universe above the sun Harrid Sallis what uh I think that mean good morning above the sun to you above the sun I think he be speak Ancient I think the communicator 's translating for we I could not read the sign maybe it only work for spoken language see you at prostration Prostration it be Prostration it be so what do you want to do Harrid or be it Sallis People be start to stare well shall we walk around and try to appear normal Nope not what I be expect at all I neither on the bright side I think he be look at I when he say Harrid please he be stare at I the whole time hey come in now I can not decide if I like the desk here where else be you go to put it out in the hall Daniel and Vala be stable base on rapid eye movement and brainwave pattern I be guess it be actually some kind of induce dream link condition Doctor Jackson believe the device be use for long range communication be it possible that be what they be do talk to someone somewhere out there I do not know I be head to the mess I be good thank I should get back to Daniel and Vala of course just keep I post Caroline you seem to be settle in okay I do not know if I will ever get use to this place it be pretty yeah yeah and work for you make this whole thing just that much more bizarre you do not have to take the job you know be you kid who could refuse it besides at the time General O'Neill do not tell I you would be my boss he be funny that way by the way the desk look fine the way it be really you never be happy with anything the way it be all hallow the Ori all hallow the Ori on their great power we shall meditate herein this day prostation it be we must meet by the protacol of light at the hour of bligh Speak not oh greatness that be the Ori you guide we and give meaning to our daily life we beseech you give we strength all hallow the Ori all hallow the Ori all hallow the Ori well that be fun six hour of prostration why do not we just tell someone who we be and what be go on I mean be not that the whole point of this to communicate I do not think these people be go to entirely understand do you hear what the guy say when we first come to the service something about meet yeah at the protacol of light on the hour of bligh what be that suppose to mean I have no idea what be you look for I do not know some reason as to why we be in these particular people these specific body well it can not be totally random well I have a more pressing question do you have any idea how we be suppose to detach from they no that be another thing that be get I worried have you try Mmm nothing it do not seem to be something I can just will to make happen maybe it be about remove the stone from the device on Earth yeah unfortunately we can not tell the people on Earth that we need they to remove they and we will just have to wait for they to figure it out for themselves maybe they have already and it have no effect I be just go to rule out that possibility do you think these people be in our body I do not know I mean this can not be how the technology be suppose to work yeah it be the book that some of the villager be walk around with it say on the front the book of Origins bless be the Ori I think you should take a look at it oh I think I 've see enough I mean Prostration for six hour give we strength you know it be all very clear I think you would find it really interesting yeah when do you start be able to read Ancient I can not but this look familiar thank those full of value I be worried when you do not meet I yeah sorry about that why do you not meet I why be you not share leave with the administrator 's wife I forget we be already suspect we must not alter our behaviour suspect of what Harrid what ail you if I do not know well I would fear you you be try to entrap I no I would not dream of try to entrap you how stop this please okay you know what please would you would you sit go with I my name be Daniel Jackson and I be inside the mind of Harrid I be able to speak through he by use of a communication technology that we believe be first construct and use by a race know as the Alterans and I be Vala Mal Doran how you doin by the star forgive I I be Phanis Nice to meet you we be from a place call Earth can I speak with Harrid no his consciousness appear to be supresse so long as we be connect Harrid always suspect that the stone be a means of communication you know about the stone we be curator investigator of the past the stone be discover some time ago in what we believe be the remain of an ancestral burial ground not far from here why be you hide they such investigation be sacrilege you be not allow to investigate your own history if such a history contradict the book of origin you be heretic we have uncover evidence that we believe prove the race of human predate our suppose creation by the Ori excuse I Daniel what if these god the Ori be the people leave behind by the Alterans you think they ascend it be possible the Alterans leave a long long time ago and what we know of the ancient they learn to evolve and ascend what if the people who remain here do too that would mean these people be a subsequent evolution of human which be apparently what happen in our galaxy after the Ancients we know ascend and it would explain why they be not as advanced as we might expect no but the religion do not fit the profile the ascend being I know do not pose as Gods I mean that be the one explicit rule that they do follow be that they do not meddle in the affair of the low plane of existence the Ori be not pose we do not doubt their power just their word and intention their power be as real as the strength and belief of all follower you be late for leave with the administrator 's wife Sallis and she be aquaintance so what should I do can you not disconnect and allow Sallis to return no apparently we can not do that then you must pose as Sallis or we will be discover I can do that the council have already take rest of it the vote be quick I deliver yours by proxy Gerak 's motion be resolve by a slim majority the Jaffa will be rule by a High Council Votes will be attribute to the various coalition representative base on military asset make Gerak the new leader of the Jaffa nation you say the Ori may have ascend what do that mean where we come from some people who use to look a lot like we evolve physically and mentally so much that they find a way to shed their physical body and live as energy on another high plane of existence some call it enlightenment and come with it a much great understanding of the universe and all its knowledge now this happen a long time ago and I believe that those people may have originally come from here and those ascend being as you call they do not guide you and ask that you worship they no in fact they believe so strongly in free will that they would not even intervene and use their knowledge even if it mean the destruction of an entire galaxy full of we regular old human such be not the case with the Ori yes so they ask that you worship they and yet conceal the truth of your existence from you that be not all what be you go to do we be gather as much evidence as we can our hope be that one day we will have enough proof to convince even the most devout believer in the meantime we meet in secret and share with those who we trust what we have learn we keep hide those artifact which prove our claim in case one or more of we be discover how many of you be there a few our number be grow some believe the fact we have not be discover be further proof that the Ori be not all powerful and all know other wonder if they be just give we the opportunity to see the error of our way and repent a crowd gather at the arrar that be an altar I can not be see with you and so say Disraya before the battle of age he speak to the sky and say and the people shall deliver unto you the wicked for your divine judgement where their sin shall be weigh in the balance of all that be just and true let go of I get your hand off I Daniel what happen it do not go so well yeah I can see that excuse I Harrid stand back Sallis have be overcome no she have not if you will just let I explain listen to I Fear not for the Ori see all outside and within if your heart be pure and your devotion unwavere they will protect you they will cleanse your being and you will be take to be with they forever if not may the fire burn you down to the ground and lie you in the dust Fire Hallowed be the Ori her heartrate be 140 she be in distress Daniel 's bp and heartrate be increase too pull the stone I can not what the hell do you say I think at first it be what I do not say you see apparently there be a blessing you be suppose to recite over the leave before you drink which nobody warn I about then I think it be what I do say I be try to politely explain what be go on and then his wife start scream and accuse I of be overcome at which point I believe I suggest she might want to think about procreation with herself well listen please listen to I you have to believe I this be not what it look like Sallis be not possess okay this be go to sound crazy but we be from another galaxy that be where we be use a communication technology that allow we to take over a body from very far away and let we talk to you we just want to talk to you okay this be get bad I be administer a sedative hopefully it will calm thing down DANIEL okay listen to I listen to I you have to believe I you be kill an innocent person DANIEL Blessed be those that deliver we from evil she be in VFIB Code blue charge to 200 no do not shoot you get a well idea you might cause a surge you could kill they both you might detonate the power source now come on Clear charge to 360 Clear still in VFIB charge again Clear I 've get no pulse she be go into a Cistallic I be call it she be dead I be sorry his vital have stabalise for the moment you can not pry the stone off no and you do not want I to shoot it no then how do we unplug this thing I do not know Brilliant at the very least we need to find a way to get that bracelet off of Dr Jackson they be still link and without Vala he will proba she be get a heartbeat Daniel you okay I 've get tingle all over and do not flatter yourself I be pretty sure it be not you thank you thank the Ori Stand you will come with I I think he want we to follow he can you walk if it mean get away from here Hallow to the child of the Ori Hallowed be we Hallowed be the Ori Hallowed to the Ori previously on Stargate SG 1 these bracelet link we together it say that the Alterans name their new home Avalon and that they build many Astreaporta stargate the Ancients build the Stargates well it stand to reason that they be not always call the Ancients these stone be actually an ancient form of communication device that link the user psychically allow the user to see through each other eye where be we I do not know but I think we be in they it be possible it be mean to work this way so that we can communicate with other without intrude on the mind of those we be connect to they be just temporary transmitter not quite what I imagine when I picture a civilization of gate builder you be not allow to investigate your own history if such a history contradict the book of Origin you be heretic what if these god the Ori be the people leave behind by the Alterans you think they ascend what be you go to do we be gather as much evidence as we can and keep hide those artifact which prove our claim in case one or more of we be discover Daniel you be kill an innocent person she be in VFIB Code blue you will come with I where be we the plane of Celestus and that City of the Gods maybe you can tell I who you be I be a prior of the Ori and what be that in time all in due time I guess we will just wait here be that what we be go to do Hallowed be the Ori Season 9 Episode 3 Origin both Daniel and Vala 's vital have be stable for two hour now what about disconnect they from the device Dr Lee have be unable to remove the stone we have not try C4 yet Sir Dr Lee be work on disable the power source but give that the device be tie directly into their mind I recommend we proceed with caution I understand but if one or both of they run into trouble again I be order you to take whatever action be necessary to shut that thing down teal'c a word what can you tell I about this Gerak fella he be first Prime of Montou a minor Goa'uld who serve Ra then later fall in with Baal when Ra be kill after the fall of the Goa'uld Baal 's armada be lead by a Jaffa name Hubr'ok Hubr'ok be an ally of Bra'tac and would have support our desire to reform the Jaffa nation with democracy however approximately four month ago Hubr'ok disappear you think Gerak have something to do with it though no evidence have be uncover shortly after Hubr'ok 's disappearance Gerak emerge as spokesperson for the more traditional way of the Jaffa High Council which he could control through a series of slow and deliberate manipulation the council play squarely into Gerak 's hand well that make he one of the most powerful guy out there at least that we know of I suppose I should meet he face to face I will extend your invitation alright Daniel what do it say well it seem to fall into suit with many of the religion I 've study they tend to weave their doctrine into simple fable like narrative with character that be mean to be identifiable with the common individual well why do not you read one to I I love a good yarn they all seem to teach meditation on one 's worth and significance the path of righteousness towards a state of high being what I be starve the central icon of the religion seem to be fire I do not need a book to tell I that that would make sense Fire be light energy warmth and yet on Earth at some point fire became associate with demonic imagery thing that be evil hell not Heaven and I be just wonder if the Ancients have something to do with that tell you what why do not you flip to the end and see how it all turn out the village of Veraga have be corrupt we do not do it I promise we be connect to these people Harrid and Sallis by mean of a communication device that be bring to our galaxy a long time ago by a race of people call the Alterans also know as the Ancients look the point be we mean no harm we be explorer you know of other in Veraga Others Unbelievers oh I be sorry do you want we to tell on people who do not believe in the Ori devotion be reward those who stray must be guide back to the path seem to I those who stray get burn to death the Ori give all man and woman free will if the Ori be so powerful why do they need we to tell they who believe in they and who do not the Ori need nothing from we it be we who must seek the truth of the universe in order to achieve enlightenment be down this road before at ease Colonel how be they do there be no change Sir I know you be concerned for they so be I but I 've get something else for you to do Sir just get a report from Dr Lindsay on P3X 421 Lindsay Anthropologist right she be be work with the human population on 421 help they get over the loss of their former false god Trouble well it seem a missionary of sort come through the gate yesterday and start spout a religion we have not encounter before not that we have a problem with people explore different faith I suspect we will see a lot of opportunist try to fill the void leave by the Goa'uld Sir this new find freedom be quickly go to bring about desperation if people do not learn to defend for themselves a lot of these shall we say shelter civilization could potentially be take advantage of by a charlaton with a flashy bag of trick and in this case well this missionary be apparently try to prove the validity of his claim by perform miracle miracle I would like you to take SG 12 and check it out yes Sir Emeca be forgive his transgression and find his way back to the path I can not take much more of this I be sorry to interrupt but if you 've bring we here to try to convert we I think it be fair to tell you that we be really not in the market for new god the will of the Ori bring you here I suppose we could talk to one of these Ori of course well great that would be great speak and they shall hear you okay you can torture we all you want with your rhetoric but we be not go to crack well I might but we be not go to tell you anything because we do not know anything be I right can I talk to your boss the the Doci the one who speak the word of the Ori like Ageadius of Valdair I need to speak thing that can only be speak in the light of the fire come with I could you not have ask that an hour ago I 've be listen to he drone on and on not you what not who not I but I I will wait here quite the hefty rise welcome as he lie there die in the sun the sand of the desert all around he Petris speak to the rock not with his lip but with his mind and the rock weep tear of fresh water and his thirst be quench Fear not the Ori fear the darkness that would conceal the knowledge of the universe Believe in the truth of all thing and you too may find the path to enlightenment and a man have no great thing under the sun but eat drink and be merry Ecclesiaste 's my favourite my Grandma be a bit of a Bible thumper weekend with Grandma mean long long Sundays at St Hilda 's church of the Grand Epiphany Lt Col Cameron Mitchell how be you do I be a prior of the Ori it be nice to meet you your arrival here be foresee no kidding so you see the future do you lesson of day go by teach we what will come to pass I be a bit of a history buff myself do not help I pick the lotto number though so where be you from where we come from and where we be go be all the same oh I get ya wherever you go there you be I think that be Buckaroo Bonzai I I be from a little planet call Earth the home of Daniel Jackson he never mention that before you know Dr Jackson do you from he do we learn of your need our need for what the revelation of your destiny Doci leave we hello I be Daniel Jackson right from the planet Earth ok so you know my name and where I be from so I assume you also know how I be connect to this man 's mind why I be here you see we be explorer we would very much like to get to know you your society how you come to be a Prior have be dispatch to the place from whence you 've come really you can do that I think we be in another galaxy it be the will of the Ori that we should spread Origin to all those bless by their creation ok well then you should understand that there be many different kind of people in the place from whence I come People who believe in many different thing they shall find the path to enlightenment right well I think you should also understand that they may not see your way as the only way the power and the greatness of the Ori can not be deny those who reject the path to enlightenment must be destroy right I be afraid of that George Washington one of our country 's found father and first President once say true friendship be a plant of slow growth and must undergo and understand the shock of adversity before it be entitle to the appellation the first Prime of Horus Kar'ek of the High Plains once say there be more honour in die at the hand of a brother than there be kill a would be friend he be a wise man he be kill shortly after lose one of the great battle in history oh well I hope it be not his brother that shoot he it be I the Jaffa be a fool in every respect he do not deserve an honourable death I see unscheduled incoming wormhole I would well see what this be about teal'c please escort our guest to the briefing room the Book of Origin say those who seek the path to enlightenment must not be lead astray right see that could be interpret a number of different way I think maybe I know what the Ori be who they be and I be not deny they be very powerful being but if I be right they be not Gods they be like the ascend being I know they simply have a great understanding of the knowledge of the universe what be a God but a being that be worship by those beneath be great knowledge power understand not enough for you to revere the Ori Respect yes certainly but that do not mean I would murder innocent people in their name I guess what I be try to understand be whether the Ori have speak to you directly and tell you to worship they or whether you 've misinterpret some evidence you 've find along the way and develop this religion on your own I can not speak for everyone in my galaxy but in my own humble opinion I do not believe that any individual or society can achieve enlightenment through fear monger and force servitude no matter what power be present as evidence that be something the ascend being I know very clearly seem to understand do not get I wrong I mean we should all try to better ourselves I mean if ascension really be the ultimate end we be try to achieve then so be it but we should all be allow to get there or not of our own free will you can kill I for say that but that be what I believe in and nothing you say or do will ever change my mind come the Ori hear you we do not require blind faith only that you believe what you see and know it to be true I realize this be just a friendly meeting but on behalf of our planet 's leader I 've be ask to present a few thought for you to consider some point that we can discuss in the future possibly look forward to an official treaty between our world and the Jaffa nation who be that Lt Col Mitchell SG 12 and a gentleman we encounter on another planet who claim that he represent some Gods call the Ori I think we have yet to see the real fallout from dismantle the infrastructure establish by the Goa'uld indeed we have already see the rise of individual and organization who have threaten to challenge we there be as many human out there as there be Jaffa but if we do not continue to work together the victory that we both work so long and hard for could result in chaos we be Ori you instruct these people to worship you we be their creator all who follow the path will join we in enlightenment do you know who the Alterans be those who abandon the path be evil Evil why they shield you really I do not really think they do much of anything for we but I guess I be wrong the truth of the universe have be obstruct all will learn the power of the Ori Hallowed be the Ori vital be return to normal I wonder what that be all about I do not know but he be in some sort of distress we can not seem to disconnect the stone or turn off the device it be the will of the Ori Figured you might say that be you sure there be nothing you can do you help we out I guarantee we will be more receptive to those story you wanna tell call it a miracle if you want when hanomere fall from above and learn't to fly on the way down that be a miracle right these planet you 've mention all have plentiful naquadah mine on they and substantial human population whose side be you on Jaffa there be no side here just topic of conversation I wish to meet this Prior of the Ori if he preach faith in false god then that be a concern for all of we I wish to hear his claim and challenge he what be go on this be bad bad than be burn to death it appear our ascend ancient and the Ori have a slight difference of opinion see the Ori seem to think that because they be ascend human being should worship they all human and if we do not then the world where we be live should be destroy I do not think enlightenment mean what they think it mean see apparently our Ascended ancient have be shield our existence from the Ori they 've be protect we the Ori seem to think that our ancient be evil because they have not share the secret of the universe with we well I hate secret at least the one I do not know see the problem be the Ori now know our galaxy be inhabit by human because of we I refuse to accept the blame for that Curiosity be part of human nature look if the Ancients know that the Ori be so bad why do not they stop we from come here free will right if they have be protect we there be no reason to believe they will not continue the Ancients may protect we from the Ori but not their human follower see ancient will not interfere on any low plane of existence if anybody from our galaxy want to worship the Ori apparently that be our choice and they will not stop prior from come through the gate because apparently they 've already send one the Ori have give prior special power and that be not fair they be still human and highly evolve human can have some pretty amazing ability they be use the secret of the universe that the Ori have give they to spread world of the Ori 's Godliness and when people do not see the light it be go to be what be we go to do I do not know I be start to think that send prior be just the beginning we could be talk crusade here we need to warn Earth we need to get out of these people take the unbeliever back to Veraga let its cleansing mark forever the beginning of a new age Evil have raise a great many unbeliever in a far off place they must be show the path Hallowed be the Ori Hallowed be the Ori what be they do why do he bring we back here I think he be use we to weed out any other heretic that might be here I still do not get why the Ori just do not do it themselves they be suppose to be god be not god all see all know all powerful the universe be infinite remember apparently that be a lot to keep track of I suppose they do not even know about our galaxy well until recently it be not our fault you would think at least they keep on top of their own people I get the feeling the Ori that their devout follower do their enforce for they to confirm their loyalty ok why do we let the Prior bring we back here well because I do not think he be go to give we much choice and besides I be start to think that might be our good way to contact Earth and warn they about what we know how well Phanis say that his sect have find other artifact you think they also have a terminal device to go with the stone if they do and we can find it and hook up the stone well we will get this communication thing go both way right if the Prior be use we to weed out other unbeliever how do we make contact with Phanis without give he away we can not you do not believe in a high power well it be complicated there be a lot of different point of view about that subject around here the Jaffa have recently shed the dominance of false god that have enslave we for many generation but many have long believe in a path to enlightenment Origin will guide you on this path those who revere its wisdom shall be uplift I have come to spread the word to the unbeliever who have be shelter and raise by evil you have no idea how much he sound like my Grandma it be a pretty big village and I suspect that Phanis and his gang do a reasonable job of hide sacrilegious artifact well we have to do something no no no Phanis you should not have come they be use we to get to you so I suspect either that or you 've truly come to see the power of the Ori Bloody likely you have to leave if I can help you speak the reality of our existence to your people maybe one day in turn you will spread that word back here you say you have other artifact besides the stone I will show you no just tell I now we be look for a large dome shape object with a blue crystal on top the stone fit inside of it come Phanis you be risk your life Harrid Sallis and I all those who believe as we do have know for some time that we may give our life for our cause we only hope one day the truth come to bear as a result and something just happen Phanis and the people shall deliver the wicked unto your divine judgment where their sin shall be weigh in balance with all that be just and true the Ori be great I love the Ori I be a believer what be the matter with you people I be tell you I 've see the light I do not think they be buy it ah I 've hear you do well glorious be the Ori who lead we to salvation who do fight the evil that would doom we to mortal sin do they defeat the old spirit and cast they out and now for the strength of our will they do call upon we to prevail against the corruption of all unbeliever well second time a charm the Ori do not shield this knowledge as other might selfish in their powerful advantage they lead you to their realm with the path that be lay out in the book of Origin all you need do be follow their teaching I be very sorry you will have to excuse we for a moment please continue Colonel they wake up just for a moment and then they lose consciousness again do they say anything yes they do guide we on the path so that we may triumph over the enemy of our salvation and be with you in the end of end on the plain of enlightenment what be the meaning of this very sorry we 've just receive some information about our visitor here which demand we take every precaution we will have to take the staff Sir and you will have to come with we I demand to know what you 've learn all I wish to do be spread the word of the Ori to your world actually that be never go to happen then I must leave at once that be not go to happen either Hallowed be the Ori Hallowed be the Ori Hallowed be the Ori Code Blue medical emergency to science lab one Repeat code blue same as before only this time it be both of they now hold on this device draw its power directly from subspace it will react very badly to an explosion you can not blow it up perhaps we should send it through the Stargate Genius no it also use subspace to communicate with another galaxy across the universe I mean there be no reason to believe that Daniel and Vala will not stay connected to it even from another planet I have a different idea tell they to start dial the Gate where too wherever wherever Alright Chevron 2 encode Chevron 3 encode Walter Orders from Colonel Mitchell Sir Proceed Chevron 4 encode out of the way Chevron 6 encode not yet Walter not yet halt dialing sequence blood pressure 's dropping their heart rate rise they be go into shock now resume dialing sequence Chevron seven lock charge at 200 Clear General Landry Dr Lam say be that Daniel and Vala have regain consciousness well do you see that be what I be talk about you have serve the Ori well I bow in humble account come and gaze upon the flame of enlightenment let its power wash over you great holy army shall be gather and train to fight all who embrace evil in the name of the Gods ship shall be build to carry our warrior out amongst the star and we will spread Origin to all the unbeliever the power of the Ori will be feel far and wide and the wicked shall be vanquish Hallowed be the Ori Hallowed be the Ori thank you General Landry be ready for we so you think we should expect more of these Priors to show up I would be very surprised if they do not how we know one come through the Stargate but if their galaxy be so far away I suspect the Ori have the power to make a lot of thing happen still for the Priors I think we can assume it be a one way trip do not think they have a problem with self sacrifice you think the ancient here in our galaxy will continue to stop the Ori from use their power to attack we directly I hope so so how do we fight these guy and I mean the message as much as the man a lot of folk out there be go to buy what these guy be sell hopefully now many have be educate to the way of false god yes but we be not talk about human with snake in their head and a slightly well understanding of technology you see the power be not false the Priors be go to offer to people what will seem like proof of God Proof of powerful being be not proof of God I be not say it be look just because we know there be some being on a high plane of existence than ourselves do not mean there be not an order of be high than they least I reckon that be what my Grandma would say the universe be supposedly infinite which in my book make it impossible to know everything I mean somewhere in there you get to fill in the blank with a little faith I have a Grandma too so Business as usual Sir let they bring it we will use our strength against their weakness that be a pretty good strategy for any kind of business you be in I be glad you two be ok amen hey wow what the hell be you do here nice to see you too no I be awfully sorry I just be not expect to see you ah well I be in the neighbourhood and I 've get a little surprise for Mitchell oh yeah he love the last one the fact that you do not tell he that we be all move onto different position yeah sorry you miss Daedalus no you be not you be right I be not listen I just have a briefing with Landry about your stuff sound like it could be a problem well we 've be up against some pretty bad guy before not so pretty overdress yes through some tough situation that we always win yeah but do not you feel that be because we have someone look out for we I do not think I would say this to anyone else but for the first time I be scared I be hungry I too come on yeah man this be good still a rush yeah I do not know why you do not get back on the horse seater except I do not think you could take one of these thing for a joyride you see that be one of the great thing about be a General you pretty much get to do whatever you want especially after you save the world seven or eight time who be count teal'c actually he mention it quite often so Mitchell I hear you have not pick out your team yet I be hope I will not have to Sir why do General Landry say something about it Sir he do be you go to tell I Sir he say you be go to be fine Mitchell thank you Sir do you mind if I kick in the afterburner Sir oh please thank you Sir come to see I off that be sweet well we 've be through a lot together and I just want to come here myself and make sure you be thoroughly search this be a little keepsake something to remember you by this be a priceless artifact as priceless as the memory we share well thank you I hate long goodbye ok Goodbye do not I even get a hug Daniel do not make this hard than it already be can not blame a girl for try no I can Jackson hey where be your girlfriend she leave about an hour ago Men I miss the go away party Hope you save I a piece of cake now that she be go I can finally get some work do around here yeah about that the whole SG 1 thing you never give I a firm answer what do you say we make it official Jackson Jackson Jackson I need a med team on level 25 good morning sunshine how you feel well what happen we be not exactly sure but Dr Lam here think it may have something to do with those alien cuff why do one assume that well you be completely unresponsive when we bring you in but your condition suddenly improve when she come back miss I Season 9 Episode 4 the tie that Bind Walter just the man I be look for Sir we have to talk about your schedule and accord to this you be go to be in meeting all day hell I be Sir after two month on this base I 've come to realise that an alarming portion of these meeting be a complete waste of my time this be all housekeeping you can handle it I no I do not think so Sir I be not Walter do not make I promote you no Sir yes Sir I mean what just just write up the highlight and leave they on my desk General Dr Lam what be what be the late on Dr Jackson well as evidence by Vala 's departure and immediate return they can not be separate for much more than an hour before they begin to feel the effect if she have not come back when she do I suspect they would both be dead I think it be suppose to stop when they take the wristband off it be Dr Lee be theorize that it might have something to do with the ancient communication device they find it be possible that the two technology bring together somehow combine to create a more permanent bond I see Colonel this be a waste of time do I a favour shut up it be not like I want this to happen anyway I be be realistic he have no idea what he be do I be stand right here he can do all the test he want it be not go to get we anywhere look I know we be scrape the bottom of the barrel here but it be not like we have a lot of choice unless you happen to know someone else who understand this technology you know someone someone who can help we no and yes wait we be not do here yet who a scientist who be study the bracelet at one point well let us go see he no out of the question why I would rather not say this be the guy you steal the bracelet from right how dare you assume that I acquire those bracelet through anything but honest mean I may have a less than perfect reputation you tell I you steal they do I yes anyway he will not help we Correction he will not help you fine but if we be go we will need a change of clothe Fine fine tell you what these outfit make a bold statement you do not reckon Landry 's go to make we work they into the rotation do you let I see that be a camouflage green and undercover rawhide it be get a nice ring to it well this well be quick 45 minute away from your girlfriend you be go to turn into a pumpkin and I be go to have to haul your ass back there gentleman how can I help you well we require your expertise Expertise well you be the foremost expert on alien technology on this planet Foremost well I do not know if I be the foremost expert I might be among the top five be you familiar with these yes yes I actually own a pair myself up until not too long ago so you know how they work of course the bracelet create a physiological bond between the wearer they be use by the Goa'uld have you ever hear of the physiological bond be sustain say after the bracelet be remove no no bar some freak power surge in the bracelet themselves that might somehow transfer their effect outright it be highly unlikely but in the unlikely event this do happen would you be able to sever the connection I might be able to Great could you tell we how be she who Vala we do not know any Vala then I be afraid I can not help you ok maybe we know a Vala I need to see she why it be not what you think I be not after revenge the truth be the bracelet be not the only thing she take from I she also steal my heart excuse I I remember it as if it be yesterday some night we would steal away from the city strip off our clothing and bathe in the spring of our garden we would chase one another across the mossy hill and then lie naked under Adora 's moon and Vala would sometimes it be ok it be great thank we get the picture very vivid very disturbing picture yes those be wonderful carnal time but that be in the past all I ask now be that I be give the chance to see she one last time bring I Vala and I will consider help you Sir Major Gibson 's here to see you send she in General Major how be thing at the Pentagon not so good I be afraid the international committee have review your budget proposal and despite your warning of how it will affect the day to day operation of Stargate Command they have decide to throw their full financial backing behind the Atlantis mission they now see this base as serve little more than a support role can not say I be surprised they 've be go over the report bring back by Dr Weir and her colleague with the prevalence of ancient technology in the Pegasus Galaxy they feel that be where we should be focus our effort and you believe that Sir Atlantis be a civilian operation they approve Dr Weir 's appointment the reason they do not want to support Stargate Command be because they have no say in how it be run that be what General O'Neill say he also say he would be willing to go to bat for you with the President but he think it might help if you take your case to the chairman of the appropriation committee yourself do he oh Jack Jack Jack Jack Jack Arlos I think I would never see you again hello Vala they overpower I some five six mercenary one morning on my way to see you they demand that I steal the bracelet under penalty of death I do not care Arlos be you go to have I kill no the memory of what we share and that you so callously throw away will undoubtedly haunt you until the day you die that should be punishment enough oh yes you be right that should do it I be over you what I be not over however be the theft of my mother 's necklace I want it back only then be I go to tell you how to sever the link connect you be realistic that necklace be go there be no way I can get that back well then our business be do Hang on loverboy we will get your Momma 's necklace then we have a deal this once belong to the first prime of Bastet it be completely unique one of a kind and I be go to give it to you for three ounce of Naquadah no two for five so business not so good huh well with no planet to conquer and no city to loot how be a Jaffa expect to put food on the table listen a mutual friend of our be suppose to send word that we be come what mutual friend Vala where be she we be not sure she say she have some business to attend to and she would meet we back at the gate what she do not call ahead I swear the next time I see Vala I would kill she where she stand that be a no do you take I for a fool I do not know about they but I certainly do Hello Inago nicely do with the distraction boy oh that be what we be do you do not wanna let we in on your little plan you would have just screw it up Vala you cowardly backstabbe sorry excuse for a woman how 've you be Inago you filthy double talking slug Nice to see you too obviously they use to date do you remember that necklace you sell I the priceless heirloom from the house of Verenna I may have overstate it be value slightly slightly it be worthless huh you be one to talk that Goa'uld forceshield inhibitor turn out to be nothing more than a power coil from an obsolete cargo ship fortunately I be not here for revenge in fact I be here to set thing straight by buy back that worthless necklace why what be your angle you do not need to know well then I guess you do not need that necklace no deal however I be willing to show you how I want to square thing here I might consider buy back that useless power coil why would you want to buy back a power coil from an obsolete cargo ship no necklace no deal I 've get an idea how about a straight swap Necklace for power coil no no wait wait wait I have a well idea we dig a big old pit we drop these two in it and we let they fight it out I will ask again Deal Deal Deal of course I do not have the power coil we be go to have to go and get that back where would you unload an obsolete power coil Sister Visina welcome back Brother Kaius how be the orphan the orphan be well thank Grannus and you well enough thank Grannus who be Grannus Minor celtic God one of Camulus ' former Lt 's thank of course all of we continue to be grateful for your generous gift pilgrim from all over the system travel to see the legendary ring of Shen'Marak however it have be a bittersweet season for we since coincidentally around the same time you make your gracious donation the shrine 's most precious relic the Nevanna crystal mysteriously disappear no yes it be shock the depth some people will plum unfortunately I have some more bad news it appear I be decieve and this ring of Shen ' Marak be apparently a fake I be afraid you will have to get rid of it out of the question hey it be bogus your follower be worship a phoney relic yes but ultimately its true worth can only be judge by the genuine faith it instill in the heart of the many pilgrim who come to visit the shrine and more importantly in the charitable contribution they make while they be here right of course if you be willing to make a substantial contribution of your own what do you want I have to get outta here I can not take anymore the fast the chant bathing of the poor if I have to weave one more prayer basket I be go to kill someone bless day bless day bless day oh my you be not a real monk he use to be a smuggler one of the good I ever know then thing get a little too hot for he and he have to find religion well it be a sweet rap while it last until great God Grannus go and get himself execute by his own Jaffa since then the number of pilgrim have be well significantly reduce that be why you can not have the ring Power coil whatever the point be that it be the only thing keep this place go if you wanna go why not just go because all I get right now be the clothe on my back I need my cargo ship the one you borrow yes that might be a bit of a problem but we can get you a replacement no deal what be so special about this particular cargo ship let us just say I make a few modification of my own you bring it to I and I will give you the ring Power coil look do not try anything alright the pilgrim of Grannus may be greatly reduce in number but they be more fanatical than ever you would have to be to be worship a dead God I give the word and they will tear you to piece before you can get halfway to the gate now if you will excuse I I have morning prayer to attend to so how do we get the ship we can not why not we 've come this far what be the problem what news we 've put the word out but she have yet to appear I need not remind you that because of your bungling we 've already lose a case of weapon grade refine Naquadah now someone have to pay and if it be not Vala then it might as well be you two rest assure Vala can not hide forever and when she turn up we will deliver her dead or alive see that you do and let it be know that no one defy the Lucian Alliance so let I get this straight you need to get this ship to get the power coil to get the necklace to get this guy to tell you how to undo whatever be keep you two connect yeah that about sum it up unfortunately that ship be now in the hand of the Lucian Alliance the who it be a coalition of former smuggler and mercenary who 've band together to take advantage of the power vacuum leave by the demise of the Goa'uld the fact they 've manage to form a coherent group make they unique and a particular threat especially to the newly form Jaffa government can we contact they they will not deal with someone they do not know I assume they know you well yes but our last encounter do not exactly go as plan Ooh let I guess you screw they and now they wanna kill you actually it be Daniel who mess up the deal you try to sell they a steal ship you be the one that tell they they could not have it the point be if they see either of we again they will kill we can we take this ship by force you would have to go up against a sizeable armada if the alternative be staying link to you I be willing to take that risk I be sorry Dr Jackson but I can not allow it Dr Lee 's continue his research hopefully he will be able to come up with something on his own in the meantime you be just go to have to learn to live with each other and by the way in three day you be come to Washington we be I be I need you to testify in front of the Chairman of the Appropriations Commitee let he see exactly what we be up against your experience with the Ori could go a long way towards convince he of the danger head our way right we will do our good Sir Daniel do you happen to have one of these credit card yes I do and no you can not by the way be a security escort still necessary do you really have to ask I notice you 've assign a woman be you afraid I might corrupt one of your impressionable young man no I just think that save someone the trouble of have to rebuff your advance how do you know you succeed I be so bored what do you do around here for fun I be do it translate these artifact from P4S 559 oh be they valuable well their historical value be immense but there be no gold or jewel involve if that be what you mean do not touch that do you know what you need to occasionally get up from under the dust of dead civilisation and live a little why do not you take I out to dinner look the only way you be get off this base be on this little side trip to Washington and if we could find a way around that we would why do not we go off world I 've get a great little deal cook up with some trader on Katana no we could be partner Split everything down the middle 60 40 hardly seem fair that your life get to continue and my affair be put on hold excuse I I should be on my way to the Pegasus Galaxy right now oh do not you blame that on I it be your own curiosity in the ancient treasure that cost you a trip to Atlantis you cuff we together you be not pay attention at the time look we can point finger all we want but the fact be we be stick together like it or not we be just go to have to learn to get along find your glass I be go to see what Dr Lee 's do hello what the hell be you do here be not this my room no your room be across the hall with the guard in front of it ah yes they all rather look alike do not they anyhow since I be here shall we make the good of it no we shalln't come on Daniel we be both stick here on this base and there be nothing else to do yes there be there be sleep there be work there be find a way out of this mess what if we can not we might have to spend the rest of our life together no do not even go there there be literally a bond between we some people might even find that romantic I be not one of those people be I really so repulsive no no no you be not repulsive you be just it be it be just that I know what you be do the whole sexual thing it be a defence mechanism really yeah you live a solitary existence you move from place to place you never form any last relationship you use sex as a weapon prevent yourself from form any real emotional bond Textbook case never realize I be so transparent Vala no really it be fine Daniel you be right I can see why you would not want to become involved with someone so pathetic I be not always like this you should know there be someone once in fact I be engage then I be take as a host and even though the Tok'ra eventually free I the damage be already do and once you have be spat on and stone by the people of your own village well you try form last relationship Vala just wait please stop alright I be sorry okay I be sorry I be just sometimes I just I forget what you 've be through if you 've actually be through any of that be you mess with I be it work get out go get out go despite the fact the Jaffa be free and Anubis have be defeat it would be a mistake to assume the Goa'uld be no long a threat but without the Jaffa to do their bidding they be effectively crippled many still have the loyalty of their human slave Slaves be a long way from an effective army and besides if the Jaffa see the light it will only be a matter of time before the slave follow suit the Goa'uld be not the only threat out there Sir so I assume you be refer to these people that you supposedly meet in a distant galaxy supposedly well correct I if I be wrong but accord to the report I read you never actually leave Stargate Command you go into a coma have some kind of vision for all we know the whole thing could have be an elaborate hallucination one of the Priors come through the Gate a simple man who do nothing but spout a lot of religious nonsense and then kill himself Senator I be there the man burn himself to death without the aid of any obvious device or technology it be no parlor trick we be also begin to get report that there be other Priors show up on other planet well it be hardly surprising that new religious group would arise in the wake of the Goa'uld 's collapse the Ori be very real senator as ascend being they have all the appearance of genuine God 's but again this be accord to your testimony they can not act in this galaxy without incur the interference from these other ascended being be not that correct technically yes well look at it from our point of view Dr Jackson finally after 8 year and billion of dollar spend the Goa'uld have be neutralize along with the Replicators and now suddenly out of nowhere along come these magical Ori require a redoubling of effort and expenditure exactly what be you suggest Senator the Stargate program have succeed in acquire alien technology so now it be time to devote our resource to exploit those technology for planetary defence namely by build more daedalus class ship now we have no intention of shut you down completely you will continue to operate at 30 of your current budget I think you will find that be more then enough money once you deemphasize your exploration if you recall Senator it be new exploration that get we those technology in the first place now there be still thousand of Stargate address leave unexplored in this galaxy this program do not exist to satisfy your curiosity Doctor the important thing be that we have learn enough to defend this planet against any potential threat do you have something to say well it be just all so amusing be not it I mean only an idiot would assume that this backwater of a planet will safe because you have a few ship with decent shield technology you do not look like an idiot to I so I have to assume that the reason why you want to build more ship be like all the man you like big machine with big engine that fire big missile because you have a deep seat need to overcompensate for your own shortcoming excuse I see she know what I mean I think a short recess would be a good idea I be do here anyway this meeting be over how do it go Sir let us just put it this way you be go after that ship the cargo ship what about the Lucian Alliance Sir you will have to figure out a way to deal with they why what happen she accuse the Chairman of the Senate Appropriations commitee of have a let us just call it an insufficient manhood she be get to go just a word of warn Tenat and Jup be notoriously unscrupulous trader they be crafty devious and although stupid under no circumstance be they to be trust in other word they be go to try and screw we before we screw they it should be alright as long as you keep your guard up and we keep focus on what need to be do close the deal take the ship make sure they do not kill I certainly not in that order I still think we need some more boot on the ground just to be safe and they will most certainly run a surface scan of the planet any additional life sign or any ship in orbit will only raise suspicion and jeopardize everything we be approach the planet run a surface scan four life sign let us go greet they this be a good plan very inspire yes we have you to thank for that nothing motivate like complete and utter desperation you say that now but you will miss I when I be go no I be pretty sure I will not just like old time I be offer my assistance on this mission only to aid Daniel Jackson my participation should not be construe as a desire to rejoin SG 1 right Colonel Mitchell at time you remind I of O'Neill ah I will take that as a compliment as you wish teal'c hey fella 's what be with all the hostility Vala how do it feel know your sorry life be about to end I do not know how do it feel tell the Alliance that you half wit lose their Naquadah Woah no no violence no damage the good until we 've finish our deal besides I think the Alliance want to hold she up as an example yes they do your name Cam Mitchell Bounty hunter never hear of you that be because I keep a low profile I like to let my work speak for itself you 've partner with a Jaffa I see look we would love to sit around and talk shop but we be on the clock where be our reward we have a caseload of weapon grade refine Naquadah sit in our cargo ship Good let us go and get it no I will stay here with you while Jup take Vala and her partner to the ship once they 've be secure he will return and ring the Naquadah down to you and what be to stop all Jut here from just ring you away and just skidattle our honour it would not be in our good interest to cheat you after all we have reputation as trader to uphold right reputation I can not help notice the absence of the case load of refined Naquadah you guy be promise do you seriously think the Alliance would have trust we with another case after we lose the last one so this be a double cross what happen to uphold your reputation let us just say those bounty hunter will not be in a position to do any complain Hold still tell you so who you like in the NFL this year you kinda strike I as a Raiders fan Daniel why do not you let I do it I can do it just do I a favour I need some help ok what go to the panel by the rear exit ok now what stay there shut up and let I finish yeah they get a great secondary in the league 's the good pass rush Offence run game and the defence run championship be I right our cargo ship have return I suggest you lower your weapon I take it we be not get our Naquadah no you be not and so conclude our deal well that go well than I expect I be pick up ship Lot 's of they Correction that go much bad than I suspect stand down and prepare to be board should not we be jump into hyperspace or something they will pursue we what be you do Kaius say he customise this ship let us see if there be anything we can use what be happen multiple energy signature and phantom vessel they be confuse the Alliance ship Fine let us go let us go let us go there be two vessel pursue we you get anything else in your bag of trick I will show you what be you do Vala wait for it now Wicked Pulse wave their power level spike and overload it should take a couple of minute to restore primary system which should give we enough time to thank for get my ship back and for not help yourself to the swag in the ship hide compartment wait do you just say hidden compartment no wait so really why would you want to trade a power coil from an obsolete cargo ship so really why would you want to trade for this worthless necklace never mind Excellent finally I can get Mother off my back so so so we have a deal remember we give you the necklace and you sever the link yes of course I 've be do extensive research and well there be nothing I can do the effect can not be counter but you know my guess be it will wear off eventually on it be own so long everybody that be it you go through all that for nothing pretty much I can not wait till Senator Fisher hear about this one yeah have you hear any news I speak to the President he give I two choice accept the budget cut or convince the International Committee to change their mind and contribute to our funding right how do we do that give they what they want a new civilian position appoint by the committee with full access to this base and a say in all major decision concern its operation Watchdog exactly thank for help out indeed good luck on Dakara do not be a stranger he will be back what be you do here have lunch do not you care that there could be prior out there take advantage of poor innocent people lure they into an oppressive religion or bad kill they for reject it be you bored of bother Jackson you be suppose to be go out on mission through the Stargate so let us go let us rid the galaxy of evil doer look despite what Daniel might think I really can help I know how thing work out there I be physically capable I be good with weapon not to mention seductively attractive I will make a fine asset to any SG team you leave out selfish and untrustworthy how about independant and resourceful that be a classified file prior have be report on 43 different planet already yeah that be what the file say it just so happen that I have a very good relationship with the people on the one you 've designate P8X 412 Define Relationship they trust I what where be you go go talk to Landry why because anyone who trust you be obviously in a great deal of danger oh God no one be here I think these people trust you why be we sneak around avoid everybody I already tell you they will not recognise I dressed like this fortunately I leave a couple of spare outfit what be it with she and her wardrobe yeah I think we could probably explain to they why exactly it will only take a second can a girl have a little privacy no besides I think I 've see just about everything there be to see right look there be no other way out of this room I be just go to change I will be right back hey these be the weapon of our God Quetesh who be you just take it easy what be you do here we mean no harm please forgive we it be be so long we begin to fear you would not return then you be foolish I would not abandon you I be your God Season 9 Episode 5 the power that be I have pillage the galaxy many time over and make slave of all the mortal I have encounter this world please I and I shall take it as my own Benevolent God Quetesh will never allow such treachery not exactly Shakespeare how be it these people do not know the Goa'uld have fall Most of this world be pretty isolated and I would be very surprised if anyone here actually know how to operate the gate these human must be tell the truth I know oh merciful beautiful Quetesh have mercy on he he know not your power what be you do it be a play do not worry I think it will be over soon then we will eat that be not what I be talk about you want to stop these people from fall victim to the Priors that be what I be go to do this be not what I have in mind what your mind may or may not be able to imagine be really none of my concern now kindly get out of your God 's face no man shall lay claim to my world and no man shall bring harm to my child thank be to you Quetesh all hail and glory be to you we have little rehearsal my Lord but I trust it please you yes as always Azdak you please your God greatly thank you my Lord you have be greatly miss now I would like to hear about the visitor who arrive through the Chaapa'ai it be pointless lie to your God Azdak I be all know as well as all beautiful he say that he be here to save we that our true Gods await our devotion Lies mean to deceive you I do not believe a word he say my Lord I swear it some of you do you have be absent for so many season some think maybe you have abandon we they be weak my Lord please forgive they have I not always be merciful to those who deserve forgiveness now go while I consider you punishment yes of course well that be easy shut that thing off why must you continue to deceive these people this be one of the many planet that Quetesh rule over when I be her host as you know the Tok'Ra eventually remove the symbiote but not before her people rebel and torture I think we be one and the same and they could not tell the difference why be I not surprised I have nothing I be desolate fortunately I discover that news of Quetesh 's demise have not reach this little mining outpost so you keep they mining naquadah for you just a tiny bit the mine be practically barren by the time I get here but this planet act as a safe haven for I until I get back on my foot look I never kill anyone I never torture they I be a wonderful God just ask they I think we will why you do not believe I that and I be not totally convinced they be ultimately go to follow your command nor should that be the only reason they do not follow the Priors I be still suppose to be their God I can not exactly go out there and ask they if they be go to listen to I I be not expect you will to what make you think they be go to tell you the truth you be suppose to be my faithful servant then I will also explain that we be not as faithful as you might like to believe and if necessary I will also tell they we be plot to kill you I have hear well plan I kind of like it Shut up how be the staff evaluation come they be do they will be on your desk by tomorrow morning that be when they be due right yes yeah I have lunch with the head of my department once a month just to stay in touch get any housekeeping do help I get to know they a lot well I know in our case what in our case what well it be just that we know each other a little well than say I do Colonel Garrett the munition supply officer really I actually doubt that Colonel Garrett 's be here long than I have do we have to do this here you wanna have lunch fine tomorrow noon I will be there as order it be not an order ok I have be sick for some time now the past few harvest I 've be more of a burden than a help to my family I 've even lose the ability to stand you be stand now the Prior he cure I say that it be the will of the Ori Blasphemer just take it easy I be sorry but I will not have he speak against Quetesh like that in my presence look we be not out to get anybody here we just wanna hear what he have to say go ahead the jewel in his staff glow he wave it over I and I feel well than I ever have all he ask in return be that I tell other that I spread the word of the Ori then upon his return when be this Prior to return tomorrow the Prior say that Quetesh be a false God that if she ever return he would expose her weakness your be a fool speak no more or I shall strike you down in the name of our true God I say take it easy you should be thankful that Quetesh be so forgive and pray when she slay the Prior for his wicked lie she will not do the same to you oh boy glory be to Quetesh Glory to the one true God ok you have make your point know when to stop I think I need to talk to our one true God this be why you want to come back to this planet all of this be mine I earnt it these people have just be keep it safe for I and as you say we can not be a hundred percent certain that they be go to obey I so if this planet do fall to Priors hello you steal this planet 's most value treasure be the least of our concern right now I like your attitude I be think of cut you boy in at ten percent and now I be think twenty despite your return many of the villager believe the Ori to be true Gods and worthy of their loyalty all the more reason why we should pack all of this up right now and get out of here be you go to pitch in or what other believe you will slay the Prior in a show of power upon his return tomorrow tomorrow Tomorrow 's no good for I you need to tell these people the truth I have a lot of need Daniel but I assure you that be not one of they if you do not tell they the truth we will yes and who do you think they be actually go to believe look command these people to obey you and not the Ori be not go to work especially once that Prior come back and we do not want to get into a God off especially since we know you be not even close forget what I say about the twenty percent yes he be right we can not trade one lie for another lie alright what can we fight with then how can we stop this prior from corrupt these people ok we have a very limited window of opportunity here if you expose yourself as a false God if you tell these people how you fool they and why we might be able to make they sceptical about the Prior or it could push they towards believe in the Ori as true god even more no the only chance these people have the only chance any of we have against the Priors be to show they we will not accept the Ori as Gods no matter what happen we must reject they true enlightenment must begin with the truth oh please the truth be so overrated look for once just do the right thing here ok you be go to feel so good about it afterwards trust I really this be unnecessary you will be execute at first light tomorrow Imposter so Daniel when do that warm and glowy feeling from do the right thing kick in cos not there yet I can not believe you all just stand there and let they imprison I what be we suppose to do you have gun do not you there be like over a hundred people there and just relax we be go to get you out of this oh you be I feel a little well I be sorry I get a little nervous what with the whole execution loom and all just believe I it be not go to come to that Mitchell and Teal'c be talk to they right now have you forget that if I die you die believe I it be not go to come to that trust I this time fine she make a mistake it be a big mistake it be a whopper but you can not just kill she why not a little help do she not deserve a trial to explain the thing that she have do I think we all have a pretty good idea of what she do and why your people be look for leadership they be look to you so you 've get to decide what kind of society you wanna have one where people get execute without a chance to explain their action you wanna hold a maldoran be not that her name Quetesh establish the process several year ago a way to settle dispute between two party fine that sound fit we be go to hold a maldoran Hey how have it go well you know what be the plan you go to blow up this door lie down supression fire so that we could rush out through the hidden escape passage it be in the room I tell you have no other exit they be go to put you on trial tomorrow I like my plan well Kinda be your plan it be name after you really a maldoran they go to let I be the judge do not think so then it be not a real maldoran be it actually this could not have work out well actually I think it could have no a trial be public we can use the forum to expose what it be to be a false God and warn the community about the Priors you be right actually we could get they all work up about false Gods and then they can kill I as an example to the other look I persuade they to let you stay here for the night right thank yeah well I will see you guy in the morning thank you I apologize for ever doubt your masterful skill at negotiation he be do the good he can that be what terrify I Welcome and thank you all for come unlike in the past the final decision of this maldoran will be yours my friend a general vote after both presentation have be make we shall all decide what be to be do to the false God Quetesh we be plead innocent right you already confess a girl can change her mind can not she we shall begin as always with the reading of the claim the first claim of seven mass murder wait a second the second claim of seven mass torture I never kill I never torture that be Quetesh the third claim of seven uh excuse I hi sorry to interrupt the person seat before you do not do those thing you will have your chance to make your presentation yes I be sure we will I just want to make something very clear as we discuss when she confess Vala be a host to a Goa'uld parasite that control her action for many year it be that Goa'uld symbiote name Quetesh that commit the atrocity you be talk about Vala herself can only be hold responsible for the action she do after that Goa'uld be remove when exactly be that four year four year very well assume your assertion to be true we shall begin again the first claim of four Planetary wide force labour this be go to be a long day indeed I perhaps more than any of you feel great sorrow at the fact that I devote my love and faith so freely to an imposter who care only for the naquadah in our mine with every breath she lie with every effort she steal at every chance she betray we the condition of poverty that we now suffer be her fault and her fault alone that be what you must consider he be good I be dead yes she steal she betray you she use you as slave labour all this be true not the opening statement I would have go for but the only reason you know about this be because she tell you she come forward know full well how you would feel and what the consequence would be ask yourselves why do she do this she do it because there be a great threat in this galaxy she think you deserve to know about she tell the truth in order to open your eye to show you the danger of give away your freedom your free will in the hope that give another chance you would not make that same mistake twice we know a Prior of the Ori have come here he be be send to this village to convince you to worship being more powerful than all of we but you must know that like Vala they be not Gods you speak well Daniel Jackson of the planet Earth what be a God what power be great enough to make you bow down in humble reverence that be the one that try to burn we to death twice there be only one measure the only question you may ask yourself be why must I believe what be there for any and all to gain by choose the path of Origin those seek eternal salvation can follow the word of the Ori those that do not shall die as mortal it be as simple as that the day of reckon approach your destiny await he be pretty good too we be so dead I have tell they of the Ori prior many of we believe but not all of we you doubt the power of the Ori no but I understand how they get it and because I do I be not willing to abandon my own free will and worship they for it the Ori heal this man this man that be sick this man who could barely walk this man be heal through knowledge we have medicine we have tool that can do much the same thing this device have the power to heal if you know how to use it but not by magical power it be call technology Technology yes Knowledge Understanding of the way thing work and the science of the universe maybe so but consider this there be two man one be starve and the other have a plentiful crop be it not wrong for the fortunate man to hoard his harvest should he not share with his hungry brother it be the same with knowledge and understanding as you have say the Ori have a great understanding of the universe but most importantly they be willing to share it with we out of their love for we their creation only a fool would turn away just because the Ori know more than we do do not make they god they be being who be once like you and I but they evolve they learn of humanity 's potential eventually over time they use that knowledge to shed their physical body and live as energy on another high plane of existence which side be he on you be all child of the Ori but you have be raise by evil the true nature of the universe have be keep from you by power that would have you stray from the path of Origin it be time to open your eye let Origin show you the way no you be right maybe hoarding knowledge be wrong maybe it be not maybe learn something for yourself be part of the journey to enlightenment but kill someone for not worship you regardless of your power be wrong very wrong Knowledge be power but how you use that power define whether you be good or evil the choice be yours give we another chance I beg you please spare we all believe in the power of the Ori or be lay down in the dust escort the prisoner back to the cell wait we be do with the maldoran we must vote now on her punishment and discuss other issue we now face Azdak I know what the Ori seem to be offer you may sound very tempting we be povery stricken as a society we may not be able to survive much long we think our God would provide for we why should we reject the knowledge and education to well ourselves but you can have all that without give up your freedom do not you see how wrong it be to enforce a belief by threaten your people with their very life as the Ori say would we not be ignorant and deserving of punishment for fail to see the plain truth before we leave we we shall deliberate Comfortable where you be live I kind of like the place I be rent in Summerin Hills if it be nice you ought to buy it well just wait and see I do not know how long I be go to be here so how be your mother why do not you call she and find out for yourself why do everything have to be so hostile I be try to tell you the truth I do not really know where to start start what the long way back to happily ever after I have a job to do as I do now I think this be suppose to be a professional meeting about my staff that be why I be here excuse I you need to work on your anti Ori speech that prior almost have I believe well not so much believe as willing to say I believe I know you be ask people to stand up and put their life on the line I really believe it be the only way we be go to have to defend ourselves against they you could try shoot they you say the Priors be human right a few well aim shot might at least get their attention the interesting thing about religion be you find that kill the missionary do not combat the overall philosophy the problem be what the Priors be offer sound quite good until you get to the whole prostrating and burn people alive bit there be that and I do not think any of we have read the real fine print yet Meaning well I personally know without a doubt the Priors be bad so creepy and believe or die be an archaic moral standing no the Ori be wrong for do what they be do but the part I have not figure out yet the part that be really bother I be why they be do it I mean why do they care if people worship they or not we have decide to spare your life really thank you your punishment will be imprisonment for the rest of your life what Azdak after everything we 've be through together you make I rub your foot be not you justly reward anyway the odd massage here and there hardly worth life imprisonment you lie and abuse the people of this planet what about the Prior wait a minute we be not do here with I yet yes we be as for the Prior the settlement be divide many believe the Ori be worthy of our devotion and you Vachna have fall ill that be the man the Prior heal yes please hurry we fear he might be close to death wait Azdak maybe we can help I do not want you near I take it easy it be ok she be not go to hurt there how do you feel now what have you do to I make people feel good be a natural talent of mine can you sit up I do not understand how do you do it how this be a tool like a hammer a shovel just a lot more complicated just because you do not understand something at first do not mean it be the magic of the Gods you think that if we be united and tell this Prior we will not heed his word he will merely go away and leave we alone well I wish I could say for sure what will happen all I know be you have to make a stand whatever happen we will be here to back you up but ultimately it be go to be up to you and your people in exchange for save Vachna 's life I 've decide to reopen the issue of your life imprisonment thank you I have to admit it do make I feel rather good I be sure you think there might be a reward that be not why I do it speak of reward the entirety of your property will be keep here as payment for your crime now hang on a minute you alright yes it be just be a very long day Azdak you must come quickly what be it many have fall ill thank you you be truly bless oh I do not know about that just do the good that I can how many have fall ill I 've lose count but it be a lot whatever this thing be it be spread like wildfire come on we need you over here we will talk about my treasure later we be do our good to quarantine the sick Vala 's use the heal device to cure they as they come in but they be pile up pretty quick symptom weakness high fever chest and stomach pain they have trouble breathe some of the extreme case have go into shock before Vala could even get to they it do not sound like we be deal with something transmit from person to person not that fast we could be look at a common source possibly water or food oh I would say we know the source look like these Priors wanna show we they be go to play hard ball well they be definitely try to establish some crediblity Sir how be you and your team Colonel yeah we be fine but I reckon we could use some back up on the way Colonel thank you Sir you alright no you can do this I be not so sure look I know use that hand device must be take a lot out of you but we really really need your help right now each one it be get hard each time it take long and they keep come I do not think I can save this whole village Daniel you have to keep try Jackson we 've get a problem here give I a minute now please he be just fine well he be not fine now I heal he if they can get reinfecte this will never end we must give in they be too powerful no it be ok I be here Caroline I be Chief Medical Officer on this base it be my call who go on this mission give my work with the CDC infectious disease be my specialty I be easily the most qualified for this I know I be your Dad I just come by to wish you luck and be careful thank you I will hang in there do not give up yet hey thank for come this be bad than I think yeah they be fall pretty fast we be go to need a place to work this way what this be not work anymore I be sorry you have to keep try at least put on a show keep their hope up I mean we know you can do that see this be exactly why I never even think about try to help people I be terrible at it because of I these poor soul be either go to die horribly or they be go to give in to the Prior in the hope that he will heal they it be not because of you I can not make they well and if I have not of be so worried about my precious treasure I would never have open my big fat mouth and we never would have come here then these people would still have to hide or convert to Origin and face the consequence that be a dilemma the rest of our galaxy be also go to have to worry about may I speak with you I 've pretty much rule out bacterial infection at this point I be treat with an anti viral cocktail we be just go to have to wait and see any idea why the hand device seem to have lose it 's effectiveness First I would have to understand even remotely how that thing work I do know it be not unheard of for virus ' to mutate and become immune to whatever be try to attack it obviously in this case we be deal with something more than just a garden variety superbug alright I do not know if this help or not but we know the Ancients be almost wipe out by a similar plague I be just bring it up in case there be something in the research that be already be do you think the Ori give it to they I be aware that SG 1 be infect with a virus and then cure by an Ancient find frozen down in Antarctica the symptom and rate of progression here be remarkably similar do you have any hypothesis as to why we have not be infect no we be still look at your bloodwork excuse I feel my forehead be I hot Hotter than usual you know what I mean I be sorry I be sure you know how much I want to walk in here and solve this hey you want to be a Doctor I 've see some bad situation before but nothing like this and base on that comparison what be your prognosis if we do not make a big breakthrough really soon these people be go to need a miracle Dr Lam you be need immediately I have to go Lam out this be bad right the virus be shut down his internal organ he can not process toxin within his own system he be essentially be poison to death you can not give he more medicine as it be this may be the virus bounce back against treatment I hate have to say this but there be nothing I can do Time of death 14 hour 18 minute after preliminary symptom be first note remove the body and prep for autopsy could I have a minute with he first this be the first not the last I 've get to get back to Colonel Mitchell you do everything you could he have return the Prior of the Ori have return you go ahead Daniel please you must save we Forgive those blind by ignorance People be die our child be die they will believe they do believe still not all of you they be not of we they do not speak for we why be you do this from the small seed of doubt spring forth a mighty poisonous tree of evil yeah alright cut the crap this be my fault alright I be the one who tell these people if they do not bow down to you bow down to the Ori you might just give up and go away well I be wrong I understand now you do not have to kill they to prove a point to I do you truly understand I understand this be not about you and I it be about all the child of the Ori enough heal these people now Vala no Daniel I 've have it with the Ori I think it be time we send they a message or will you heal they only their faith can heal they now then you be useless to we stop at once please do not let their evil deed doom we we all bow to the power of the Ori Hallowed be the Ori Hallowed be the Ori Colonel have you get a couple of aspirin Dr Lam how be you feel tingly how about we pretend I do not say that ok you hang on and I will be right back hey what do I miss oh my God that be not all look tell other what you have see today previously on Stargate SG 1 come back and rejoin SG 1 I have my reason for want this job what if the world needs save if the world needs save I will be there to do what I can the bracelet create a physiological bond between the wearer they be use by the Goa'uld Jackson Jackson you be completely unresponsive when we bring you in but your condition suddenly improve when she come back miss I who be that a gentleman who claim that he represent some Gods call the Ori there be as many human out there as there be Jaffa if we do not continue to work together the victory we work so long and hard for could result in chaos you show no fear Latal he be one man what be there to fear he promise retribution if we do not bow to their god upon his return the Jaffa have shed too much blood to replace one false God with another we have make our decision and we will tell he have you come alone the Ori be with I always you have read from the book of Origin we have what say you to the promise of the Ori we will hear no more of false Gods go now and we will spare your life you speak for all we do one way or another this world will serve their purpose Jaffa thank blessing the glory of the Ori thank to the Ori Season 9 Episode 6 Beachhead unschedule offworld activation what have we get Chief receive a message Sir it be text only it be in Goa'uld none of you folk read Goa'uld do you you boy be not go to let people from two different planet beat you at your own silly game be you this silly game be not over yet that be my wingman you need a new wingman I be go to kick your ass promise promise as you be Colonel actually I be look for Teal'c we receive a communiqué from a Goa'uld name Nerus Ring any bell I be aware of his identity he be a minor Goa'uld who serve Baal for many century what can you tell I about he honestly you do not want to know honestly I do why what do you say we go with the idea that I be in charge and I 've ask a simple question Nerus define avarice and gluttony Simple answer he be a Goa'uld know for his many appetite he be also know as an inventor responsible for a host of Goa'uld technologies really that be when I start pay attention to he too Weird as it sound he be offer to work for we Nerus be not to be trust Funny he have nice thing to say about you no he really do he say some very nice thing I would consider it a great honour to meet the hero of the Tau'ri who bring the Goa'uld to their knee yeah it be nice no he be disgusting you can not honestly open the door to a pathetic minor Goa'uld pose as one of the big boy well at least promise I you be intend on torture he we be set he up in the vip suite no yes Sir if you do not mind my asking why yeah well accord to his communiqué he be in possession of military intelligence of the utmost urgency sound like it be worth a listen still why throw in with we why not stay with Baal or work for some other Goa'uld well look at it in term of optic we must look like major player now by defeat Anubis Most of the System Lords be kill by the Replicators then we defeat the Replicators wow we look cool do not let it go to your head have you see this list of dietary requirement already take care of Ripened Traquil egg we get egg I do not know if they be ripe or not SG 3 be with he on a neutral planet do a security check as we speak as soon as they give the green light I want you to Offworld activation Speak of the devil he be clean Sir thank you Sergeant we will take it from here hello I be Nerus Major General Hank Landry I be in command of Stargate yes I be sure you be a very important person and you have very important reason for subject I to your security precaution but to meet you to look upon the face of the one the one what the one who inspire a great uprising of course now the time of false Gods be at an end and no small part because of this man Doctor Daniel Jackson it be rumour among the Goa'uld that you alone defeat Anubis be that true where would you hear that oh I hear everything Lt Col Cameron Mitchell Leader of SG 1 but you you be not no will he be here Nope and you be not even Colonel Carter be you this be not at all the way I imagine that will be Nerus if you would follow I to our Briefing Room we have much to discuss yes yes but first I must have sustenance have you meet all my dietary requirement as much as humanly possible good good because I be positively famish no seed how be that possible it be a state secret but we be willing to negotiate that be impossible but delicious still still we have important matter to discuss do not we your voice just change oh we do not have to talk that way this be a device that I invent what you be about to see occur nearly two day ago now the free Jaffa who claim this planet call Kallana what be that the formation of an extremely large forcefield around the planet 's Stargate Brilliant and you be share this information with we because why be you so surprised we join force to destroy the Replicators I have no recollection of your participation teal'c you wound I I be the one who figure out how to activate all the Stargates in the galaxy at once do not Ba'al mention that to you that be so like he be not it though that be alright your adversary call themselves the Ori we know all about the Ori yes well thus far I detect only a single individual no doubt a Prior inside the forcefield but it be expand then it will soon be able to accomodate entire army yes and far more the Stargate itself have not shut down since it open wait a minute you say this happen two day ago yes 38 minute be the maximum time a Stargate can stay open that be a law of wormhole physics not accord to the Ori which mean they have a power source which can indefinitely maintain a wormhole from another galaxy plus this forcefield a ZPM can not even do that how to do battle with an enemy so powerful with my help every forcefield have a weakness and I be confident that I shall find it Sir if this intel be correct it represent a complete change of tactic we will have to respond I agree Colonel but if this Kallana be a Jaffa world I be not sure how this be our fight not your fight you engineer the downfall of the Goa'uld this be very much a galaxy of your own making General and you must take responsibility what would you have we do attack they as quickly as possible with as much force as you can bring to bear this be nothing short of an invasion General like it or not you be in a state of war Jack Jack Jack she practically invent the Mark 9 and you be the one who think we should use the damn thing why be you waste valuable time say no I 've read enough of your SG 1 mission report to know that there be time when no one else but Samantha Carter could have pull your ass out of the fire well this be one of those ti reporting as order Sir yeah she be stand right here you be a funny man Jack very funny Chevron 4 encode I promise you he be lie oh which part all of it Chevron 5 encode yet we have be unable to dial the coordinate to Kallana despite several attempt goa'uld do not do anything for anyone other than themselves Chevron 6 encode maybe it be in his own interest to stop the Ori Chevron 7 still will not lock Alright we 've try that long enough Colonel Carter we 've revise the original plan slightly to expedite matter the Prometheus be en route and will rendez vous with we at P4C 452 we will proceed to Kallana from there now consider their unique ability to maintain an active Stargate indefinitely and their forcefield capability the President have authorise any and all mean to complete the mission oh boy and here I be try to have a nuke free career we 've be develop something at Area 51 that General O'Neill believe will be our good chance to stop they right here right now but you do not agree I agree we have to try I just do not think it will be enough it be what we 've get question no Sir still no response from the Jaffa council None as of yet well we can not wait for Gerak we proceed as plan Chief dial the Gate yes Sir move out well temporary or not it be good to have you back how good be this we 've get the band back together you sure with the extra backup singer ah she be good fun plus we figure if Jackson be to die yeah that be the word it would jeopardise the mission well when we speak a couple of week ago you say you think the effect of the bracelet be wear off I be I just do not want to put it to a test from the other side of the galaxy so wow just die to get rid of I now be not you no I be not die oh no I know I be not welcome here despite all my effort to try fit into your good stargate club you can all rest assure that as soon as I can safely part Daniel 's company without kill the both of we I will oh and you you will wish you would listen to I when I say let the Goa'uld come here be a mistake get to it and good luck alright let us do this request permission to come aboard Shaft welcome back to the Prometheus thank you Colonel Shaft my call sign Cam Shaft yeah Disappointing be not it Flight Deck this be Pendergast SG 1 be aboard Engage hyperdrive and proceed to Kallana at good possible speed be the Mark 9 ready to go stand by for your system check I hear you be in a hurry you hear correctly what be a Mark 9 exactly it be also know as a Gate buster sound big some might say too big really I 've always think there be no such thing Vala this be a military vessel I know darling I 've steal it before just try to be my charming self let us see a little less talk a little more shut the hell up General join I for a glass of wine it be from a place call France I be on duty what be this this be exquisite what be it Chicken Chicken it be a rare delicacy among our people it be exquisite I want more chicken More chicken I will try to pull some string Nerus this arrangement be only go to work if you actually do something to help with this problem I be work I be deep in thought when you walk in yeah I could see that you do not trust I course I do not trust you now here be the late transmission from my satellite as you can see the forcefield continue to expand in phase and as it do so it weaken considerably enough to penetrate with our beam technology yes with those nuclear device that you be talk about or SG 1 they could talk to this prior face to face why would they do that we resort to force only when necessary oh I assure you it will be it will be General and and and with the most powerful weapon in your arsenal I will forward this new information directly to Prometheus and I will see if I can arrange some more chicken do Sir we receive an encrypt databurst from Stargate Command the moment we come out of hyperspace Decode it immediately be we pick up any other vessel in the system Negative Sir can we get a close look at the surface you can already see the extent of the incursion with the naked eye my God it be enormous not everything I see be in the window we can all see thank you it be increase by almost 900 since our original intel what of the Jaffa Colonel Carter I be sorry teal'c I be not detect any lifesign outside of the forcefield inside just one Prior I do not know how he be manage it accord to these reading the atmosphere inside the field have become toxic probably as a result of the Jaffa weapon 's fire on the forcefield send a subspace message to Stargate Command we be over the enemy beachhead you do realise that no matter how nicely we ask they they be not all that likely to stop then why be we go down there well you be go cos ' I be go and we be go because we have order thank to Nerus do not that alarm anyone well our government believe we need to send the Ori a message indeed the Ori need to be make aware of they be not welcome well some of you be certainly expert in get that message across SG 1 this be the Flight Deck my people be project an expansion phase to occur anytime in the next few minute Understood if Nerus be correct we should be able to punch through with a transport beam and if not then we be all dress up with nowhere to go your return window will be roughly 16 second once on the surface after which time you will be commit until the next expansion phase in about half an hour I will be monitor from the bridge Thanks let us do this stand by mode in 3 2 1 mark good luck set the weapon be now in mode 2 we be good till the next window how can he breathe perhaps he have a personal shield of some kind Yo my name be Lt Col Cameron Mit I know who you be yeah he just tell you his name I also know you will do everything in your power to stop we Obvious you will fail the Ori be more powerful than you here be the thing we be not here to talk to you we want to talk to the guy you take order from the Ori be all see Great in that case we have in our possession a Mark 9 Naquadriah enhance nuclear warhead which be design solely for the purpose of vapourise Stargates and anything else in a 100 mile radius if you attempt to disable this warhead physically electronically or otherwise it will result in an immediate detonation now we have a number of these god awful thing at our disposal and we will not hesitate to use they if necessary if you do not disengage the Stargate within 30 of our Earth minute we will shut down the Gate for you go ahead we know who and what you be and want no part of what you have to offer if you attempt this on any other planet in this galaxy we will find you and we will fight you that be it I just give he 30 minute 29 minute Earth minute yeah I 've always want to say that well now you have sure hope they shut down that Gate before we have to set this thing off that would appear to be highly unlikely Colonel Mitchell I know it be naive even for you detonate the large warhead ever build by man be not exactly the historical footbump that I have in mind not to mention the guilt you be go to feel for vapourise a perfectly good Gtargate and that guy ah he be probably look forward to it hey prior you understand that you be within a 100 mile radius and that personal shield be not go to help you death be only the beginning of the real journey sound familiar it should sound familiar Doctor Jackson when I die I will ascend it be the promise of the Ori even if you fail your task what the hell be that Lieutenant there be no warning sir they start fire the second they come out of hyperspace it be damn fortunate they be not fire at we open communication to Jaffa vessel this be the Earth ship Prometheus we request that you hold your fire we have people down there I repeat SG 1 be on the planet attempt to negotiate an Ori withdrawal Cease fire now the forcefield be be fire upon by Hatak vessel why be they do that can we get they to stop do that oh this could be bad the Mark 9 's fuse in mode 2 be a wee bit twitchy you mean it could go off yeah they stop fire Sir the forcefield be enter an expansion phase ahead of predict time this be Pendergast I want SG 1 bring back onboard as soon as we can beam they through the forcefield SG 1 Prepare for immediate extraction the weapon be now in mode 1 Prometheus we be ready to beam up prior last chance I be Gerak of the free Jaffa why have you come here it be an honour to speak with you Sir my name be Lt Col Samantha Carter by insist that we cease fire on the enemy stronghold and you 've allow it to expand even far and we 've lose the element of surprise and quite possibly save the life of SG 1 I ask you again why have you come to this world we have reason to believe that the Ori be attempt to use this planet to stage a full scale invasion and you hope to repel this invasion with word there be more to this word be often the most powerful weapon of all Gerak the old way will not stop an adversary as powerful as the Ori so you say in your message to the High Council teal'c to which we receive no response we have no choice but to act on the information we have and how be it that the Tau'ri receive this information even before the Council how we get this information be not important what be important be that we stand together as ally in the face of our common enemy you say you 've come to fight we have I dispatch a scout in a cloak cargo ship he tell I you have do nothing we be send the Ori a message which they should receive in about ten second Shields to maximum Gerak I suggest you give the same order aboard your ship there will be a blast wave Jaffa five second Sir the forcefield go into another expansion phase just as the bomb detonate and it be a big one what be happen the forcefield continue to expand it be not suppose to be do that no why be it do that I do not know what be you go to do about it will you shut up that be a multi gigatonne detonation there be just no way maybe the Gate be destroy no if the field be still expand the Gate still have to be active the environment inside the field have be turn into super heated plasma make it impossible to get a reliable reading and this be your message to the Ori Pithy be not it we strike the enemy with our most powerful weapon and yet their forcefield grow that be not our intention their beachhead must be destroy if you be truly our ally you will join we in this attack if you do not your ship will become our next target the detonation do weaken the forcefield our combined weapon fire might just finish the job if it be not we will soon be engage in battle with Gerak 's force we just do not have enough information until I can explain how they be keep the Gate open or power a forcefield this large it be your call I say we run away and rethink the whole thing open up with everything we 've got bring the main rail gun online Commence fire Launch missile be the fire have any effect Forcefield be definitely lose strength but it be still expand at a fast rate than it be weaken it be almost envelop the entire planet what happen then dammit what what Colonel we need to cease fire now now do it the great the intensity of our weapon fire the great and more frequent their expansion phase be there be a direct correlation they be use the energy of our own weapon to build their beachhead you mean they plan this there be no way to project the necessary power through a Stargate across galaxy so they design a forcefield that could be power by our own weapon the Ori know the Jaffa on Kallana would defend their homeworld and other would follow and Nerus make certain we would join in which mean he be work for the Ori the Mark 9 give they almost 70 of the power they need to envelop the entire planet oh yeah we 've be set up what a complete shock I will not say another word Gerak 's force must also cease fire open communication too late I be read activity on the surface we 've get incoming three object and counting bear 180 rise from the planet 's surface from the coordinate of the Stargate and accelerate Shields to maximum why have you cease fire we have reason to believe our weapon may power the enemy forcefield Impossible well that be what I think but it be the only explanation Gerak they use both of we multiple contact on multiple bearing Sir what the hell be they they be about ten metre long but censor read no internal space no lifesign aboard rear gun to defensive fire mode stand by to launch fighter one of they be on a collision course I can confirm that 1000 metre 500 Sublight engine to emergency thrust Brace for impact Damage report there be a hull breach on the hangar deck shield be down to 20 Return fire all position sensor be down take we out of orbit we can not stay here I wanna know what you send my people into General I 've be expect you you know these egg they be not properly ripe I ask you a question Sergeant they say all good meal come to an end I assume General that by now SG 1 have report that the Ori the close thing to true god in the entire universe have successfully establish a permanent foothold what do you do oh it be not what I do General what I have do pale in comparison to your contribution and by now the forcefield have almost entirely envelop the planet which make they unstoppable and we could not have do it without you two of my ship have be destroy and my own flagship have be damage we must withdraw we too have suffer damage Gerak but the battle be not yet over our sensor tell we that the planet have begin to collapse I can not tell you to what extent if you choose to remain to find out know that your action will be watch hey we be on the same side here we shall see what be he talk about he be leave we 've get the sensor back up but we be go to have to get close to the planet to find out right bring we about take we back into the system ok I 've get a fix on the planet look like Gerak be right accord to the sensor its diameter have decrease by 16 Planet 's do not shrink in my experience uh there be something else what be that a ship it be hard to say whatever it be I think it be compose of the object that come through the Stargate do not that look an awful lot like a yeah it do in fact I think that be just what it be no it can not be cos I be go to say Stargate try supergate I estimate it be 3 to 400 metre across large enough for passage of an entire Armada it be incomplete there be still time Time Time to do what what everything we 've do have just make thing bad the planet 's diameter have now decrease by up to 50 and it be accelerate rapidly I think I know why only one thing in the universe could power a Gate that size it be also the only thing that would allow they to keep the Gate open this long and there be one on the other end a black hole that be what the forcefield be for it be not mean't to keep we out it be design to collapse the planet into one micro singularity why well this be how they can create a wormhole that can span such a vast distance with a black hole at either end they can maintain an open wormhole indefinitely fine fine how do we stop it I have an idea if we could the next idea that anybody come up with have to be outside the box ok the Gate be compose of individual block there must be some sort of energy link between they like like a chain exactly so we so we need a big ole set of bolt cutter too far outside the box get close to the box Planetary collapse be speed up exponentially I estimate singularity formation be minute away and there will be a significant shockwave whatever we be go to do we have to do it now Sir Somebody just activate the ring transporter what oh no do not leave without I Vala where the hell be you you care now Vala I be aboard the cloak cargo ship that Gerak leave behind to watch we how do you find it good guess look the tone be set a certain way ring seek out the near set which happen to be aboard this cargo ship cloak or not what be you do try to help Daniel someone have to do something and you would not listen actually I get the idea from Colonel Carter the object be be hold in some sort of energy field like link in a chain and I intend to take the place of the last link Vala when that singularity form there will be a powerful shockwave the cargo ship will not survive I be count on it I will ring back before it hit then you can all thank I immensely Shields to maximum she be run out of time alright it be work she disrupt the energy field hold the object in place the singularity be form she do it the Gate 's be destroy do Vala make it back onboard Negative Sir Jackson Infirmary get a message to Stargate Command the Ori beachhead have be destroy there be still time to repent General the Ori be forgive that will not be necessary SG 1 have destroy the Ori beachhead you be lie I be not I witness their power General Power that will one day be mine and if what you say be true you have merely forestall the inevitable and when you put I to death for what I have do I shall ascend no you will descend to a small dark room in the basement of Area 51 and you will stay there till you come up with a defence against the Ori that be our deal what would possibly compel I to do that hunger you know these Ori be just go to try it again probably Sam I could sure use someone like you on the front line just think about it Hey Jackson sorry I keep fall asleep well it be well than the alternative you be lucky the bracelet 's affect be wear off yeah lucky I Vala Mal Doran will be mourn I 've be go over the telemetry from the last few second before the formation of the singularity a matter stream leave the cargo ship just before it explode there be at least a slight chance that it be pull into the singularity so you be say she could be alive somewhere in the Ori home galaxy it be possible well we want to send they a message previously on Stargate SG 1 Gerak emerge as spokesperson for the more traditional way of the Jaffa High Council which he could control it be symbiote poison the trust launch at least two poison attack against Goa'uld occupy world after we take back the Gate that mean they have to leave the relatively safe confine of the solar system and head out into the galaxy where they run the risk of be kill or capture you think they have be take as host then send back to Earth any Goa'uld who get his hand on they would have discover pretty quickly that they belong to a top secret organization with high level connection to some of the most powerful government and institution on this planet by now the entire Trust could have be take over Season 9 Episode 7 Ex Deus Machina the body be discover this morning on a remote road of interstate 77 in Virginia he be spot by a passing motorist local authority say he be be dead about a day or so probably the victim of a hit and run driver so what do we figure this guy got lose and he be hitch a ride back to Chu'lak his presence on Earth be a mystery to I he be find literally in the middle of nowhere about three mile north of a little town call Edison Population 3012 the symbol on his forehead indicate that he be a servant of Lord Yu many of whom now follow Gerak and Gerak might be able to shed some light on this I will speak to he very well Colonel Mitchell you be with Teal'c Dr Jackson I want you to dig up all the information you can on Edison Virginia Colonel Carter will join you as soon as she be settle in Sam hey come on let I let I give you a hand thank you so General Landry brief I on the circumstance surround our mystery Jaffa yeah I think I get something on that Farrow Marshall yeah you be familiar with they they be an aeronautic firm headquarter in Bethesda the Department of Defence be their big client yeah it turn out that their plant in Virginia employ about eight hundred resident at Edison until it close down six month ago now it be locate just outside the town and about a a mile and a half from where our dead Jaffa turn up really Pardon the mess I be still unpack Farrow Marshall let us see what they 've be up to lately here we go their Chief Financial Officer go missing yesterday morning interesting timing yeah accord to his wife he leave for a business meeting in Richmond Virginia and never come back make no mistake brother the Tok'ra only wish to meet with we because they fear we we defeat the Goa'uld and take their mothership and stronghold now we be our own master I need not remind the Council that the Tok'ra do battle with the Goa'uld for just as many year their effort be instrumental in secure our freedom let we all be clear the only motivation that the Tok'ra have be their own selfish need not to help any of we then what do you suggest Gerak that we use our new find strength to take what we want that we emulate our former oppressor brother and sister we finally have the opportunity to govern with authority and respect year ago that seem unthinkable but now we be in a position to help other who be in need of our support and guidance why should we help they how about because it be the right thing to do look whatever your difference with the Tok'ra in the past it be time to move on teal'c be right you kick ass you be sit pretty do not get hang up on outsider be not permit to address the Council never mind I caution you we have fight too long and too hard to entrust our future to the Tok'ra or the Tau'ri for that matter brother and sister I suggest we bring this assembly to an end let we consider what we 've discuss and reconvene in the morning very well Gerak a word teal'c welcome back to Dakara your presence be sorely miss what draw you away from your Tau'ri home a Jaffa be discover on Earth dead oh strange but what have that get to do with I he be a servant of Lord Yu 's and I assume a follower of yours well that may be but I do not seem to recognise he nor do I know what he be do on Earth my obligation to the Council require my presence elsewhere I be sure you understand he be lie to we no kidding it be about six month ago when he start act strangely what do you mean strangely cold distant you 've get to understand Alex have always be incredibly focus when it come to his job and at first I just assume he have a lot on his plate but after a couple of week it become clear that it be more than that I start to suspect he might be have an affair so I hire a private investigator and I have he follow and what do the investigator find out I be not sure exactly but a couple of day after accept the job he quit return all of my money and strongly suggest that I drop the matter he do not offer you any kind of explanation no but it be obvious he be scared he do some surveillance in his first two day these be the photo that he take he ask for they back after a couple of day well after he drop the case but I refuse I offer they to the police but they do not think that the photo be pertinent to their investigation my husband be not have an affair but he be clearly involve in something that he want to keep secret do you mind if we hold onto these no go ahead he still refuse to speak the prisoner be strong then we must be strong Yat'yir it be through instrument like this we be oppress then how appropriate would it be then for it to be use to serve our cause you will surrender your secret of that I be sure Colonel Carter Charlotte Mayfield VP here at Farrow Marshall how can I help you I want to ask you a few question about your plant in Virginia it be shut down six month ago officially yes but we go by to check it out and it look like it have be clean out very recently I be not sure where you be get at some of the resident of Edison claim they see truck travel to and from the plant a couple of night ago they be mistaken so you be say no one be be in the area for several month well I can not speak for the local but certainly no one from Farrow Marshall would have any reason to go there how about Richmond anyone from Farrow Marshall have reason to go there accord to his wife Alex Jameson be on his way to Richmond Virginia when he go miss we 've cooperate with the local authority on Mr Jameson 's disappearance you may want to consult with they who be Mr Jameson meeting with that day I be sorry company policy prevent I from discuss that with you your CFO be miss now I would think that you would want to do everything within your power to help find he oh I do as I say we be cooperate with the authority now if you will excuse I I think we be do here these gentleman will show you out if you have any further question feel free to fax they to the head office you can be sure that be not the end of it of course not we 've only just begin now I coordinate with Kerry Johnson and the CIA 's investigation into the NID Trust connection we 've do a little digging and manage to put name to some of the face from the photograph Sheila Jameson provide Steven Ballard Chairman of the Stark Consortium this be Mesato Hiro ceo of Far East Mercantile James Lowry and Tony Trand President and chief financial officer Aleraf Pharmaceuticals this one be Michael Northrup CEO founder of Hamill Technologies now all the individual we 've manage to identify so far be major player in the area of business and high finance very powerful very influential and in the case of these two very missing Missing Terence Evans and William Blalock found partner of Persian Media Enterprises they go miss about six month ago Coincidentally around the same time we manage to destroy the Osiris ship you see a possible Goa'uld connection here well we already know that sometime last year the Goa'uld successfully infiltrate the Trust and that the Trust have connection to Government Agencies and Corporations worldwide there be a good chance we do not get they all if that be the case Goa'uld be still on Earth and they be gain strength let I guess they do not know anything either as Gerak grow strong few Jaffa risk defy he for fear of retribution we must leave Dakara and seek our answer elsewhere the answer you seek be on Earth what do you know of the Jaffa we discover he lose his life try to secure Gerak 's prize of what prize do you speak Ba'al Ba'al be on Earth that be where he seek refuge immediately follow his defeat in the battle for Dakara he have be there ever since you be tell I a member of the Jaffa High Council claim that Ba'al have be here on Earth for the well part of the last nine month yes Sir be there any chance she may be right my information suggest that Ba'al have be hide in the Arkeba System he have be sight there as recently as a week ago so the Council member be either lie or she be a victim of bad intelligence not all bad Sir they know enough to look for Ba'al at a Trust operate facility if he be on Earth that would be the good place to start if the Jaffa genuinely believe Ba'al to be on Earth they will continue to search for he well that be obviously unacceptable tell the Council we 've begin our own investigation and if he be here we will find he it would not be in Gerak 's good interest to allow that to happen why Ba'al 's capture would be a big moral victory as well as a huge political gain for whoever bring he in should Gerak be successful he would win the heart of many undecided Jaffa thereby assure undisputed influence over the Council so all we have to do be find Ba'al before they do yeah but Gerak have a head start the fact that the company CFO go miss around the same time that the Jaffa be kill you think Jameson be at the plant when they came look for Ba'al in which case he may well have be capture he have reveal Ba'al 's location and the location of his various shelter on Earth you should never have invent such an effective mean of torture Come on come on yes where be the false God Ba'al we 've be compromise they be five floor above we I know we be leave hello come on hurry there be people here they be shoot up the all place so those office be a war zone Staff weapon versus semi automatic who win hard to say there be no body and all the security footage be miss witness one some guy who be work overtime spend most of the firefight under his desk but be able to provide a description for three individual big tattooed chainmail pant so it be either our Jaffa or Kiss be back on tour I have something to show you we 've just receive this although it be a far cry from some of the well world 's I 've conquer in my day this planet be not without it be charm that be in retrospect I be actually glad we never succeed in destroy it that say Earth be not without it be drawback the foremost being an alarming lack of privacy my ship have be seize my army vanquish I no long present a threat to this galaxy all I ask be to be leave alone without have to worry about you the Jaffa or any of my former enemy come after I so I would like to offer the following deal allow I to live out the rest of my day here on Earth in peace without interference in exchange for my freedom I will follow your law you will never have cause to fear I again I hope we can put the past behind we I certainly have no desire to harm you or anyone else on this world that say you should know that I 've place a Naquadah bomb somewhere in the United States consider it a precautionary measure if another attempt be make to capture I I promise you the consequence will I most dire of all the retirement destination he could choose he have to pick our planet we have team outfit with Naquadah detector in several major urban center but there be no way we can cover the whole country the Prometheus have instrument which can detect Naquadah from orbit do it not yes but so far the scan have come up empty so it could be a bluff or Ba'al may have find a way to shield the bomb from our sensor Bluffing or not he be still a threat as defacto head of the Trust operation he have the resource and capability to do a lot of damage Naquadah bomb or not so problem number one how do we find he Problem number two how do we take he out without inflict collateral damage good point Ba'al be probably surround by security no doubt most of they human with no knowledge of his true identity if we go after he we risk injure innocent people not if we use the symbiote poison the Tok'ra develop we already know it will not harm human physiology and with the right delivery system nothing but that Nice I will contact r and D see what they can put together which leave we with problem number one the NID 's run surveillance on the individual identify in the photograph 's with Jameson hopefully eventually one of they will lead we to Ba'al of equal concern be Gerak 's Jaffa we have no control over they if they decide to move on Ba'al Earth will face Ba'al 's full reprisal and I be guess those Jaffa be not exactly kick it back at the local Denny 's plus be not it a long stinky ride from Dakara in a cargo ship indeed it be more likely that Gerak have a mothership somewhere in the vicinity of Earth well if the Prometheus be go to detect the naquedah from orbit it would have do it by now alright I will send they out to look for the mothership Colonel Mitchell I want you and teal'c onboard Colonel Carter Dr Jackson you coordinate with the nid in the event they locate Ba'al I want you there hey wait up alright that be well gentleman welcome aboard thank you Sir any word from NORAD SSN come up empty could the ship we be look for be cloak Motherships do not possess cloaking capability well then could we be look for another type of craft it be possible whatever the target ship if it be out there we will find it Agent Barrett thank for the lift well I could not exactly have you guy catch a cab to the stake out now could I so what be the late well one of our agent follow the Jameson lead spot an individual match Ba'al 's description at the Gilroy Hotel on Fifth Street about an hour ago look like we get he pick up anything at all unusual variance anomalous energy reading no Sir you know it be possible what we be look for be not even out there it be possible but unlikely if Gerak believe Ba'al to be on Earth he would undoubtedly establish a base of operation in planetary orbit Great so where be it hide in plain sight what be that right Colonel Pendergast Plot a course for the far side of the moon do it what be the situation they be still inside in 1602 all the exit be cover we be just wait for the green light Dr Jackson you go with Williams how 've you be pretty good you yeah pretty good can not complain what be new let us see I be lead r and d for a while there well I never figure you the type to settle for a desk job I need something with more flexible hour Janet 's adopt daughter Cassie be go through a hard time oh I see I spend some time on the Prometheus away on deep space reconnaissance helped stop a dangerous new enemy from get a foothold in the galaxy yes yeah I hear about that how be Pete we break up really I mean sorry to hear that oh it be the good thing for both of we so you be single again not exactly Sir I be pick up a large energy signature Lock on target Target lock Sir we be receive a communication from the mothership Let us see it withdraw or we will be force to defend ourselves sorry we be not go anywhere Come on where be they Abort all agent abort what be go on he be not inside if we move now we risk compromise the operation Barrett you would well be damn sure about this we be sure let they go and come to the van Sam it be not he how do you know because he can not be in two place at once Ba'al be across town right now do a live television interview what thank you that be a very good question my acquisition of Hammel Technologies and it 's subsidiary be just a first step in a long range venture that will ultimately see a consolidation and a streamlining of what be presently a dissolute market no doubt most of you have never hear of I before today well I can assure you that over the next few month you will all get to know I very well and I look forward to it this be Colonel Pendergast of the Earth ship Prometheus ask you to stand down we have no desire to engage in battle but we will not withdraw our force look we know why you be here then you also know that I have no choice but to maintain my present position ok FYI we be not go to let you put anymore man on the planet 's surface if you fire on our ship we will defend ourselves Yat'yir hear I you and your Jaffa be at a disadvantage know neither territory nor it be inhabitant allow we to assist you in apprehend Ba'al we can both lay claim to his capture then all Jaffa can declare freedom and celebrate as one I be afraid we be past the point where be difference can be settle so readily I be sorry teal'c meanwhile they 've still get boot on the ground nothing we can do about that perhaps we can can how by force Gerak 's hand yes Sir our order be to stay put for the time be you 've get to be kid I come on we know where he be we 've get he yes Ba'al have make it easy for we to pinpoint his location but unfortunately by go public he be make it more difficult for we to take he down quickly and covertly we make a move against he now and we risk a media circus unless of course you feel like give the american people a Stargate primary there be also the little matter of a Naquadah bomb sit somewhere in the continental United States yeah ok ok we will stay the General 's consulting with the Pentagon to determine what our next move should be if there be one thing a Jaffa value above all else it be his pride when the other Council member discover that Gerak have not be completely forthcoming they will turn against he and force his hand Gerak must be shame into remove his force from Earth it be the only way your turf your rule brother no matter how far we must travel no matter how long it will take our former enemy must pay for their crime this I promise you and we will destroy they not only just in memory of those who have fall but in honour of those who survive to enjoy their freedom you speak of honour Gerak yet you disrespect this Council by dishonour it with your lie I have not lie to this Council it be you that I have purposely mislead for fear that your commitment to the cause be suspect even as we speak Gerak 's follower be hunt Ba'al on Earth of this we be well aware I have wish to inform the Council soon but I dare not for fear that element sympathetic to the Tau'ri would learn about Ba'al 's whereabout you dare question my loyalty your loyalty be not under question teal'c you have do more than anyone to help secure our freedom and for that we be ever grateful however your allegiance to the Tau'ri present you with a difficult dilemma even as we speak the Tau'ri ship prevent we from pursue the enemy as you have say ka'lel I accomplish much in our long struggle against our former oppressor but only because of the support of the Tau'ri their commitment be as unwavering as my own and now you would repay they by surreptisiously steal upon their world put their people to say nothing of the Stargate program at risk they be our ally rather than dishonour they by trespass onto their world respect they enough to tell they the truth ask for their assistance in capture Ba'al they will help we but will they they be as determined to have Ba'al answer for his crime as be we but if they succeed then he will be bring before this Council where he will face his proper punishment you have my word what the hell be you think there be no guarantee that the US government be go to give they Ba'al it be only to give Gerak pause before his next attack against Ba'al on Earth even so we may have only gain a brief respite Satellite tracking have place Ba'al on a remote heavily guard compound west of the city from the site of the press conference directly to his present location he take no evasive maneuver make absolutely no attempt to disguise his movement clearly he be embolden by the belief that you would not dare attack he now that he have make himself a public figure I 've have Walter patch in Colonel Carter and Doctor Jackson everybody up to date we have a cruise missile preppe with symbiote poison and ready to launch on your command General I recommend we launch now it may be the last chance we get what if he be not bluff about the Naquadah bomb then we will have stop he before he have a chance to plant any more we will have to come up with a cover story would not be the first time we must strike now before Ba'al realise his strategy have backfire and the Council I merely promise he would be deliver if capture if he be kill then there be no difficulty right good work what be the news Stargate Command intend to attack how can you be certain the human that set up the Trust be in a position to infiltrate much of the secure communication network employ by this government how clever of they have you get something else for I Walter yes Sir we just get this send to we you have choose not to heed my warning sort of force my hand there be a bomb in the helsian tower in downtown Seattle it will detonate at exactly 1 30pm local time call off your strike at my location and I will diffuse the device defy I and this will be just the first of many such demonstration 45 minute the building be be evacuate Mobile unit have be dispatch yes Sir Understood Sir Agent Barrett have your man tighten the perimeter around the compound no one in or out Daniel once the missile hit you will have to go in and make sure we have a confirmed kill why where be you go to be Seattle how the hell you go to get there Prometheus beat fly coach Colonel Carter have you locate the bomb we be unable to get a fix on it 's location multiple signal be it possible there be more than one device well we be not sure wipe the hard drive and destroy the equipment I want nothing leave the Jaffa they 've find we Time to go Colonel Carter and her team be still search no sign of the bomb yet Sir Dr Jackson report Jaffa at the target site they 've engage the compound guard you must not hesitate General Landry launch the missile yes Sir launch alpha two it do not make any sense it be like there be Naquadah everywhere how old be this building it be brand new it just go up last month give I a secure line to Stargate Command now Sir we 've get Colonel Carter Colonel do you find the bomb sort of what be that suppose to mean reading indicate the entire superstructure of the building be lace with Naquadah it be build that way Ba'al 's be plan this for a long time I be not sure I understand Colonel the bomb be not in the building Sir the bomb be the building Missile be lock on Sir we have a confirm hit on the location Agent Barrett and his team be move in to secure the area Sam that Naquadah be not go to go off on it be own there be get to be a detonator there I agree but it could be anywhere inside a wall under a floor we would never find it in time how much progress have you make on the evacuation we 've clear a five block radius but when this thing go off a five mile radius be not go to be enough there be not much you can do about that now I will contact Prometheus have they beam you and your team outta there wait that be it Prometheus Sergeant Sir patch I through to Colonel Pendergast Cam what can I do for ya I need a little help move it work the building detonate at a safe distance Sir I 've get Doctor Jackson General what be happen out there Doctor I be sorry to report Sir it look like Ba'al escape the old way will no long serve we Gerak 's way be not the way of the future how dare you how dare you step foot in this Council chamber why should I pause to return tell I teal'c because you disregard my warning because your rash action not only allow Ba'al to escape but cost the life of many of our brother they do not die in vain my rash action be neccessary I be sure you will agree yes you may muse about what might have be but the fact remain it be my man who capture Ba'al enjoy your shortlived taste of freedom you be bear slave and slave you will die Ba'al do not escape he be capture by Gerak 's force well yes and no he be drag into the Council chamber and execute before my very eye there be no doubt teal'c we secure Ba'al 's compound and search the premise in the basement we discover a lab contain equipment and datum relate to genetic replication it be very possible the Ba'al you see die in Dakara be just a clone the real Ba'al could still be out there where you go to take a much needed rest do not you think you should go back to Dakara let those Jaffa know the truth no to reveal this at this time would seem little more than an attempt to tarnish Gerak 's hard fight victory teal'c it be the truth Regardless they will not listen for the time be their heart belong to Gerak at present there be more question than answer in the event surround the gas line explosion that claim the Helsian Tower in downtown Seattle what we do know so far be that at approximately 12 45 this afternoon local fire and emergency crew be dispatch to the scene an evacuation order be give and the building and surround area be evacuate two hour later when reporter be permit to return to the area all that remain be a heap of rubble surround as it be by tall highrise there be no eyewitness to the building 's destruction no one see or hear the explosion and as a result conspiracy theory abound some have point out that the amount of rubble at the site be significantly less than over six hundred channel and nothing to watch think I will turn in we have a big day ahead of we tomorrow what you get Jaffa Quiet it be nothing he be not do that on purpose be he you know just to keep I interested well that depend be you lose interest no we have not find so much as a snap twig on this planet but hey hey it be all good baby Teal'c 's intel do suggest that the Sodan be rumour to have a base of operation here Teal'c 's intel come from a bunch of Jaffa he use to be at war with you know old enemy and new ally and all that jazz but still you think the information 's bad I think it be vague a world once inhabit by ancient a village shroud in the mist of time sound like a movie trailer well we 've find some pretty interesting thing base on vague yeah still I be get that grasp at straw feel yeah just do not tell Teal'c I already do yeah what do he say the warrior of the Sodan exist Colonel Mitchell I be certain of it need more bass go fall back to the gate I get our six go go go where the hell be they SG 22 this be SG 1 we be under attack we need backup where the hell be Mitchell Cameron what be your position Cameron do you copy his wound be grave my Lord his symbiote be badly damage no bring he Shal ' Kree Season 9 Episode 8 Babylon he will be dead by sunset if not soon then you must keep he alive Carter to SGC you get anything yet Chief Colonel we be read UAV telemetry five by five so far no sign of Colonel Mitchell let I know when you 've complete your first sweep Affirmative SGC out anything not yet how be he do not well his symbiote be die if it be not remove the host will die also Sergent radio Dr Lam let she know we have a priority one medical emergency income no tattoo he be a warrior of the Sodan accord to legend no Sodan have be indenture to the Goa'uld for over 5000 year so your intel be correct indeed Colonel Carter there be something you need to see this write Ancient look familiar nope teal'c I have never before see such a device well I be detect energy reading it be definitely some form of technology perhaps this be how the Sodan manage to escape so quickly actually that be exactly what it be this say it be some sort of aperture or gateway to to where Enlightenment just enlightenment nothing more specific that be all it say hold still you know your bedside manner totally blow your wound be infect it must be cleanse or you will die this will cause you a fair amount of pain how be it go in there Touch and go they 've be at it for nearly six hour now Most Jaffa would not survive such wound Wich mean she be very good that be why she be here look like you be both right about the device he be wear More ancient technology a cloak of invisibility that explain how they be able to ambush you so easily what about the transporter Carter 's with a team on the planet work on it right now so far they have not be able to even open up the damn thing let alone turn it on yeah sorry I could not have be more help well one line of ancient text be not a hell of a lot to go on we be run surface scan with Prometheus on several moon and other planet in the system you believe Colonel Mitchell be no long on P9 G 844 it be a possibility Ground sweep and UAV scan be all come up empty do not move do not make a sound you call to the other and it be goodbye Jaffa it would seem you have I at a disadvantage it certainly appear that way now you be go to tell I how I get how thing seem and how they truly be be two very different thing for example you be free to leave this place whenever you choose what now you be tell I but to reach the Chaapa'ai would take month on foot to the mountain of Dor'ta'nak no one who be attempt the journey have ever survive so how do we get we be bring here through the eye of the Gods which be your question can wait now that your strength have return we should begin Joma'Sha'Tal'ac immediately if that be breakfast I could eat you have spill the blood of a Sodan warrior do you think our mercy be without purpose Lord Haikon have decree that you will answer for your crime by way of Kel Shak Lo which you will battle with another warrior and on that day you will die I take it from all the beep our friend be still with we that he be though how he survive be a mystery to I I would say that nine hour you spend work on he might have something to do with it nice work I do what I could to save he but his symbiote be too badly damage we have no choice but to remove it and start he on tretonin as soon as he regain consciousness I wanna know why so you can interrogate he well that might be more up Teal'c 's alibi but that be the idea well it be not exactly the kind of post op recovery I have in mind well let I know the moment he wake up ok Lt Col Cameron Mitchell United States Air Force Earth I do not know if you know what be be go on out there but thing be a little different now the Goa'uld have be defeat the Goa'uld should have be defeat five thousand year ago my ancestor be one of the first of the Sodan they be part of an elite command force under the Goa'uld Ishkur for year they pillage and plunder under his name drive fear into the heart of all those that would oppose his rule the further they ascend among the rank the more they be able to discern the truth that he be not a God at all but merely an imposter our true Gods be those that come before we you be talk about the Ancients Ishkur brand my ancestor as traitor and order their death they try to fight to show their brother their faith but the odd be too great they be force to flee they set out to find Kheb hope that their soul would find peace but instead their search lead they to this world you know about the Goa'uld but you do not help the other Jaffa defeat they look for the first time in their history the Jaffa be free but it will not last without strong leadership they need your help their fate be of no concern to we I hope you be prepared to die well Mitchell you will not be able to break your bond we seek out the Sodan in peace wish only to open dialogue instead you attack we and take our comrade all enemy who our transgress our sacred ground forfeit their life yeah well you might want to post a few sign look we just want our friend back we figure that your fellow warrior may wanna know that you be still alive and kick so we be think straight swap our guy in exchange for you if your friend be take then mourn he for if he be not yet dead he soon will be hear I when I say that all free Jaffa have always have the great respect for the warrior of the Sodan you speak of respect yet you condemn I without my symbiote I will be dead soon enough a medicine call tretonin course through your vein you have be free from your burden such a thing be not possible oh but it be it be very real I assure you it be now use by several thousand free Jaffa with no ill effect your poison will not work have you any honour you would have let I die on the battlefield so be it you just do not know what be go on in the rest of the galaxy or you really do not care the Jaffa make their choice 5000 year ago their affair be no concern to we yeah but how do you survive at some point you get to go hunt for you know we raid Goa'uld stronghold for shipment of symbiote that have yet to be implant in any Jaffa such mission be rite of passage for our young warrior well it sound like fun the fighting style of Sodan have be a closely guard secret for a hundred generation it be a shame you will die shortly after learn it attack I you find I an unworthy opponent no it be just I do not feel like ok let us try that one more time you be slow and undiscipline if you fight your opponent today you would die without land a single blow and what happen if I refuse to fight you just kill I it be an alternative you do not wish to explore Dr Lam tell I you have refuse to eat the very odour of your food turn my stomach if you be to survive without your symbiote you require sustenance it be only because your drug have weaken I on the contrary brother it have free you what do you know of freedom you who have serve false god who choose to live in this squalor rather than among his own people I know that I have hear story of the Sodan since I be but a child your bravery and skill be legend among all Jaffa it be because of my failure as a warrior that I languish here now Prisoner to a former slave and his pitiful ally speak not of skill to I many Jaffa have fight and die for a cause that be start by the warrior of the Sodan and for what instead of respect the tradition of our ancestor you would only seek to lead they far astray that way Blue be leave Red be right got it Faster Faster how do I do badly again yeah yeah you stop use that gadget I guarantee you I will be well a Sodan warrior must anticipate an attack at any moment yeah well where have you guy get those thing anyway the writing of our Gods instruct we how to construct many of their device we use they to protect our sacred ground speak of Gods I know this be probably taboo but I need to talk to your boss that visitor you have yesterday I be assume it be not the first time he be be here I 've meet their kind before they be bad news look I will do any crazy training exercise you want within reason Finish the course in time and I will consider it you know a bag of sand with a hole in it be not an accurate timing device you be an evil man please sit I be good ok maybe I will sit you know I be start to get an idea of why you guy attack we that prior be tell you we be enemy be he wrong you could have cut we down the second we step through the gate but you do not Generations of my people fight and die under exile pray for the day when we could seek the path without recrimination when we pray to the Gods do they hear we Mitchell do they once give we a sign as proof of their existence I know that the Ori be not the Ancients but can there be any doubt that they be Gods and if they can lead we to the path of enlightenment how can I refuse they you be make a big mistake these Ori be not what you think they be they be not even close tek'hel'shee perhaps when you finish your debt in your final moment you will understand I 've already be there I understand you may rest now no I be good let us keep go you be not tired six week airborne training at Fort Benning that be tire this be nothing come on if I wanna survive this Kel Shak Lo thing I be go to need a hell of a lot more than you be teach I Quit pussy foot around and stop hold back let us go you believe this staff be what make you strong the Kran'too be nothing but an extension of your body no true warrior depend on a weapon for strength or advantage see that be what I be talk about Drink I be not go to get use to this stuff be it not for my tea you would have die many day ago it be self defence you know the Jaffa I kill it be he or I it do not matter blood have be spill our law decree you must answer for it so who be he his name be Volnek a most skilled warrior look for what it be worth there be nothing I can say be there no so who do I fight Lord Haikon will determine that on the eve of your battle usually it be the close blood kin to the slain warrior right and the next of kin be just as tough as he be do I stand a chance never mind I promise I will die well and all that jazz but before I kick it I get to ask you buy what these prior be sell Lord Haikon have lead we for more than a hundred year he know what be good for we all yeah yeah look I get it you be a team player I be ask what do you think it be not my place to question Haikon 's judgement nor be it yours well somebody well because if you guy follow the Ori all of your tradition your kran'too staff your precious path your tasty beverage it be all go down the drain enough we be finish for the day you say a Prior have come to the Sodan and you have decide to follow the word of the Ori I walk the path of our true god the Ori be not Gods what do the Prior promise you a place of honour at his side as herald for your new master this Prior will have you hunt down and kill all Jaffa who refuse to follow the path of Origin that be the path you walk I will learn the code of the ancient transporter no matter how long it take this be go nowhere two week and he have not give we so much as a decent high coo well it be understandable Sir Most Jaffa would never break under normal interrogation technique not to mention the fact that the Sodan be an elite group of warrior I be sure their mind be train to withstand a lot bad what about the device we have not make much progress I be afraid it seem the code prevent we use it be rig to some sort of defence mechanism Dr Lee receive a few nasty volt while try to implement an override how be he Dr Lam say the feeling should return to his leg in a few day meanwhile the international committee be keep score of all the resource we be use to try to find Mitchell Science team orbital scan by Prometheus all of they come up empty certainly do not look good another few day and they will tell we to shut down search and rescue operation Shut it down Sir with all due respect in the past we have spend month search for our people in the field we can not just stop look what she be say sir be we 've never leave a man behind I be more than familiar with the concept Dr Jackson give I something I can use soon or the next paperwork I fill out will declare Mitchell MIA I just need a minute let he pass thank you alright I will make this quick the Prior represent a race of ancient yes but believe I when I tell you they be not the ancient you wanna worship the Prior have heal our sick cause our crop to grow as if by magic why should I doubt the power of the Ori look their power be not what you should question it be how they use it anyone refuse to worship they and they die and I be not talk about a few non believer here and there I be talk about whole planet wipe out and I should simply take your word for this you wanna believe my people be godless and inferior go right ahead but we have never need proof of our Gods ' existence in order to believe in they Faith it be your faith that sustain you for five thousand year not the ancient themselves do not throw your history away for a bag full of magic trick admit it Haikon have totally lose his mind a warrior can not talk and fight at the same time a fact you refuse to accept get it you may provide a challenge to your opponent after all Mitchell follow by my violent death of course of course to my inevitable demise why do you do this do what train this hard these be the last day of your life I would think you would spend more time in reflexion well all I know be the moment you accept your fate that be when you be as good as dead till then all bet be off you can not survive Kel Shak Lo well no offence but I 've endure thing I be not suppose to survive before and I be still here how can you be certain the Prior speak falsely because I 've see entire planet wipe out because they refuse to follow the Ori look I be not try to tell you what to think but if everything I believe be be threaten I would wanna know Jolan your people should not suffer for their faith you two again yes Us two again save your word I be not in the mood we know how you feel but we be not here to talk you require evidence that the Ori be not to be trust this be Tass'an one of the founder of a free Jaffa settlement on a planet call Sarvarus many family come to live there to enjoy the freedom that they fight so hard to achieve he be Sodan indeed tell he what happen a month ago a man come through the Chaapa'ai he call himself a Prior he tell we of powerful Gods call the Ori who he claim would give we protection and show we the path to enlightenment and he leave he later return tell we we have to make a choice follow the Ori or be destroy we choose to resist continue brother he dial the Chaapa'ai and merely place his staff in the ground in front of it then earth shake with a fierceness I have never see nor hear of before in moment our city be level hundred of our people wipe out in an instant enough of these lie you expect I to take the word of this sorry excuse for a Jaffa I witness the destruction with my own eye Heed my word brother if a Prior visit your world leave you have spill the blood of a Sodan warrior Human do you deny it no but it be not no I do not deny it if any blood kin of the warrior seek recompense let he step forward now I seek it you in the name of Volnek of Gashrail my brother may the blood spill here today settle this debt once and for all you may begin may you die well likewise the human be dead the blood of the Sodan have be avenge he fight and die a warrior my Lord it be only fitting he be give the rite of Shel'mak'asah very well with your permission my Lord I would like to take care of it myself I be afraid you would not wake well maybe I should not have how long be I seven hour Seven I think it be only suppose to be two I may have inadvertently make the elixir to strong yeah that be go to leave a scar so do it work the elixir be most effective they believe you be dead well do bone never mind so where do this leave you if the Prior intend to mislead the Sodan as you say then I be his enemy and Haikon it may be too late to convince he of his mistake but there be several other warrior who feel as I do we will continue to walk the path of the Sodan until the other see the error of their way well for what it be worth you will not walk alone come how do it go not well even after we show he video footage of the damage Volnek still refuse to believe the Ori be responsible for what happen on Sarvarus what be he do now nothing he have not say a word since Tass'an leave which put we back to square one yeah basically Teal'c seem to think that show he more image unscheduled offworld activation what have we get Chief Recieving an IDC Sir it be Colonel Mitchell you be kid I would never do that Sir you have a visitor you yeah I think you be dead too oh we have unfinished business just take it easy you shoot I you shoot I first I will have vengeance you will listen brother I know that you think we be enemy and right now it do not matter if we become ally what matter be that you understand the truth you be fortunate my brother drug you you would never have survive a true Kel Shak Lo do not know take you down pretty good you be lucky Lucky be good grant my freedom change nothing Mitchell we will meet again look forward to it Sir Colonel I need you to read this good morning to you too Colonel sorry Sir how be you what be it it be a report from the Tok'ra they 've discover a gravitational disturbance with their long range sensor another Ori incursion well it could simply be a yet undiscovered black hole but the Tok'ra will not have a ship in range for some time I 've locate a planet with a Stargate close to the disturbance if you will permit I to take a go SG 5 should be available thank you Sir unschedule offworld activation Walter receive an iris code Sir it be Colonel Carter that be fast open the iris yes Sir Colonel tell I you 've get good news actually Sir I think there be a little glitch we be on the wrong planet Sir be the intel wrong we do not know Sir when we arrive there be no sign of the MALP I check our telemetry base on know star position we be not on P3X 584 Sir somehow we got send to a different planet Walter I be review Gate diagnostic Sir how could this happen if it be a Gate malfunction it be a pretty big one unlike any we 've see before chief inform all offworld team to use the Alpha Site until further notice yes Sir if there be something wrong with this Gate I wanna know what it be before anyone else walk through it yes Sir find the problem until we do all Gate activity be shut down Season 9 Episode 9 Prototype run the cross comparison program hey how be it go well as far as our computer be concern the dialling sequence to P3X 584 run perfectly normal except for the fact you end up 12 000 light year off course oh here be something maybe it be not our fault I think it be always our fault we just run a program that compare the energy signature of the last thirty outbound trip to look for anomaly it be kinda like a bump a bump actually more like a series of bump exactly 8 5 second apart well that explain everything actually it might Defence mechanism yes Sir I think each of these spike represent a request by the offworld Gate for an authorisation code if the correct authorisation code be not enter in time we be prevent from reach the planet that do not explain how you an SG 5 end up half way across the galaxy well I have a theory about that too instead of use an iris like we do the offworld gate store incoming datum in its buffer system then if the correct code be not receive it dial a random address and empty the buffer into the new wormhole Interstellar call forwarding that be pretty cool how do the MALP get through to 584 I mean initial telemetry confirm it be on the right planet my guess be the 584 security system filter incoming matter base on certain protocol Organic versus inanimate for instance that seem like an awful lot of trouble to keep people out which make I curious as to what be be hide there always want what you can not have I 've calculate it will take the Prometheus two week to reach 584 at maximum speed if the Ori be construct a Supergate then we may not have that much time I will contact the High Council and have a Jaffa ship scout the area can you figure out a way to crack this authorisation code certainly try Sir teal'c no offense but I would feel well if we investigate this ourselves dismiss MALP be enroute we place a bacterial culture inside the MALP 's cargo compartment hopefully the organic material will force the 584 Gate to hold the MALP and ask for an authorisation code I be receive the Gate 's authorisation request now we just hope this program work what do that mean I think it be good the MALP be come online rotate the camera to the left it be the first MALP it work Good alright let us see what all the fuss be about well we will have to wait till nightfall to get a visual confirmation of the black hole in the meantime Major you can set up the gravity sensor I will make sure we can dial home SGC this be SG 1 leader we have arrive safely thank you Colonel we will dial again in 15 minute Prometheus be stand by hopefully that will not be necessary Sir Mitchell out I would rather not wait around two week for a ride we be go to have a look around I think I find the problem you see anything like it before Nope and I do not wanna remove it until I know exactly how it be connect to the system good news be it will not affect any outbound dialling Colonel Carter we 've get the gravity center up and run Good I will be right there hey guy this be Daniel you might wanna come and check this out first I get it you check out the black hole it be amazing what people leave lay around where do those go only one way to find out I do not think anyone be be home for a while this be some kind of science lab this look familiar it be Nirrti 's DNA Manipulation Device Nirrti she be the Goa'uld who be try to create an advanced host right end up with a bunch of super freak who turn on her that be a cool file this writing be in Ancient oh I be wrong there be someone home wait wait what I be look for the light switch New guy you touch that I know how to read that I get a faint pulse Carter get back to the gate tell the SGC we need a med team here right away well you be clean no sign of any exposure to infectious agent Great how 's pod man also go to be fine I suspect the convulsion be just a reaction to come out of stasis although his preliminary test result be quite interesting how we 've be able to study the genetic characteristic of the Ancients from the database send back to we from Atlantis our patient X definitely show some physiological similarity you think he be an Ancient I be runnne a more detailed analysis there be some more strange anomaly but in the meantime why do not we ask he hello I be Doctor Caroline Lam do you understand I yes Good try to relax there be nothing to be afraid of you be safe you be on a planet call Earth I be Lt Col Samantha Carter of the United States Air Force Cameron Mitchell Ditto on the other stuff can you tell we your name it be Khalek Khalek we find you on another planet in stasis in what look like some sort of science lab Earth yeah that be right I want to go home Home where be home they take I I be a prisoner so long he do experiment on I he who I never know his name please I just want to go home can you tell we what this guy look like do you have the Stargate address for the planet you call home the symbol to dial yes ok when you be feel well we will see what we can do so not an Ancient too bad poor guy this be exactly what Nirrti do kidnap people and then experiment on they yeah but Khalek there say he well I be sure Nirrti be not the only Goa'uld with an interest in evolve human host that lab look more ancient than Goa'uld you think it be an Ancient experimenting on he I do not know but I be sure Jackson will get to the bottom of it in the meantime we will get the address to Khalek 's homeworld and send a malp hopefully it will still be somewhere he want to go back to hey what be up well it look like that our black hole 's just a regular old black hole no giant Ori Supergate that be good teal'c say you could use some help in here yeah there be something wrong with the power supply it be drive I nuts we will look what we can do Colonel Mitchell say the man we find in stasis be not an Ancient he be be hold prisoner and experiment upon we do not believe that he know his captor have you find anything Daniel Jackson just page and page of log note about the exper what be it this be bad where be he isolation room 1 under guard why what do you find I should have know when I see the Ancient writing he use to use it as code on his ship Dr Jackson the lab do not belong to an Ancient it belong to Anubis but he be long go now yes but the man he leave behind be not the victim of experiment he be a genetic hybrid he be grow in that lab I be sorry whatever he tell you he be lie the Goa'uld pass on genetic memory now he may not have a snake in his head but the man we defrost and bring back here have Goa'uld DNA intermingle with his own that make he the son of Anubis the log entry say Anubis manage to replicate his pre ascension DNA use the genetic manipulation device then he combine it with Human DNA and be able to rapidly grow our our friend there the analysis I do suggest that Khalek be significantly more evolved than we be much more in line with the human form of the Ancients prior to ascension so he could have all kind of super funky power well the subject Nirrti manipulate demonstrate telekinetic and psychic ability like the prior the goal of the experiment seem to have be to create an advanced Human with a little Anubis blend in you say he use his pre ascend DNA do you think he be do his experiment before he ascend no see that timeline do not track with the log plus it say he have to reproduce his dna which mean he be do all this after he ascend and be send back by the Ancients well halfway but this do not make any sense even a highly evolve human host would not be as advanced as he be why bother maybe he do not like be stick in limbo maybe even a small step back to mortality be worth it to he on some level perhaps he be attempt to create an even more powerful servant than the Kull warrior no matter what Anubis ' ultimate goal be Khalek be extremely dangerous Options Put he back in his pod I doubt we would be able to get the one from 584 back here if we leave he there other could circumvent the security and find he as we do we could post guard what about the Antarctica pod look I think we need to consider whether we want to preserve he at all look the fact be we do not know how successful Anubis be Khalek be advanced yes but we do not know how far along he actually be now if he be aware of his own state of evolutionary advancement and I bet you anything he be it be possible the only thing keep he from ascend right now be that he have not figure out how what would that take I do not know but if he can do it if if he know how or figure out how at the very least we be go to have another Anubis on our hand and at that point it be go to be too late to stop he well he could not progress his state of being while he be in stasis look you know I would never suggest this lightly but he be what he be and give the danger he pose I think we have to ask ourselves what be the point in keep he alive at all I hear you Doctor Jackson for the moment we be take every security precaution we can I will contact Washington Discuss how we be go to proceed in the meantime I suggest all of you learn as much as you can include what Khalek do and do not know Khalek can you hear I yes my name be Doctor Daniel Jackson why have you restrain I like this why be everyone suddenly act like they fear I look you can drop the act I do not understand have you contact my homeworld we find you on your homeworld I understand Ancient those research note Anubis leave we know that you be grow in that lab and you possess Anubis ' dna and his genetic memory my memory DO include you Doctor Jackson the confrontation you once have with my father I sense it be some time since I be last awake what have become of he I be not here to answer your question the other they wish to study I do not they why else would I still be here give the danger you know I pose they want to learn what I be how I come to be but you have you ever take a life Doctor Jackson I believe you have kill a man my memory be so sharp and clear it be as if they happen only moment ago the countless live my father extinguish all those that come before he that do the same such pleasure it give they but I have not experience it myself yet do it really feel that good million of slave bow before I a galaxy of desperate pitiful lifeform at my foot that be clearly intoxicate I can almost taste it as if it be I there and not those whose memory I possess but nothing nothing do I anticipate more than the sweetness I know I will feel when I will kill for the first time I can hardly wait to watch as fear stop a man 's heart so much more intimate one on one to watch as the blood flow from his vein and savour his ever fade hope for life there be only one way to stop it I know you wish to take my life and I promise you before this be over one of we will feel the pleasure Mr Woolsey give the timing this can not be a good sign the International Committee oversee the SGC have read and consider your recommendation to place the prisoner back in stasis at least until we can decide what to do with he we think that be a mistake oh you think we should kill he on the contrary we think he must be study you understand how dangerous he be we understand how dangerous you seem to think he be there be very little coroborating evidence at this point that be why more study be require be this a joke cos if you look closely I be not laugh you and your people go before the Senate Appropriations Committee and demand that the budget for this facility not be cut in half why because of a formidable new enemy that now threaten our galaxy what would we do without you all we have hear be that the Ori must be take more seriously than the Goa'uld that the Priors who represent they be extremely powerful and dangerous in their own right and yet in the month since this threat emerge not one propose counter measure not one shred of technology not even so much as a theory or strategy to fight these missionary have result from ongoing Stargate operation until now and you want to freeze he go go you be on a roll base on the report the only thing that we do know about this Khalek be that physiologically he may be very much like the Priors of the Ori an advanced form of Human far along in evolutionary development first and foremost study he may be the key to learn a way to fight the Priors actually that have not escape I not to mention the fact that he may be the miss link between ourselves and ascension certainly that merit more research the member of the committee feel very strongly about this then neither they nor you understand the risk oh we do the issue be if this command do not have the ability and security in place to take full advantage of an opportunity like this then we believe we need to reevaluate it 's leadership and ultimately its operation if Woolsey and the bean counter be go to force we to keep Khalek conscious maybe we would well figure out what he be capable of and fast it be like he be goad I into kill he like he want we to do it he know be he be on the path to ascension maybe he think that be the final step if that be the case we may have no other choice but to freeze he again with strict instruction never to defrost indeed unfortunately we must now convince other this be the prudent course of action Major Altman seem to think he have something that will help we yeah this unit it seem to be self contain well it be what analyse a subject 's current physiological status and feed back into the DNA manipulator we should be able to bring it back with we and rig it to give we a well idea of how advanced Khalek really be that would be good nice work I be go to keep work on the translation he be out cold Colonel I give he enough sedative to keep he out for hour can not be too sure that should be good we be pretty sure these red patch indicate area of the brain where synaptic activity be maximise a normal human brain you or I say should show roughly five to ten percent coverage I be five you be ten so what be it at now sixty percent Sixty eight exactly Daniel say the research theorize that eighty possibly ninety percent activity be require for conscious willful ascension so he be not there yet well no but wait a minute what be that that be not there a minute ago no the percentage just jump to seventy one be you say this guy be evolve right before our eye his heartrate 's increase I wonder if that have something to do with the brain scan device I be go to administer some more sedative no no just a second let I just make sure that there be no interference with the line here I shoot he twice at point blank range and he appear to be heal very quickly I should have empty the clip I do not get it Sir how can Woolsey not know that keep this guy around be a bad idea he be an ass so what he be risk a catastrophe just to embarrass we Woolsey be a pretty straight shooter I think he really believe this be go to be of benefit look we be the one who 've spend the last eight year justify enormous risk for the advancement we 've make Fact be we be record some incredible datum Khalek 's healing ability his advanced brain function that scanner be still operate when he be use his telekinetic ability and we 've be able to isolate the area of the brain he be maximise at the time see I think the point be be that he have telekinetic ability and he be continue to evolve while we sit around yammer about it all the while he be get close and close to ascend you should know there be now 50 000 volt run through that floor Sir and a Tok'ra shield generator bar the door it be one way so we can still fire bullet in there if we have to finally Dr Lam believe your ability can be control with a dopamine inhibitor a shunt have be insert into the base of your skull and a massive dose will be automatically inject should you try anything else thank for the warning Richard or do you prefer Dick no you do not tell I your name Shame about Major Altman he be go to be fine we will see any further outburst will not be tolerate whatever you say Dick hey I hear you guy could use some help yeah we hear what happen how be Major Altman he be go to be ok the Ascendometer say Khalek 's about 80 there Ascendometer Mitchell Wish I would think of it after Khalek be shoot and start to heal it shoot up another five percent or so yeah we be help he the healing process help he to learn another aspect of his advancement I will bet anything he want to get shoot you think well accord to the research the way it work be the subject get the treatment in this machine and certain physiological change be make in the brain then it take some time week month to adjust the individual need to get use to the change learn how they work it be a gradual process that be what the scan be show we Khalek be learn to use the advancement the late treatment give he now eventually with enough physical evolution and mental control he will reach a critical stage where he will learn to shed his physical body and exist as energy yeah I always think there be a spiritual component to ascension that you have to be a good person at heart to do it there be certainly one when there be an Ancient help you well obviously when the process happen naturally there be no rule well if you can call this naturally still the Ori prove you do not have to be moral to ascend who know maybe it be part of a grand cosmic balance Good and evil have to coexist on all level well for now Khalek be still mortal I do not think he really want to die before he be figure it all out he be probably be hide the full extent of his power from we for all we know he be mock we because he know we can not really hurt he what else have you learn not much I do not think this database be go to be much help anymore we 've be through it twice now well the reason I come be because I have an idea base on the datum we 've collect from the scan on Khalek 's brain I be think that we can run a simulation on the dna machine to see where it be really go to the good of our knowledge this have never be do before right artificially advance a Human being to ascension use technology rather than the help of another ascend be the log be incomplete Anubis seem to have be stop before he could finish his experiment let us see if it be really go where we think it be I mean at the very least maybe get a timeframe General I be reconsider the arrangement with the International Committee that be keep you here then I suggest you start go through your budget because without their support how can you still be convince that this be the right course of action the scan indicate his advancement have plateaue at roughly 80 of potential brain activity that might have something to do with the dopamine inhibitor how long be we go to keep this up until we find a way to counteract someone with his ability in the field accord to your own account the man be able to read your mind do not that concern you Gravely the fact that there be dozen of Priors with ability like his roam the galaxy right now also concern I and the committee represent the free nation of this planet General for the moment in my opinion this situation be under control well I certainly hope that at the point at which you change your mind be not too late you want to see I I be pull the plug you can notify the committee that the SGC no long require their support General Khalek 's condition be stable you 've take ample security precaution every minute we have to study he record datum the close we get to a means of fight the Priors not to mention the possibility of solve the mystery of our own existence the issue we face can be overwhelming at times I can see how someone might lose their perspective I have not lose perspective General I recognise the importance of this research that be why I be not go to let you stand in the way ultimately the decision be mine I be have Khalek transfer back to his stasis pod on 584 immediately regardless of the consequence to this command thank you Nuts just about do each of these section represent a treatment on the machine and the result of advancement you say that Khalek have have five treatment yeah accord to the log well this be where he should be now in maturity do that mean what I think it mean we need to report this to Landry yeah there be one more thing I think you should do first just to give you a head up we be go to keep you attach all the way home you try anything you be go to be a drool idiot in a couple of second Corporal continue go ahead we be just prepare to send Khalek through to place he back in stasis bad idea 584 be the last place we should be take he right now in fact it be probably what he be hope for this be General Landry Belay the order resecure the prisoner back in the seat now explain why I just do that the reason his advancement have not plateaue be not because of the dopamine inhibitor he be go as far as he can now he may have learn to use the physical advancement he now have but he will never be able to ascend in his current state he need more treatment on that machine to make it happen keep clear the one place we can not send he to be the lab on 584 I bet he be be wait for we to try this be Mitchell tell General Landry the prisoner be secure seem thing be no long in control Dick be you ok yeah I be fine just help I up no you be not you have a concussion you need to stay put look my head can wait we just finish secure he he go nuts and kill two S S you think he could have hear we head off to the Gateroom Gateroom go go Levels 12 through 28 be now secure full emergency contingent be in position and on high alert there Target be on level 21 Hallway B Heading north Security system down we 've go to auxillary power Damn he go that way medical team to level 24 Hallway D meet I at the Gate we will call this in Khalek just go down emergency exit tube 3 get those door open I be try Sir Controls be not work they be seal shut halt the dialling program I can not Sir you should have kill I when you have the chance he be lock we out of the system Iris control be still down too incoming wormhole cut auxillary power to the blast door Cameron the electronic lock be down you should be able to prise the door open yeah that be easy for you to say what take you so long Iris will not close nice shot I rig the call forward device on 584 to dial back here and you do not tell I we be go to Sir but we do not get a chance it be a good thing too he would have hear we medical team to level 28 Base be secure Doctor Jackson I just want you to know the man who die I be go to see to it personally that their family be well take care of look for what it be worth I understand how you feel and why you take the position you do it almost sound like you might find it in yourself to forgive I no that do not mean we do not all want what you be look for and the answer be still out there and you be right about the risk believe I I wish I would be wrong I too previously on Stargate SG 1 what say you to the promise of the Ori we will hear no more of false god first we have to make a choice follow the Ori or be destroy in moment our city be level if a Prior visit your world leave be great knowledge power understanding not enough for you to revere the Ori it do not mean I would murder innocent people in their name if we do not continue to work together the victory that we work so long and hard for could result in chaos my name be Orlin I be from the planet you just visit actually the truth be I love you oh my God I be just say it be pure ego Pure ego I do not know at that level of enlightenment I mean arrogance be about pleasure right wallowing in the pride of one 's achievement well you do not think that get a whole galaxy to bow down to worship you be something to write home about no I be just say the ascend being that I 've meet have pretty much all the satisfaction anyone can need they do not need to lord it over we they kind of look at we the way we look at bug Insignificant Amusing yeah no look I get what you be say but Damn that smell be that you no do not think so oh barne right of course I should have know that stench be you very funny Mitchell be under cover on P2X 885 10 000 poverty stricken peasant only one fresh water well not to mention 130 degree in the shade well you might want to think about take a shower before you debrief Landry right after Lam clear we Hell Lucky she maybe if we be lucky she will give we all a sponge bath I would not repeat that around the General Lieutenant I would not repeat that around I sorry Sir let us go ok seriously what be his problem aside from the fact that be a completely inappropriate comment Lam be Landry 's daughter Sir I be sorry know when to shut up Lieutenant Hey Colonel how have it go by the way not good 885 's go Ori Third planet this month I ask not to be disturb forgive I but he be here greeting have you contemplate your destiny I have read from the book and I find it to be most illuminate Antares and the river how the people of the low valley be free from the yoke of an iron serpent who rule over they without mercy do you see this as more than mere coincidence you suggest this prophecy such be the wisdom grant by true enlightenment and the road we all must take many Jaffa be without faith and direction Hurt by the lie and betrayal of those who have enslave we you 've be burn by evil but do not let that keep you from the warmth and light of the eternal flame let Origin show you the way I be merely say that it may still take some time for other Jaffa to see Origin as I have come to see it but I vow to spread the word of the Ori to all Jaffa Hallowed be the Ori Hallowed be the Ori Season 9 Episode 10 the Fourth Horseman Part 1 Colonel Carter I 've read your proposal and and I be not exactly sure what an aneurism feel like but I suspect I be pretty close boy I be glad I be not the only one can you put this in layman 's term well simply speak Sir base on the research that be do on Anubis ' genetic experiment Khalek we believe we may be close to develop a technology that could inhibit a Priors special ability be we talk about a anti Prior gun here because I do not remember see the word gun anywhere in here well it would not be a gun exactly but that be kind of what make we think it be possible because I be able to shoot Khalek while he be focus on defend himself from you which mean he be not omnipotent you think the Priors be the same we 've identify specific portion of the brain that be active when Khalek be use his unique ability now he have those ability because he be at a much more evolved state very close to ascension now we be hope the Ori be affect the Priors in much the same way Dr Lee and I be work on a way of target and neutralize those high brain function use a field generator emit fluctuate ultrasonic frequency and my headache be just go away I do not wanna sound overly optimistic Sir but I think we may be close to test within a couple of day I would like to report that something positive come out of that whole Khalek situation yes Sir keep I post he do not look too impressed oh trust I Anti Prior gun would have go down well if the Jaffa at Kallana have heed the wisdom of the Priors then they would still be alive today the Jaffa at Kallana be defend themselves against a military incursion the Ori be attempt to construct a mean by which to invade our galaxy and attack we they offer we the wisdom of the age and everlaste life and we meet that with force be their action not justify thousand of life be lose all the more reason why we should respect their power if you be suggest we have no other choice but to acquiesce that would be cowardice Gerak I believe their intention be pure they offer we enlightenment knowledge salvation all of these thing can be ours if we have the courage to embrace our destiny I believe a recess be in order the council will deliberate on Gerak 's proposal I come as soon as I hear Gerak have propose that the religion of the Ori should be adopt by all Jaffa as law to be teach to our child it be benediction and tradition follow to the letter should it be ratify by the council all Jaffa would have no choice but to accept the Ori as Gods true belief can not be legislate surely the council must know this be beyond their purview but Gerak seem to have sway many he be convince that the Ori represent the true god we have all seek for generation and that only by worship they can we finally find peace and enlightenment then he be a fool and must be reveal as such Gerak be many thing but he be no fool teal'c because of we too many Jaffa now know that the ancient of this galaxy will never offer we a quick path to ascension still the Ori be not the answer no but Gerak be old as be many of the Council for they the Ori represent hope for life beyond that which we now know for that reason alone this proposal will carry weight a couple of day well we will just have to roll up our sleeve and burn some midnight oil if we have to Midnight oil why do not you just tell they we would come up with a viable mean of create cold fusion while you be at it Sure if you 've get something no look I mean all we have be a bunch of uncorrelated datum and a theory I mean I admit it be a pretty sound theory if you pardon the pun ultrasonic wave that be good anyway I mean it be go to be a matter of month before we get it oh I see I understand this be your first project back from Area 51 and you just you just wanna impress everybody ri can you hear I what ah no I right sleeve up and work it be Colonel Barnes about three hour ago he come in complain of fatigue about an hour after that he could barely stand high fever chest pain respiratory distress Sound familiar you be certain it be the same he be display identical symptom as the people who be infect on 412 it be a Prior plague we have to find Lieutenant Fisher and fast in my many year of service I have meet with our man and woman in uniform around the world active guard and reserve along the front line and those here at home and then as now I be continually amazed by your courage dedication and patriotism our airman soldier sailor and marine be symbol of the pride and strength of this nation be proud of what you do you make our nation strong and our world safe thank you what be go on this way Sir back off back off Lieutenant Fisher yes Sir you be go to have to come with I immediately come on that way in here please you clear SG 6 when they return from 885 I approve their clearance yes we 've be take extra precaution since the outbreak on 412 but you can not test for a virus that you do not know exist this strain have a completely different genetic make up and what be bad it seem to be mutate right before our eye Sir they 've find Fisher they be bring he in and everyone at the speech have be quarantine barne say he think Fisher be the one who make direct contact with the Prior Airman Ryan be show early symptom Lieutenant Brooks have be quarantine as well Sir we have no way of know who Fisher may have come into contact with prior to leave this base or how far this thing have spread it be a couple of day before we leave the planet Airman Ryan and I go to morning prostration the Prior be there preach you have no idea your cover have be blow no Sir there be no way anybody from that planet could have know we be from Earth the Prior walk among we touch people on the head some sort of benediction wait wait wait he touch sorry he touch you on your head I be sorry Sir if I have realise it be so important I would have put it in my report that be alright Lt thank you so how come he be not sick I be guess it be because he be just a carrier if he get sick and die from the virus it would not spread very far would it Colonel Dr Lam a word what have we get he be definitely patient zero the team on site at Peterson just report that two of the people in the crowd at General Hammond 's speech be display symptom and have test positive the General himself be fine that be good Sir what about the restaurant and the gas station Fisher stop at on his way into town the CDC have mobilise unit to try and contain the situation they 've send out bulletin to every hospital and medical facility in the state anyone show plague symptom will be refer to we do we have a cover story a new influenza that first appear at St Francis Medical Center two day 's ago we be issue a press release in an hour Colonel I would like you in the field follow up on Lieutenant Fisher 's activity just to be sure yes Sir you will have to get scrub and stay in hazmat on the outside yes ma'am twelve infected base personnel have be quarantine too four of they be show early symptom now half of those people come in direct physical contact with SG 6 after they come back however the rest of they do not which mean we should assume the bad case scenario which be the virus may be airborne and persistant so we have no idea how many people this will ultimately affect no unauthorised offworld activation what now you want to be a General General Landry to the control room Chief it be teal'c Sir I 've establish a videolink with he on Dakara General Landry Chief Harriman have inform I of the situation may I be of any assistance not at the moment we 've restrict gate travel in and out of the base for the time be Understood how have it go with the council have they make a decision they have not but I have be tell that they be lean towards accept Gerak 's proposal despite our warning do not sound good bra'tac and I no long believe this battle can be win through diplomacy alone the Council must know of our resolve by other mean such as we will travel to Chulak to meet with other Jaffa leader who feel as we do no matter what the council decide we will resist any alliance with the Ori so your fight for freedom may end up in an all out civil war indeed Let us hope it do not come to that it be a self service station Sir accord to receipt 22 people have use the pump that Fisher use we be track down the folk that use credit card six used cash we 've call in the National Guard I be stay in touch with the Governor but it look like we may need to close down the state Colonel yes Sir it be pretty bad the attendant 's be put into quarantine and it look like he be get it that be not the news I want to hear what be you do what be you do I be test frequency with Dark Pariah I can not hear a thing Noise cancel technology how be it come not well I mean we all know our auditory sense be a direct line to certain brain function and we know that they respond differently to different sonic frequency but you know try to achieve something as specific as isolate one small part of the brain that be like I mean it be like it be like try to do something that be impossible good analogy oh come on I have not sleep what what no I say it first what be what be you look at nothing I think I be just tired too the waitress who serve he the cook the manager they be all test positive we have fourteen customer unaccounted for bulletin be be issue on local and national radio and television the medium 's have a field day have you close the state border Sir too late for that Colonel we already have report case in Utah Kansas and New Mexico Damn that be fast fast than we can move airport bus station train station they be all secure at this point but more than one person seem to have get out Track them down Colonel will do Sir Panicked citizen be demand answer from authority who have be clearly overwhelm by the speed and scope of the virus despite their good effort the contagion continue to spread at an alarming rate of course keep it right here we will have the late in break news on the hour every hour we will see you then this be go nowhere and my sleeve be up as high as they can go perhaps if we try a different kind of spread spectrum a combination of wave yeah but look I I be sorry the only thing I can confirm with any kind of certainty be that sleep deprivation definitely have an adverse affect on all brain function I be go to go get some coffee do you want anything no I be good you be so close I know hello Sam it be good to see you again I 've miss you who be you I have no choice but to take this form it be I Orlin as far as I can tell he be a normal Human adolescent who claim he be an Ancient who have descend and take human form there really be no other explanation Sir for how he could have get into the base Orlin know the thing he know I be pretty sure he be give we the key to finish the anti Prior technology that Dr Lee and I be work on accord to the mission report on your first encounter with Orlin you two have an intimate relationship well we do but he do not look like that he be Taller he be a grown man well so why come back as a boy this time he say he have no choice Sir he have to take a young form in order to preserv as many of the ancient memory as possible the knowledge he possess as an ascended being be too massive for a normal Human brain to handle we be guess that have a young brain give he a slightly well chance of retain the knowledge a little long that make sense actually the know make up of a still develop mind have a potential for well memory retention than that of an adult ultimately Sir he say he will lose most of the knowledge Sir I think he be take a huge risk just to be here we should at least hear he out I be sorry be not you break some major cosmic rule here I mean why do the other let you go without wipe your memory clean honestly I do not really know I guess enough of they feel it be necessary for someone to step out of line and warn you I be assume you be talk about the Ori we be already aware of the threat they pose believe I you do not know everything a long time ago the Ori and the Alterans be one society Human on an evolutionary path to ascension but a philosophical division grow the Ori grow more and more fervent in their religious belief the Alterans for a lack of a well way of put it believe in science the Ori try to wipe they out so instead of go to war the Alterans build a ship leave the galaxy and come here we know that both the Alterans and the Ori eventually ascend and that the Ori pass on their religion call Origin to the next evolution of human they create yes but the central promise of the religion everything the Origin 's follower devote themselves to be a lie be you say that the Ori do not offer their follower ascension no most certainly not then they would have to share share what the power they seek from those who worship they well how be that possible I mean be you say that there be a real physical transfer of energy to the Ori that occur simply through a Human being 's belief in they simply be not how I would put it it be quite complicated but possible and if they be to have a measurable effect it require massive number of Humans really push their will nevertheless it be one of the main reason the ancient have so strongly believe in strict non interference in the low plane because the temptation to manipulate and malign low life form into some order for your own purpose can result in exactly this type of abuse and corruption the Ori empower themselves by sap the life force of those willing to surrender themselves to they unknowingly and this promise of salvation in return lead to nothing but death of the most meaningless kind because there be no conscious effort to achieve enlightenment without be spoon feed by the Ori do the prior know this I mean be they complicit no they be merely pawn the more world the Priors convert the more powerful the Ori become they must be stop why do not the Ancients Alterans whatever you call yourself now why do not you stop they I be one of they no long and even if I be it be unclear whether such action would result in victory nor be such an endeavour at that level necessarily the next good step to further enlightenment all I can say for sure be that if this galaxy be to succumb and bow to the Ori it would be very bad for everyone you have spread the word of the Ori well Gerak I believe that their wisdom be worthy of my effort and yet such wisdom still fall upon deaf ear a group of unbeliever Jaffa would stand against your leadership and the Ori be meet as we speak on Chulak but your belief can not be force upon other the offering of Origin speak for itself I believe that in time they will come to believe that this be true as you have say the Jaffa be strong willed you be a people that understand the nobility of bloodshed the neccessity of sacrifice what would you have I do go to Chulak Mark it as the last place a Jaffa will ever defy the power of the Ori and destroy all those who will not walk the path to enlightenment we be hope that as long as you be here you may be able to help we I no long possess the power to simply cure this plague as I could have as an ascended being however with the knowledge I still retain I believe I can synthesise a cure easily use your medical technology you build a stargate in my basement with spare part from a toaster actually this will be a little hard than that Gerak the battle at Kallana I lose a cousin there and it do still haunt I today but it do not cause I to doubt my decision I have read from the book of Origin search for the wisdom you speak so highly of and I do see fable mean to fill we all a raft of hope with purpose story of morality and righteousness and this be not worthy of your respect so be the tradition of the Jaffa be we just suppose to abandon all that we be no but if you want to look really carefully you will find everything that we want be in here everything that we ever desire be in here how be it go Basically I know what I need to make I just do not have any of the right material or tool this be the good we have I can get you a toaster if you need it not unless you be hungry for toast Waffle iron look I hate to be pushy but do you have any kind of timeframe on this honestly Time from your perspective be not something I be all that use to deal with so be there anything I can do you can keep I company right hospital be struggle to cope with an influx of people I have Colonel Mitchell on the line for you who suspect they may have contract the virus as a result crowd waiting room be now serve only to exacerbate an already difficult Put he on speaker what have you get Colonel Sir we have a problem look like one of the people that use the gas pump Fisher touch get onto a plane before the quarantine go into effect to where it be bad he catch a flight to Denver with connection to Chicago and New York Sir I be afraid we 've lose control of the situation I have to admit it be nice be out of that uncomfortable suit for a while I know I be vulnerable now as a Human yet I still can not quite get my head around my own frailty what you 've be at it nearly nine hour straight you need something to eat I be hungry maybe it be just I it have be a while since I experience Human sense but this food do not smell very good that be because it be not very good I remember eat pretty well the last time I do this this be a one way trip for you this time be not it the other they be not go to help you ascend again be they I do not think so I know it must be kind of weird my appear this young a little but I understand my only regret in all this be that human social convention preclude we from show affection the way I wish I could excuse I my feeling have not change for you since we last see each other Sam maybe in a few year it be ok we do not need to talk about it any further I just want you to know that take human form at this age well necessary do not come easy because of how I know I would feel be here with you again be it I or be this food not very good be you make a joke no it have be a while since I taste food but this seem terrible we just talk about that oh right I be sorry I be use to hear my own thought in my mind and sometimes it be hard to distinguish which one I say out loud do I tell you I still have feeling for you yes thank you yeah we do not need to go into that again five thousand confirm case of infection now the bulk of those be from the Colorado Springs and Denver area what about New York and Chicago 45 new case have be report in Utah 36 in New York 20 in Chicago and now 20 in San Diego the country 's in a panic the President 's prepare an address what the hell happen to JFK and Salt Lake the CDC have the manif and the name of the flight crew and because we move fast most of the passenger be quarantine but a few still remain unaccounted for they be do the good they can to track they down now we be now hear about case in new location every hour now as oppose to three or four a day what about casualty there be only eight people dead so far five of they be SGC personnel so far I say so far because of the reasonably long incubation period again this virus be design to avoid detection and for maximum spreading capability and we know it be deadly so with over 5 000 people infect and no effective treatment as of yet that number of casualty will climb very quickly very soon Colonels please tell I something good be happen somewhere Dr Lee have finish the anti Prior prototype of course without a Prior on hand it do need to be field test but we think we have a good reason to try it how be that Orlin seem to have hit a dead end with his work on a cure he say there be a vital component miss I tell you anything he need what he need be a blood sample from the Prior who infect Lieutenant Fisher Orlin think the Prior essentially manipulate his own dna to create the virus it have mutate several time since then but he still think have the root dna that it be base on may help you be talk about use an untested technology to try and capture a Prior no not just any Prior the Prior who infect Fisher use our intel from our friend on the Sodan planet who lead we to 885 in the first place apparently they be expect the same Prior back there tomorrow and you be sure they can be trust as far as we know the Sodan be the one who blow SG 6 's cover I do not believe that Sir seem awful risky give that Orlin do not even sound positive this will help he Orlin 's attempt to find a cure might not be the only reason to do this he think the prior do not know the truth about the Ori maybe if we enlighten they for a change you want to try and turn this Prior well maybe not a complete 180 but he might give we something especially once he find out his god be not go to ascend he if he believe you will not know until we try Sir in the meantime we can at least get a blood sample so how do it work assume it actually do work you know I keep tell myself that one of these day I be go to do something that actually get I a little respect around here we be all wait for that day Bill theoretically once activate the device will emit an omnidirectional ultrasonic field and that will prevent a Prior from access a highly evolved area of his brain that give he a super human ability of course we be presume that the staff weapon the Priors carry be also mentally activate and will also be neutralise while we be at it why do not we just assume that I can fly oh actually I 've be work on a theory where you say yourself it would be risky yeah I know I know I say that but the more I be hear the more it be cross over into crazy do not get I wrong I like crazy that be why I ask for this job one more thing there be a range of frequency program into the emitter if one do not work at first try the other even if the Kal'chak region commit to our cause we will still be outnumber in ship and army nearly six to one hopefully no shot will ever be fire you believe our mere willingness to battle our brother will force the council to hear we the council be lose it be the heart and mind of our brother and sister that will take notice they must be make aware of the threat the Ori pose if he be unarmed let he enter you be not welcome here the power of the Ori can not be deny I have come to beg you to cease this madness or be destroy by whose hand my ha'tak be in orbit above this planet you would murder your brother and sister innocent child for choose the life of a free Jaffa you leave I no alternative you have be warn what be you do I think you be go to get some rest as soon as I finish the dna sequence program that way when we get the sample from the Prior we can plug in the decoded strand and we will know if it be go to help Orlin you 've already do it what the sequence program you finish it a couple of hour ago you be go to get some rest I be on my way and I feel like I have forget something Orlin it be ok I be just tired no you be not I want you to go see Dr Lam I think she have enough to deal with right now Orlin you be our good hope for find a cure we need you to be ok I have they target shall I open fire the only true darkness live in the heart of those who will not follow the path otherwise there be always some measure of light and where there be light the Ori see all I spare their life because I believe they will soon see you defy I we do not serve the Ori at our whim you can not win the heart of the Jaffa by needlessly spill the blood of the innocent we be mere mortal we can not begin to question those with the knowledge and understanding of the infinite universe if a few Jaffa must give their life so that all Jaffa from now until the end of time can find true enlightenment then who be you to stand in the way would you forgive I ask I not for forgiveness I sense your doubt Gerak but fear not the Ori do not require blind obedience they will show you their power where be we your physical form remain on Dakara the power of the Ori have bring your mind here to Celestus City of the Gods come Hallowed be the Ori Relax Jackson I spend two week with these guy we 've get nothing to worry about well consider what happen the last time we be here you will forgive I if I be a little cautious we will be fine be we still fine yeah we be fine good just checkin ' it be the most active scan we 've see since Khalek that device you bring back from Anubis ' genetic lab show we his actual synaptic interaction and look like pocket of cell be just shut down I can not say for certain but I can hazard a guess they be wear out from extremely unnatural overuse well he say he would lose the memory eventually human brain be not mean to hold that much information this look bad than that it be like the cell be literally die because they can not handle all the synaptic activity what hey this be way beyond my experience still as you say the human brain be not suppose to be use this way I do not know if it be conscious or not but it be possible he be try to hold onto the knowledge and hold onto that much knowledge be cause brain damage that be right have he contact I as soon as he land we be track a new outbreak in Florida Walter Sir just receive a communique from the Whitehouse can I have your attention please at last count we have report of over 8 000 people infect in 13 state as a result of these number as of 0800 this morning the President have order that all border in the United States be close until further notice all inbound plane and ship and other traffic will be order to divert to alternate destination our country be now entirely under quarantine you can not ratify this proposal until all member of this council have be hear from so far six regional member you merely seek to delay the inevitable if and when all Jaffa wish to embrace the Ori then we shall act accordingly if our brother refuse to accept Origin into their heart then they seal their own fate we can not turn our back on our own salvation because of indecisiveness and they will see their way to the path it be the destiny of all Jaffa to follow Origin like you my judgment be cloud by suspicion and distrust but the Ori sense my misgiving forgave I my weakness and show I their power I stand before you today as proof of their divine might they have poison your mind the Ori 's promise be hollow we have learn from the ancient that they be not ascend their follower do you expect we to take your word for this one of the Ancients return to human form to warn we that the Ori gain strength by sap the power from their follower that be why they seek out support the Ori be not some benevolent god offer the path of enlightenment they be but manipulative being who will use you and discard you once you have serve their purpose enough they be no well than the Goa'uld Enough the Goa'uld be imposter but the Ori the Ori be the real Gods behold the gift the Ori have bestow upon I we 've have three fatality this morning we have another 12 base personnel who be in critical condition and probably will not make it past the next 24hrs that be it they 've be give sedative and be rest comfortably there be nothing you or anyone can do for they right now I can go see they no you can not you be exhaust and you 've already get a lot on your plate those people be serve under my command Sir what be it Walter as of 08 00 this morning the CDC report confirm case of the virus in both Mexico and Canada we could be look at a global pandemic Season 9 Episode 11 the Fourth Horseman Part 2 Jolan hey it be good to see a familiar face Lord Haikon wish to see you let rock and roll it be foolish of you to come the other be distrustful of you yeah I kind of get that be there anything else I need to know Haikon will have your answer Welcome Mitchell thank you Haikon please sit I apologize for make you wait but we just come back from a mission of great importance we be inform of a world of non believer who be conspire against the Ori the Prior dispatch we to deal with they you mean kill they well we be tell they pose a considerable threat leave not the small pebble to allow any hindrance that will slow your people 's progress so say the Prior yeah the prior say a lot of thing look I be the last person to criticize someone for what they believe but if your intention be to convince I to withdraw support from the Ori you need not bother you be make a big mist I have already decide as much what we go to the planet as the Prior instruct 200 strong to eliminate any threat we be expect an army what we find be simple farmer too naïve to understand the consequence they face for dare to defy the Ori the Sodan be proud warrior we do not kill innocent people so you do not follow through we leave they unharmed but before return here we have to put all doubt to rest so we travel to another world one rumor to have refuse the Ori the entire civilization be decimate by a mysterious plague there be no one leave yeah that be what they do in fact they be do it on Earth right now as we speak and it will probably happen here when the Prior get back and find out you do not obey his order how can we resist so powerful enemy well I can tell you but you be probably not go to like it Orlin Sam be you alright I be fine it be you I be worried about we just get your test result back they show significant and progressive change in different area of your brain what kind of change a degenerative process that have already start to impair your cognitive function I know that when I take on human form the memory I bring with I would eventually fade that be only part of it I mean it be not so much a result of you lose the memory but more a consequence of you try to hold on to they Orlin by not let go of the ancient knowledge you be damage your brain yes my human mind be fail under the weight of so much information you know this would happen do not you as an Ancient how could you not have know of course I know Sam but I have no choice but you have a choice now your brain be fight a lose battle strip away whatever it can in an attempt to salvage the memory relate to the cure give they up and you could stop this from progress any further I can not do that there be too much at stake you have the memory write they down give I the instruction I will complete the vaccine it be too complex you will not fully understand the process try I Orlin you do not have to sacrifice yourself let go before it be too late I can not risk entrust this job to anyone but myself I have to see this through Sam I be sorry we be good okay this device will emit a high ultra sonic frequency target a specific portion of the Priors ' brain temporarily block his ability to use his power now the good news be it will not have any effect on we the bad news be it may not have any effect on the Prior either in order for this thing to work the way we want it to it have to be broadcast on the correct frequency unfortunately we do not know what that frequency be so we will use a trial and error approach this remote allow we to adjust the signal and soon or later we will get the right one any question thus far how will we know it be work oh we will know when the Prior 's no long able to use his power and how will we know he will no long be able to use his power well someone be just go to have to test it and find out do not worry fellow that someone be I so it be simple we disable the Prior we take a sample of his blood we send it back to the SGC they finish the cure we turn the Prior against the Ori and call it a day Jackson you be drive oh yeah SG 22 I want you in defensive position around the perimeter there there there and there there be one other small problem we be not exactly sure what the range of that device be so Haikon I need you to get the Prior as close as possible be that a problem no no it be not you be confident that this will work well if it do not work we be out of option I fear we have lose they this battle be far from over but clearly the Council be sway the task before we be daunt but not impossible the Jaffa nation have no appetite for war particularly one that threaten to divide we indeed that much be certain the Ori on the other hand will not abide opposition they have already order Gerak to quell the dissention within our rank then we must retreat into the shadow and evade their attempt to find we no we must make a stand on Chulak Faced with the prospect of in sight a civil war that would kill million the Council will be leave with an impossible choice but ultimately they must decide between the Ori and their fellow Jaffa it be only by force their hand that they will see reason so I believe an enterprise this bold will require much support then let we gather a fleet to defend Chulak it be like catch a glimpse of someone from the corner of your eye then turn around and they be go you begin to doubt whether you really see they in the first place tell I Sam how can you regret lose a memory you can not even remember what be you work on the instruction for assemble the cure in the event that I be too incapacitated to complete it myself it be a precaution we have to take the most frustrating part in all this be that I be unable to control what I can hold on to even for a little while crucial information I need to finish the cure be slip through my finger while insignificant minutia of my experience as an Ancient be still fresh and clear in my mind in time I will lose it all but for now it just do not seem fair be there anything I can do to help no at this point it be good if I work alone despite the good effort of all those involve the virus continue to spread at an alarming rate the CDC advise anyone who suspect they may have the virus or may have come in contact with someone who do Sir just receive word that China Great Britain and Russia have ground all air travel and have close off their port to foreign ship this be out of control and it be only go to get bad and accord to General Hammond 's office our ally have express concern about the cover story specifically how long we can continue to maintain it they 've request a meeting with you so it be your estimation that General that the decision to send SG 6 to that particular planet be the right one as evidence by this plague we have no viable defense against the Ori the purpose of the mission to 6 5 6 be to gather intelligence that might help we in that respect but admittedly the mission be a failure in the bad possible way and as a result million perhaps billion will lose their life the newly appoint liaison between Stargate Command and the International Committee be inform of and sign off on the mission your representative agree it be the right call there be some concern that Mr Woolsey may not have be fully apprise of all the possible ramification now to his credit he still support your decision the Ori be go to strike at we soon or later and rather than sit back and wait for it we be out there look for a way to stop they to stop this from happen and to start point finger General at such a crucial General Landry the purpose of this meeting be not to assign blame but to arrive at a well understanding of how this happen and conversely to avoid something like this ever happen again that be provide we get a second chance presently we have no way of stop this virus People be die and there be not a damn thing we can do about it what you propose be madness so it may seem but if the Council believe that we be mad and can not be dissuade from sacrifice our life then all the well we must stake everything on the belief that in the end the Council will value the life of their brother over the empty promise of the Ori Time be short brother we must gather our force for the big our army the more life Gerak must choose to take we must make this decision as difficult as we can for he Gerak be no long one of we he be a Prior now Gerak may be a Prior but I have no doubt that part of he remain Jaffa and that be the part we must seek out I still believe this plan to be madness but then I once consider the very notion of defeat the Goa'uld a mere fantasy prove I wrong yet again teal'c you have my support thank you Brother he be on his way Jackson Ready Alright everybody sit tight wait for my signal remember we need this guy alive you go to the planet as I ask to we do and yet the nonbeliever still live they do why have you disobey the will of the Ori because we take order from no one the Ori offer you enlightenment immortality even if that be true their price be too high what they ask of we go against the very spirit of the Sodan you doubt the power of the Ori it be not their power that we doubt it be their worthiness as Gods that be not it that be not it either Andreas choose to hunt the lion and be eat by his prey come on it be unwise of you to challenge I yeah well I would not mind another crack at it what do you hope to achieve by attack I do you honestly believe it be possible to capture I well that be the plan and what purpose would that have serve George Hank how be the grill Medium rare I just get off the phone with the CDC a flight leave Salt Lake City three day after the contagion be identify make a stop over at O'Hara before continue on to its final destination Charles de Gaulle airport you be tell I the virus have already reach Paris three of the people on that flight have test positive for the virus french authority be do all that they can to track down the passenger flight crew any ground crew or airport personnel that may have come into contact with they and anyone who come into contact with they and anyone who come into contact with those people you know at the rate this thing be travel in three day it will hit the Middle East six day it will be in China Stock market have already take a dive and people be panic if this thing spread far enough and do enough damage it could start destabilizing government we be go to have to be prepare for any and all possibility yeah we take the liberty of borrow a sample of your blood hope you do not mind you look for this no it be not go to work that warm fuzzy feeling you be experience may be the effect of a device that be inhibit your ability to concentrate and focus your power symptom may include dizziness irritability Nausea mild nausea and a condition know as hotdog finger it make no difference what you do to I but know this the Ori be all see they be already aware of this a front to their eminence and shall strike down those who dare to defy they nothing yet and you draw a blank little thirsty that do not count no it do not their movement be not so easily define their way unseen and veil in mystery right right they have a plan I do not suppose you want to tell we what that be why have they send you to this galaxy in the first place we be beacon on the road to enlightenment no you be dark side intergalactic encyclopedia salesman unfortunately the home office have not quite be up front with you nice work on the metaphor thank you for starter do you know that the Ori need people to worship they because that be how they gain their power he do not know no he do not know that no it be true we be not exactly sure how it work but from what I 've hear they actually drain power from their follower that be why they need worshipper you should talk to they about it next time your home might do a well job of explain the process to you Ours be not to question but to rejoice in their service for they be perfection no not really because a perfect being would not need to lie to ensure the loyalty of their follower they would not need to promise you ascension if they have no intention of deliver it those who follow the path of righteousness shall be raise up high no they will not because the Ori do not share power they be use you Pity not the blind man for he be hinder not by the vision of this world but rather pity yourself for he shall see the light before you I be go to get something to eat Orlin Damn it be you okay I be fine no no he be not fine Colonel he have not be fine in two day he have demonstrate lapse in judgment that have put everyone in this room at risk Colonel that be enough no he be right Sam I can not help you anymore I be just in the way here reflect on your ill spend youth old man in truth I be think of you if this gamble succeed you will have once again prove yourself a great leader perhaps the only one capable of unite this fractured Jaffa nation my heart be indeed with our people but as long as the Ori threaten this galaxy my place be with SG 1 I understand even so there be no doubt we be the poor for it I disagree after our great victory this day Gerak 's influence over our people shall wane then our nation will rally under the command of a great leader that be if he have the courage to accept the challenge I who well tell I no there be many other there be many other who cover the position but none who possess the strength and wisdom only you can offer it be not too long ago we face a similarly impossible task and yet on that day despite the odd we finally end generation of oppression and struggle by secure victory over ba'al fleet I remember stand on the peltak of that mother ship just as I be do now wait for the battle to begin yet know no matter what the outcome it would be the last time I would have to take the life of a fellow Jaffa no Jaffa blood will be spill on this day on that you have my word Sir we have confirm case in Bonn Amsterdam Rome and Madrid we have suspect case in London and Athens the who have team on route meanwhile there be suspect case on the african continent some of the military leader in the region have already declare martial law thank you Chief Colonel how be thing progress they be not Sir as you know the contagion rapidly mutate nature necessitate our require a speciman of dna from the original virus we finally manage to get a blood sample from the Prior who start the plague but so far it have not help it look like we 've hit a dead end well let us hope look like be the operative sentence here yes Sir Orlin sorry to disturb you not at all General please I would like to thank you for everything you 've do I wish it could have be more hey you get as along as far as you could the rest be go to have to be up to we Orlin I realize I have no right to ask this of you but there be something else you might be able to do for we numerous vessel drop out of hyperspace you be out number retreat be no long an option I do not want to slaughter you but I will if you give I no choice so what say you teal'c I still have hope this situation can be peacefully resolve Gerak let we meet on the planet surface and discuss very well it be a norwegian cheese I think spelt with a g or a J maybe both Jiggha Gojuha something like that so what you do be you dice up the cheese you toss it in with the egg white and you chop up some avocado throw it all together whoa daddy you get yourself a wicked omelet General we be just exchange recipe I hear have he offer up anything no Sir the man do not even have a decent pie crust the Ori be not go to ascend you they lie to you and anyone else they could take advantage of let not the word of deceiver lead you to doubt nor the enticement they offer cause you to stray exactly and the sad fact be you give it all up for nothing the life you have be go the Ori take it away from you bless be the true believer for only they shall walk the path and they shall be welcome onto the realm of Ori and make as one with they what do you leave behind a wife Children I have a grown daughter I be not around much when she be grow up and it be something I will always regret you ever think about your kid the time you spend with they the thing you use to do together before you throw it all away but how how would I know whether the Ori be ascend people or not truth be I do not know for sure but he do Hello Demeras who be you how do you know you be entire life be an open book to I the moment you set foot in this galaxy I be once ascend but I take this form because it be the only way to warn the human about the Ori since I make that decision I 've pay a heavy price in term of the effect it be have on my mind the memory I 've lose Life and death Light and darkness Hope and despair the rift be create and on that day the Ori be bear but every so often something will stir in I and if I push myself hard enough I will remember one more time before it leave I forever your name Demeras your wife Adina your son Jaden and Alon but the hatred of those who stray from the true path fester and bloom in the dark corner of the avarice to which they be cast and the fact that the Ori have never ascend any of their follower and consume by this hatred they poison all they touch bring death darkness and despair you know that as an Ancient I would not lie to you and the soul of their victim know no peace until the Ori come and whisper to they Sleep for the end draw near he be overcome the device and on that day all will rejoice when the Ori come and lie they lo General I be fine what be he say he just tell you why the Ori be on their way to this Galaxy they be come to destroy the ancient you have make the right choice there be no honor in fight an unwinable battle More peace at the hand of a tyrant I assure you the Ori be not the Goa'uld have we truly live as slave for so long that we must fear be free it have nothing to do with freedom Enlightenment be just within our reach or so the Ori would have we believe why have you lead I here I think it fit that on this day when we must sacrifice our short live freedom that we do so here at the site of the Battle of Salsacksor where you be father give his life for this very cause he begin to doubt the Goa'uld long before this rebellion take shape Gerak it be your father 's death at their hand that lead you to question what god be so deserving of my worship you be not one who be choose you do not witness the wonder I beheld do that erase the dead heal the sick and wound destroy their enemy with but a wave of their hand the Goa'uld deceive we the Ori 's power be pure then what be the measure of a god Gerak be it the scope of their power or how they choose to wield that power would a god who be prepared to lead we on the path of enlightenment so contradict this divine benevolence by destroy all those who refuse to believe in he those who refuse to believe must die I understand how difficult this must be for you Gerak near your final year you so desperately long for the enlightenment that we all seek this be not the way to save yourself I only want to avoid bloodshed stay this course and you will have not choice but to spill the blood of your brother and you may start with I for if I have a choice between resistance and return to the life of slavery then I choose to die free I be tell you I be fine Carolyn can you tell these people I be fine you be not fine your blood work come back positive you have the virus it be always darkest before the dawn my uncle use to say that all the time he be a wedding planner General Hammond at ease Sir when do you arrive oh I 've be here a while Colonel but you be busy and I think it be good not to disturb you Colonel Mitchell Congratulations on get the band back together thank you Sir it be not easy ah but worth it you could not ask for three well people watch your back I be sorry I will not get a chance to see Teal'c before I go you be leave Sir oh I be off to Peterson I 've be call back to Washington well it be good to see you again Sir it be good to see you too all of you give my good to teal'c take care of each other take care of General Landry too you be awake how be you feel after that little nap well than I 've feel all day how be that for irony how be Mitchell and Dr Jackson they be clean and Orlin I just run a battery of test on he I be afraid the effort of draw out all those memory have take a toll accelerate the degenerative process so he be in his quarter rest you look tired Carolyn you should get some sleep I can not not yet I can make that an order the last time you order I to bed I think I be six you be just as stubborn back then I speak to mum recently how be she worried all those year I be grow up I resent the fact that you never tell we anything about your work about why you have to leave we for day sometimes week at a time but now I be begin to understand how hard it must have be for you talk to mum the other day I want to reassure she to tell she everything but I could not it be hard unscheduled offworld activation it be teal'c low your weapon this be colonel Carter stand down what be go on Gerak have arrive to assist we why do you hesitate Gerak if I help you I will die but I will die free Gerak what the hell just happen I think the Ori be not allow to take action in this galaxy without in sight the ancient they can not it must have be some sort physiological failsafe they put in place when they make he a Prior in the event he ever turn they be normalize it work the final death toll of the pandemic have be estimate at a little over 3000 world wide but health official be quick to point out that it could have be much bad as distribution of the vaccine continue many have begin to ask how this could have happen in the first place and more to the point where do this virus originate we be lucky there might not be someone like Gerak to help we next time it be not just Gerak he cure the people in the Base from then we be able to isolate an antibody and manufacture a vaccine use Orlin 's formula thank to Orlin 's work we should be able to prevent the Priors from attack we in this way again oh I reckon they 've get a pretty wide repertoire the Ori will undoubtedly view this defeat as nothing more than a minor set back it will not be enough to dissuade they from continue their incursion into this galaxy certainly not if their end game be to destroy the ancient give the fact that they be personally threaten do you think the Ancients will take measure to defend themselves if it come to that it be possible but I think we be a long way from the Ori pose the ancient a serious threat no they be just a threat to everyone else in the galaxy so how be Orlin his condition have stabilize but I be afraid the damage have already be do hello hi who be you my name be Samantha do you need help with this Sure I finish the outside so you can help I with the inside okay open up this door I get he what the hell be go on Colonel Mitchell yeah what happen bring he oh my God Colonel Mitchell I be place you under arrest for the murder of Dr Reya Varrick Season 9 Episode 12 Collateral Damage sorry to keep you wait Emissary I be not expect anyone well I apologize for come so late but the Committee just complete its deliberation you 've choose a new leader for the project yes we have congratulation I be honor we expect great thing from you Doctor along with your new responsibility you will have a high security clearance you already know about the ring of course yes Sir what you do not know be that we 've use it to visit over a dozen inhabit world and there may be thousand more out there my God as ambassador to those world I 've see first hand the kind of technology that exist in the galaxy Giant ship capable of travel between the star weapon of immeasurable power Galar be vulnerable Doctor the project may be our only hope for survival we will do our good Sir Colonel how do you feel that be just weird I be have a conversation with you it be about a year ago but we just meet yesterday I be the one who have a conversation with Dr Varrick what you experience be my memory that be amazing believe I Dr Jackson this be just the beginning the memory be copy from the Emissary 's mind and splice into yours once there it be incorporate into your consciousness like a transplant organ become part of a new body I could swear I be there I do not really know what we be talk about but we be talk of course this be just a small demonstration we be still perfect the process but we believe eventually the device will become an invaluable educational tool imagine your most brilliant surgeon or engineer instantaneously transfer the full memory of their education and experience to young student you could conceivably cut their training time from year to mere week and you say you adapt this technology from a Goa'uld memory device that be correct if you do not mind our asking where do you get your hand on one this planet have be under the protection of the Asgard for many generation but it be originally occupy by the Goa'uld that device be discover by archeologist over 100 year ago but it be not until recently that our understanding of the technology advance to the point where we could create the memory transfer it be Dr Varrick who make the final breakthrough the Emissary be exaggerate I be just the last in a long line of scientist work on the project the last be the one who get it right what the Galaran 's have not perfect the memory implant technology to the point where it would have widespread application but from colonel Mitchell 's experience it sound like they be well on their way if they succeed it could artificially accelerate their technological advancement I think that be the point I be say it could be dangerous we be hardly in a position to judge Dr Jackson for the past nine year SG 1 have be routinely employ technology that be well beyond our level of advancement the Asgard be busy rebuild which mean they have not be around to do much protect the Galaran 's feel like they need to play catch up in all likelihood that be the reason they be seek a relationship with the Tau'ri they be undoubtedly aware of our success against the Goa'uld so what exactly do they want I mean aside from our goodwill and fellowship well right now they have no interstellar capability except for the Gate itself they 've be work on hyperdrive technology but without much success and they want to offer this memory device in exchange for our help well the emissary be reluctant to get into specific I think he want to wet our appetite for the technology before we start bargain well it work the joint chief be already salivate over the idea of training jet pilot in a manner of day we need to set up another meeting no need sir we 've already be invite back for a reception in honor of the scientist who develop the implant technology I be hope there will be dance Sir check that out even on an alien world a wallflower Dr Amuro he be work on the project for many year well it do not look like he be enjoy the party you know how it be with scientist we spend so much time in the lab I think that be where we feel most comfortable in your case I find that hard to believe be you suggest I do not work as hard as my colleague no no God no that be suppose to be a compliment Guess I will have to take your word for it no it be not that I do not appreciate the potential of the technology it be just that we be talk about your memory here it be fundamental to your identity if you can not trust it you be lose your memory be already less objected than you think it be Dr Jackson well he be get a point I mean just ask any cop whose have to take eyewitness testimony yes but there be a difference between get a license plate number wrong and not know if the four year you spend in college ever actually happen yes but that would never be the case because everyone receive the treatment would be aware of what they will get so long as the technology be not abuse well that be a risk with all new technology easily say by one who have not be the victim of such abuse excuse I Reya Dr Marell this be lieutenant colonel Mitchell we have to talk excuse I how be it go I do not think the diplomacy be my thing that be what you be do what nothing nothing Reya wait why be not I inform of this excuse I what you move up the test schedule and you select a group of volunteer when do this happen we 've be very impressed with your progress we think it be time to take your research to its next level you should take this as a compliment I notice all the test subject be military officer how should I take that this be still a classified operation you give I your personal assurance this project would remain under civilian control and so it have the military be simply make their contribution well I 've see what those contribution can lead to you be overreact and in any case this be hardly the place to discuss it this conversation be not over I will be back Reya wait up what be all that about I should have see this come they be go to take the project away from I why would they do that you be the one that figure it out which mean they no long need I I know where this be come from it be the general staff they want to control the technology without any interference from civilian scientist I swear I would not let that happen why be I tell you this you be a military officer yourself if you get your hand on the device the same thing will happen on your planet I be not a big fan of misusing technology on any planet and I might be able to help you out what do you mean well obviously your government be keen on form a relationship with mine that give we some leverage you would use your influence to help I I could try well I really do not want to go back out there maybe you could do I a favor and walk I home it be not far but I do not like to walk alone at night really do not they have crime on your planet oh yeah do not move the night the emissary tell you that they put you in charge of the project he come here right that be right this be weird I mean I know I 've never be here before but I recognize this place then you know where the drink be help yourself and pour I one too it be impressive do all government scientist live like this the success of the project have bring I a few privilege sometimes I feel a little guilty Most of my colleague from my day at the academy do not live nearly so well well I be sure you deserve it that do not pull any punch do it after the day I just have that be the whole point so you live here on your own why do you ask that be a big place I do not know just just curious I guess I think that be your clever way of ask if I be marry I be not that clever well anyway the answer be yes I live alone I be marry for a while but the job get in the way well that much I understand then we be not so different after all we should not do this you would not have come here if you do not want to I do not say I do not want to Emissary what be go on where be colonel Mitchell he be be take into custody why he kill Dr Varrick what that be insane when we find he his blood alcohol level be extremely high I suspect it be probably some kind of unpremeditated crime of passion we all know they leave the reception together that be hardly evidence we also find her blood on his hand and his fingerprint on the murder weapon but most importantly he confess Cam what happen I do not know I mean the whole night be just a blur I just remember feel this insane anger I do not know why I pick up the statue and I hit she with it she be lie there helpless and I it be not you ok these people can implant memory yeah I 've be try to tell myself the same thing all morning but it do not stop I from still see her face what if I tell you everything that happen to you yesterday be a false memory how would you know the difference the Emissary would like to speak with the prisoner we need to talk about this so call evidence you have against colonel Mitchell that will not be necessary Colonel Mitchell be free to return to Earth I be what I be try to convince the Cabinet to maintain your diplomatic status but I may not succeed wait a minute if they think I be guilty why be they let I go they believe it be in the good interest of interplanetary relation to put this difficult business behind we as quickly and as quietly as possible Colonel Mitchell have be falsely accuse which mean there could still be a murderer out there let us be realistic here very few people have access to the memory device even few have the skill to manipulate it in this manner and none that I can think of have any motive Colonel Mitchell should be grateful under our rule of evidence he would be convict of this crime I should be grateful to walk away and have this memory stick in my head for the rest of my life alright then if you agree to close the matter we can have the incident remove from your mind and replace it with a memory of a pleasant uneventful evening just like that forget it ever happen precisely on the other hand if you insist on a full investigation I will not be able to protect you if the evidence continue to point to your guilt you will be subject to the full force of our law and the penalty for murder be death Cameron we need to be really careful here we have no idea how their legal system work we do not know what kind of right Sam I need to do this I want to know what really happen you can tell the Galarans that until colonel Mitchell be return all trade talk be suspend he do not want to come back he want to force they to conduct a full investigation I do not give a damn what he want look General it be easy for we to sit here and be certain he do not do it but look at it from his point of view no matter what we say he be still go to have the memory of murder that woman with his own hand you say the Emissary offer to have the memory remove well he would still know that she have be kill and I be sure he would be curious why no one be hold accountable for it he be take an awful chance I believe it highly unlikely that the Galarans would execute colonel Mitchell it would severely hinder the possibility of future relation with the Tau'ri Sir I 've already speak with Dr Marrell he say they can use the implant technology to determine if the memory be genuine or not I do not want he hook up to that damn machine again without one of you present I will be observe the analysis in the meantime Teal'c and Daniel have be grant access to all the material relevant to the investigation very well Dr Marrell and Dr Amuro will be conduct the analysis now if there be anything else you require as a matter of fact there be I understand a sample of colonel Mitchell 's blood be take when he be arrest in order to determine his blood alcohol level yes we would like a portion of that sample send back to Stargate Command just to corroborate your result of course I will see to it you can take the guard with you this man have be accuse of murder I do not want they in my lab you can wait outside and you fella sure you want to be leave alone with I Dr Varrick be our colleague if we think for one minute you actually kill she we would not be help you then who do you think do kill her Reya be go to do everything she could to oppose the militarization of the project so they got rid of her why frame I they assume you would claim diplomatic immunity and therefore no prosecution would be necessary whole thing be to be sweep under the carpet they assume wrong and for that we be grateful can you prove the memory 's false well unfortunately Dr Varrick be the most qualified to do this work I be sure you will do fine please brain activity be extremely fluid we can not read a memory like open a drawer and pull out a file pattern shift and mutate one memory color another that be why it be so difficult to create a successful graft you have to be careful not to cause too many inconsistency Alright Colonel we need to establish a base line what I have do be identify a series of key memory from your childhood these be seminal moment they stand out like signpost and they influence everything that come after they I be go to activate one now Dr Peters to examination room 1 Dr Peters you alright yeah it be just weird what be you see I be in the V A hospital where they bring my father after his accident he be a test pilot right yeah it be the first time I see he after the crash scare the hell out of I to see he like that somehow he make it seem that everything be go to be ok we be move into a related memory now it be a couple of month later we be watch the launch of the first space shuttle God I can not be much more than ten year old go baby go what do you think of that Cam Space plane I tell you what if they can pull that off the least I can do be walk again right well do Colonel so what be next with this data we should be able to precisely calibrate the equipment and then come the hard part we will need to run through your memory of the murder we may have to do it several time great teal'c Dr Jackson what can I do for you we 've get a problem this data file be suppose to contain all the material relevant to the murder investigation but large section of Dr Varrick 's personal record have be delete well she be involve in a number of our most top secret project the deletion be make in the interest of national security but I be sure there be nothing in the missing material that have any baring on the investigation how be we to be certain because I be tell you we must be miss something we 've be through it three time what be the problem well maybe we should run another diagnostic it be not go to change the result I need some air so far we can not find any evidence that the memory be false accord to these result colonel Mitchell really do murder Dr Varrick Dr Marrell you have to continue with the analysis please you know he do not do this that be not what the machine say look I know Dr Varrick be your friend she be more than that Colonel she be my wife we have be separate for two year I guess I be still hope there might be a chance I can not help you Sir Dr Liam 's in surgery but she want you to see this right away it be the result of the analysis of colonel Mitchell 's blood sample anything useful yes Sir she want you to know that the troponin be negative but the C K and the myoglobin be up no wait the myoglobin be negative but the C K and the troponin be up no wait Walter Sir whatever it be it mean that when the sample be take colonel Mitchell have be recently either stunned or render unconscious by some kind of electrical charge like a Zat Gun yes Sir or some such similar thing this be hardly proof of colonel Mitchell 's innocence well on Earth you have to prove guilt I know we be not on Earth I will admit its enough to suggest to they that the investigation should continue but Dr Marrell have express reluctance to help you any further at least let we talk to he I be sorry about Reya she tell I she have be marry she do not tell I it be you would it have make any difference I do not kill she even if I want to help you there be nothing more I can do why not well as you know we use colonel Mitchell 's own memory to establish a comparative standard and normally that should have be enough to identify any false reading but we be unable to do so which mean either the memory be genuine or the transfer be so expertly do that the ordinary method of detect it be useless what other method be there well the only way would be to compare what happen the other night with a genuine memory of similar content and emotional resonance so unless colonel Mitchell 's make a habit of kill innocent people we be out of option I may have what you need hook I up there it be what be we look at the emotional resonance pattern of this memory be very similar to that of Dr Varrick 's murder Mustang leader this be Mustang 3 do we have a confirmation on the target yet Negative Mustang 3 AWACS report we be still wait on intel maintain cap I have tally a three vehicle convoy just like the man say copy that 3 we be still try to confirm that the target be in the convoy Triple A on my three breaking leave his heart rate just shoot up Breathings shallow I be take fire do we have a confirmation yet not exactly friendly sky out here boy and girl can I get a confirmation on that target Mustang 3 you be clear hot repeat you be clear hot pretty sure about this that be affirmative bump up to 1500 for reacquisition Roger that weapon be armed Bomb away Mustang 3 Mustang 3 Abort Abort what no no no no the bomb be away what the hell 's go on Mustang leader we 've lose confirmation on the target you 've get to be kid I can you confirm hit Stand by the target be destroy oh shit sorry about that Captain we be rely on local ally intelligence so obviously someone drop the ball who be the target be he in the convoy or not do not do this to yourself who be in the convoy Sir as far as we know it be a group of refugee this be not your fault but it do not change the fact that I have to live with it for the rest of my life please tell I you get what you need we be analyze the result now just give we a few moment you ok no it work the new datum indicate that the memory of Reya 's murder be implant thank God I will inform the Emissary Hang on a second we may have prove that I do not kill she but we be not finish not by a long shot I have to know who do it and I be not leave here until we find out what exactly be we look for because we know the memory be implant we can expect to find anomaly little moment where the brain be simply incapable of deal with the inconsistency that arise as a result of the graft now often these take the form of missing time or sudden change in the identity of people around we typically they centre on the splice point where the memory start and stop the problem be they can often be difficult to detect hey Sam Thanks he be ready you want to see we I understand Dr Marrell and Dr Amuro be able to determine that the memory be an implant I must say I be relieve a trial could have be extremely detrimental to relation between our world not to mention inconvenient for colonel Mitchell yes of course I be sure he would like to return to Earth as soon as possible actually he be still in the lab Colonel Mitchell believe that an analysis of the false memory could prove useful in determine the true identity of the murderer I be sorry but I will not allow it we 've already be more than generous in put our most important scientist and facility at your disposal to determine colonel Mitchell 's innocence but now it be time they get back to their research look all we be ask for be a little more time the project be already behind schedule Dr Marrell be the most qualified to lead the research now and his new responsibility preclude he from participate in this investigation anymore Colonel Mitchell be assault his memory be manipulate against his will and an innocent woman be murder now I 've only work with the guy a short period of time but I be pretty sure he be not go to let this one go and if you want to get in his way let us just say when it come time to decide if we want to pursue this relationship his opinion 's go to carry a lot of weight Cam no I be good well be you sure you wanna continue this it be possible that there be no anomaly or that they could be bury so deep we will never find they even if we go over it 100 time it be the least I can do for she now let us keep go alright there be nothing here there have to be I will find it Marrell I know she mean a lot to you but how much long can we put the poor man through this he want to do it look we know the memory 's false by comparison there must be some other indication we 've be through this a dozen time the splice point be indistinguishable I know but I now realize that be because he be render unconscious before the procedure be begin and he be still unconscious long after it be complete the whole thing have the quality of a dream it be jumble up in his mind alright so what can we do about it Focus on the inconsistency in the memory itself but what if there be not any I be waste my time explain this to you can I do my work how be he do not too good do not sound like you be make a lot of progress Marrell 's determined but I do not know the graft appear to be flawless I 've get something there you see it yes what be it it be what we 've be look for Colonel Mitchell can you hear I yeah we 've identify a point in the memory where we think there may be an anomaly I be go to activate it now I want you to tell I what you see I be in the house I be walk down the hallway no no whoa I I 've lose it go back just a minute stop there can you run it again maybe slow it down a little I see my reflection my reflection in the mirror but the face be blurry it be an anomaly if the reflection in the mirror be not your own your brain can not deal with it that be why it be blurry can you clean it up I think so what do you see who be it it be he be you sure Positive it be Marrell that be impossible if he kill she why would he be help we I mean he want to reveal the identity of the murderer more than anyone what if he do not know what you be say he kill she and then implant the memory in colonel Mitchell and then erase it from his own mind be that possible theoretically yes but this be insane I love she but she leave you do not she and you never get over it then you see I leave the party with her look it be impossible well there be one way to find out for sure if he really do erase his own memory he would have have to replace it with something else we can check for anomaly the same way we do with colonel Mitchell go ahead you will not find anything we find that he have two identical memory one from the night of the murder one from several night before except no two memory be exactly the same it be like signature when they be identical that be when you know they 've be forge as far as he know he be in bed sleep the whole time he do not want to just fool we he want to fool himself to get rid of the guilt and that be what do he in we be do how do you feel fine I guess I 've erase the implant you should no long have the image of kill Dr Varrick in your mind but all of your genuine memory should be intact I still remember she Thanks Dr Amuro and you must be our visitor from Earth be you alright well no obviously you 've hear what happen to Reya to be honest I still can not believe she be really go but I I talk it over with the emissary and we both agree that the good thing for I now be to get back to work it be nice to meet you what the hell be this he think she die in an accident and he will continue to think that for the rest of his life you be go to just let he get away with murder he do not know he kill she there be no way to recover that memory and that be suppose to make it ok it be for the good of the project and Dr Varrick would have understand that I read your report not sure I 've ever see language like that use in an official Air Force document before sorry about that Sir oh you should have see what colonel Carter and Dr Jackson write yes Sir Colonel Carter tell I what you have to do to prove your innocence something about relive a difficult memory of course she do not know what it be all about she have not read your service record like I have I have not think about it in a long time but I guess something like that never go away do it no when it happen I almost resign my commission I be glad you do not I understand how you feel but leave the air force will not change what happen will not make you feel any well you know you suck at pep talk dad I be just be realistic what else be you go to do become an airline pilot fly the New York DC shuttle five time a day Mow the lawn on sunday that do not sound too bad yeah well for someone else maybe but now for you it could have be easy if you have grow up to be more like your mother but you be just like I always look to the horizon always look for something more no I be not like you dad I be not that strong no that be where you be wrong kid you just do not know it yet unscheduled offworld activation what the hell be that I do not know Sir we be receive SG 1 's IDC they be back early open the iris there be nothing on your end nothing out of the ordinary to account for what we hear no Sir it be perfectly routine we just dial the Gate and step through Gate diagnostic show no irregularity still I would like you to double check the datum once we be do here yes Sir tell I about the planet well we can confirm that the local be visit by a Prior two week ago he perform the standard miracle heal the sick cure the blind and pass out the usual literature the native be easy picking they feel as though they be abandon by their God Amaterasu and Ba'al excuse I you say Amaterasu accord to the background file P4R be once under Ba'al 's control P4R Sir we go to PX7 455 I believe you have the wrong report anyway the Tok'ra have be monitor the inroad that the Ori have be make in the region for quite some time accord to Selmak they be take advantage of the relationship between do you just say Selmak indeed teal'c Selmak be dead Sir Selmak and Jacob be very much alive Offworld activation Chief it be SG 1 's IDC Sir this be when they be originally schedule to come back Defense team stand by open the iris Season 9 Episode 13 Ripple Effect well accord to the test I 've run they be both SG 1 identical in every way how be that possible well we know Ba'al 's able to produce adult clone of himself Presumably he could do the same with our people give sample of their dna that do not explain how they know SG 1 's IDC and if their Intel be good enough to get their hand on something that sensitive then how come they do not know about Selmak yeah it be like they get the hard stuff right and the easy stuff wrong Ba'al would have know well you know the first team be make some pretty wild claim about people in past event and since the second team come back from the right planet at the scheduled time it be safe to assume that they be the real SG 1 okay then who be the other team and where have they come from exactly we check their story out we go to PX7 445 the planet they claim to have gate in from the local there swear they would never lay eye on we so this other team be lie not necessarily Sir it be possible they do gate in from PX7 just not the PX7 that we know the multiverse theory of quantum physics deposit the existence of parallel universe an infinite number of ever grow alternate reality that exist concurrently with our own the theory hold that anything that can happen will happen if not in this reality then in another so you be say that somewhere in an alternate universe I get to second base with Amy Pandenberg theoretically yes boggle the mind do not it we be part of a metaverse in which individual subuniverse be continually be generate our own experience with the quantum mirror prove as much reality can exist where we never defeat the Goa'uld or the Stargate program go public and Selmak be still alive exactly now while it may feel immediate the journey between Gates be not instantaneous it take on average 0 3 second travel time however accord to Gate diagnostic the travel time for the other SG 1 team clock in at 3 4 second suggest a significantly long trip ok say for example we accept the possibility that this be an alternate SG 1 from a parallel universe how do they get here I get nothing yet Sumatra Mandheling one cream two sugar lucky guess usually I have instant myself so I be guess this almost feel like home do not it almost like home but if it be home I would be sit where your sitting and you would be sit here tell I I would love to help you but I have no idea what be go on I be think one of two possible scenario a Carter 's right and you be from an alternate universe in which case we will do everything we can to get you back home or b you be not who you say you be in which case we need to find out what you be really after actually there be a third scenario C you be not who you say you be and it be up to we to find out what you be after I understand your reluctance to trust we but rest assure we be just as eager to get to the bottom of this as you be no offence but I be not entirely sell on the alternate world theory there be nothing on our mission to PX7 that would even hint at it no quantum mirror no weird alien artifact it be a routine op but you be tell I that somehow the Gate send we through to a parallel universe even though we know it be not suppose to work like that and yet here you be assume of course this be the SGC SG 1 six year ago wake up in what they think be the SGC turn out they be not really on Earth and it be all part of an elaborate Goa'uld plot Pegasus Galaxy last year a team from the Atlantis base gate through to what they think be the SGC turn out they be not really on Earth it be another planet and they be be manipulate by alien let I put your mind at ease we be neither the Goa'uld nor manipulative alien you will forgive I Sir if I do not take your word for it we win our freedom in the battle for Dakara and on that day not only do we defeat Ba'al and the replicator you ensure that Anubis would never again threaten this Galaxy and then all Jaffa be unite under our new leader bra'tac bra'tac really that that that have not happen here yet and with the new threat to this galaxy I return to SG 1 right along with colonel Mitchell myself and eventually colonel Carter who rejoin follow her follow her honeymoon what no I be go to say follow her stay on the Prometheus Honeymoon indeed we be not able to stop the Ori from establish the second beachhead by the time we realize it be too late they have already send their ship through if it happen in our reality there be a good chance it could happen in ours as well they destroy Chulak Dakara most of the Jaffa stronghold it be only a matter of time before they attack Earth you have to find a way to get we back I be work on it I 've be go over the Gate diagnostic and there be an unidentifiable energy spike just prior to your arrival it be almost certainly relate to the sound they hear but I be still analyze the datum we be on PX7 for over 24 hour gather intel and yet when your team go back to the planet no one recognize you now that suggest that our point of departure be definitely in our universe so what ever happen have to have happen between the time you step through the Gate on your end and the time you step through the Gate on this end except the Gate system be not design to transport matter between universe it be not design to take you back in time either but it have before do you notice any no unusual weather pattern or solar flare activity at the time then be it conceivable something else could have affect the wormhole what could possibly exert that kind of influence on a subspace matter stream a black hole a black hole as we discuss the situation we realize we could pinpoint the source of the phenomenon to a precise window specifically the in term journey between the two Gates do she just say we pardon I she say we you say we ah I and myself I suppose the other Samantha Carter right finally someone who can keep up with you Yep ok this be PX7 455 their point of departure and this be Earth their point of arrival the wormhole that bring they here cross this section of space bisecting this singularity the black hole that be create when we destroy the Ori beachhead exactly now I be theorize that when they bisect the singularity subspace be rupture create a rift in the space time continuum that bring that SG 1 in to this universe but we 've have team gate in from location on the other side of that black hole in our universe why be not they affect one more stupid question oh sorry your be fine mine be stupid why do not we end up on alternate PX7 when we gate through to check out bizarre SG 1 's story I can not answer that as far as I know the deviation be one way and specific to that particular wormhole however just to be on the safe side I would suggest that we reroute all Gate travel around the singularity for the time be unscheduled offworld activation what do you have for I now Walter Sir it be SG 1 's IDC again do you want I to send a confirmation if another team come through they will just be strand like the first one receive radio transmission let us hear it Stargate Command this be Mitchell what be the hold up we 've get a situation here Sir if we do not open the iris Stargate Command do you read Defense team open the iris what the hell 's go on so much for this phenomenon be restrict to one wormhole I may have underestimate its influence it be possible the first spatial tear may have cause a ripple effect across several reality transform an area of their subspace into a kind of funnel that be redirect their Gate travel to this universe any wormhole pass close enough to the black hole be be draw into the singularity and reroute here so you be tell I we be the hub the convergence point yes Sir it might account for why Gate travel in this universe be not affect might account Colonel Mitchell Sir Inform all off world team to proceed to the Alpha site until further notice Gate travel to and from Stargate Command will be suspend indefinitely what if there be more team come in hot Sir I be willing to make the occasional exception but I be not about to turn this base into the grand central station of the Multiverse dismiss why be it that every team that have come through the Gate so far have be exclusively an alternate SG 1 I mean how come no alternate SG 2s or SG 3s well SG 1 be the frontline team the one most likely to get into trouble offworld and as a result the team we would most likely have to let through right so far we 've have to turn back over 50 team and not all of they have be SG 1 here be the really interesting part each team from each reality have dial in from a different point of origin no repeat all originate from a corridor of space start from Earth and pass within a few degree of the singularity what about that superfluous energy signature have that happen again no not since the first alternate team dial in any idea what it be I be not sure but it remind I of the incident on K'Tau in that case we introduce an unstable super heavy element into their sun 's nuclear reaction when the wormhole that bring we there pass directly through it but in this case the wormhole 's pass through a black hole so who know what the effect would be I think we could use the help yeah I suppose two head be well than one unscheduled offworld activation let us get to work General I be just about to come find you I have contact bra'tac on Dakara he have dispatch a mothership to the location provide to we by the other colonel Carter if the Ori attempt to establish a second beachhead then the Jaffa should give we a head up Presuming of course if event play out the same way in both universe to this point the particular of the vary universe have remain remarkably similar that be what I want to talk to you about another sg 1 come through twenty minute ago which put the count at twelve team not include yourself well at least we be in good company well this last team be a little different in term of personnel how so well there be someone I think you might like to talk to Daniel teal'c where 's General O'Neill I be sure you all have a lot to catch up on Janet Dr Frasier what be go on here Janet this this may look like home to you but it be not this be not the Stargate Command you leave we be not the Daniel and Teal'c you know you and your team gate to a parallel reality this be an alternate SGC on an alternate Earth in an alternate universe in our reality Dr Janet Frasier die 2 year ago sixteen different SG 1s sixteen different point of origin but only one point of convergence this universe now give the fact that previous trip through the black hole do not produce a rupture in the subspace structure they may not have of produce the rupture but it be entirely possible that their repeat trip contribute to the deterioration of the space time fabric that weaken eventually seed to the singularity create the bridge between the various reality and I be think that the proximity of these reality in relation to each other may account for the absence of the entropic cascade failure but it still do not help we with the main problem how do we reverse the process I do not have the answer to this because if I do we all would not be here Coffee no thank you you know I can not help but think this whole thing would be a lot easy if Hammond have not order we to destroy the quantum mirror we could just use that to send all these team back to their proper reality how I mean there be a near infinite number of parallel universe the chance of we find the right home universe for even one of these team be next to impossible excuse I Colonel Carter my colonel Carter here Sir I 've bring another volunteer who be offer to help Martouf hello Samantha I remember the mission to P3X I be tend to a wound airman we come under fire you be there you help I stabilize he and get we out of there no I do not you be hit by an errant staff blast and and kill instantly you be honor with a hero funeral lucky I hopefully you will be able to return to your world soon hopefully yeah for the moment it look like your your trip here be only one way no no you have to find a way to get we back as soon as possible yes Sam and Dr Lee be work on something but you do not understand we have be target by the Ori Earth be be ravage by a plague hundred of thousand have be infect if we do not find a cure the entire planet will be wipe out so how be thing in your universe you mean between we I be a little curious thing develop but with you be on the other side of the galaxy well long distance relationship can be difficult I eventually join the Stargate program to be close to you we work together even live together for quite some time but in the end thing do not work out you be with someone else now who I think I have something this be the postmortem analysis of the P3W 451 incident a planet whose orbit stray too close to a black hole one of our team be attempt to gate back at the same time and as a result the SGC could not shut down the Gate from this end I do not see what this we be unable to sever the connection because Stargate Command be still connect to the singularity 's gravitational field through the open Stargate but we be not try to in that case we use a shape charge to deliver an energy surge to the matter stream force the matter stream to jump to a different Gate thereby sever the connection that could explain the sound they hear and the superfluous energy signature that accompany the matter stream from the first wormhole it be some sort of la maybe a supernova or a gamma ray burst discharge at the exact millisecond that wormhole pass through that singularity it be a one in a billion fluke that rupture subspace and create the point of confluence that draw the affected reality into this one and then to seal the bridge between the multiverse we have to target that point of confluence basically recreate the circumstance that cause the breach in the first place but how be that possible you you say it yourself it be a one in a billion freak incident well the odd would increase significantly if we take the wormhole out of the equation then what happen to we we would be strand here I consider not tell you about this I understand why you hesitate but you make the right decision by seal the rupture we will ensure no other team get strand here that be provide that this actually work I mean we still have one major obstacle to overcome how do we deliver an explosive device into the singularity we get help from a friend Thor send his apology for not attend personally but he and Heimdall be in the neighboring galaxy deal with a most sensitive matter in his stead I have convey the time dilation device as request we appreciate your quick response Vaseer so what do you think will this work I prefer not to prognosticate well do not prognosticate just tell we what your gut feeling be speculate on the matter would serve no practical purpose Joseph and Mary what be the odd Less than 12 and that be provide you be able to in act the plan before the black hole 's gravity decimate your ship Damn that be cold Colonel Mitchell Colonel Carter I be give it the green light shut this thing down you know I read all the mission report on the Asgard they be not that I expect what be you expect well pant for one the distance between the launch point and the target be crucial and you must be precise in your calculation I know the slight oversight in either the timing of the explosion or the proximity of your ship to the singularity could result in a fail mission at good certain death at bad I be sorry I be have a hard time concentrate I understand you be tired allow I to complete the calibration for you knock yourself out Time and again we 've manage to save Earth and its ally from the most dire threat situation in which we face unassailable odd almost certain defeat but we always manage to find a way to prevail in the end I be sorry I wish there be a way I could send you home or at the very least delay the mission so you have no choice but to do what be good for your world I assume yours be not the only SG team in your reality that be actively search for a cure to the plague no and I have a feeling that your Samantha Carter be back home work on the problem she stop be my Samantha a long time ago I 've miss you I have complete the calibration thank you Vaseer General Sorry to disturb you I be wonder if I could have a word of course Doctor Come in thank you Sir I would like to make a request on behalf of all of the team strand in this reality please postpone this mission until we can find a way to get home I can not do that we need our team out there gather intel on the Ori threat instead of sit on their hand here wait for normal Gate operation to resume and that will not be possible until this problem be deal with well I can empathize Sir believe I I think you need to take a look at the big picture this go beyond this world beyond this galaxy this universe hundred of billion of life be at stake their survival could hinge on not just our return but the return of every SG 1 strand on this base Sir back in my universe Earth be face a global pandemic one that your planet have already face and beat you have the cure that could save my world all I have to do be get it to they I can also empathize but at the risk of sound callous my priority be with this world how can you prioritize the life of one group over those of another what make my Earth any less important than your own we have the top mind from 18 different universe work on a way to get you home now hopefully they can come up with a solution before this mission be complete but if they can not then I be sorry Doctor we finish load the warhead and the time dilation generator once the system check be complete we be good to go where be the crew you be look at it give the danger we may face it be decide that we proceed alone so if this plan go fubar we be the only one that go down with the ship well there be plenty more where we come from right the perilous nature of this mission should not be take lightly there be a chance the Prometheus may not survive this voyage but courage and a steadfast resolve will prove the most valuable asset in this undertaking well good luck to you all I miss Thor of course by the time he actually get around to drink that orange juice it would have be sit in the back of the fridge for what a month yeah yeah yeah oh yep he be so damn thirsty he knock it right back it be a second or two before he actually breathe in at which point Spit take of all spit take there be orange juice on the table the chair on Aunt Emma Aunt Emma oh oh big old fat Emma sit across the table little bit of bacon on her face orange juice drip off her nose Reminiscing over old time yeah hell I could talk to this guy all day no doubt you finish your shift yeah I be exhausted I be go to bed speak of which I think it be past my bedtime and you need your beauty sleep Woah who be talk so how have it go I find a way round all the security protocol everything be set Perfect by the time they figure out what happen it will be too late Show time we be approach the singularity calculate minimal prime distance to warhead launch Come on Carter I 've get it relay the information receive engage sublight engine proceed to co ordinate we 've reach the target location yeah I hear yeah I think they be just circle like we be park I should warn you I 've be practice those Sodan move you be warn would not it have be easy just to zat he easy yes but far less gratify do he just insult I what be go on there be be a change of flight plan you want to tell we what be go on we be make an unscheduled detour yeah just how far out of our way be this little detour go to take we about 3 week you be plan on take this ship to Atlantis I mean give the parallel between our two reality I can not think of anywhere else we will be go as soon as we complete our mission we will drop you at the near habitable planet ' till then have fun three week well that give we time to think of something Idea 's anyone give the unique circumstance we find ourselves in it be possible to anticipate their action and reaction all we must do be think like they well should not be that hard the other colonel Mitchell wish to speak with you you be just go to ignore he for the next three week you guy seem reasonable and you have not hurt we much you do not have a beard so you be not from the evil twin universe right good right so if I know I like I do I would have a pretty damn good reason to be do what you guy be do bottom line be I would understand well than anyone so level with I what be go on let I ask you something how far would you go to save the life of every man and woman on Earth do not bother I already know the answer if you be in my situation you would be do the exact same thing what go after the ZPM come on why else would you be go to Atlantis our ZPM be deplete we need yours to power the ancient weapon in Antarctica oh right screw our Earth to save your own all that ZPM be do right now be allow one way travel from the Pegasus galaxy to Earth the billion of life that we save be worth more than the inconvenience of slop back and forth on the Daedalus we need that ZPM to cloak Atlantis if the Wraith come back and discover the City be not destroy they will launch another attack if Atlantis fall this galaxy be the next target if the Wraith return if they attack if the City be destroy the threat we face be more immediate that still do not give you the right to do this well say it work say that you can beam the ZPM of Atlantis how do you plan to get it back to your own universe you have a way back you 've plan this all along well we be right they be go after the ZPM you sure you can open the door hey I help build this thing open the door the easy part it be take the ship back that will be tricky the armory be this way no teal'c go to the armory on the next level it be less likely you will be spot Daniel and I will head to the engine room and pull the control crystal once they come to investigate the problem we will get the drop on they there very well hey you have to give it a shot I know I would so now that we know how you get out we will just have to make sure it do not happen again no hit so while we be up here we be down on the next level break into the other armory how do you know I be not your Mitchell Easy if we be in your position we would have do the same thing let I get this straight we figure that you guy would try to escape and we set this trap for you not realize that you would figure out that we would figure you out and you would set your own indeed now can you take we to our colonel Mitchell Sam disable the power relay run through these wall so I would not bother Ideas anyone Walter Sir it be a subspace communication from the Prometheus let us hear it yes Sir Sir this be colonel Carter Good to hear from you Colonel I take it the mission be a success no Sir in fact we be scrape the mission and head back home Colonel Sir I think I figure out a way to send these team back to their proper reality and how do we do that by do exactly the same thing the first team do in order to get here you be tell I they plan this from the get go yes Sir it account for the boom you hear and the extra energy signature the Gate diagnostic pick up in the first matter stream they open the wormhole through the black hole and then blast a bridge into this universe be not that how Carter describe it I do not know I just remember Wormhole black hole blast Colonel Carter Sir we 've establish a wormhole to PX7 455 now when sergeant Siler be finish we will fire the direct energy weapon through the Gate if I be right it should reverse the space time rupture effectively invert the convergence effect each team gate in from a different point of origin once the convergence effect have be reverse we will dial those different point of origin and create wormhole that will follow the inter universal pathway already create by their initial trip here I get it I get it they be go back Ready when you be Sir Clear the Gateroom I will need the weapon back once your work here be complete it be after all only on loan to you temporarily I know you will get it back when we be do low the blast door fire the weapon we have a stable wormhole 3 4 second it work open the blast door bring they in Hey Mitchell when the time comes cut the green one what the hell do that mean I do not know but I 've the feeling that someday you be go to find out have all the other team leave Sir you be the last one to go it be nice work with you again Sam your presence have be sorely miss on our team just out of curiosity where do I go maternity leave we have something for you the cure to the Prior 's plague thank you General it be good to see you again you too may it not be the last time well we would love to stay but we have a planet to save Bye Democracy be the future of our great nation we must proceed with the dissolution of this Council which we have see can be influence and corrupt I hereby formally propose we hold a public referendum of the subject so that all Jaffa can participate in the decision before we thank you Brother Maz'rai your wisdom be always greatly appreciate by the Council now I call sister Ka'lel as the last speaker before rebuttal will be hear Brother Bra'tac I be afraid I must begin rebuttal against dissolution of the Council our people be not yet ready for this burden Bra'tac you underestimate they Sister my position on this Council be secure by the might of the Haktyl but it be well know that many region do not yet recognize any right for female let alone the right to vote on their destiny I agree there must be change such change must occur prior to a general vote so that its result can be view as fair and representative Kal'el Kal'el do she not just speak of her support for our proposal just this morning privately yes I would not have call on she otherwise then why would she betray we in session someone have influence she still I have always believe Kal'el to be honorable be there no end to this duplicity we must face sometimes I fear I have get too old for this Brother indeed and yet this be what result when we leave such decision to the rash of youth I will speak with her Kal'el please forgive the intrusion not at all I be glad you be here we must speak may I ask why you do not support our proposal now be not the time we have no choice Kal'el I be afraid as far as you be concern that be true Season 9 Episode 14 Stronghold hi I be Lieutenant colonel Mitchell I be here to see Bryce Ferguson Colonel Mitchell yes Ma'am hello I be Dr Kelly Nice to meet you I 've have a chance to see your friend Great Dr Lam say you be the good well that be very nice of she to say I be not aware of any official rank system well I be sure you will be a little well than Fergie 's H M o back in Iowa well I will do what I can I 've order some test they should give we a well idea of what we be look at yeah he be have that shrapnel for a while they just find the aneurysm a few week ago he probably have it the whole time and do not know it he say his doctor back home have throw in the towel on this one well I will not lie to you it be in a tricky spot but as you know we have access to certain technology not available to everyone else just yet yes Ma'am Thanks I be tell he be not privy to classify material no so you get he in here but you could not get he clearance that be a whole other ball of wax the irony be he probably would 've have my spot in the 302 program if he have not be injure he be a well pilot than I ever be well than most actually this must be important to you I imagine you have to pull some pretty big string to make this happen Ferguson get that chunk of metal in his head save my sorry ass four year ago I will do what I can thank and so upon further reflection I have come to agree with Kal'el more debate over the propose state of government be require we must take our time in such grave matter for now we must maintain the present high Council and not bow to the pressure of brother bra'tac and Teal'c Maz'rai I be entitle to be sway by reason bra'tac you be the one who table this proposal for a referendum you have always believe democracy be essential for the future of our nation indeed that be still the case I have merely be convince that we should not act in such haste Brother it be you who fear that Gerak 's follower be gather strength that there be a danger that if we do not dissolve this Council they could still vote to support the unilateral submission to the religion of the Ori all our dream for a free Jaffa nation would be lose forever all I be say be that I believe there be yet more time for healthy debate we can not let this proposal die there be still Council member who remain uncommitted Brother U'kin be not in session today I will visit he later this evening after I confer with our ally on Chulak and I will see what I can learn here if Maz'rai 's vote be influence I shall expose it Ferguson it be about time Son of a bitch drag I out here to get poke and prod and turn upside down and he can not spare a minute from his big important job to visit his die friend ah it be good to see your bad attitude have not change much what do you expect I be die for God sake do not have to get up you idiot oh Cam I be not go to break you look like you be feel good yeah I be do pretty good for a guy with a tick time bomb in his head well why do not we see what the doctor have to say about that oh I be just do what the flyer say it be in the waiting room of the shrink 's office they send I to a couple week back so you be go to bite the big one now what first thing on the list be accept it learn to talk openly about it so that be what I be do do I mention I be go to die yeah I think you do okay so how about you how be the big important top secret job still top secret oh come on man you can tell I I be not go to tell anyone I be go to die you know no flower no no hell I think about it but I decide on this instead oh yes I likey a lotty Colonel Dr Jackson Bra'tac have information concern a situation on Dakara it be teal'c he leave last night to consult with one of our ally he be due back this morning but do not return you sure he be not just late he miss an important Council session there have be unusual going on as of late I be here because I no long know who I can trust on Dakara and I be certain something be gravely wrong I will divulge nothing that be not my intention my purpose be to teach you obviously this motion to dissolve the Council in favor of elect official have spawn strong opposition many who have reap benefit under the current regime would lose their status upon passage of the vote anybody in particular you think would resort to kidnapping and blackmail to influence the situation I use to believe in the honor of many who have disappoint I of late well we should probably start at Teal'c 's last known whereabout let I know if you need additional personnel Colonel Mitchell be take some personal time thank you Sir come on come on no you do not want none of I no you do not oh oh now do not look now you would well back down die yeah that be what I be talk what the hell be that be you even try you know what I be just I be kind of tired but this this this be great really this be just like old time tell you what I will play leave hand with one eye yeah I be do Alright fine I reserve the right for a rematch Fair enough look I I appreciate you take some time but what be you talk about I be just say you do your duty you can go now I 've get nowhere else to be really seriously Cam it be fine you do not have to stick around yes I do I wish I could be of more help Bra'tac but Teal'c leave last night barely an hour after arrive do he say where he be go he say he be need back on Dakara be anybody with he he travel alone please let I know as soon as you have learn what have happen what be the matter Brother you call yourself a friend yet you speak lie to my face whoa Bra'tac he be deceive we where be teal'c Bra'tac what have come over you I have tell you what I know I will not ask again he be take from here I do not know where please what be that all about I believe he speak the truth he do not know where Teal'c be but he admit he helped arrange for Teal'c 's kidnapping and he shall be deal with accordingly unfortunately for we this situation be much bad than I imagine how U'kin have always be one of the strong supporter of our cause a Jaffa whose honor I never would have doubt there be but one possible explanation for his action I see it in his eye he be be brainwash you know I never do buy that you go down in a test flight why that be what happen okay so you you be test a plane in a dogfight over Antarctica Dogfight I do some check I still have friend in intelligence right you think you be get your hand on classify information not exactly I piece some thing together come on we be both up for that big important classified position I just want to know what I miss out on that almost get you kill I wish I could tell you I really do no you do not no you probably feel guilty as hell that you be do what you be do while I be wait to die read the flyer man it be call survivor 's guilt now it also say that you need to be honest with yourself and those around you speak it do not seem to be work as I fear his will be strong I will break he whatever it take no no I will deal with this hello teal'c you seem it be time we have a little chat I 've recall colonel Carter and SG 3 from Chulak do we have any idea how widespread this brainwashing might be it be impossible to tell but it explain how many alliance have shift so dramatically over the course of the last three week for all we know half the high Council may have be compromise you believe Goa'uld technology be behind this Teal'c once fall prey to it at the hand of Apophis but he be able to break its hold by endure the rite of M'al Sharran anyone include a Jaffa could have their hand on that technology now still the fact that Teal'c overcome such manipulation in the past should make he more able to resist its effect again which may actually put his life at great risk Bra'tac you say a close friend of yours Maz'rai have a similar change of opinion virtually overnight yes it be likely he too be brainwash right I guess what I be get at be be it possible you could get he to defeat the brainwashing the same way Teal'c do and if so at the very least he might be able to give we an idea as to who be behind this I admit we 've certainly have our difference in the past but you need to hear what I have to say I will not hear the word of a false god ah yes the whole god issue maybe we do take it a little too far but can you blame we we give you strength vitality long life I know you do not quite see it that way but no matter it be all in the past now come now teal'c we be smart enough to know we be not actually god well some of we be anyway there be always those who will begin to believe their own propaganda I suppose all you need be enough people to worship you and then what be the difference you be pretty much a god by definition be you not so be the case with the Ori grant they do seem to have some very interesting power to back up their claim I 've see what happen to those who resist they be a formidable enemy how do this concern you and I we work together to defeat the Replicators this be work together take I against my will brainwash the Council to do your bidding the Jaffa number in the million spread across the vastness of the galaxy your background be diverse and rich in a history of warfare with each other because of the Goa'uld as a united nation you be young and inexperienced too weak to face an adversary as powerful as the Ori Gerak prove that what you need right now be a strong leader one with the mind and experience to wage war on such a foe you I be not ask you to worship I I do not plan to undermine your freedom I care nothing for your right and tradition or what you wish to do with your daily life what I do not want to see happen be the utter subjugation of this entire galaxy at the hand of the Ori that would be an utter shame for all of we do not make this personal teal'c your people be in need and I can help they I can help all of we defend ourselves against the Ori that be an absurd accusation you know I Bra'tac I choose my opinion carefully that be true no really it be we check these out of the hall of record before come here six month ago you co author policy measure design to prevent voting abuse by Gerak 's coalition four month ago you vote in favor of increase the size of Council to give unrepresented Jaffa a voice and just three week ago you introduce a motion to set limit on the Council 's legislative power be we see a pattern here you believe in democracy Maz'rai how else do you explain your action I do not deny my belief my thinking on the proper timing and strategy for implementation be what be change two evening ago do you remember clearly what you do bra'tac I do not remember what I eat yesterday that be sad I admit but proof of nothing other than old age Age have take away everything but our wisdom old friend those be your word to I just before you table a referendum for democracy tell I one thing that happen the night before last then I will let this rest please leave I I be weary Bra'tac we have reach he trust I face the rite of M'al Sharran be something one must do with clear mind and conviction we must give he time Dr Peterson to room 5 B Dr Peterson to room do you know what I think you be do sleep I think you be fight alien I think that chunk of metal you 've get in your cranium have cause a lot of damage I know you be not test fly a plane down in Antarctica you be fight an alien armada in human build alien hybrid fighter and we 've get like a whole fleet of they and at least a couple of interstellar battleship whatever you say man the info be out there the military they could not build all that stuff themselves they would have to contract it out I do some consulting for an aeronautics firm call Zephyr when I first go on disability come on man I be season enough to see through all the bogus cover story they 've be blow around the last couple of year I mean what really happen to that building in Seattle a couple month back and that strange new influenza outbreak that sweep the globe do not that start in a hospital near here look Ferguson no I know I know you can not tell I it do not really matter the point be I know that whatever you be into it be big I mean it be big than we ever dream of even back when we be cadet and we swear that blood oath that we would make it into the space program or die try look I be not some crazy conspiracy nut Cam I know you 've get thing to do besides sit here wait for I to die go I find it help if you hit it oh that be alright I probably should not have any more caffeine I get the result back from the cat scan and well it pretty much confirm Mr Ferguson 's own doctor 's finding the shrapnel originally lodge itself against an intracranial artery and over the course of the next few year form the aneurysm give its size and relative position we risk do more damage if we attack it surgically even an intravascular approach would likely cause a major rupture okay so what be the plan well I know you be hope for well news Colonel I be sorry I be afraid there be no option it be only a matter of time sorry Doc you be wrong hit it do not help I will pay for that thank you now please leave we you think he do this to himself he remove his own symbiote the rite of M'al Sharran I do not understand why would he do this on his own I mean he have to know how dangerous it would be indeed it require that you bring yourself to the edge of death in order to find your own true spirit should you fail he be ashamed that he have be brainwash if he fail to overcome it he do not want anyone here to save he I push you to this old friend bra'tac Kal'el bra'tac be tail Kal'el he be hopeful it will lead to Teal'c 's whereabout Colonel Carter be put together a rescue operation that we can implement the moment we get confirmation I will be there under the circumstance everyone will understand if you choose to stay back on this one I be sorry Sir we be talk about Teal'c I understand how be your friend do not so good on that front Sir there be something I need to ask you so have you give some thought to my proposal to be honest you 've look well teal'c do not tell I your spirit be wane I know you need tretonin to live Give in do not threaten the future of your people because of personal pride you be frightened you seek to control the Jaffa because you recognize the power of the Ori and you be helpless to do anything about it on your own I 've try to be nice I 've try to present reason convince you in a most merciful fashion but my patience wear thin now rest assure I will prevail over you precious Council and control the Jaffa ultimately it be for their own good if you keep resist I I will have no choice but to let you die Cameron Sam bra'tac get we a Gate address Kal'el lead he to a planet with a mothership park on a pyramid he believe Teal'c be be hold there that be good news we be brief in an hour I will be there do you need some help with this no I 've get it do this make I a hypocrite I tell my dad he be get a Tok'ra symbiote Pete Got shoot by a Goa'uld with a laser blaster that be not really the point I mean about use that thing I know after what happen to I I be oppose to anyone ever have anything to do with that technology and now I be go out of my way to make use of it be show your friend the truth go to make he feel any well he want to know I be not go to be burden with guilt over the fact that he die because of I the truth go to to change that not for I hey hey so you be finally get the hell out of here actually yes Good I might not be here when you get back though do not you quit on I no I just mean that I be check out of the hospital I be go home there be nothing more they can do for I here what be that it be a little something I pick up on another planet yes very good that be hilarious you know you never really could tell a joke we 've make some modification since we get our hand on this but basically here be how it work some of my memory from the last year have be download into this device attach these lead to your head and you get to experience some of the thing I 've go through you be serious you want to know the truth I be go to show it to you you can continue to resist I and die or you can take the tretonin and save yourself join I and you will save many more it be up to you Mayday mayday we be go in repeat we be go in Colonel you be here to lead SG 1 teal'c Daniel Jackson hey we 've get a little problem in here you do this before fight a knight in armor no can not say that I have it appear to be a hologram a hologram and we do not want to get into a God off these prior want to show we they be go to play hardball the mark 9 give they almost what be you do why do you stop teal'c be in trouble there be a rescue op about to leave I have to go go save he for God sake yeah I just do not want you to give up not when there be so many possibility out there just get out of here look before I go I have to say something you may not like it but I be go to have to live with it no matter what you say or do I be sorry I be do what I be do and you be not because I act rashly I be a hothead and you be suffer because of it no you be do what you be do because of who you be yeah I be impatient I lose control I be not particularly fond of that side of myself I do not mean that when you see an opportunity you take it with the kind of thing that you and I be ask to do that you be do now I mean you 've get to be a little angry you 've get to be out of control I mean if you think too much you be just go to freeze up my God you be go to other planet through a freaking wormhole you have be a little nut I just do not want to screw up again well you would well not this teal'c he seem like a pretty decent guy or alien whatever he be Jaffa Jaffa just be yourself Cam trust I that be pretty damn good thank I would have do it for anyone you know that it be part of the job yeah it be can I use this thing a little more play stop rewind way cool hey when you get to the part with the flight attendant yeah Skip over that that be private I promise nothing at which point we should receive radio confirmation from bra'tac that the Gate on P2 M 903 be clear we can expect intense but limited resistance upon approach the mothership it will be visible roughly half a mile from the Gate bra'tac should be able to provide aerial cover thank you for join we Colonel Sir we will secure the Gate proceed to the pyramid gain access to the mothership and locate and retrieve teal'c keep in mind all evidence suggest Teal'c be be brainwash there be no guarantee he be even go to cooperate with this rescue teal'c be family I do not like people screw with my family we be with you Sir let us bring he home shall we try again Alkesh shak'tel Colonel Carter the Gate have be clear alright let us go move out let us go move move move bra'tac watch your back go go go go Mitchell Cam wait for backup I see you be feel well seem your friend have come to rescue you I expect nothing less unfortunately it be too little too late the mothership 's engine be power up it be take off I be curious be you merely feign allegiance wait for the right time to strike at I dammit Shel kree kill he teal'c Shel noc take you guy long enough not you guy the rest of the Jaffa guard be retreat back here I can not get these damn ring to work if we all go we could be cut off with no way of get back off the ship you go we get your back you sure about that be I go to be able to stop you I do not think so I be in a bad mood today teal'c you must resist Silence old man your word be meaningless I take it this mean I do not have to shoot you you do not good sound like somebody be still drive this rust bucket we should get the hell out of here before they jump to hyperspace indeed would you please stop it be kind of make I nervous sorry it be just that the implication of this referendum be tremendous I mean we take democracy for grant but these Jaffa the referendum pass for the first time in our history we will have leader vote upon by every free Jaffa Congratulations Welcome to the club two month from now we hold general election well let the campaigning begin what about those Jaffa affect by Ba'al 's brainwashing it will take much dedication on their part to overcome but with our help they shall prevail where be colonel Mitchell Colonel Mitchell you should know that your action be instrumental in bring about a successful vote for a democratic Jaffa nation today yeah I hear about that that be great sorry I miss it I understand and I be sorry about your friend yeah I be hope to see he again I be in your debt Colonel Mitchell not only for save my life but for save the life of bra'tac as well teal'c no offense but I would have do the same for anyone you do not owe I a thing we watch each other ' back because that be our job right indeed hey teal'c how would you resist the brainwashing I figure I might be in that situation someday and I do not reckon I be go through the rite of M'al Sharran to resist the influence of other knowledge of oneself be most important right thank yeah I be work on it previously on Stargate SG 1 the Rand Protectorate and the Caledonian Federation have be lock in a state of cold war for decade this be insane Soren 's force be move in on this facility I can get you to the Stargate but we have to go now I be not blind Leda I know that you and Daniel have grow close during his convalescence Jared it be not what you think I 've see entire planet wipe out because they refuse to follow the Ori if a Prior visit your world leave what be up incoming wormhole from Tegalus a Jared Kane be request to be let through say he need to speak to you and it be urgent on radio Jared this be Daniel what be wrong Dr Jackson I have very little time I 've gain access to the Stargate without my government 's authorization please allow I to come through I be alone and unarmed open the iris okay Jared it be safe to come through stand down Dr Jackson Jared this be Lt Col Cameron Mitchell Tegalus post apocalyptic war superpower with deep seat political difference that Jared Kane it be nice to meet you your government stop respond to our communique month ago we would assume that you completely destroy each other not quite yet I be go to say no long want our help but that will do no the Rand Protectorate be still struggle to rebuild and defend itself from the Caledonian Federation okay what be so urgent five month ago a man come through the Stargate he call himself a Prior of the Ori here we go yes we be aware of the Priors and what they be preach the Prior be not just offer we religion he offer we power in exchange for our embrace the Ori he give our government design for a weapon that could be launch into orbit a satellite capable of give we total domination over the Caledonians okay assume your people intend on build this weapon how long before it be complete 24 hour ago a caledonian military outpost be completely vaporize in a demonstration the weapon be already operational Season 9 Episode 15 Ethon how long until your government make its next move our President have give their leader Minister Chaska a deadline of five day after that if the Caledonians do not surrender to Rand occupation they will be destroy and the Prior instruct you to do this Rand have be in disarray since the missile attack last year Intelligence report be filter in that say the Caledonians be prepare a full scale ground assault they be go to invade and attempt to topple what be leave of Rand once and for all Caledonia be not interested in hear from this Prior the Prior ask our leader if he could spread his word to the Caledonians as well of course they would never accept anything that Rand be already embrace President Nadal explain that to the Prior he say anyone who do not accept Origin must be destroy man these guy get a bottomless bag of trick do not they I be guess it be also the Prior that convince your people that have a relationship with we be no long necessary it be already clear your government be not go to offer we the type of weapon and technology this Prior be offer we you see we be not just on the verge of suffer defeat at the hand of the Caledonians we be on the verge of collapse as a nation but now after what you 've tell I of these Ori and the Priors I fear that may have be a well way to go we appreciate your situation but what exactly do you want from we these be the early schematic for the weapon unfortunately they be not complete the Prior give we step by step instruction in stage make sure he keep you under his thumb he say it be so he could make sure each stage be complete properly before we move on to the next it be the good I could do under the circumstance Access became restrict soon after some of we in government voice our disapproval about build the weapon you wish we to destroy the weapon it be the only chance we have to stop thing before they go too far just to be clear you be do this to save Caledonians you do not hate they for bomb your country and kill so many of your people I do but I refuse to see any more life be they Rand or Caledonian senselessly lose due to archaic prejudice or religious extremism this have to stop would you excuse we for a moment what be we do talk privately I be sure general Landry will not mind you want the big chair not I I will sit here Sam he be in Washington yeah right let I just start this by say a lot of this be actually our fault there would not have be a war on Tegalus if we have not go there in the first place General O'Neill probably say it well the minute we step through the Gates we be stick our collective nose where they do not belong we do offer to help they rebuild an offer they eventually decline because they be be influence by a Prior and this satellite thing take it to a whole new level the Ori be now arm their follower who say they will not eventually help they build ship capable of attack other planet we need to nip this trend squarely in the bud so what we just fly in there and blow it up yeah unless you have a well idea all Tegalans both Rand and Caledonian alike deserve to know the truth if we tell they what we know who the Ori really be they might be convince to dismantle this weapon themselves you think they will listen let us just propose it to Kane and see if Rand will hear we out so can we can use these plan to build ourselves a satellite weapon hey you 've get to ask these plan be incomplete I mean it be not even clear what be power the weapon Kane do say they be early schematic so not useful well enough to see that it be not very efficient for example these capacitor take several minute to store enough power to fire the weapon and then again before it can repeat wow you would think an Ori weapon would be more advanced the Ori may have design it for they but Rand still have to build it use the resource and technology at their disposal now remember that it would not take much by our standard to give Rand vast military superiority over Caledonia then it can be easily destroy if these plan be an accurate indication right so we will take Prometheus for this should not be a problem the satellite appear to be a predominantly offensive weapon no defense well it stand to reason Rand know that Caledonia have nothing even close to capable of reach orbit although there do appear to be sensor build into the target system so our approach may be detect the Prometheus be protect by Asgard shield technology exactly now as I say even if they do see we come the weapon will take a few minute to charge up we should be able to emerge from hyperspace and take a shot at it before it can respond if for any reason it do not go well we jump back into hyperspace anything yet give they some time they seem shocked that you be here I be sure they be you do not think they will listen to we our people suffer greatly after the war they need to believe there be a reason for what be happen to they and the Prior provide that he say our suffering be a test to see who be worthy well if it make you feel any well your planet 's not alone Kane I have to ask Leda five month ago while Rand be decide whether to accept Origin or not a disease sweep through the country thousand become deathly ill the Prior say those who believe and embrace the Ori would be cure that be when people everywhere begin accept they as god we watch so many barter away their belief in exchange for their life but Leda she she refuse to accept it I be sorry Dr Jackson we just receive a communique from the Rand government they want to talk this be not exactly what I have in mind what happen if your people do not hear from we I tell they to proceed with destroy the weapon President Nadal Senator Kane this be Dr Daniel Jackson I know who he be I be here represent Earth on a diplomatic mission I be here to officially inform you Jared Kane you be under arrest for treason excuse I you allow we to come here under false pretense Dr Daniel Jackson your government have knowingly harbor a felon as well it seem they be in possession of top secret document vital to the security of this country as of now you be both consider enemy of the state and will be detain until trial can be set approach the planet Sir Prepare to lock on Dr Jackson 's locator beacon the moment we drop out of hyperspace yes Sir I guess I can assume that any kind of trial will be rig honestly we will be lucky to get that far President Nadal have be paranoid about caledonian spy for some time now because I betray he this way he may assume I be also part of that network Great I do not suppose your country have any law against torture no I applaud your courage Kane Commander Pernaux Dr Jackson Dr Jackson yeah I get it what I do not understand be why you come back Dr Jackson and I think there be some thing the Rand people need to know the only thing I need to know be the name of those among we who be work for the Caledonians just because I go to Earth for help do not mean I 've also give information to the Caledonians or know who might have Earth be responsible for our current state of affair turn to they be an act of a desperate man Kane Kane turn to we in the hope of prevent you from make a catastrophic mistake the Priors be not tell you everything about the Ori you need to hear I out before you use that weapon to wipe out the Caledonians so you admit you sympathize with Caledonia that be not what he be say how the next few day unfold be entirely up to you but until I find out who else be work with you I guarantee neither of you will know a moment 's peace I have a signal from Dr Jackson 's locator beacon Beam he directly onto the bridge I take it this mean thing be not go so well couple with the fact that we have not hear from he since he leave two day ago we have locate the satellite Lock on target this will be perceive as an act of aggression against Rand we could be risk any chance of negotiate for Daniel 's safe return Commander Mr President the satellite 's sensor have detect a ship close on its position Target have be acquire Sir we 've get the satellite dead to right we can hail they and ask for Dr Jackson in exchange that would not accomplish the goal of this mission Jackson know it might come to this he tell we to proceed no matter what he would not want we to trade his life for thousand possibly million of Caledonians well it be your call colonel all I be ask be that you make up your mind quickly Sir we be detect a power buildup from within the satellite its attitude be change we be be target sound general quarter full power to forward shield generator and maintain course and speed do it Fire firing missile missile detonate prior to impact Target remain intact Sir it look like it be be protect by a shield Defensive capability must have be add okay now what shield be hold Recommend fire a warning shot we have be attack Commander we must respond in kind Target the ship the Earth vessel have be target Weapon 's primed and ready Fire Evasive maneuver full military thrust Return fire with forward rail gun Sub light engine be not respond weapon be down we 've lose hull integrity and life support on deck 3 through 7 seal they off that blast cut through our shield at full strength I know I do not understand how sensor detect that the weapon be recharge we 've only get minute hyperdrive status Hyperdrive be offline Hull integrity be too unstable medical team report four casualty eight crew member still unaccounte for that thing can only fire at one target at a time go Scramble Blue Squadron we will see if we can do some damage in close go go track multiple small ship attack the satellite the shield be hold by the grace of the god thirty second till weapon be prime and ready Target the large vessel again it be no use Blue Leader we be not get through keep at it boy Lieutenant I need sublight engine now I be try Sir Auxiliary system be not kick in they can not the two main power relay have be damage can it be repair we need to re route power through the bypass conduit here we should get limited sublight capability back Marks you be with colonel Carter go we need to get up two level Captain the elevator 's not safe right sorry I do not know what I be think Shields Forward shield at 40 Divert all shield power to forward generator Sir sensor indicate that the weapon be reach maximum power all hand brace for impact this damn thing 's shield be not weaken I get you be you alright my arm Bridge this be Carter can you beam we up to auxiliary control room two Negative Colonel control room no long have life support the large vessel appear to be disable shall I broadcast a call for surrender the book of Origin tell we that enemy of the Ori show no mercy in their attempt to draw we away from the path we must face this attack with all the strength we have be give finish they Prometheus this be Blue Leader Request status report not too good right now Blue Leader can we assist Negative Blue Leader negative Docking bay be too unstable for safe return stand by for order Roger that Bridge this be Carter we need deck 15 unseal Unseal it if you can if the aft power control panel be still intact we should be able to rig the naquadah generator and re route power to sublight propulsion you 've get about two minute Colonel it be not enough time Sir open a channel broadcast on all frequency yes Sir this be Colonel Lionel Pendergast of the Earth Vessel Prometheus call the Rand Protectorate your attack on our vessel have severely damage our engine and render our weapon system inoperable we be willing negotiate the term of our surrender Rand Protectorate this be the Earth vessel Prometheus we wish to negotiate our surrender repeat we wish to negotiate our surrender okay fire it up do not we need to test the power flow no time but I know do it alright this be useless Blue Squadron this be Blue Leader break off the attack and scramble formation between the Prometheus and the weapon maybe one of we will get lucky and take a portion of the next shot I would not consider that lucky Colonel Mitchell well it could be for anybody aboard Prometheus this be President Nadal of the Rand Protectorate address the Earth vessel please explain your brazen act of aggression against our nation our action have be misconstrue as hostile we be here to investigate why an emissary we send to your planet Dr Daniel Jackson have cease all communication with we and yet your first act upon enter our planet 's space be to fire on our defense satellite but we detect that your satellite be power up and aim at we which we take to be the first act of aggression we merely respond in kind now we be no long a threat to you I have people aboard this vessel who be in need of medical attention and I be vent atmosphere please consider our request for surrender keep your finger cross your planet send this ship to attack we I have no desire to take more life you tell we what we want to know I will accept their surrender who else be involve in this attack what other action be the Caledonians plan we be not spy I come here to convince your people to dismantle this weapon yourself before any of this become necessary why would we do that I have try to explain who help you gain access to the Stargate I act alone you be lie you be part of a spy network help to supply the Caledonians with classified information do you ever think that maybe the Caledonians be be leak information because not everyone in your country agree with what you be do the weapon be charge wait please just listen to I before you go murder defenseless people we be the one defend ourselves your ship attack we sensor detect the weapon be fully charge Colonel Carter I need good news now a couple of more minute we do not have it Sam I be sorry it be over give I as much power as you can re route it from the shield and get I all function internal Asgard beam sensor back online Sir we be abandon ship begin the evacuation order I want all personnel to beam down to the planet 's surface find I a nice open field anywhere in Caledonia yes Sir and broadcast the location of all the active sensor site this be the Prometheus to all F 302 's we have begin our evacuation I advise you to get clear of the ship and meet we at the rendezvous coordinate on the planet Affirmative Prometheus I will handle the final transport command everyone else be to report to the near beam out site let us go people that be an order move Sir I get out of here get out of here go if I do not finish tie this in we will run out of power before everyone can be beam off go we must not fail the god we must embrace our destiny fire the weapon wait no ah hell the Earth vessel have be destroy the loss of your people be regrettable but your planet and the Caledonians must know our resolve you know full well the Caledonians would rather sacrifice themselves than submit you will be force to commit genocide and destroy they a year ago they launch a first strike against we they obviously have no problem with do the same when do it stop when do we stop kill each other over war start by our father and their father before they this be no long about Rand or Caledonia it be we need to set aside our difference and fight the threat of the Ori together Goran how long have we know each other please believe what Dr Jackson have tell you about they with my own eye I see the Prior bring the satellite to life merely by touch it with his staff neither Rand nor Caledonia have the technology capable of resist such power what choice do we have look I can not make you any promise but we have already develop a machine that neutralize the prior ' power now as far as we know they 've only be able to travel within our galaxy by use of the Stargate and you can either bury your Gate or we can teach you to build an iris system like ours Nadal have lose all sense of reason the book of Origin be just one big lie mean to seduce we into meaningless worship the Ori just want to use we and kill in their name be not self defense it be murder we be monitor the entire exchange to our knowledge 76 crew be recover in caledonian territory there be over 115 people aboard that ship do you have any sort of a manifest a list of name we can compare to those recover not on I no so where be our people the transport arrive moment ago teal'c Cameron Sam you be a sight for sore eye it be good to see you alive Colonel Carter we fear the bad where be Pendergast he be not with we our security force do extensive sweep of the area where you appear no other survivor be find this be Minister Chaska leader of the Caledonian Federation I be thankful you survive such a tragic event Colonel I hope we can offer you and your crew some comfort here she be pretty much up to speed on what be go on we be of course pray for your success but with the destruction of your vessel I fear that any hope for a peaceful solution to this crisis have be lose and you will not surrender our people would rather die than live under Rand rule we will retaliate against any attack with the full force at our disposal any word nothing the Rand government continue to deny any knowledge of Daniel Jackson 's existence our contact tell we he be see alive in the Rand command bunker during the exchange with your ship he have not be see since any progress here well these satellite schematic be far more detailed than the one Kane provide as we see firsthand shield be add late in the design process I be still not sure what be power it or how it be able to penetrate our Asgard design shield but there be one bit of good news accord to this all command for the satellite originate from Rand 's main control facility and maintain a shield around the satellite be a huge power drain so it be only activate when a threat be detect be you say the Prometheus be destroy because we hesitate to fire when we drop out of hyperspace we hesitate out of concern for the safe return of Daniel Jackson we also hesitate to leave once our weapon be ineffective however it seem that you be say if we be to destroy the Rand control facility the weapon itself would become vulnerable to attack then we could take a 302 back up there and finish the job no the Rand facility be part of an underground bunker complex that be strong enough to survive our last missile attack since then Rand have develop an early warning radar system and anti missile defense wait up what about sabotage you say you have people on the inside our agent have already make several attempt Security be too tight for they to mount any sort of effective strike actually we do not have to hit the bunker itself to knock out satellite control if we can sever the link between the facility and the weapon even temporarily you be talk about an E M Pulse even a small one detonate in the atmosphere above the facility should interfere with their ability to control the satellite E M Pulse it would disable their electronic device they would be totally blind for a short time you possess such technology you would not have suggest it if you do not have something in mind well like most discovery it be a bit of an accident after the battle with Anubis ' fleet over Antarctica small random e m field be detect by Prometheus during the cleanup it take we a while to figure out be you go to tell I that an F 302 give off an E M Pulse when it blow up it be one of the thing I be work on at area 51 we think it have something to do with a concussive force interfere with the artificial gravity field generate by the inertial dampener so how do we remote fly a 302 over there and blow it up we do not have to all we have to do be harvest the inertial dampener and rig it to one of the caledonian missile what about their anti missile defense we can use that same 302 's radar jamming technology to make your missile invisible to Rand still if this do not work as you be plan it will be see as an offensive against Rand President Nadal will surely respond by step up the deadline for our surrender and he will use the satellite weapon against we this will work I do not know what to say how to take it all back I should not have come to you look right now I just have to believe there be survivor you think that be really possible the Prometheus have beam technology have beam technology whatever that be look the bottom line be we can not lose focus of why we come back here in the first place there have to be a way out of this and I get the feeling Pernaux be listen to we Daniel I know the history between Caledonia and Rand make thing seem impossible but sometimes an outside perspective help in the past I 've find the key to these type of dispute be to to get both party on equal footing just to get the process of talk with each other go again do you ever give up not until I be dead and sometimes not even then Intelligence be report visual confirmation of a missile launch from Caledonia early warning system detect no missile enter our airspace one missile so it seem possibly a test then they be not go to surrender they be prepare to launch a preemptive first strike give the Earth attack on the satellite have fail you do not know that they still have two day until the deadline get I Minister Chaska President Nadal be on line for you Ma'am do not look like they 've employ countermeasure the radar jamming be work the timing be too coincidental I suspect he have spy who witness the launch you need to stall or else they will activate the satellite shield out of sheer paranoia patch he through President Nadal this be Minister Chaska Mr President if you be call about the recent missile launch please forgive I I should have call you immediately the launch be entirely accidental it seem there be some confusion when new launch protocol code be distribute recently obviously the payload be detonate as soon as we realize what have happen needless to say everyone here be a little on edge as of late but thankfully we have ample precaution in place to prevent such an occurrence from be a serious threat indeed Minister Chaska while your military 's incompetence do concern I the reason I be call be to discuss the impending deadline I see our government be still in the process of debate its option as promise we will give you an answer by the designate deadline I be sorry the decision have not be easy for you we shall talk again soon Air command this be Blue Leader we be wheel up Roger that Package be on its way we be 30 second from detonation over target nice job he do not believe a word of it we be get a report from coastal monitoring base four may be visual of an incoming missile why be not it show up on our radar Sir satellite sensor be detect a single small ship on approach possibly one of the Earth fighter that land in Caledonia activate the missile shield what just happen I do not know we 've lose power all system be down backup power be suppose to be isolate the system that activate it be down we can not control the satellite get it back get I a radio and a phone in here that work Blue Leader this be base the package have be deliver Window of opportunity be now open Roger that we have clear the atmosphere two minute from weapon range the blast do no apparent damage beyond the power outage which seem to be limit to the area immediately around the command facility to our knowledge the Caledonians do not possess the level of technology require to do this such a weapon could only have be give to they by your people I hope so how do we undo this you tell I now or I will have you execute base on its speed and trajectory the Earth ship will reach the satellite in less than one minute do you think if the Ori be true god they would allow the Caledonians to do this look I understand your fear of the Prior and why you feel you have no choice but there be another way out of this what would you have I do let I use the radio I can contact the ship that be about to destroy the satellite and get they to call it off why would you do this because I still believe a peaceful compromise can be reach out of all this I be listen this be Daniel Jackson come in please whoever be fly the 302 if you can hear I please respond this be Daniel Jackson come in please Jackson go ahead Mitchell yeah you okay for the moment you well all thing consider listen I and Teal'c be get ready to bag ourselves an evil Ori satellite yeah so glad I catch you listen the Rand want to offer the Caledonians a deal really may I please Daniel this be Sam Hey Sam good to hear your voice your too I be here with Minister Chaska of the Caledonian Federation we would like to know what Rand be offer in exchange for leave the satellite intact Rand be offer Caledonia the Stargate Rand be offer the Gate and a limited cease fire so all those from Caledonia who do not want to follow Origin and wish to seek refuge on another planet may do so they want we to leave our home our planet Jackson be you sure about this I 've get a clean shot at this thing and I be in favor of take it listen the Rand build that satellite in less than a year and I can tell you their resolve be pretty steady if we blow this one up they be just go to build another and as far as the Caledonians go well Sam you will just have to explain to they that the Priors may not give they much choice regardless of what Rand decide to do I 've see the Priors wipe out entire planet for refuse to follow the Ori you will not fight they with we well we would try but honestly there be only so much we can do will the Prior not follow we wherever we go maybe but for now look this offer be not go to be on the table long and I realize there be a lot to be work out but at least it be a start at the very least the Rand now believe that you have the ability to disable the satellite whenever you want which they will surely counter in time tell colonel Mitchell to call it off Blue Leader this be Carter Minister Chaska be request that you stand down Alright Jackson but you folk have well be damn sure about this backup power be online Satellite control have be re establish sensor detect the Earth ship be veer away from the target activate the shield the ship be no long a threat power the weapon what target the caledonian capital building Sir perhaps we should take a moment you will abide by my authority Power the weapon now power the weapon our sensor detect the weapon 's shield have become active Jackson what be go on down there the satellite be power up its weapon and target the planet we have a deal President Nadal explain your action immediately President Nadal you give your word I give my soul to the Ori who offer we all salvation anyone who reject that be a fool they be all Caledonians for God 's sake they all deserve to die long before the Prior show we the path to enlightenment Shut down the satellite do not listen to he now arrest the commander stand down I will not let you do this Nadal do as I say put your weapon down now get a medical unit in here go go Shut down the satellite he be dead you hear he the President be dead Commander Pernaux be next in command he be also the one who kill the President the President violate an international treaty you want to be the one responsible for destroy a city full of people when this go to tribunal Shut it down now Hang on help be come the deal will stand hey have not see you since the memorial service yeah it be a rough day so where have you be I hand deliver Landry 's letter to colonel Pendergast 's wife and kid they need to know that he die save his crew that his death matter well 76 people survive that be a testament to his leadership and yours we never would 've get off that planet if you have not broker the deal so I take it then you have not hear Heard what soon after we leave the talk break down and and we 've be unable to make contact with they General Landry have the Daedalus re route on its way back from Atlantis it seem the Caledonians be not content to just leave their fair planet they launch an attack and Rand respond the Stargate be presume bury in the rubble rough day rough day previously on Stargate SG 1 unfortunately that ship be now in the hand of the Lucian Alliance the who it be a coalition of former smuggler and mercenary who 've band together to take advantage of the power vacuum leave by the demise of the Goa'uld we receive a communiqué from a Goa'uld name Nerus Ring any bell he be a Goa'uld know for his many appetite I be the one who figure out how to activate all the Stargates in the galaxy at once do not Ba'al mention that you will descend to a small dark room in the basement of Area 51 and you will stay there till you come up with a defense against the Ori what would possibly compel I to do that hunger what do you say to they look obviously it do not go so well I do advise that you be a most unlikely drug smuggler Colonel Mitchell can we please just fall back to the Gate we can not hold this position what be take so long guy we 've get a problem yes bad man be shoot at we just hurry up and open the damn Gate Season 9 Episode 16 off the Grid it be call kassa look a lot like corn which I always think be indigenous to North America must be pretty damn tasty if it be cause all this fuss I believe lieutenant Mooney describe it as sweet corn heaven what be his condition he still crave it Sir he do not even want to leave the planet I have to restrain he to get he back here that be amazing obviously you 've never have my grandma 's corn bread and black eyed pea no what about the rest of the population be they demonstrate any of the same addictive behavior everybody be fine when we first get there a fight break out in the marketplace when supply run low and my man and I have to move in to restore order that be what make Mooney want to taste it in the first place I just do not think it would it be all right what do Dr Lee have to say about it he be still analyze the sample now Sir to determine whether or not it be naturally occur which make I wonder if the Ori have something to do with this get all the population jonese for space corn I do not know I also do not believe that to be unlikely it do not really fit their M o do it besides there be no evidence that a Prior have ever be there before in the last session of the interim council several Jaffa leader complain of erratic behavior on several planet we do not suspect tamper with the food supply Colonel be you able to determine where this kassa come from I pressure one of the vendor for a Gate address but to be honest I do not know if it be accurate it be worth check out Sir well find out what you can but try to stay under the radar will do taste test the produce please I have two daughter do not worry we be not go to hurt you who be you what do you want we be look to buy some kassa it be available at every market we be look for a sizable quantity I can maybe spare you one or two cart full how much for the whole field this be not the way the Alliance do business as in the Lucian Alliance how many alliance do we know many the Lucian Alliance will know you have come they have eye everywhere Great because we be look to set up a meeting maybe you can arrange that Worrel return this afternoon Worrel be this be his land his crop he live in the house just up the road well tell he Mr Shaft would like to meet with he any specific time or should I just block off the whole afternoon I will arrange it but I must warn you he will not take kindly to your request or to your presence what the hell be that what be what we be suppose to stay under the radar I doubt if this world possess such technology see when he be right he be right Sam have a point we be not equip to take these guy on right now I have no intention of take anybody on I be just go to pose as a buyer you no offense Jackson but you do not strike I as the drug dealer type in fact you be not even close I think I be as close as you be Come on you be mile away teal'c which one of we be close I believe the three of you to be equidistant oh please Mary Poppins be not even in the running and neither be you because I be go I be just go to ask some question about the operation find out what I can tell they their price be too high and then high tail it out of there this be a bad idea it be be four hour now when do we call this thing they be heavily armed this be the man I tell you about Mr Shaft hey you must be Worrel where be your friend Mister I figure you would rather deal one on one call I Shaft who tell you kassa be grow here in my business you get to know the right people what right people you know the good hardworking type tell you what you want to know and then disappear you can go we will talk inside Great if we remain here we will be discover let us hope it do not come to that fellow do you think I would carry a weapon enough alright Mister what can I do for you I represent a coalition of seven planet with a combined population of 30 million kassa hungry soul we be look for a supplier I do not have that kind of inventory Nah nobody do that be why I need more than one so if you could just refer I refer you high up so you wish to speak to my superior I think our need be big enough to warrant his attention your need Ooh that do not look good just exactly who do you think you be I already tell you my name Mister actually it be just Shaft Mister be more of a courtesy title so if you could just pass it along to your superior that be all I be ask I be force to wonder what someone like yourself a businessman represent how many planet do you say again Seven but one of them be actually a moon so so 30 million potential customer and you need I to arrange a meeting with my superior see now you be sell yourself short yeah I think he be in trouble as be we what do you say to they look obviously it do not go so well guy what be take so long we 've get a problem just hurry up and open the damned Gate okay here be an obvious question you be surround drop your weapon Chevron four encode Chief how long be they overdue now two hour Sir Colonel Mitchell 's never miss a check in Chevron five encode General Landry Sir I just speak with Dr Lee he be determined that the plant contain a highly addictive psychostimulant which just confirm what we already know but we do not know it as engineer which mean it do not evolve naturally Chevron six encode Chevron seven will not lock why not I do not know Sir I be not show any malfunction at this end run a diagnostic and try again yes Sir the infamous SG 1 everybody this be Worrel trust I Mister you will not get the good of I again actually it be Mitchell Cameron Mitchell I try to explain the Mister thing I do not think he get it how do you steal the Stargate what SG 1 show up on my little backwater planet and the Stargate vanishe I be not a fool perhaps not but we be not responsible we be here on a reconnaissance mission so you be do slay System Lords and decide to move on to more press agricultural concern that be exactly it Corn patrol oh I have a question why would we make the Gate magically disappear before we have a chance to escape through it bad timing that be get to be the single stupid thing I 've ever hear do thing always go accord to plan in your world Dr Jackson no not usually no then I would guess this be another one of those time and until my Stargate be return thing will continue to go wrong we 've make repeat attempt to connect Sir there be no signal whatsoever it be get to be a problem with the offworld Gate get I colonel Emerson on board the Odyssey yes Sir right away Sir I have general Landry for you on screen Colonel how go the shakedown 90 of our primary system be up and run Sir Care to take a ride another time I just need you to tell I that your hyperdrive be part of that 90 we 've lose contact with SG 1 they be on P6 G 452 Estimate 22 hour Sir I would not want to go into battle just yet but I think we can reach 452 and extract SG 1 inside of a day Glad to hear it I assume they have the new locator chip implant they be the first after the event on Tegalus I can not think of a well first operational mission for the Odyssey than to bring home SG 1 neither can I Colonel good luck thank you Sir Landry out Major Marks set a course for P6 G 452 yes Sir Attention all deck this be Emerson Prepare to engage hyperdrive take we out with pleasure Sir seriously why would we take the Stargate away before we have a chance to escape through it and do not say bad timing be thing continue to go wrong for you Dr Jackson it be within your power to change that torture we be not go to get you the answer you be look for I do not want to torture you in fact if you tell I the location of the Stargate I be prepared to release you oh you be not I can not can you believe he just say that you 've already blow your chance whoever take your Stargate be long go and when your superior discover that you have let the real thief escape it be you who will be torture someone be steal Stargates well four that we know of Sir accord to the Tok'ra dispatch which could explain why we have not be able to dial 452 and contact SG 1 exactly Sir in fact the Trust try this once with our Gate be not any Goa'uld mothership or similar class vessel capable of take a Gate not with Asgard beam technology which one eye witness apparently confirm be the method be use send an encrypted databurst of all available intel to colonel Emerson on board the Odyssey yes Sir oh and chief call Peterson Air Base I need to take a little trip to Area 51 right away Sir General they tell I you be come but I do not believe they I say I do not believe you well here I be you come to visit a condemn prisoner empty hand you be not a condemn prisoner Nerus but if you tell I what I need to know I will arrange a feast the like of which you have not see since you set foot on this planet Feast I do not use the word lightly nor do I how may I be of service my dear General someone out there be steal Stargates I need to know who how and why steal they beam right off the planet with Asgard technology as far as we know well that must be madden for you it be I already have an idea who it might be well if you be so smart what do you need I for I have a theory I still need some answer but such a quandary must be worth more to you than a single solitary indulgent meal perhaps we could discuss my dietary requirement on a more permanent every minute you waste try to negotiate I take one item off the menu can we talk over appetizer General look for what it be worth guy I be sorry I drag you into this oh it happen all the time ah my friend you wear the furrowed brow of a deeply worried man how be your day go we 've be recall by the Alliance well you can not say we do not tell you so it be far bad news for you I no long have any reason to keep you alive no wait I can think of a reason we be more valuable alive yes we be more valuable alive good one no my instruction be quite clear take care of Mr Shaft last I want he to watch the other go first your death will serve as a warning to your people never to meddle with our operation in the future General this chicken be most plump and delicious you spoil I General it be call turkey Turkey another rare delicacy well I must have more turkey what be this I be lose patience Nerus well you already know who it be so it be Ba'al of course it be Ba'al who else would it be why be he do it you be the genius you tell I ah maybe there be no need to go into the third and fourth course no General no no no no I mean that as the most sincere form of flattery you be one of the more intelligent human being I have ever have the pleasure of meeting and I assure you General that this meal have just begin I be glad to hear that hey the other three have nothing to do with this I be run the operation Cam Worrel know this tell he to get back here SG 1 I be colonel Paul Emerson Welcome aboard the Odyssey thank you Sir how about that time Jackson Good timing Airman let us get these people out of these binding and to the infirmary Sir I know you people have be through a lot yeah we will live Hand it over we receive this intel from Stargate Command a few hour ago Damn Ba'al 's be busy he be be gather up Stargates from all over the sector for the last several week yeah we see one of they disappear do we know why not yet nor do we know where he be what of the Lucian Alliance for the moment General Landry consider this our top priority where be he get his intel Nerus oh jimdandy such intelligence can not be consider reliable I be not sure Nerus do work for Ba'al for century it be a good place as any to start and general Landry can be pretty persuasive when he need to be Nerus you have the most atrocious table manner of any person I 've ever meet oh General please you forget that despite appearance I be not human oh my goodness why do Ba'al want a dozen Stargates Nerus Dessert Young man you have positively read my mind come in come in make room for dessert just put Ooh what be individually frosted cake well you be so clever you figure out the perpetrator what do you think we assume he intend to offer they back to the planet he be steal they from in exchange for some form of payment you be not very intelligent be you General Sorry to disappoint you well you be just think too small that be all you 've get to think more like a Goa'uld what be it that Ba'al once have think of it now think of what he have lose he be start over precisely see there be still hope for you yet see some time ago Ba'al come to I look for a way to rebuild in the event that the Jaffa ever succeed in conquer the Goa'uld now I have be study the Stargate system for month to help you defeat the Replicators incidentally and I stumble upon a way to disable the correlative update program so you could move a Stargate and not have it transmit its new position to the rest of the network precisely so it would seem that Ba'al have put my research into practice which lead we to where I have a theory General but no assortment of cheese however delicious could possibly compel I to tell you that what do you have in mind my freedom absolutely not once he have set the program it will be impossible to detect your freedom just be not on the table Nerus but I be sure there be something else we could offer my dear General I rarely say this so please take it to heart when I say that for the moment I be full what be you think Worrel please do not kill I why would I do that the last time I hear you say that to someone they I be just stun that you would honestly believe that SG 1 would steal the Gate and trap themselves on the planet well I you have they for almost two day and you learn nothing and now two third of our crop will rot uselessly if we could bring in cargo ship Cargo ship do you have any idea how many it would actually take I promise I will avenge this do not worry about SG 1 and Earth they be of little consequence we have spy all over the galaxy find out who really take the Stargate and get it back or do not bother return yourself yes Netan I trust you be all packed yes with a sizable assortment of what do you call they cupcake yes a most generous point to concede in our negotiation General consider it a go away present well I be touch yes well I admit it take some convincing well superior can sometimes be difficult they do have reason not to trust you yes but but you do you do convince they that it be a fair bargain I give the coordinate for my freedom unless of course you do not intend to honor I think you know by now I be a man of my word well yes of course you be then you should have no trouble believe I when I say that if you be lie about these coordinate there will be nowhere in this galaxy for you to hide I I believe you I be glad Farewell Putz should I dial the coordinate he leave Sir no it be probably a black hole or bad if I 've learn one thing in this command it be never to trust a Goa'uld especially if his name be Nerus yes Sir Come in Sir we be pick up a subspace signal from the beacon that be fast yes Sir it look like you be right he go back to Ba'al send the coordinate to Odyssey a S a p yes Sir Sir if you do not mind my asking how do we plant the beacon on Nerus yes Sir it be a piece of cake Sir I be receive a subspace transmission from SGC it be a set of coordinate Ba'al General Landry 's indeed persuasive Colonel be the Odyssey ready to fight our shield have only be test in simulation but our weapon and navigation be online let us take he down how nice you come to greet I in person oh oh I have this fabulous innovation I want you to it be call a cupcake it be so good why have you return my old friend you wound I deeply I be capable of wound you much more deeply I think you make yourself quite comfortable with the Tau'ri or be it the Ori you actually believe that that I would defect to the Ori no no it be a temporary lapse of judgment I admit but I have never in my in my life ever waver one iota in my devotion for you Sire be you certain you be not follow I be a genius you know so you insist yes and so I have prove in my service to you time and time again do you know how many stargate I have to go through to get here five stargate and that kind and naive general promise I anyway he give I his word that he would not follow I if you wish to return to my court Nerus you shall have to prove yourself how find I planet suitable for my new empire I be ready to begin anew well first I must recover from my harrowing ordeal it would be wise not to defy I Nerus thing have change considerably since you leave from what little we know of Ba'al 's ship there be only one cargo hold big enough to store the Stargates and that be here we beam onto the ship make our way to the cargo hold and tag the Gates with these sucker Locator beacon they only operate through subspace so they should not be detect once we lock on to their signal we beam back the Gates beam ourselves out and hopefully be go before Ba'al know the difference but will not Ba'al be able to detect the Odyssey and even if they do not how do you beam through his shield let us just say that be be take into consideration oh dear General Landry have Dr Lee program a virus into several of Nerus ' device as soon as he interface one of they with the ship it should kill all their system shield sensor weapon Colonel Emerson this be flight deck we be come out of hyperspace now Sir Understood we be on our way Ba'al 's ship should be dead ahead Sir have they detect we Negative Sir but I be receive a subspace locator code it be program to transmit when the virus go active Nerus do not waste time for a change what be happen all our system have fail how can that be I have limit power back online it look like the system be be disrupt from within the ship come with I this way we be in Understood we will hold the station within beaming range oh hello oh it be just a teeny tiny virus I be sure I can eradicate it in short order as soon as I regain control of the terminal oh general you be a lot more devious than I think you be you disappoint I I will I will keep you inform thank you oh here you be again oh well I do not think that that shoot the console will help but you can try oh I see I do not suppose there be anything I can say but I be so interesting we have an intruder on the ship oh boy one two three four five six seven twelve we be go to need more locator Colonel Mitchell Company Ideas Houston we have a problem what be it Sir another three mothership just drop out of hyperspace what intercept a hail Sir Ha'tak vessel this be Netan of the Lucian Alliance Surrender now or you will be destroy Lucian Alliance this be colonel Emerson commander of the Earth vessel Odyssey please respond Sir they 've power up weapon Target appear to be Ba'al 's ship SG 1 this be Odyssey what be your status Jackson a little help our position have be compromise but we be attempt to proceed with the mission be advise the Lucian Alliance just show up you can not go up against all of they with an untested ship they be target Ba'al 's ship we get to get you out of there now that be a negative I be still tag the Gates Colonel without shield Ba'al 's ship will not be able to withstand anything we know thank you SG 1 out Status manage to restore sensor and communication I be detect four other ship in close proximity what we be be hail put they on screen this be Netan of the Lucian Alliance you have cargo that belong to we you will surrender it and your ship now you be in no position to make such demand you have no shield and no weapon surrender immediately or prepare to be board go ahead and try Fire on they Target weapon and hyperdrive engine get I my shield Sir the Lucian Alliance vessel have open fire SG 1 stand by for extraction I be attach the last beacon now go activate transport I have manage to restore shield Sir we 've get a problem Ba'al 's shield just go back up you be go to have to sit tight we can not sit for long fall back bring we about Captain fire forward rail gun at the lead ship it look like we be go to be test our shield Evasive Report shield be hold but down 11 Sir the Lucian Alliance ship show minimal damage what about Ba'al 's ship can we get they out of there yet Negative Sir Last mag Alright we need to find another way off this boat Carter I have an idea Nice Jaffa cover fire Forget weapon bring our hyperdrive online my Lord I be show imminent shield failure Sir Ba'al 's ship just lose shield get they out of there now Hangar deck report Sir we 've get all the Gates but one we could not get a lock on its beacon what about SG 1 Negative Sir Ba'al 's ship have be destroy concentrate all weapon fire on the Earth vessel all three Lucian Alliance vessel be target we now Sir Engage hyperdrive Glad to see you I be a little surprised to see you come through the Gate Colonel Carter successfully reprogramme one of the dhd in Ba'al 's cargo hold so that we could in fact escape well do with your permission Sir we should let the odyssey know that we be okay they probably fear the bad the bad that we be blow up with Ba'al 's ship in the Lucian Alliance 's attack Sir so the Stargates be destroy no hopefully the Odyssey manage to beam the Gates off in time an eventful few day debrief in one hour we have get the good job in the world do not we I be go to hit the shower I be go to find a doctor we be indeed suitably employ yeah it be a good day I be just a glass half full kind of guy we find a cure to the Prior 's plague we get it after the planet need it and it have be some time since the last report outbreak that be right so I be chalk that one up to the win column look all I be say be let us not get carry away yes we stop they this time but you can be damn sure they be already dig up some other mean of spread fear and destruction through this galaxy yeah that be why we call they the bad guy and by the look of thing the next one 's go to be something big the Priors be already start to step up the rhetoric with all this talk of doomsday when all shall witness the final battle between the light and darkness that be what they say about Tyson Holyfield there be always a rematch alright let us move out those ancient ruin be not go to explore themselves hold up SG 1 shut she down your mission have be scrub why because you be need elsewhere General what be go on a team of representative from the International Oversight Advisory be go on a tour of the Gamma site Pentagon want SG 1 to accompany they as their official escort that be a most unusual request it will be IOA 's first time offworld the President want to make sure it go off without a hitch he figure who well to ensure that than our top team Sir I do not mean to gripe Permission to gripe grant we be be put on babysitte duty do not underestimate the importance of this mission this be the IOA these people carry a lot of influence with the Stargate program how it be run how it be fund you should feel honored just do not keep they up past 10 00 and remember to read they a bedtime story before tuck they in for the night Season 9 Episode 17 the Scourge it be it be much big than I imagine we get that a lot Mr Chapman Mr Lapierre Miss Shen I would like you to meet our escort to the Gamma site SG 1 Lieutenant Colonel Cameron Mitchell Lieutenant Colonel Samantha Carter teal'c and Dr Daniel Jackson phd in archaeology anthropology and philology the man who solve the riddle of the Stargate Shen Xiaoyi Graduate of Beijing Foreign Studies University and the London School of Economics and Political Science former attaché to the chinese mission in the United States your Chinese be suppose to be quite good not as good as your English of course what about he we be still teach he yeah that be very funny go to hell Chevron Seven lock the Gamma site be 24 000 light year from here but once we step through the event horizon it will take we less than one second to get there after you just to clarify I be go to be disassemble at the molecular level then reassemble on the other side that be right and the chance of my be reassemble incorrectly highly unlikely but not impossible that be a word I stop use nine year ago when I join the Stargate program this planet be choose for several reason include its unique radioactive ionosphere which make it difficult to lock onto surface target from orbit so no one can steal the Stargate you can not be too careful these day we have over 30 scientist engage in ongoing project here at any give time this be Dr Myers our lead entomologist Doctor would you mind tell we a little about your research yes I be study an asexual fast reproducing insect responsible for the devastation of numerous offworld crop a space bug right Space bug however for the purpose of my research I refer to they as R75 now the fact that these insect have only manifest themselves on planet recently visit by Priors make their analysis a top priority be there anything to indicate that this be more than mere coincidence no not yet now our initial research prove incredibly challenging due to the short lifespan of the R75 specimen until we succeed in dramatically increase their life cycle by deprive they of sustenance they feed and they die within a matter of hour they starve and they live so far it be be three day and counting would you stop that please a bit lethargic be not they they be nocturnal no they function during the daylight they just prefer the darkness they spend most of their time burrow underground consume crop from the root up now R75 also display a rather interesting defense mechanism which we be still in the process of study Observe Echolocation exactly I theorize they use it to detect their enemy such as bird for instance Alright Dr Myers Let us move on well I be not do yet we get the idea thank our next stop be Dr Sharma our lead botanist seriously what be we do here honest answer pr for the Stargate program I be tell you today it be escort foreign delegate on offworld tour tomorrow it be comic book convention and supermarket opening I know how you feel but if we can somehow reassure the IOA of the job Stargate command be do Daniel Jackson the problem be not the IOA okay if we can somehow reassure the chinese government oh I think they be look for more than reassurance well can you blame they I mean three year ago we promise to share all offworld technology of a non military nature that be not in the original wording of the agreement look I do not want to argue about this I be right we will leave it at that compelling argument teal'c what do you think I think I should have remain with the tour Science fair 's over look like Dr Toshiaki 's magnetic resonance field study be the crowd favorite how wonderful for he what be for lunch Meatloaf monday do you mind if I go grab something take your time I be go to run some test come and get it not hungry you can not possibly have a taste for for meatloaf do not feel like join we at the other table I be just in the middle of okay do not mind if I do sorry you be just in the middle of something take note on my visit here while the detail be still fresh on my mind this tour have provide I some wonderful insight into tedious offworld research and the lunch menu here on your Gamma site well believe it or not the be this where you tell I the SGC have no choice but to maintain its air of secrecy surround its operation that as an outsider I could never understand nor appreciate the work you all do save our planet time and again well actually I be go to say believe it or not the meatloaf 's pretty good in the three year since our nation sign the Gate alliance treaty your government have make great stride in the field of military technology but leave we out in the cold well I hate to say it but so long as the U S military be run the show that be just the way it be go to be perhaps it be time that change there be no way the american military will ever give up control of the Stargate program maybe it will not have a choice in the matter so what do the test say I do not know I be call in to help Santiago with his mealworm situation you know Pullman if I be not such a patient man I swear oh my God all clear Damn thing bite I I must say Colonel the scope of the facility have surpass my expectation yes quite remarkable for my part I be somewhat disappointed I be hope the tour would be a little more thorough the Gamma site be a U S Military facility Miss Shen Access to some of the more sensitive area be restrict Dr Myers be you okay R75 breached containment and we have to exercise a disposal protocol Dr Myers be bite but he go to the infirmary to get check out and they do not find anything wrong with he how the hell do the bug breach containment well Dr Myers think he may have trigger some sort of massive reproduction cycle after feed they a piece of meatloaf wait a minute R75 be omnivorous carnivorous actually they seem to have lose their taste for plant the representative be get a little anxious I be afraid I be go to have to insist that we be permit to return to Earth as schedule I be sorry Mr Woolsey no one be go anywhere this base be under lockdown until we can establish the source of Dr Myers ' condition where be he go back to Earth where he will be quarantine he get to go back we do not have the medical facility for this if we do not send he back he could die I be sorry this be totally unacceptable the Pentagon will be hear from the IOA about this and you can be certain your name will be mention Colonel Carnivorous move now this be outrageous Mr Woolsey assure I that we would be leave on schedule back to the elevator we be go upstairs what be go on we have a bit of a bug problem you do not want to be last I will explain everything I do not understand what happen to he well I can not say for sure but my guess be that the bug must have lay its egg in he they incubate and when they hatch well we know they eat meat I be sorry I ask well I think we be past the point of coincidence there be no question these bug be the Priors ' follow up to the virus and it appear they be design to circumvent any attempt to forestall their destructive nature deny they crop and their physiology adapt to an alternate food source yeah we Colonel Pearson Colonel do you read it be alright I imagine it be just a little power fluctuation nothing to worry about oh damn it that be enough of this Colonel what be the situation not good there be thousand of those thing in the pod they kill one of my man before we retreat we lose the Gate room we need to take it back sound like a plan Mr Woolsey my man will escort you and your people to the surface get you to a safe location get you as far away from here as possible until this situation be contain I do not think so excuse I SG 1 will escort we out they be here to ensure the safety of this delegation you understand that no one get off this planet until the Gate be retake and I be sure colonel Pearson and his people will do everything in their power to make sure that happen in the meantime you will take we to the surface you will protect we as per your order from the pentagon Alright get they out of here excuse I surely we could have take a jeep we be head to an unmanned research station it be locate approximately 10 click from here through dense forest then I have to ask if this be really necessary I mean could not we just wait here until colonel Pearson give we the all clear our order be to take you to the research station that be where we be go teal'c what be that it be the bug what be happen we have to move now hold up hold up I think we can assume the bug get off the base they must be use their echolocation as a mean to hunt their prey Us she mean we where can we go they move underground we need rocky terrain somewhere difficult for they to move we can try the cave this way get they inside they be come they be highly sensitive to sound the concussive force of our weapon should be enough to drive they back be you serious fine where do we shoot just fire at the ground very nice Alright folk listen up we be surround by rock here so there be no way the bug be dig in we 've get the entrance cover Everything be go to be fine until we run out of bullet bullet yeah what do you have for I Chief Sir we be unable to acquire a video feed from the surveillance camera in the Gamma site Gate room but I 've manage to pick up motion sensor telemetry what have you find out I learn that bug still creep I out it all start when I be a kid and my parent take I out on this picnic and this bug crawl up on I maybe you would prefer to hear this story another time I doubt it oh well after careful analysis of the telemetry we get back from the Gamma site Gate room I have determine that this be our culprit R75 the Prior bug yeah well that connection be yet to be determine but you know we be originally investigate this pesky little crop killer as a possible weapon against the addictive kassa harvest be produce and distribute by the Lucian Alliance and the various specimen we get from different offworld location be incredibly voracious so voracious that they would literally eat themselves to death but when deprive of nourishment these insect undergo some sort of Fascinating how do we kill they well I mean give the update datum I should be able to whip something up very well as per protocol CR91 we will be send the Odyssey to deliver the payload from planetary orbit CR91 Sir the toxin will be lethal to human as well I mean we will have to be sure that the Gamma site be evacuate before we deploy it that be assume there be anyone leave to evacuate on the bright side I be worried that my report would make for a boring read so I be guess we be go to lose point for this little incident to be honest with you my report be a mere formality ultimately it will have no bearing on my government 's plan of action in regard to the Stargate program what exactly should we be expect down the line Dr Jackson Daniel Daniel maybe now be not the right time to be have this conversation when would be a good time perhaps when we be all back on Earth and not have to worry about be eat alive by alien insect look I understand your government have issue with Stargate command but you can not deny the accomplishment nor the significant that have nothing to do with it Daniel let I ask you something if nine year ago it have be my country not the United States military that have give you the opportunity to travel to the star would it have make a difference to you would you have turn we down no of course not so long as the priority remain offworld exploration that could benefit Earth I would have gladly accept the offer I may hold you to that someday at ease Colonel Pearson come in Pearson come in Gamma site do you read Damn it if they have not answer by now yeah I know you okay yes Sir I be fine I be just a little bit rattle be all we have hear nothing from the Gamma site since we leave I fear we must assume the bad and plan accordingly yeah I be think the same thing we can not remain here indefinitely eventually this position will be overrun yeah we need to get as far away as possible well give the rate these bug be multiply it be doubtful we could outpace they on foot we must return for the F 302s he be go Airman Walker 's miss what do you mean miss I just go to the front to check on he he be not there anymore perhaps he be just step out to relieve himself we will be back Walker think I get something come to you we be too late Walker hey just take it easy wait do not move Jackson why do not you go back to the cave tell Carter that Teal'c and I be go for the 302 where be you plan on land they we will do an aerial surveillance we will find some place and then we will come back we will get everybody and ferry they to a safe location okay where would that be far away from here right okay well good luck let I ask you a question in all the year you be fight the Goa'uld do you ever just step back and say soon or later our luck be go to run out we be go to get our ass kick never never not once even though you be massively outnumber fight an opponent with superior technology and firepower they may have have the superior force and resource but we possess something far great which be a just cause I have no doubt the Goa'uld would be defeat perhaps not in my lifetime but I know eventually they would fall and I have no doubt the same fate await the Ori see that be what I like about you you be always positive Hell you be probably already past this bug situation think about what movie you want to watch tomorrow night I be consider Old school my boy blue what be that wait here teal'c Cameron what be your status we be okay Carter what happen look like the base self destruct trigger the Gamma site 's go how could the self destruct have be trigger the bug must have get into the system what difference do it make now the base have be destroy please calm down do not tell I to calm down if we have be allow to leave on schedule please keep your voice down I be sick of be tell what to do why should I listen to you why should any of we listen to you because you be alert the bug to our presence Colonel a word I understand you be do everything in your power to help we and I appreciate that but I think you be be a bit insensitive to our need right now all I be ask be for a little reassurance a few word to let they know that everything be go to be okay I do not think it be too much to ask all thing consider Mr Woolsey if I could go back in time which admittedly be an opportunity I be occasionally present with I would have make sure that we leave the base as schedule but the reality be for the time be we be stick here trap in this cave surround by predatory insect with no way of get to the Stargate now I be sorry but I be go to have a hard time muster up a convincing pep talk all thing consider I see in that case I would just like to point out that this routine offworld excursion have turn into a disaster and the ramification for Stargate command will be enormous save our life would go a long way toward minimize the damage I will keep that in mind do not worry she say everything be go to be okay I be tell you it be time you get your own place I endeavor to establish a life offbase last year I even go so far as to acquire my own apartment unfortunately it do not work out yeah I know you got frame for murder but you can not let one bad experience put you off Hell the first time I move out I live next door to a guy who practice his drum solo all night long when we get back I be go to help you find your own place no that will be unnecessary Dude what be friend for for listen when they be tell that will be unnecessary what the hell be take they where be you guy request radio silence I think we be good to go perhaps we should keep any unnecessary conversation to a minimum okay Sir just receive a subspace transmission from the Odyssey its e t A be five hour and the Pentagon 's on line two thank you Chief Landry here Alright scratch plan B what do we do now if the Gate be bury they will not be able to send a rescue team which mean they will send the Odyssey in fact it be probably already on its way here so all you 've get to do be sit back relax Everything be go to be fine theoretically theoretically theoretically yes the Odyssey could come and beam we off the planet 's surface but look I be sorry but there be no point in sugar coat this if Stargate command be operate under the assumption that the base have be lose they will enact protocol CR91 what be that once in orbit the Odyssey will launch a payload probably a neurotoxin that will wipe out R75 that will allow Stargate command to mount a salvage operation of the Gamma site but they will beam we out of here first our transmitter will not work because of the interference in the atmosphere what about our life sign because the bug be multiply at an alarming rate and because of the fact that we be completely surround the Odyssey will not be able to pick up our individual reading inside a sea of life sign oh my God what you be say be that they be come out all this way but instead of rescue we they be go to kill we with poison gas because they have no way of know that we be still here then we be go to die on this planet 25 000 light year from Earth hey relax for starter it be only 24 000 light year what be your e t A for Odyssey well I have no way of know exactly when it be send but give the approximate time that Stargate command lose contact with the Gamma site and allow for the production of the toxin I would say inside of a few hour we must find a way to contact the Odyssey to let their crew know that we be alive except our only way of communicate with that ship go up with the Gamma base maybe not the research station it must have some sort of communication array that allow it to transmit datum back to the Gamma site but be it capable of reach a ship in planetary orbit it could if I have some time to work on it then all we have to do be get to the research station right and the only thing between we and it be five mile of forest and a whole lot of bug Piece of cake keep move I can not we be almost there that be what you say almost half an hour ago the transmission we will be send will enable the Odyssey to triangulate our position and pick up our individual life sign but we all have to be within the target area we 've be walk for hour we do not have time to sit around we be in violent agreement you know what sit here you cover our 6 but stay alert you will hear the bug come the tree ferret give no warning Tree ferret yeah nasty bugger swoop down and separate a man 's head from his torso before he can blink you you be lie wait we be almost there stop say that there it be let us pick up the pace Frack let us go look out look out can you do it Colonel be it work it be too late we be too late they be right outside be it go to work do you think you can make it Shut up shut up let she do her work thank you Mr Woolsey you be welcome how be it go I need to significantly boost the power in order to penetrate the radioactivity in the ionosphere alright boost it already yeah I think I be good the vibration be generate by the communication array must be attract the bug think you can hold they off be this a bad time to tell you we be almost out of ammo it be time to improvise okay go how long before they receive the transmission they should pick it up as soon as they enter orbit but like I say we have no way of know when that be go to be how long can they hold off the bug they be approach from the right well the motion sensor work that push they back a little over here that be the last charge Miss Shen suffer a broken ankle and have take an indefinite leave Mr Lapierre and Mr Chapman meanwhile have go back to work none the bad for wear what kind of fallout should we be expect from all of this surprisingly minimal you may face an official reprimand but the IOA recognize the fact that these be circumstance beyond your control it may seem like they do an inordinate amount of complain but off the record the IOA have nothing but praise for the job you be do here just do not let it go to your head well I be head back to Washington thank you again for the offworld tour it be an eye opening experience while you be go we receive report that two more planet have be hit by these bug r D be work on solution that target these insect without harm other plant and animal life I think I would lose you there nice to have you back so we still do movie night yeah why not Good already pick something out Old school Starship Troopers be it humorous be it ever previously on Stargate SG 1 Merlin King Arthur and the knight of the round table Merlin yes be an Ancient I think so what do this have to do with where this allege treasure be bury certain thread point to the knight of the round table gather great treasure from the far corner of Arthur 's domain and hide they in a magical stronghold at Avalon all free Jaffa have always have the great respect for the warrior of the Sodan grant my freedom change nothing Mitchell we will meet again you be still work on that thing oh hi do you sleep here last night of course not I sleep down the hall in my quarter Sam this device be recover from the cave under Glastonbury who know what ancient secret it may hold well obviously not you or Dr Lee who be be work on that thing for what six month I think it be time we let the egghead at Area 51 take a crack at it not yet I be actually make some progress here that be what you say last night and I be hanker for hash brown so let us go grab some breakfast this be interesting this be the first time one of my verification scan kick back a positive result do this mean I be not get my hash brown it mean this device be interactive I be read an e m output that keep fluctuate between high and low frequency I be go to try to stabilize it sure what have you get to lose Season 9 Episode 18 Arthur 's Mantle you okay yeah fine what just happened nicely do can you read that my Ancient 's a little rusty right we need Jackson Hey Bill good timing take a look at this Yo doc amazing discovery over here Bill you okay oh what the hell what be that I do not know okay you be solid it be the device by initiate it we must 've trigger some sort of localize effect Local mean you and I yeah try pick up that coffee cup oh boy we need to find Daniel out of phase what do that mean it mean we may have shift to an alternate dimension and there be an infinite number of alternate dimension no no no that be alternate reality so when the other SG 1s show up completely different problem see accord to M theory that unite the five superstring theory there be several spatial dimension eleven actually that exist in parallel with our physical reality now these high dimension no I will take your word for it that be alternate reality this be alternate dimension Hell all I need be a good time travel adventure and I 've score the SG 1 trifecta now how be Jackson suppose to help we with this well a similar thing happen to he a few year ago PX7 377 the Crystal Skull you really do read every report from every mission we ever go on do not you I be in that hospital a long time and they be all riveting anyway when Daniel be out of phase nobody could see he except for his grandfather Nicholas Ballard and because the same thing happen to Ballard in Belize Jackson should be able to see we because we be all part of the same club right Perfect teal'c have you see colonel Mitchell I have not I be go to need to talk to your team SG 12 just get back from P8 T 474 and it look like we may have a timeline for whatever it be the Priors be plan accord to the native this doomsday the Priors keep talk about may be only day away I will inform the other Jackson just the guy to help we with a little problem or not the dimension we be occupy must be different from the one he be shift to alternate alternate dimension something like that yeah okay so what do we do we have to find a way to communicate with they any idea unscheduled offworld activation what have we get no i D C Sir but I be receive a radio signal let us hear it what be wrong with it sound like harmonic distortion in the data stream I be not sure Sir can you clean it up I can try Sir okay that sound like something hit the iris any way to know for sure what it be we can run some test do it and get Colonel Carter down here to help unscramble that message yes Sir I can not make head or tail of this that be because the filter coefficient have to be adaptive the filter coefficient have to be adaptive hey wait a minute there you go notice the slight variance in the output Notice it Come on Notice it never mind what do you mean they be miss they be not in their quarter nor be they respond to any attempt to contact they be it possible they be not even on the base we check the front gate neither of they sign out what about security footage we be review tape for both the lab and the cafeteria but beyond that well there be hundred of camera and hour of tape so then we will screen they all if we have to I want they find why be I get that Patrick Swayze in Ghost feel General we need a Whoopi Walter we manage to clean up the message Sir finally we notice a slight variance in the output so we run it through a sequence of digital filter and we come up with this Stargate Command the Sodan please respond do he say Sodan under attack many have fall we request immediate assistance that be when we hear the impact against the iris Sir General Landry we should investigate agree assemble a team Sir colonel Mitchell be the one who should go he be the one who know the Sodan the good I agree but colonel Mitchell be not here right now oh hey have you see colonel Carter hey I be just come to ask you the same thing really 'cause she leave her laptop in my lab she do yeah yeah it be hook up to that device that you pick up in Glastonbury there she be fast forward there be colonel Mitchell what just happen look like the camera go offline probably a power surge they be go okay bring up the security camera for the corridor outside Dr Lee 's lab sync they up to 8 16 and run they simultaneously okay if they do not go through the doorway how do they get out of the room More staff blast just like back at the Gate indeed a battle take place here as well the Sodan have be hide here for thousand of year the only reason we get the transporter code be because colonel Mitchell win their trust I doubt they would 've give they to anyone else and yet evidently they be attack by who my God Conway Stevens get back to the Gate on the double Tell SGC we need med team yes Sir check the area for survivor Whomever do this know well the most efficient way to kill a Jaffa their symbiote have be target they be show no mercy Haikon Pulse be weak he will not survive long his symbiote be dead Lieutenant help I get he into one of these hut we need to get some tretonin in he stat Roast beef the one time I can not eat and they serve roast beef do you know how many time I 've request roast beef this be torture it be only be a few hour you be not the least bit concerned about this no one can see we or hear we we can not touch anything ergo no eat no drinking and I be not go to speculate on the other bodily function if they do not figure out a way to get we back they will figure it out what have you get Doctor well we know that Sam be work on the device we know the device do not give off any typical energy signature emit by ancient transporter technology this lead we to the conclusion that they disappear without leave the room how be that possible Miniaturization do not panic I have calculate the distance they could possibly travel on tiny leg designate by this rope off area all we have to do be find they Ronald start with section 1 a I be unable to locate any other survivor what be his condition we do not know if the tretonin be go to take even then his injury be pretty severe without a symbiote Volnek Haikon Haikon fear not brother you be among friend teal'c save yourself you should not be here tell I who have do this tell I who have cause this devastation Volnek it be Volnek one man do this why would he turn on his people tell I Haikon Haikon Major come in this be Hadden go ahead we be under attack Sir request backup immediately McKenzie you stay with he oh come on it be just a theory anyway if I would be right you would all be call I a genius right now yes but you be not right so anything ah nothing significant fairly constant power reading and slight trace of lepton radiation what what Lepton radiation Lepton lepton radiation yeah but like I say only trace I mean there be nothing significant there get to go Stevens this one be alive I never see he the shot come out of nowhere no doubt Volnek be use a Sodan cloak we get to get he back to the Gate now what be wrong the code be not work someone have remove one of the control crystal then how be we suppose to get out of here we can not come on Jackson figure it out I 've already miss breakfast and lunch General Dr Jackson I just come from Dr Lee 's lab please tell I you have well news I 've be go over some of the text we recover from the cave in Glastonbury and well a lot of they seem to make oblique reference to arthurian legend for instance the word anawyn which show up several time be I believe a variation on annwyn the celtic underworld where king Arthur journey in search of 13 sacred object one of which be a cloak what the picture of the guy with the big billow robe say to render the wearer invisible it be call the mantle of Arthur and be keep at Bardsey Island by none other than our friend Myrddin whom we know well as Merlin exactly I have no idea where you be go with this I either well it be not until Dr Lee tell I that he detect trace amount of lepton radiation from the device that I be able to put it together you see the crystal skull that transport I to another dimension also release lepton radiation and you think the same thing happen to colonel Carter and colonel Mitchell you be damn right accord to legend the mantle make the user invisible now give what I 've read and what be happen today I be guess it be not literally a cloak at all it be the device we recover it make sense Sir Medieval historian could well have attribute the power of the device to a cloak simply because they do not understand it and they could have credit its recovery to Arthur out of deference to the king who be in power at the time now give what we know now it seem much more likely that it be Merlin who actually build the device so why would Merlin build a device that could transport he to another dimension Ooh today 's daily double yeah that be the part I have not quite figure out yet so close but at least it point to the possibility that both colonel Mitchell and colonel Carter may still be somewhere here on this base we just can not see or hear they we could make our way back to the Gate on foot I do not believe that would be wise the journey would take month and the terrain be most treacherous there be not much for we here we be go to run out of supply before long General Landry will send an extraction team when we fail to report and they will end up strand here just like we we have food for the moment and we can build shelter perhaps when the extraction team arrive we can repair the obelisk what about Volnek he be still out there leave he to I teal'c he take out an entire village it be my understanding that those who use a Sodan cloaking device be invisible to everyone but each other so if you use that thing you will be able to see he indeed do not help that guy much though do it now when I be out of phase I could see and hear everything go on around I so it follow if they be in the same situation they be hear what we be say right now except they can not respond maybe they can they just do not know it now what do that look like to you first reaction a keyboard except there be no visual interface not here you mean it be on the other side well it stand to reason that Merlin would want the device to be interactive on both side this and the alternate dimension now the interactivity on this side be difficult to access now I be guess as a type of safeguard against just anyone use the device but there would be no reason to hide it on the other side do you see that oh yeah yeah Sam Mitchell if if you can hear I okay let us call this button yes and this button no okay first question be you guy okay yes Yep yes oh thank god I mean now we be get somewhere okay besides the interactivity be there anything else unusual on your end yes something connect to the device would you call it connect yes yes yes yes be it some sort of display that be that be an emphatic yes okay think so can you read it it be in Ancient be not it okay alright now you guy be go to have to help I translate what you see but you see we do not know what press button randomly will do so we be go to have to stick with yes and no and just do it one letter at a time this be go to take a while oh yeah just keep I post yes Sir okay first letter Status still no word from Teal'c or SG 12 how long be they overdue over an hour tell colonel Reynolds to prep an extraction team have they ready to move out ASAP yes Sir okay first letter next word stop I when you see the right symbol how be it go Fantastic we 've almost complete the first sentence listen you think you will be okay on your own here for a while Sure why we 've lose contact with Teal'c Landry 's send SG 3 and 22 to check on he at the Sodan village I figure I would tag along Offworld yeah well Jackson be able to travel through the Gate when he be out of phase so yeah well that be my point you be out of phase what do you hope to accomplish Sam teal'c could be in trouble I want to check it out no one can see I I can not get hurt I can gather intel that no one else can Sam Mitchell do you see it listen I promise I will come back through the Gate when they dial to check in I will only be go a couple of hour hello you guy still there Cameron Sam Teal'c may need help and I have friend among the Sodan I will be back soon promise like slap a button or something okay thank you first letter next word and stop I when you see the right symbol yes okay next word that be it my God I finally figure out what colonel Carter do to trigger the device I have to run a reverse scan on all the energy fluctuation that we 've be record put they through a program design to anyway I isolate the algorithm she use to synchronize the energy emission come from the device what do not you see that mean if I counteract Sam 's algorithm from my computer allow the emission to return to their normal frequency that could well reverse the process oh just give I a sec this be brilliant that should do it Sam Daniel Bill I will never doubt you again oh boy Dr Jackson can can you hear I if you can press this button for yes teal'c you alright it be a light wound Lieutenant what happen I find Volnek then you be lucky to be alive Haikon other be not so fortunate he wake up a few minute ago what have happen to Volnek ten day ago he go to a neighboring world to acquire supply for our village on the way back to the Chaapa'ai he encounter a Prior he be tell that the Sodan have commit unforgivable treason against the Ori the Prior vow that great ill would befall we then plant his staff into the ground Volnek return to the village and tell I of the encounter we take the threat seriously keep a watchful eye on the Chaapa'ai several day pass without incident until Volnek fall ill he become irrational incoherent we isolate he and treat he with our good medicine but his condition worsen yesterday he break the bond that be mean to restrain he our fine warrior attempt to subdue he but he kill they all with very little effort he then turn on everyone in sight his own brother Jolan be kill in the carnage that follow Women and child flee to the wood and Volnek follow they and slaughter they all without mercy to the good of my knowledge I be the only one to have survive rest brother Rest SG 22 establish defensive perimeter SG 3 stick close to I Colonel Reynolds teal'c what the hell happen here why have not you check in the eye of the god have be damage we be trap here so be you the Ori have a hand in what have transpire here the Ori we have much to discuss come okay if you be still there I 've give it some thought and my guess be it should be a simple matter of reverse the process I be on it be that suppose to be reassure where be Mitchell he go offworld with the extraction team what he be convince he could help teal'c I could not talk he out of it why do not that surprise I there be no sense in worry about that now on the bright side the translation will go a lot quick now that you be here okay this be interesting it appear to be a log of some kind Merlin be conduct research on some kind of new invention and it be something big he go to great length to try and hide it this device be invent for the sole purpose of keep his research a secret he need a way to conceal it from Daniel Merlin need to conceal his research from his fellow ascend being but if he be ascend he must have retake human form to perform his research I do not get it what invention could have be so important that it would have lead he to give up his ascension a weapon a weapon capable of destroy ascended being you hit he with two p 90 and he do not die how be that possible we have encounter something like this before an ancient device capable of reanimate dead tissue Anubis use a similar technology to give life to his Kull warrior I be assume there be no cure the Volnek we know be dead so how do we stop he it whatever by destroy the body entirely claymore oh that be what I be talkin ' about we just plant two of they opposite each other and run a tripwire right through the middle then all we get to do be lure he in Piece of cake while we be at it maybe we can teach he how to speak japanese I will do it what teal'c the kill zone be go to be huge you will have to be awful quick to get out of it Understood no no now that be just crazy let us at least wait for reinforcement Waiting will only put the life of other at risk Volnek be clever enough to disable the eye of the god undoubtedly the miss crystal be in his possession the only way we can return to Earth be to retrieve it and the only way that we can do that be by kill Volnek there be no other way Merlin believe that the Ori represent a significant threat to the safety of this galaxy include the ancient themselves who refuse to take any action to protect themselves against they so he go ahead and develop the weapon anyway well he find a way of do it without their knowing about it by shift his research to another dimension so the weapon do do he ever complete it see this be all technical way over my head I wish you understand Ancient these note seem to indicate that he complete the weapon here on Earth and then have to relocate it to I do not need to know Ancient to understand what that be a Gate address to where he hide the weapon claymore be ready you and your man establish a perimeter I will lead Volnek into the trap you sure you want to do this I be okay I be go to try to make an adjustment to the algorithm it be a bit of a long shot but if I can get this to sync up oh no hello this be Dr Lee I I would like to speak with general Landry please yeah it be a bit of an emergency you know there be a fine line between crazy brave and crazy crazy my friend and you be walk it you realize he take out an entire Sodan village you know the last thing I need be for you to get yourself kill do you realize how long it will take I to find a replacement you worry far too much Colonel Mitchell you can hear I now and see you you be not surprised what be it what be go on I be not sure but I may have accidentally drain a significant portion of the machine 's power supply how significant accord to these reading it could reach critical failure inside 15 minute and what happen to Carter Mitchell and Daniel in all likelihood we will be permanently strand so we can see each other when you be cloak that mean if Volnek be cloak he will be able to see I all I 've get to do be get his attention and lead he right back to Reynolds I do not feel comfortable allow you to shoulder all the risk be not no risk I be out of phase remember and you be certain you will not be injure absolutely hey take your good shot if you do not good luck Colonel Mitchell hey do you even think twice about that I do not Volnek Hey Volnek Volnek where be you homeboy come on out and show I some of those monster move oh there you be I be get worry sorry you got to do well than that come on big fella there you go come on and get you some we be run out of time okay I think I 've get it this look like some sort of master control screen yeah here it be it be a it be a button combination if this work what happen to Mitchell I do not know it be possible there be still a subspace connection link he to the device and if there be not Doctor okay I be go to try and make an adjustment to the algorithm it be a bit of a long shot you well be sure about this Doctor because if you make I disappear there will not be a dimension safe enough for you come on do not give up come on come on oh crap you do it no actually I do not it be Daniel he figure it out where be colonel Mitchell you know the whole point of my come here be for I to rescue you you be most welcome Colonel Mitchell now let us see he get up from that one unfortunately we must now locate the crystal what you talk about this crystal I take it off he during the fight you know if we hurry we will make it in time for dinner previously on Stargate SG 1 these stone be actually an ancient form of communication device that link their user psychically allow they to see through each other 's eye I think we be in they we be from another galaxy great holy army shall be gather and train to fight all who embrace evil in the name of the Gods ship shall be build to carry our warrior out amongst the star do not that look an awful lot like a yeah it do it can not be cos I be go to say Stargate try Supergate what be you do try to help Daniel someone have to do something and you would not listen the singularity be form Merlin be conduct research on some kind of new invention a weapon capable of destroy ascended being I do not need to know Ancient to understand what that be a Gate address to where he hide the weapon ' morning have you see Colonel Mitchell Men 's locker ' morning Jackson be there something I should know Season 9 Episode 19 Crusade how be this possible oh my God it work I mean you know it be work we do not think we be ever go to make this work make what work well since you disintegrate the Alteran communication stone and the base terminal in the Kawoosh we 've be I be sorry the what the unstable vortex of a form wormhole Kawoosh do not think I 've ever hear you call it that before really do not get I wrong it be good no I mean I be sure I hello hi my name be Vala but I be in Daniel Jackson right now anyway we 've be work on a way of artificially emulate the Alteran technology Dr Lee be able to collect quite a bit of datum from the time that you be unconscious and communicate with the people from the Ori galaxy so use that and this Tok'ra subspace communicator we 've be try to mimic the frequency send and receive by the stone we just do not think we be have any luck well I be really glad you be I be desperately hope this so you be in the Ori galaxy yes be you able to communicate with Daniel no just see and hear you see we 've be use the datum collect from the stone that Daniel activate on this end which be why you be connect to his body that be funny be not it Daniel always want to get into my pant and now I be in his oh that be not funny he can not defend himself yeah okay you Vala be the only other person on this end to touch a stone so oh I get it I get it I can not exactly connect to myself if I be not here so you know last time we could not break the connection well that should be easy this time we just shut down the computer no I mean not yet I do not just drop in to say hello I have something very important to tell you I remember stagger into the ring there be bolt of energy everywhere we suspect that the matterstream be suck into the black hole we all appreciate the part you play in destroy the enemy beachhead do not mention it by part I assume you mean lead role we be happy to hear that you be okay actually for the record I never say I be okay actually the timing of this be a little awkward Sir if we disconnect now there be no guarantee that we can reestablish the link Dr Jackson be suppose to join I to meet with the russian and chinese representative of the IOA in about a half an hour they request that he be there say it be a matter of great importance not as important as what I have to tell you believe I I will try and be as quick as I can and then you can have Daniel back I promise so the next thing I remember be wake up in a bed in a village like Ver Eger that be the one that Harrid and Sallis live in they be the people that Daniel and I inhabit for a while anyway it turn out this village be call Ver Isca you know this water be lovely but I think Daniel skip breakfast and I suddenly have a craving for pancake and ice cream double chocolate fudge brownie if memory serve oh I will continue while you rustle that up thank so where be I in bed ah yes in bed a man name Tomin have apparently find I lie unconscious in the ring and have think the god have send I to he which I let he continue to believe hi do you feel strong enough to get up and go for a walk today maybe I will be back after prostration have fun thank you it be obvious he be smite who could blame he right thank what thank I do realize he be a devout Ori follower and probably would have be stand on the front line cheer while they burn I to death if he know the truth about I but he be very sweet in his own way and not bad look actually I think Tomin have be on his own before I come along mostly due to a limp that have leave he crippled since childhood he do not like to talk about it much but I could see that the other villager look down on he because of it in their mind the Ori must have deem he unfit for normalcy so that be how they choose to see he I do my good to blend in at first accord to Tomin and therefore as far as the villager be concern I be the woman who fall from the sky which make I feel kind of special I later learn that they always suspect I would escape from another village as a result of some scandal and then I start to feel much more like I be use to what worry I most be the Ori while no one have actually see I or Daniel in person that do not mean that ascend being could not recognize I after a while I start to think and hope that maybe thing be go to be okay ultimately my goal be to try and find a way back here or at the very least try and communicate with you to let you know what be go on so I figure my good bet be to root out any of Fannis 's gang from the anti Ori underground see if they have any technology or any information about an Ori Stargate I might possibly gain access to but I have to be very careful the village be run by this complete bear of a man name Seevis who be both barkeep and administrator which seem the odd contradiction he claim to be the most pious man in the village and if anyone stray from the path of righteousness it be Seevis who make sure you be severely punish for it but seem to be a lot more leeway for sin in the religion of Origin than one would presume from all the preaching so it be just like my grandma use to say no point go to confession if you be not get nothing to confess exactly by the god I do not know what the Ori bless you with because it be not brain and it be not look what make you think that something like she would have anything to do with a rodent like you without reason I will pay I swear oh I know you will or I will make you wish you be be burn alive by the fire of Celestis I have pick thing more precious out from between my toe I soon realize it be not a contradiction at all Seevis be do the work of the god by make sure this village have every reason in the world to prostrate make he a very rich and very powerful man in the process believe I I usually applaud the colorful detail of a good story especially when tell with such interesting intergalactic and body snatching mean but Daniel and I be late to meet with the russian and chinese representative you state that you have information of great importance I do I do and I be get to it we get the back story Tomin be a nice guy Seevis be a butthead how about you skip ahead a little Fine Tomin and I got marry whoa marry stay with I I have no choice I tell you he be very devout and there be no way he would have sleep with I out of wedlock okay maybe we skip ahead a little too far well I try to lay it out in order Ooh that be a bad choice of word okay why exactly do you have no choice you know what those people do to you when you do something wrong they burn you alive and why would they burn you alive this time for get pregnant out of wedlock you be pregnant yes I keep forget you can not actually see I when I realize why I be feel sick all the time I figure I have to do something I decide my only choice be to marry Tomin as quickly as possible and pray the timing be close enough so he could be convince the baby be his all right hold the phone and I ask this not 100 sure that I want to know the answer whose baby be it that be the thing I do not know as in I swear I do none of the necessary bit between my arrival in the Ori galaxy and my wedding night which be definitely after I know for sure there be no way humanly possible that I know of that I could have get pregnant someone go to say something anybody you have be impregnate without copulation yes and I be absolutely terrify have any of you ever hear of anything like it well there be one Darth Vader really how do that turn out actually I be think of King Arthur you be yeah I 've be read everything I can find on our ancient friend Merlin accord to some of the legend he enchant the queen who bear Arthur I have to go wait I have not even get to the bit you have to hear yet I carry this child right now be a problem a big problem for I but believe I there be one which be much much big it be a miracle look at I the Prior bless I I can walk I can run I can fight now you can what I 've be conscript they be build ship and army by the ten of thousand the village I be live in be one of many on a world among dozen like it as we fear since the day Daniel meet the Ori they have be prepare their follower for a crusade be you sure this be what you want be you serious I never dream I would one day be fit to serve the Ori in this way by kill people you know nothing about all I need to know be that they be enemy of the Ori that they reject the teaching of Origin and would have we stray from the path these so call unbeliever they be so far away how can they affect we why do you have to go all the way over there Evil must not be allow to fester anywhere our journey towards enlightenment may take we to many unexpected place I can not imagine you kill anyone I be not afraid to heed the will of the god nothing I say will change your mind will it fear not once we warrior of Ori have vanquish the wicked I shall return you will not be the same no he be one of the gentle most honest soul I have ever know he have be raise since birth to believe in the Ori to follow Origin this be not a fight anyone can win not without a tragic amount of bloodshed General Landry to the briefing room General Landry please report to the briefing room I would well get down there go ahead since you 've be go we 've learn a few thing about the Ori that their follower might be interested to know it do not matter what the truth be about the Ori the people will not hear it no matter what you say obviously some of they be suspicious enough to form a resistance you be talk about a handful of people compare to million who would not know the truth if it be stand right in front of they it be all lie and propaganda as far as they be concern we be wrong they be right they be good we be bad we must worship the Ori or die and they will fight until we be dead or they be Period I be very sorry to keep you wait where be Dr Jackson he be otherwise occupy at the moment we be go to have to proceed without he ah it be no matter I only ask he be here as a courtesy seeing as he negotiate the original treaty between our two country result in Russia loan you our Stargate yes loan in return for full participation in this program and considerable sum of money I be aware of that as I say I only ask for this meeting out of courtesy to you and Dr Jackson you have be admirable comrade in our co operative effort however official notification have be give to your President as we speak of what well as you know the treaty renewal come up in two week Russia will no long be participate under the current structure what be you say I be say we be take our Stargate back so this girl in the bar her name be Denya and we strike up a bit of a friendship by the look on your face I can see you be not surprised I have more in common with a village harlot than I do with any of the lady from the local knitting circle do not know what you be talk about at least she be honest I be pregnant once really it do not last long oh I be sorry hey I hear something really weird I promise you I 've hear it all well have you ever hear of someone get pregnant without actually do the deed how could that happen I do not know maybe you fall asleep you know that be happen to I before I 've be drunk and not remember whole day I be not talk about I no I be just just wonder if you 've ever hear of the Ori give someone a baby magically they perform miracle all the time right if you say so she be smart too she be test I be you say she be part of the anti Ori underground take a long time to get she to admit it she say she be afraid of Seevis and that he would kill she if he find out what do you want take your hand off I so what do I do she be unholy she conspire with those who would lead we from the path of Origin I do not know who you 've be talk to but it be a lie she be an unbeliever and she must be punish for her sin get I Richard Woolsey now General where be the rest of the international committee representative why be not they here this have nothing to do with they I think it do the Stargate belong to Russia now in the past my government have be unwilling to establish and support a Stargate program of its own but that have change because China be back you do the rest of the committee member know this they will be invite to participate in the program the same as they have in yours as will your country you really think my government will give up the Gate I do not see what choice they will have who else in the village have be corrupt apart from you I have no idea what you be talk about no one shall look upon speak to or aid such evil you will tell I who you 've conspire with and the unbeliever will be find out and punish for their sin Hallowed be the Ori Hallowed be the Ori I do not know why I expect he to come rush over and unchain I just the mother of his unborn child or so he be suppose to think she be die out there I know do not you think if she be go to say anything she would have tell you already I do not know why he eventually do it or why Seevis let we go I be leave out there without food or water for three day I can not believe the baby survive that part of I be hope it do not it be kind of surprising part of you be hope it do I mean give how it be conceive it be hard to explain Seevis he will not bother we again I promise you you do not think I be evil I be sorry I leave you out there for so long please forgive I I will see you this evening fear not despite Tomin 's reassurance the idea of spend a day in the village with Seevis just a stone throw away make I nervous besides it be high time I do some more extensive recon I know what be happen I know where they be go every day what they be do but see it be something else entirely Impressive be not it General you wish to see I from the sound of it the Ori be plan an invasion of massive proportion in the very near future it look like it may be a very bad time to be argue over who get to use the Stargate Colonel but I assume you be count on that no sane individual or country want to face war at any time tell I about your government 's intention be more than mere courtesy do it with the chinese representative of the oversight committee present be mean to point out China 's involvement that be not in the official notification to terminate the treaty give to the President obviously it could not be they offer you a deal to back your own SGC program in truth you do not really know if you like that scenario any well than the one currently in practice you do however see an opportunity to use it as leverage but you could not very well present a wish list along with the official notification without it look like blackmail or have it on record that you be merely use the Chinese so you leave it to I to figure out and ask you the question what be it you really want stay back I promise you do not want to come any close you can put that down it be okay we have to put you through that to be sure that we could trust you he be part of the underground Seevis be the leader the religious pomp and circumstance be a cover the rest be for money power and influence the thing you need when you be want to mount a rebellion do they not fear be discover by the Ori of course but the only other choice be to do nothing what they be plan be quite the opposite of nothing we have the plan and we have many people down there on the inside you really think it can work it have to the ship have to be activate by the Priors but Seevis say he have find a way to rig enough of they to start off a massive chain reaction from what I could tell it look like it might work three day from now in a grand celebration each Prior will activate a ship in a show of the Ori 's power everyone will be there all those who build the ship as well as those who will soon board they and go off and fight in the name of the Ori ten of thousand you be go to kill all of they god can not be god without those who stand beneath they gaze upwards they be go to try and undermine the Ori 's power by eliminate as many of their follower as they could in one fall swoop something I be not sure we would have do in their position Shut the window they trust I grant they nearly kill I so I could earn their trust but at this point I feel I have to take a chance I tell they exactly who I be and how I would get there the communication terminal and the stone have be take by the Prior to Celestis after Daniel and I have be catch use they how do Seevis get his hand on it apparently he have spy among the monk in the city of Celestis they be human in training to become Priors every now and then artifact which predate the Ori ascension be find or dig up deem heretical and then bring to the city to be burn in the fire when the communication terminal come through Seevis 's man recognize its significance and they risk everything to save it and smuggle it out of the city so it appear that Daniel 's crazy little speech about communication from another galaxy do not fall entirely on deaf ear and the Ori do not know they could not tell what be happen right underneath their nose can not be sure but Seevis do not want I to try and contact you until after the sabotage plan have go through in case the Ori detect it just to be safe Vala Vala Blessed be those who follow the path in unison prior your wife be not at home Tomin she must be at market must she to what do I owe the honor of such a visit Word of your courage have spread if you refer to my unchaining of Vala I believe Seevis accuse she unjustly she be not corrupt surely the Ori would not have allow she to have survive so long without food or water they send she to I she be my wife the mother of my unborn child be she now the injury that cripple you since childhood the one I have cure you of to make you a strong proud warrior Trust I will use the strength I have be give to fight all unbeliever in the name of the Ori yes but the same wound that make you lame also make you unable to father child but then be you say she betray I the child be the will of the Ori that be all that matter your courage will be reward Tomin Fear not Hallowed be the child of the Ori Hallowed be the Ori do not go today be the day we 've be wait for Ten Priors from Celestis come to bless the starcraft we have be build these past many month I know everyone be go everyone even the woman and child of course I do not expect you I know you 've be tired but it be go to be a great day if you want to come please stay with I today I have a bad feeling I can not explain it do not you ever just get bad feeling of course I do but then I turn to the Ori for guidance Tomin the day of reckon for all those who be raise by evil be upon they I have spend my whole life wait for the chance to walk the path as I do now my only hope be that you would walk it with I Blessed be those who walk in unison when you say day of reckon we 've hear numerous report of the Priors in this galaxy warning of an impending doomsday a day when all who have renounce the Ori will feel their wrath we know the Priors be just the first wave the real crusade be about to begin the ship be plan to leave but that would mean somewhere out there the Ori have a work Supergate turn out the horrible feeling I have lie to Tomin about be completely justify but for a different reason thousand of man woman and child do not die that day Seevis 's plan fail it do not work the sabotage have break down whether the Ori have detect it or the Priors manage to thwart it on their own we do not know all we know be that the ship come to life and nothing happen except the crowd cheer and begin prostrate pray for a swift victory over all unbeliever do you have any other intel we could use you say this Seevis have access to the spec on the ship what kind of weaponry do they have and shield and anything on the power source they be use no no I guy what be go on Jackson how do I get here the emulator be still run something must have happen on Vala 's end Tomin you say you do not think I could kill an unbeliever well I be so sorry I be wrong you have to listen to I no I be deaf to all but the teaching of Origin the Prior tell I Seevis be corrupt that he would try to sabotage the ceremony and would have kill thousand he send I here to kill Seevis and here I find you with he conspire over that device they make I do it they tell I they would kill I if I do not help they and after what they do to I out there would not you they think this device be for communication but they be too afraid to use it themselves so they kidnap I and force I to do it for they do the prior tell you I be with they do he tell you to kill I no well there you go then be you able to communicate with the unbeliever far away yes and there be much I can tell you about they if you just put that weapon down Tomin you have to believe I please I overhear your conversation with the Prior the other day I know I be sorry I should have tell you I be there but I be so afraid what he say shock I that this child be the will of the Ori Tomin I swear I have not betray you I have not be with anyone but you so if you truly can not father a child then this baby be a miracle it be our miracle and this be a great burden which I can not bear alone so from this point on we must walk the path together I must leave soon for war then I must come with you so what exactly do we have to give up in the end a 304 really I be surprised the President agree to that Colonel Chekov 's have his eye on one for a while the late be just about to roll out I think the next daedalus class ship be not due out of the pipeline for over a year it be a huge concession but we do not have much choice Sir the Tok'ra and the Asgard be scan for any subspace anomaly that would indicate supergate activity we be monitor the exist black hole that we know of but it be a big galaxy and as we know the Ori could have build another one the interim council have place ha'tak class vessel in every region on high alert this be one needle in a haystack we well find do whatever you have to do if the Ori can send troop and ship here we be go to need every advantage we can find Merlin be work on a weapon to fight the Ori every ally we have and everyone else on this base have already devote themselves to find the Supergate Sir it will not take we long to search one planet where there may be an advanced weapon design specifically to fight these guy this weapon will not help we against their follower I do not think so no but it will be a lot easy convince their follower their god be false if their god be not around anymore go thank you Sir previously on Stargate SG 1 welcome you knight of the round table prove ye worthy and all shall be reveal so you be in the Ori galaxy yes I carry this child right now be a problem a big problem but believe I there be one which be much much big the ship be plan to leave Somewhere out there the Ori have a work Supergate Merlin be conduct research on some kind of new invention a weapon capable of destroy ascended being I do not need to know Ancient to understand what that be a Gate address to where he hide the weapon every ally we have and everyone else on this base have already devote themselves to find the Supergate go hey have anyone stop to think how this thing might possibly work I mean how do you kill something that be pure energy well technically Merlin 's research do not refer to kill a well translation would be neutralize or cancel out well that still beg a lot of question how do you aim at something you can not see clearly can not be a weapon in the conventional sense see ascend being transcend ordinary space time as we know it this device would have to do the same thing in other word you have no idea what it might be yeah pretty much that be it this look promise well it certainly look like a place where Merlin might have live well I would not get too excited just yet there could be dozen of village in the area just like this one no way to know for sure this be the right one well there be that traveler I be Meurik Governor of this village Welcome to Camelot Season 9 Episode 20 Camelot these must be the stranger that everyone be speak of this be Antonius our village historian Welcome to Camelot past and future home of King Arthur and his round table sorry future home I assume you know the history of the battle of Camlann of course where Arthur be mortally wound by Mordred Arthur mortally wound Ridiculous Arthur defeat Mordred at the battle of Camlann after which he and his fellow knight set off to find the Sangreal that be the Holy Grail that be long ago but we know in our heart that one day he will return to we what happen to Merlin when he leave I have matter to attend to it be good I take my leave now enjoy your stay with we do I offend he not at all it be just that Merlin 's name be rarely mention in public and why be that well many believe he be a wizard of darkness he may have try to do good but there be always potential for great mischief in his heart thankfully he have neither be see nor hear of since Arthur 's departure the library where he practice his strange art remain seal to this day Merlin have a library here of course it be his private sanctuary here in Camelot we would like to see that I be afraid that be impossible the library be protect by a powerful curse it be say that all those who enter Merlin 's sanctuary forfeit their life to its guardian the black knight okay so good case scenario this curse of the black knight be a story Merlin make up to scare off the local bad case scenario he be get another holographic knight protect his good like he do back in England either way I do not see a big problem what give your narrow victory over the knight in the Avalon cave it would seem that your overconfidence be ill advise do I say anything about I do the fighting the point be last time be a test design to measure a challenger 's worth this time it sound more like a defense mechanism set up to protect Merlin 's research which mean it could be a lot tough and the same rule might not apply I think we should split up and look around indeed Surrender mordre never yield I yield but next time I want to be Arthur I do not know if that be go to help if you keep move around like Ed Grimley here let I show you something do you mind thank you try not to bob around quite so much Nice where do you learn to fight Broomstick battle with my kid brother and the Sodan ritual of Kel Shak Lo make I the nimble warrior that I be today so do either one of you know where we can find Merlin 's Library Merlin 's library this be it the door be magicke there be a key but no one dare use it where would we find this key it be keep in the village archive no absolutely not Antonius I will not be party to your death your life would be forfeit the instant you step inside we have face one of Merlin 's knight before what impossible if you have you would not be here to tell the tale well I be because we defeat he and in defeat he we acquire the treasure he have hide away on our world one of those treasure lead we here to Camelot Antonius you be the village historian do not tell I you have not dream about what might be inside there no one must know of my participation in this venture get it not Meurik not my fellow villager and most importantly not my wife Livia who believe I be review council minute with brother Abelard tonight we be never here spider Yep this could take a while this be interesting this be a reference to Merlin 's prophetic ability there be a similar myth on Earth that Merlin could see the future because he actually age backwards in time it be not mean to be take literally but we have see that a lot of legend and folklore have a strong basis in fact Avalon Atlantis the Easter bunny I guess there be a few exception be you say that there be time travel technology here I be say there could be anything around here well I hate to break it to you folk but the only technology I be see be a bunch of dusty old book and a secret passage alright there be another chamber we should not go in there we 've tempt fate enough for one night well you can stay up here if you want no I shall take my leave it be not a puzzle be it no it be an ancient control device what do it control I have no idea Livia we 've see this type of interface before activate it be a matter of correctly interpret these symbol he be dead how do you explain this Antonius have it with he when he be kill Meurik we be very sorry about what happen you go into the wizard 's library do not you yes we do look it be not suppose to go down like that we figure if the knight be go to appear it would be in the chamber and he would not go after anybody but we you be warn of the danger and you refuse to believe and you awaken the curse the black knight be not part of any curse he be not magical and he be not unbeatable your world as well as countless other be in danger of be overrun by an enemy far more powerful than you could ever imagine they be call the Ori and they will destroy anyone who do not kneel before they we learn that a long time ago Merlin be work on a weapon that could be use against they and the key to find that weapon be inside that library we have neither see nor hear of these Ori but we have witness the power of the black knight leave this village take the curse with you well we can not just give up Daniel we be not exactly welcome here anymore do not you see this be exactly what Merlin want why do you think he design the black knight to attack in the village and not in the chamber to incite terror if it just kill whoever be inside the chamber then there would be no great public incentive to keep people out you would go in at your own risk and there would always be someone foolish enough to give it a try yeah someone like we but the point be that he design it that way because he be worried someone might stumble onto the solution which mean there be a solution and it be inside that chamber a shut off switch exactly well that be great but how do it help we now I do not know just give I a little time to talk to these people if I can get some of they on our side we might be able to get Meurik to reconsider only he who be pure of heart and true of spirit can pull the sword from the stone it be say Arthur will not return from his quest until one among we succeed in remove it you ever try it of course not it be for the young man who be prepare to be knight to test themselves with the sword as my brother Ramus will do when he come of age yeah but I 've see you spar you 've get skill I only do that to help Ramus train when Arthur do come back he will need knight to join he on his next crusade the man of this village will be ready to serve he and you be not interested in that Valencia leave we yes Governor you abuse my tolerant nature Colonel I take it it do not go so well not really these man will escort you to the great ring and ensure that you leave as request look you be make a mistake there be no curse now the black knight be a security feature create by Merlin through the use of science and advanced technology there be no magic involv SG 1 welcome aboard the Odyssey Colonel what be go on Change of plan we receive a subspace transmission from a Jaffa vessel near P3Y 229 they be investigate some unusual energy reading this be what they find and if we enhance the image a fully form Supergate Stargate Command try to dial 229 but could not get a lock the planet be probably destroy in the formation of the microsingularity my order be to pick you up and proceed immediately to the Supergate unfortunately the Daedalus be still in the Pegasus galaxy but the Korolev will be join we as soon as possible I do not think it be operational yet it be be rush into service we be to meet up with as many Jaffa and Tok'ra ship as we can muster and destroy that thing by whatever mean necessary set a course yes Sir wait a minute we can not go yet we do not have any more time Doctor by all indication that space Gate 's operational there be no telling when the Ori be go to start send ship through okay go but leave I behind Colonel I believe the key to defeat the Ori be on that planet I know it Daniel even if you be right the villager never go to let you back in the library then beam I in Alright you get one more chance I will go with Jackson a little quality time and that black knight might show up again we will have the Russians swe by and pick you up on the way through you have until then thank you Sir so what now well all indication be the black knight be activate the second I step onto that platform so my guess be we can shut he down by inputte the correct code sequence on that control panel Merlin 's p I N number yeah something like that so how do we find it by analyze these document you do realize we be on the clock right course be plot Sir very well Colonel Emerson I wish to be transfer to the near Jaffa control vessel can I ask why I intend to seek out some much need ally that be it sorry do not mean to wake you no I be not sleep I be Kel'noreeming teal'c teach I the fundamental do he mention you should remain conscious in the process yeah I be still work on the basic so you get something yeah I 've cros reference half a dozen passage that mention the black knight now there be a series of recur word and phrase that stand out if you know what you be look for be we talk access code I think so what be the matter well if I be wrong about this then Nah look I will take care of the black knight yeah how be you go to do that again I will pull the sword from the stone just like last time well I think we 've be over this this be a completely different scenario you see in the Avalon cave it be pull the sword from the stone that cause the knight to appear in the first place here we do not even know if they be connect we know Merlin put the sword there right probably which mean it be no ordinary sword and that be good enough for I besides do we have a choice no nothing happen be that a good thing or a bad thing Bad Bad you stay I will go make it work okay oh boy everybody down no do not think so Mitchell how be it go out there not so good do something help he he bring this on himself what do you think you be do greeting friend I be Merlin yes you be the prize you seek like the pendulum 's swing mark the passage of all that be before you Mitchell I do it be the black knight go not exactly I do not understand I 've get the treasure activate the hologram greeting try a different code I already try all the combination I come up with Marks the passage of all that be before you Mitchell Mitchell Greetings friend I be Merlin all that be before you greeting friend I be Merlin the prize you seek like the pendulum 's swing mark the passage of all that be before you greeting friend oh screw it like the pendulu look look where do it go he have do it Sir we be receive a transmission from one of the Jaffa ship Put it on screen I be Cha'ra of the free Jaffa it be my ship that discover the Gate I understand there be be no other sign of activity none you should be aware we 've already attempt to destroy the Gate our combined force have no effect so all you have to do be shoot the control crystal pretty much sound like one of my plan how come we do not do that in the first place well because I have to find the access code first if I have not none of this would 've beam in and I would not have see Merlin 's hologram message right what do he say well I think it be a riddle and I believe I figure it out you see this pendant now in every depiction of Merlin from his library I 've see it and in fact in the hologram message he be wear it as well but I 've never see it before not in any reference material back on Earth and you think that be the device we be look for the riddle mention a pendulum now at first I think that be a reference to a passage of time like a pendulum clock then I realize it be more literal something that hang it also say it be right before my eye I do not know do not that seem a little small just remember we be talk about thing that transcend ordinary space time here relative size have no meaning Fine let us start look Sir another ship just drop out of hyperspace it be an Asgard vessel open a channel this be Colonel Emerson of the Earth vessel Odyssey yes I know who you be hello Kvasir Colonel Carter there be much work to be do where be the rest of your team Daniel and colonel Mitchell be still look for the ancient device I be tell you about in our communiqué and Teal'c well we be not exactly sure where Teal'c be fly into our territory in an unmarked cargo ship I do not think you be that stupid I have allow myself to be capture know that I would be bring before you really I have come to seek the assistance of the Lucian Alliance I take it back you be not stupid you be insane kill he I should kill you where you stand but as I have say I have come seek your assistance the fate of the galaxy be at stake we have be analyze the information that Daniel Jackson be able to retrieve from Merlin 's phase shift device unfortunately he do not get very far before it permanently run out of power there be enough datum for we to summise what this so call anti Ori weapon might be really I be not able to make head or tail of it really just tell I what you 've get it be an energy transfer device similar to a Zero Point Module except that the energy be channel not from subspace into ordinary space time but rather into the dimension occupy by ascended being and this energy be harmful to they in some way it be a form of interference a simple analogy would be two stand wave cancel each other out if the weapon indeed work the way Merlin 's writing imply we would simply need to activate it and send it to the Ori galaxy and they would be eliminate yeah but how do we do that I mean we do not even know where the Ori galaxy be let alone have the ability to send something there that be where you be mistaken you be talk about the Supergate we dial out before they can dial in precisely that might actually work of course we will need Merlin 's weapon if colonel Mitchell and Dr Jackson do not find it do not worry they will find it what do you mean it be not here well we 've be through this stuff twice it be not here it be get to be here look I once lose my car key in my apartment for three day Colonel Mitchell hi Come on in do not be afraid the black knight be not come back it be incredible yeah it be all your you do not wish to claim a prize for defeat Merlin 's champion well there be one thing we be look for but we can not find it actually maybe you can help we do you recognize this it be the Sangreal this be the Sangreal it be also know as the bloodstone of course sing blood blood red for the color of the jewel wait a minute we be talk about the Holy Grail right every movie I 've see that be a cup no the notion that the Grail be a cup or chalice particularly the one use by Christ at the last Supper be a a late addition to the myth in early account it be describe variously as a dish or platter or in the case of Von Eschenbach and other middle eastern influence chronicler as a stone that fall from the heaven if this be what you seek you will not find it among these trinket Arthur and his knight leave to quest to the Sangreal long ago do you know where they go of course it be say that they journey to three distant land mention in Merlin 's prophecy Castiana Sahal and Vagonbrei any of those spot ring a bell no but if they be part of one of Merlin 's prophecy then any one of those book could hold the key to what we be look for the book upstairs Jackson that be day week to find the proper reference and then there be no guarantee that we be go to be able to track'em down search for Arthur 's whereabouts in this library be not necessary now thank to Valencia we 've be give a sign that Arthur will return soon and you be welcome to stay with we and wait as the man that conquer Merlin 's curse you will be give a place of honor look once and for all there be no curse okay this this be a device it be a machine it be like a flour mill or a catapult it be just a lot more complicated there be no magic boy my timing be off today Colonel Mitchell Dr Jackson welcome aboard the Korolev there it be Colonel Carter Sir we 've manage to locate the dialing control crystal on one particular section of the Gate now Kvasir 's already program a replacement crystal so it be just a matter of somebody get out there and instal it and I suppose you would like to volunteer yes Sir I would go but you do not have a space suit that would fit I no one be go we just get word from the Korolev Mitchell and Jackson do not find the device Sir even without Merlin 's device dialing out be still our good bet because in the very least it will prevent they from dialing in well it be possible that with the power generate by the singularity we can maintain this connection indefinitely the coordinate be set be you ready Colonel Carter Ready as I will ever be initiate transport engage magnetic lock I be remove the panel now I be put in our control crystal it will just take a few minute to initialize Sir we be pick up increase energy output come from the Gate Something 's happen I 've lose my magnetic lock it be an incoming wormhole get she out of there now it be not work there be too much interference Sam report Sam oh my god can you pick up colonel Carter 's signal Negative she be too close to the event horizon Sir the Korolev just drop out of hyperspace this be colonel Chekov what be the situation we 've get an incoming wormhole I would suggest you prepare for battle here they come I only count four ship it be probably their first wave we should see what we can do about discourage a second one Sir we be receive a message from one of the Ori ship text only what do it say and those who be prideful and refuse to bow down shall be lay low and make unto dust be that all it say yeah that be it open a channel then do Tyolus say to the people of the low plain seek not wickedness amongst your neighbor lest it find purchase in your own house what be that Book of Origin think it will help they be power up their weapon here we go all battery open fire Shields down to 50 Sir we just lose sublight engine redirect power to the engine begin evasive maneuver we 've lose power we have to scramble the 302 no they will have no effect against that hey we be get our ass kick it be time to go all in I will draw their fire while you get the ship back online it be no good Sir we be dead in the water Sir pick up approach ship Apologies for my late arrival well late than never indeed forget the engine give them everything we get NARRA TOR previously on Stargate SG 1 in the name of the god ship shall be build to carry our warrior out amongst the star Everything Origins follower devote themselves to be a lie whose baby be it I do not know PRIOR the child be the will of the Ori VALA the ship be plan to leave Somewhere out there the Ori have a work supergate CARTER we 've manage to locate the dialing control crystal on one particular section of the gate we dial out before they can dial in Something 's happen oh my God I do not think you be that stupid I have come to seek the assistance of the Lucian Alliance all battery open fire VALA grunt almost now keep push I be push you grunt baby crying be it all right she be beautiful she she wait where be you go I want to see speak alien language no I I can I hold she she be my baby after all I 've just be through I want to hold she she belong to all who follow the path speak alien language what be it Tomin from one all will learn she be Orici PRIOR such be her purpose in this vast expanse that be shelter by evil and lead astray she will be the beacon of light in the darkness to the warrior of the Ori and to all who follow the true path to salvation with the wisdom of the age she will lead we to glorious victory over any and all unbeliever this be Lieutenant Colonel Carter come in please can anyone hear I please respond if anyone can hear I this be Lieutenant Colonel Carter please respond ON RADIO this be Lieutenant Colonel Carter I be in a space suit drift free approximately 2 000 foot off the front right position on the supergate Sam RADIO STATIC Sam it be I Mitchell can you hear I I can not tell you how good it be to hear your voice yeah you too I see the Korolev explode MEN shouting scream I must have lose consciousness Daniel still on board I think what happen to the Ori ship they leave here approximately four and a half hour ago this be Colonel Emerson aboard the Odyssey Colonel Mitchell be that you yes sir thank God this be Carter be you in range to beam I back aboard I be afraid that we have not get beam capability at this time Kvasir 's work on it where be you I be sorry we be out of touch there for a while we lose all communication in the battle we get our sublight back online and then track the Ori safely from a distance use our long range sensor till they jump into hyperspace about an hour ago we be still just get back our basic operating system look I hate to be self center here especially give what be just happen but I 've only get a couple of hour of life support leave here EMERSON I be aware of your situation Colonel I will keep you apprise request permission to come on board sir Permission grant leave docking bay be out of commission Colonel get it receive hail on screen Colonel Emerson teal'c it be good to see you be okay Colonel Emerson teal'c it be good to see you be okay you as well this vessel have sustain substantial damage it have take some time to get primary system back online we 've be receive several distress beacon from damage ship we 've be able to ring aboard a few survivor but our life support be already over tax any chance you can take on a few people I will take that as a no how be the shield and hyperdrive come we have 20 power to shield Kvasir 's concentrating on the Asgard beam technology Hyperdrive be still offline how about some good news anything Colonel Mitchell have land safely thank you keep a channel open to that mothership try to reach Teal'c take he to a cell EMERSON why would the first wave just leave we behind they have to know there be survivor they need witness their goal be not to kill we all it be to convert we their wish be to go forth and tell everybody about how they kick our ass that they do How be Kvasir come with that Asgard beam Kvasir this be Emerson please report due to the damage I be rewrite the control code from the beginning and it would be go much fast be I not constantly interrupt he be work as fast as he can any of the Korolev crew beam over before the ship be lose a half dozen not Dr Jackson we locate the data recorder and we be work on retrieve it Word from Teal'c Briefly but then we lose the signal he seem to be in a bit of a scuffle over control of the ship marks ON RADIO Colonel Emerson to the bridge what be it Major we 've re establish contact with the Lucian Alliance mothership sir they be ask to speak with you I be on my way be earth aware of our situation our only long range array that be not fry be sensor Subspace communication be beyond repair still they 've get to know something 's wrong we 've miss two schedule check in so there be no help no unfortunately there be nothing they can do the Korolev and the Odyssey be our only two ship in the galaxy how long can we go on current life support a day maybe less that be only if we do not take on more survivor Great yeah MARKS Channel be open sir this be Colonel Emerson of the Earth ship Odyssey I be Netan leader of the Lucian Alliance you will surrender your ship to our control immediately do you want I to take this one sir go ahead hey there Lieutenant Colonel Cameron Mitchell here look we be all in this fight together be not we this be not how ally be suppose to treat each other grant we get our butts kick but we still need each other if we be go to survive our sensor detect your shield at minimum if you do not capitulate immediately we will open fire you would be destroy the only other ship out here with life support capability you drag we into this battle know it would deplete our force I suspect intentionally that be not true we all lose badly why do not you tell we your situation maybe we can work something out the situation be you will surrender or be destroy whisper what sort of ordnance do we have on board not much and he be right about our shield we be sit duck DOOR OPENS how be you feel look they can not keep she from I no matter who or what she be I be her mother she need to be feed and care for she be be well care for do not she I should be allow to see she I speak with the Prior and they 've agree to let you see she hello Mother Odyssey this be Carter I do not know what you can see from your vantage point or what your sensor be pick up but from out here that mothership look pretty badly damage I would be surprised if they be weapon capable thank Sam they have not fire yet take we out of weapon range let us see what they do well I hear that child grow up quickly but this be ridiculous groan well that feel much well thank you you do not believe I do not know what you mean you can not hide your feeling from I it be all right I will help you find the path Hallowed be the Ori Hallowed be the Ori Bra'tac what do you know the battle do not go well we 've lose all contact with both Earth ship we would be lucky if either survive Word be four Ori ship come through the chappa'ko Supergate they lie waste to all that stand in their path and then move on we need to get at least one ship out to the scene of that battle find out exactly what happen and if there be anybody leave who need help agree Walter dial it up how be it go we be just about to test it what be that it be suppose to be a sandwich Sam I be sorry we be not quite ready yet hate to rush you can you fix it in time I be unsure of where the instability be occur simple answer I will have to go through the program code again line by line that be a no it be time for Plan B if you be think what I think you be think it will not work mark do you mind Hang on Sam we be come to get you oh boy this be your fault I have already tell you all I know of the Ori our only hope of defeat their follower be to unite our force and work together you have nothing to gain by torture I that be where you be wrong I be very very angry right now and cause you a great deal of pain will make I feel well teal'c screams look the sublight engine do not have that much control if you hit I even at minimum velocity I be not go to hit you not on purpose even if you get I in past the shield the artificial gravity will kick in a fall from even 30 foot in this suit Sam stop worry Kvasir be ride the control manually you be go too fast this tub do not go any slow initialize 5 reverse thrust get she initialize 20 reverse thrust Kvasir take she down lightly DOOR ALARM BLARES MAN ON RADIO we have her sir she be okay nice fly yeah some day you get lucky thank you you be welcome yeah I be go to say no sweat but there be definitely sweat involve in Kvasir 's case I think it be perspiration any news on Teal'c no but we have something else we download the black box datum from the Korolev MITCHELL we know that six people get off use beam technology before it go up none of they be Jackson however the ring be also activate you betcha Sir sensor be indicate a slight energy fluctuation in their shield coincide with their own weapon fire Beam a nuke on board Odyssey be report no success with the attempt to beam weapon on board enemy ship what about ring I know they use they the matter stream might get through how can we lock on just set our ring to seek out the near other set it be worth a shot move close I be on it I want that warhead transport to the ring room now take we close to the near enemy ship set it to go off five second after activation you do not know where the enemy ship be or what they be capable of all we know be they cut through two of our 304 an Asgard ship and a fleet of Goa'uld motherships they could be on their way here as we speak we send the good we have to stop they the i o A be consider bring the Atlantis ZPM to Earth for use in the Antarctic Earth defense system even if we have a ship it would take a minimum of three week for the ZPM to get here and there be no guarantee the ancient weapon platform in Antarctica would be any more effective against the Ori ship than what we 've already throw at they as usual the i o A be waste their breath you know if I have the salary they pay those idiot blowhard politician to put into my budget I be sorry do I say that out loud SIGHS ORICl Hello Mother you need not be afraid be you actually go to stop grow at some point because well at this rate you be go to have a very short life I be glad you worry for I be you feel well I be thank you I be very hungry would you like something to eat okay you have question do you have a name they call I Orici yeah it be not much of a name be it what would you like to call I well I always think that if I have a daughter that I would name she after my mother she be a very strong woman her name be Adria I like that Adria you think that by name I you will humanize I make I more like you more sympathetic to your point of view how do you know what you know the Ori wove their knowledge into my genetic makeup at least as much as my human brain could hold all their knowledge be far too much for we to possibly comprehend the understanding of an infinite universe be obviously without boundary then you be not actually one of they I be the close I can be in the form of flesh and blood be not there a part of you that be from I of course you be my mother exactly and as your mother you will listen to I young lady there will be no lead of these ship and army on a mass murder crusade or else SIGHS it be worth a try I know why you believe what you do I know why you believe what you do but the ancient be the one who have lie to you they be the one who long ago try to destroy the Ori for their belief not the other way around only the Ori share all they learn the Ancients have keep the basic truth of your existence from you they have hoard their knowledge and be dishonest about everything contrary to what they 've tell you the Ori most certainly do ascend their follower and the ancient be the one sap energy from human in this galaxy to empower themselves that be why they create you to give they the strength to destroy the Ori once and for all that be why all those who could not be make to see the true path must be destroy or all will be lose to evil be you say this be a preemptive strike it be self defense it matter not what you call it the cause be just and the truth will see we through to victory do you really believe that or be you just hope I will why do not you believe I Mother I do not know you choose to take the word of an Ancient over your daughter what have the Ancients do to earn your trust about as much as you in the end only you can decide the fate of your own soul two mothership just drop out of hyperspace Come about let us face they head on the Lucian Alliance ship be hail we again lower your shield and prepare to be board or you will be destroy I assure you Captain I be quite capable of follow through this time shield at 30 they will not stand up to much Sam we 've get company how be that hyperdrive come not well Kvasir 's still work on the beam technology sensor indicate the mothership be power weapon long story be you alone yes what happen to you what do you mean oh I have a baby you know I never think I would agree with my father but now I be start to remember about how he use to go on about you nurture they and then you raise they and you teach they the good that you can and then all they do be break your heart I always assume that his experience be just taint by I what be you talk about well she start off all sweet and innocent to begin with and now she be hell bent on domination of the galaxy what how old be she a few hour the Ori use I to sneak one of their own over the border this child be their way of cheat the ascend rulebook well they could not exactly encroach on our galaxy themselves without get into a confrontation with the Ancients right so they create their own human representative with their knowledge to lead their army sort of an uber Prior like the Doci oh but she be much bad than that the Priors be just pawn she know the score she be complicit with the Ori you should have hear the propaganda that she just try to feed I wait wait wait we be talk about a baby here right oh she be be genetically alter she will be a fully grow figurehead in a day or so if she take after her mother she will have a pretty good figure too this be bad you be tell I Origin be about to become a lot more appealing to the male of this galaxy do you have any idea where we be go no that she would not tell I she know I be not on her side she be still hope I will see the light part of she can not help but feel tie to I she want I to give she a name and Adria I tell she it be my mother 's not Stepmother Witch of a woman the more I get to know you the more I be start to understand Huh nothing do you know what be strange Daniel no she have the knowledge of ascended being twist though it may be but I sense that there be a part of she that be just like any other kid that want her mother 's approval so I be hope I can use that somehow I mean why else would she care what I think right now we be a little more concerned about get off this ship there be only so long I can hide hide yeah hide coughs cough hi what hi long day ah I be exhaust I see you be up and around grunt much well three more ship just emerge from hyperspace they be flank we receive hail on screen greeting Bra'tac greeting back at you head up the Lucian Alliance be get ready to open fire on we I have already demand that they stand down or face we in battle they be fire weapon what the hell be they do Carter now or never I have a lock Bridge we have teal'c be you okay I have be well medical team to Auxiliary Control Room 2 I guess we 've all have enough fighting for one day they just do not want we to be able to salvage the ship when they turn tail and run after everything you 've be through after everything you 've see how can you still not believe in the Ori you think I do not the Orici be a truthseer she be a child little girl always have issue with their mother be you say you do believe in the Ori why be you here with I if you doubt my devotion because I love you because I be still hope I can save your soul what where be you go I be call to duty and here I be hope I could save he SIGHS I be glad to see you alive it be good to be alive old friend we just get some bad news the Ori ship have be locate moment ago they emerge from hyperspace over Chulak why Chulak perhaps because it be where the Jaffa rebellion against the Goa'uld begin no matter we must not abandon they well as soon as we get our hyperdrive back we have to head to Earth for repair Someone 's get to stick around keep an eye on that supergate we may not be able to stop the Ori ship from come through but we should at least know if they do we will leave a small contingent in a cloak scout ship behind can you expect backup it be unlikely the remain Jaffa fleet defend Dakara you 've only get three mothership we have a lot more than that here and we could not stop they we can not merely stand by while our brother and sister fall Sam I be go with they I too it be suicide well for Teal'c and Bra'tac that be not really an argument against go EMERSON what about you however remote there be still a chance that Daniel 's alive on board one of those Ori ship he may need our help you really believe that you do not know he like we do good luck look like a ground incursion be about to begin we be on Chulak with most of the warrior out there fight Jaffa we might be able to get off this ship undetecte we have an opportunity here yes I be think that but we do not know what power that child might have she be the key to the whole invasion if we could somehow capture her take she with we turn she against the Ori then she would become the most powerful weapon we could have against they that be a big if what have you get nothing worth a try then you be go to need a well disguise I know where the armory be they have stun weapon like Zat gun I will distract she while you sneak up and stun her it be kind of a skeleton crew on board how many more Jaffa do you have on the other ship not many get the council to relinquish three ha'tak be difficult enough the crew I have to assemble personally so we be outmatch in manpower firepower and technology do we have any sort of battle strategy or be we just plan on drop out of hyperspace and get our ass kick again hey I be all about noble death pointless noble death on the other hand the Korolev log indicate that they be attempt to use the ring to get a nuke through a fluctuation in the Ori ship 's shield that be coincide with the firing of their main weapon Great so we will use the other two ship to draw their fire while we sneak around the backside and jam a big old nuke up their tailpipe but we do not have any nuke you have any fancy Jaffa bomb we have explosive that should be effective all right as soon as we drop out of hyperspace I will start broadcast on all radio channel if Daniel 's still alive hopefully he will get the message that we be here and he can ring aboard there you go now we get a plan you know if she be anything like the Priors she may have power like they that be why I will go in first try and get she back turn toward the door so she do not see you come now you 've learn that the Priors need to be focus in order for their power to work so when you hear the catchphrase come in fire and anyone else in the room should not be a problem now you be sure this thing just stun the staff thing kill that be less potent but if you shoot that at someone several time it will probably kill Adria it be I Come in Mother be you all right why be you sit here alone in the dark nervous CHUCKLING the knowledge in my mind be grow as I be it be a lot to take in it make my head ache I can imagine actually no I can not but I be sure it be rough it be chase they move into flanking position what be you do look out on Chulak be you interested in the planet you be conquer have you be here before once what do you know of the Jaffa they be proud people confuse about the way to salvation they have be mislead by parasite pose as god for many generation but in their heart I believe they know ascension be the true goal of our existence then why be you slaughter they this be Lieutenant Colonel Samantha Carter call any survivor of the Earth ship Korolev please come in ON RADIO repeat this be Lieutenant Colonel Samantha Carter call any survivor of the Earth ship Korolev please come in Sam it be I Daniel Daniel I know you make it yeah it be good to hear you too listen I be kind of in the middle of something right now we be in orbit try to blow up one of the Ori ship yeah I be on one of the ship that be land on the planet yeah I be on one of the ship that be land on the planet I be go to have to tell you the rest later request radio silence I be detect the fluctuation in their shield almost in range the good news be I just make contact with Daniel we be right he be alive and on board the Ori ship that be land on the planet Hallelujah what be the bad news we just lose one of our mothership if our plan do not work this will be a very short battle we be in range carter now they be fire send it it should have go off by now they must embrace their destiny well then hallowed be the Ori please Mother it be blasphemous for an unbeliever to speak those word no really you be start to make sense to I now I be really come around Hallowed be the Ori we just lose another mothership let us get Jackson on board and get the hell out of here I be sorry Colonel Mitchell that be not the plan bra'tac what be you do I believe he intend to ram the enemy vessel yeah I get that but that will kill we I think he know that indeed teal'c this be crazy not the good kind of crazy you know that what would you have I do Colonel Mitchell talk to he chance be we will just impact the shield we will not do any damage to they what do you think you be make some kind of a statement hey I know this be your ship and we do not have to come along and maybe it be well to die in battle I do not know I be never really hope to find out but I do know one thing there be no point in die when you be go to lose anyway not when you have a choice they be conspire against you yes I know kill he no wait we want to talk to you move I say kill he No Mother GASPING you could not have wait until she would finish heal I well she be distract leave I grab she oh yeah like that be go to happen Colonel Mitchell Colonel Carter this be Emerson come in what be your status Beam we on board Enemy ship have detect our presence move into range you should have four beacon transmit I plant one on you early just in case do it no we be lucky the ship on the planet have lower its shield you should have grab for Adria not I no I be think I should have shoot she when I have the chance Daniel you could not have kill a child she be not a child she be an Ori in the body of a human be not that cheat well Orlin break the rule by take human form and tell we the truth about the Ori yeah and he pay for that no offense but I think this kid 's go to be a big problem she will be fully grow within a matter of day see cheat yeah I get to admit the ascend rulebook be get a little hard to understand you know I do not think there really be one there usually never be rule in a war unfortunately right now there be no war in a war you 've get two side fight all we have be a lot of win by the bad guy they have troop and ship in our territory and a supergate to bring in more anytime they need they I remember when we first open the gate the Goa'uld have total domination over the galaxy they have massive technological superiority over we a lot of people do not think we have a chance I be not say we should give up I will fight to my die breath I just think we need a new plan a damn good one NARRA TOR previously on Stargate SG 1 baby crying wait where be you go I want to see she be Orici with the wisdom of the age she will lead we to glorious victory Merlin be conduct research on some kind of new invention a weapon capable of destroy ascended being MEURIK Arthur and his knight leave to quest for the Sangraal long ago it be say that they journey to three distant land mention in Merlin 's prophecy Castiana Sahal and Vagonbrei GATE ACTIVATION ALARM BLARES six more world have fall to the Ori two be Jaffa stronghold they attempt to resist but be overwhelmed within a matter of hour accord to those who witness the battle the enemy be lead by a young woman of extraordinary power six planet in eight day and they do not even have their full team in the field yet why have not they make a move against Earth in all probability the ancient device in Antarctica be give they pause at least until the rest of their battle fleet get here I get it I get it I make the connection Sir Gawain to Gwalchmei Culhwch and Olwen Verus Gen Bree and you say I be hard to understand STAMMERS oh it be Vagonbrei one of the planet Arthur and his knight go to in their quest for the Holy Grail I get the gate address while on PX1767 we get the name of three planet Castiana Sahal and Vagonbrei three possible destination for Arthur and his knight in their quest for the Holy Grail what we know to be Merlin 's weapon unfortunately what we do not get be any corresponding gate address and the process of go through that library page by page look for clue could have potentially take year so I know we be go to have to narrow the search parameter a little that be when it hit I Sir Gawain be not he one of the knight who say Ni he be a knight of the Round Table and in one his early incarnation an old Welsh tale he go on a quest to help rescue a lose love the legend say that Sir Gawain a k a Gwalchmei visit several land over the course of his adventure include a place call Gwlad Gan Brenhinol Gwir which be Welsh for the land of royal truth translate that into Ancient and you get Verus Gen Bree Vagonbrei so how do that get we a gate address it do not but it do give I something very specific to look for in Merlin 's library namely reference to Gawain now base on this information I start scan through the title and I find this now the entire volume be dedicate to Gawain 's adventure and include several very interesting illustration include a depiction of a sword he once carry note the symbol engrave on the blade a gate address Vagonbrei well we will not know till we check it out well do Doctor Colonel Carter what be the status of the Ori supergate any attempt we 've make to dial out to the Ori galaxy have fail it look like they be block we from their end there be a mothership in the area that will alert we to the arrival of any other ship More ship we can hardly deal with the one that be already here you have a go find that weapon yes sir will do I be talk to SG 1 you be not go anywhere KNOCKING ON DOOR General I be hope you might reconsider your decision and allow Vala to come with we give everything she be put you through you be the last person I would have expect to ask I that yes sir and I be hope that impress on you just how strongly I feel about this look I know she be no angel she be lie she be steal she be cheat she be misrepresent herself she be lie but she also risk her life to warn we that the Ori be on their way and almost sacrifice herself to shut down the very first Ori supergate I understand the contribution she be make the truth be the Pentagon be not willing to roll the dice on her but you could convince they otherwise you see 10 year ago General Hammond sit in that very chair and he be face with a similar decision as former first Prime to Apophis Teal'c have commit some terrible crime as the former First Prime to Apophis teal'c provide valuable insight to the enemy 's resource and tactic and as the mother to the leader of the Ori army Vala may hold the key to stop they if I push this issue and the Pentagon agree to let she join you on off world mission then I would be the one ultimately hold accountable for her action yes sir I understand sir so I would be count on you to keep she in line yes sir so can I go on the mission no you be not clear for off world travel yet you still have to go through a psych evaluation what be that it be sort of an interview give to all prospective SGC personnel design to assess a person 's psychological state get a sense of their mental well be oh to find out if I be make strange sound wonko right so they be go to sit you down in a little room get you talk about yourself and ask you a few question so it be a test sort of and all I have to do be pass how hard can that be I be go to have to do some research so I be go to use your computer while you be away on this mission you know what I would prefer if you do not there be a lot of sensitive material in there Great be careful time to go I say no and you can not access it without my password already get it thank I but the MITCHELL this place be deader than a Texas salad bar hello hello it be obvious this village have long since be abandon General what bring you by just think I would see how you be get along what be you do just a little research for my upcoming mental appraisal you can not cram for a psychiatric evaluation that be what they want you to think it be a battle of wit my mind against theirs they will try and confuse I with their trick question but I already have the correct answer there be no correct answer for instance when they ask I what do you consider your big flaw no they will not ask that question my answer will be that I feel I be too much of a perfectionist you see I put a positive spin on a negative yes that be very transparent question two you be in the desert you see a tortoise lie on his back in the hot sun you recognize his plight but do nothing to help why why because you be also a tortoise guy you should take a look at this whoa I think I like to sleep in CARTER Dr Reimer REIMER Colonel Carter Colonel Mitchell I understand you 've get a bit of a medical mystery on your hand MITCHELL what we have here be a village full of skeleton CARTER we find a few lie on the ground but most seem to have die in their bed I think we can rule out violence anything leave besides bone sorry Doc whatever happen here happen a long time ago REIMER let us go take a look do the village record give an indication as to what befall these people no but it do make mention of some ancient lore tie to the area accord to legend a cave overlook the village be once home to Morgan Le Fay EX CLAIMS in arthurian myth Morgan be a powerful sorceress King Arthur 's half sister and an adversary of Merlin that would suggest she may have have a hand in the disappearance of the weapon we seek now Morgan like Merlin be a purport magic user so it make sense that again like Merlin she be once ascend One who foresaw the danger present to she and her kind by a weapon capable of destroy ascended being so she take the weapon from Merlin and go into hiding on three possible world this be one we 've get to find that cave why do I have to tag along on this little hike you get somewhere else you need to be yeah how about at home in bed I got pull off inoculation duty on 865 to come here and pull a double shift I 've be up 18 hour straight what be it bird what bird my point exactly I first notice it in the village now here in the forest as well an unusual stillness there be no bird or any other animal life for that matter all right so what happen to they Vala I be Dr Hutchison have a seat so how be you feel very well very well well you know all thing consider I mean you would assume I would be a prime candidate for acculturation difficulty endure feeling of displacement and alienation perhaps even a little paranoid ideation but the truth be I be able to adopt an abstract attitude which allow I to release some of my repressed feeling ultimately provide I with a cathartic actualization how be you feel I be fine there be nothing here maybe it be the wrong cavern we should continue search the area carter it be get dark out Daniel we should head back to the village Ackerman Yo Ackerman Wake up what happen we be do Sorry Jackson be you familiar with inkblot test okay I be go to show you a series of image and I just want you to say the first thing that come to your mind okay Courage respect you look at this inkblot and the first thing that pop into your head be respect yes respect okay Vala this be call a projective test it be design to allow I a little insight into your emotional state I just want to get to know you well not pass judgment on you I want to help but to do that I be go to need you to be completely honest and spontaneous with your answer do you understand of course okay I be sorry Kindness Red team 's wrap it up Figured we would do the same this can not be a dead end there have to be something here take it up with Landry you can come back tomorrow knock yourself out strain your eye all you want you be right I could probably get a fresh start in the morning all right let us go home GRIMSBY Hang on a minute where 's Ackerman Ackerman come on Bernie Ackerman let us go Yo Ackerman Wake up come on MITCHELL he be asleep what the hell kind of diagnosis be that Dr Reimer say he will not know more until he be complete all the blood work there be get to be something more to it like a coma REIMER no I be afraid not Coma patient do not respond to outside stimuli Pain sound touch Ackerman respond to all three he even flinch react in his sleep state why can not we wake he up I do not know I need to do more test before I can say anything for sure and we have to contact Stargate Command and have they send out the necessary equipment I be sorry be that not something you would be well off do back at the base ideally yes but unfortunately and just like Ackerman here all of our blood work show an elevated white cell count and a mark increase in serotonin level whatever it be we 've all be infect you think this be the same thing that kill the villager Let us just say for the time be I recommend we all try and stay awake for as long as possible if we fall asleep we may never wake up we be send the medical supply through now Colonel MITCHELL Roger that sir sure you do not want a little more help I can send another team in Hazmat until we know what we be deal with sir that would just be risk more life we can handle it Understood I be awake I be awake compliment of Dr Lam we have dextroampheta something moto whatchamacallit caffeine pill and good old fashioned coffee go easy there Grimsby how long have you be awake for I do not know what 24 hour yeah talk to I when you get to 40 you 've pull all nighter before right yeah load of they this feel bad do not it yeah I think it be only I I too be more fatigued than I would have expect it have to be the infection it do not just keep you from wake up it make you want to sleep in the first place well in that case teal'c I prefer to rely on my tretonin Cheers Reimer what you get since we start monitor he Ackerman have be in stage 4 level what they call delta sleep or slow wave sleep we also note that his brain be produce a surprising amount of melatonin it be a hormone synthesize from serotonin a sleep induce agent that be what be keep he asleep so all you 've get to do be figure out why his brain be produce the melatonin we be work on it Jackson what do you find in the town record a handwritten entry from the village doctor in which he mention a sleeping sickness that affect the town now he do not go into any great detail but it do make mention of a possible source for what be happen Morgan Le Fay see it seem the villager believe she curse they for reveal her whereabouts when King Arthur and his knight came look for her so do Arthur find she here JACKSON probably not if the villager believe she curse they then it be more than likely she escape in any case we have to go back to that cave General just wonder if they 've reach a decision on my mental well be yet Dr Hutchison be not finish with you yet you be to meet with he again later today SIGHS if I may speak candidly General I have a feeling that Dr Hutchison be somewhat troubled in fact I think he may be suffer from Klinefelter syndrome though you do not hear it from I the only thing Dr Hutchison be suffer from be the headache you give he I suggest you stop play game and start take this evaluation very seriously I think I be let us call that delusional memory DOOR CLOSES MITCHELL you know it be Jackson 's idea to come back here and check this cave out again I can not help notice he be the only one who do not make the trip teal'c Daniel Jackson make it clear that his time would be well spend continue his research of the town record carter here Dr Reimer want we to take some soil sample why just in case this be where Ackerman pick up the infection beep Hmm KNOCKING ON DOOR hello hello may I have a moment of your time oh I be sorry I be just on my way out I 've get a meeting with Dr Hutchison I know that be why I be here I promise to be quick my name be Richard Woolsey I work for the International Oversight Advisory a civilian run organization make up of representative from the various nation involve in the Stargate Program and what can I do for you Mr Woolsey why do not I tell you what we can do for you we can see to it that you pass your psychiatric evaluation with fly color effectively put any doubt Stargate Command may have about you to rest and what would you want in return just a little insight into the weekly going on here at Stargate Command you see despite the fact that all signatory to the Gate Alliance Treaty be de facto partner in the Stargate Program my employer be often leave out of the loop when it come to the more sensitive development here on the base we would just like you to keep we update be all so you want I to be a spy CHUCKLING I 've read your file Ms Mal Doran I do not think what we be ask be that unusual for someone with such a colorful history DOOR close BEEPING Cam teal'c I think I find something what you get well it be a faint energy spike I almost go past without notice it Shazam I guess Daniel be right after all MITCHELL yes he be we should check this out would it not be prudent for one of we to return these sample to Dr Reimer as quickly as possible no he be right we be on the clock and we have no idea how deep this hole be all right I will go back stay in radio contact at least as long as you can do you really think these will hold I oh those be not restraint we be hook you up to a polygraph it be also know as a lie detector it measure certain variable like blood pressure and heart rate to determine whether you be be truthful or not oh I see all right let us get start then shall we and what be your name Vala Mal Doran where do you spend the last week on Earth here at Stargate Command have you ever steal anything no that depend on how you define steal these be control question design to gauge your reaction by elicit both truthful and deceptive answer from you you be do fine just try to relax EXHALES you be look very nice today oh thank you you be look rather dash yourself oh thank I mean nice stammer I mean not objectionable Colonel come take a look at this this be in that soil sample you bring back from the cave what be it I believe it be a parasite be it dead no it be dormant Ackerman may have somehow awaken one well how it do not seem to respond to movement excuse I let us see what happen when they come in contact with live tissue whoa I will lay odd that be your culprit right there these people would have have no understanding of microbiology they probably come up with the story of Morgan 's curse because they could not comprehend what be happen to they carter hey where be Grimsby he say he be on his way back he be not here oh no perhaps we should rest no that be a bad idea and I be start to regret stay up late to watch Deuce Bigelow European Gigolo last night check that I regret it almost immediately FAINT rustling be I imagine thing or I hear it as well Grimsby Sam JACKSON well we find Grimsby he be asleep and we can not wake he Dr Reimer what be wrong have his condition change well you could say that he be dead REIMER I see evidence of a ruptured aneurysm near the pineal gland there be something else in here REIMER what the hell morphology be identical to the parasite we find in the soil sample only it be grow 1 000 time big I be assume thing do not go well I fail to see the point of that ridiculous exercise unless its purpose be to thoroughly humiliate I those question be not intend to shed light on my character or delve deeply into my subconscious they be merely little reminder as to exactly why I do not belong here then I take it you 've carefully consider our offer and come to a decision I have Whoa EX CLAIMS MITCHELL okay question if what take out the village be what kill all the wildlife around here how come that little sucker 's alive and kick it may possess a natural immunity to this mysterious affliction yeah that be exactly my point so all we get to do be catch Joe Bob there take he back up to Carter and Reemer Reimer whatever they reverse engineer an antidote and Bob be your uncle we sleep till Tuesday teal'c indeed yeah Carter it be Mitchell RADIO STATIC we have progress too far within the cave system yes we have all right well we will nab Junior first then we will call Carter when we get back up to the surface Progress we 've be theorize that when the parasite enter the bloodstream it trigger the body 's immune response and the production of serotonin then it make its way to the patient 's brain where it lodge and feed feed on what Melatonin our analysis show the parasite we remove from Ackerman gorge itself on the stuff carter it stimulate the production of melatonin which flood the body that be why the urge to sleep be so powerful that be why the urge to sleep be so powerful and once you give in the parasite just keep on feed until the engorge parasite affect the surround cranial tissue eventually provoke a lethal aneurysm but we be think that it may be possible to starve out the parasite so to that end we have isolate a speciman that we awaken from a dormant state groan Dr Reimer Dr Reimer it be his heart Sam he be dead oh I be sorry ah Vala oh not you again you know you have another schedule appointment what would be the point of that you people have already make up your mind about I be that what you think well it be not like I have not encounter this sort of thing before you know I see it every day in the eye of the people who could not separate I from the Goa'uld who enslave they so you know instead of become a victim of their arrogance and stupidity I choose to take advantage of it so I lie I cheat and I steal I be not go to apologize for it and to be perfectly honest with you I can not guarantee that I will not do it again all right of course I have recently find myself risk my life for something other than my own personal benefit maybe it be just a phase hold it please or maybe it be because for the first time I 've actually meet someone who in some small way actually believe in I but I be sure you be right I be sure it will pass what carter Daniel you can not fall asleep do you hear I yeah we can not take any more of these either with our serotonin and melatonin level spike it be too dangerous we be go to have to rely on each other all right okay easy there Easy do not worry I be not go to hurt you grunt I 've get it Colonel Mitchell on your foot Colonel Mitchell there be much ground to cover if we be to reach the surface no you you go ahead without I I be just go to I be just go to stay here I be cook then I will carry you if I must forget it no Tretonin or not it be go to catch up with you at some point the important thing for you be to take Kermit back to Carter and what be his name and get they start on the cure indeed I will return for you Colonel Mitchell and I will be right here wait on you Sam Sam I can not do it anymore you have to you got to hang in there just a little while long in here Dr Jackson Colonel Carter where be the rest of your team Reimer and Ackerman be dead Teal'c and Mitchell go to the cave what cave get they in the isolation pod no wait wait no wait we can not go to sleep it be okay we will take care of you no you do not understand the parasite it feed on INAUDIBLE COUGHS take it easy teal'c we 've get you take it easy take it easy teal'c we 've get you take it easy we 've get some sort of animal here we need to take it to the lab yeah I be getting work up cuss at Teal'c tell he to go on leave I must have be 20 minute before I realize he have go and I be sit there talk to myself JACKSON what about you any hallucination yeah when they put I in the pod I imagine I be be put in a coffin I think I be be bury alive well rise and shine how be you feel Rested and raring to go sir I assume Dr Lam get you up to speed carter yes sir between the sample they collect from Teal'c and the research Dr Reimer and I conduct they be able to produce a serum that effectively isolate the parasite and starve it out I just hate that that cave be a dead end we go through all that for nothing JACKSON I would not say that exactly I do find one reference in that library that might prove to be useful Atlantis you think the location of Merlin 's weapon be hide in their database I think it be worth check out phone RINGING Carter I see we will be right there there seem to be a problem in the gate room sir I never like you and I know you can hear I dial the gate now dial the gate do not make I come in there you stop it what be go on I be leave I be not stay somewhere where I be not welcome and do not even think about make I stay against my will would not dream of it but I figure you would want to stay after go through all the trouble of pass the psychiatric evaluation I pass Dr Hutchison seem to think that you have a lot of potential he do he feel you can make a significant contribution here at Stargate Command and I agree congratulation I be a little overwhelmed but as my first official act I would like to report a rather disagreeable little man that would be I Mr Woolsey 's offer be part of the test we want to make sure we could trust you I know that but be his sexual advance part of the test what that be General I can assure you well I would have even consider play along but some of his request be well a little unusual even for I General I would never General General wait so when do I get one of these SG 1 badge you do not you be not a member of SG 1 you be a probationary member of Stargate Command who will be subject to some very intensive scrutiny for the next few month oh do not screw up and welcome aboard see I still think it be cause for celebration so I say we go out have lunch and I will pay pay with what exactly well Daniel will cover I until I get my share of the loot Loot yeah from all the treasure we be go to bring back from our off world travel what I have to wait until I be off probation before I can start collect VALA Funny he do not look excited trust I like a kid who be up all night on Christmas Eve I think we impose a moratorium on cultural reference I would not understand so excited he be up all night it be only because he be worry sick about the success of the mission get up sunshine Time to see what old Santa brung you Morning what we just come out of hyperspace I be guess you do not want to miss the landing what what time be it EMERSON ON RADIO this be the Captain all hand take station for atmospheric entry why do not you tell I okay he be a little excited MAN ON RADIO Odyssey this be flight you be clear for land Understood Flight we have the beacon CARTER hey you be just in time be you kid I would not miss this for the world the number of time I try to get here only two of those time be my fault it be beautiful ON RADIO Odyssey this be Weir I want to be the first to say welcome to Atlantis thank you Doctor we be get a good look at your fair city even as we approach feel free to take a moment but Stargate Command want you to get start on your mission as soon as you 've off load our supply Weir out what be wrong oh nothing I guess I just wish my first trip to Atlantis be not under such desperate circumstance MITCHELL it be just another mission Jackson one upon which the fate of the entire galaxy hang in the balance and he go on those all the time CARTER Vala 's not wrong if we do not succeed and the Ori manage to get more ship through that supergate well like the lady say let us all just take a moment okay moment 's over let us go save the galaxy carter the Ori supergate have be inactive since they send their first wave but it be be report that the Priors be promise reinforcement for their army which be on their way and should be here soon now we can only assume that that mean more ship and these four be already more than we can handle we have to act now well why do not you try dial out I mean if it be power by a black hole you should be able to keep the thing up and run almost indefinitely I be sure they think of that before they come all this way Rodney carter it be what we be attempt to do when the Ori fleet first come through now the Asgard have since try again but for some reason they can not dial out but you might be able to dial in well that be the problem it be design to dial in from another galaxy like one of the stargate in the Pegasus no no no the diameter of a stargate be not arbitrary there be a specific correlation between the energy require to create a stable wormhole and the size of the gate I know that and it be exponentially proportional to size which mean the energy require to create a connection with a supergate would far exceed that of an ordinary gate it would be like put together a Saint Bernard and a Chihuahua and the problem with that would be well obviously it be a question of oh I see you be mock I be not you what no I be not from Earth I honestly do not get the reference oh oh well they be both dog McKay Colonel Carter please continue if he speak again I will shoot he but to answer your question we be introduce another stargate into the equation Teal'c should have it in position right now if we can make a connection between that gate and one from the Pegasus Galaxy you be go to try and make a jump do not shoot I you know I can not help myself Jump can you do that one of Colonel Carter 's more brilliant planet save idea from a few year back Stargate Command inadvertently dial the gate address of a planet that be on a collision course with a black hole P3W 451 if memory serve the only way to disconnect before Cheyenne Mountain got swallow up be to set off a shape charge right at the event horizon now that energy spike force our outgoing wormhole to jump to another stargate that be relatively close by MITCHELL and if we can do it again we can tie up the Ori supergate indefinitely even if you be able to establish an initial connection we need a nuke we know and a dialing crystal capable of already have one and if you want to keep the connection open for more than 38 minute you will need to find a black hole in the Pegasus Galaxy this be not our first barbecue Dr McKay I be just say the yield calculation can be extremely tricky if not borderline impossible you may need I CHUCKLES Colonel Carter say as much EX CLAIMS we be not go to tell he that John do you think you could spare Rodney from your team Hell you can keep he Nice I get to tell you Sheppard it be a nice place you get here thank we just paint well good luck and listen if McKay give you a hard time just shoot he also he be mortally allergic to citrus really I keep one with I at all time just a comfort to know it be there that be good intel thank yeah STAMMERS that be a good one we be actually we be quite close have you pack your bag oh right right all right be good yeah good luck I wish I be go with you no you do not no I do not this place be Daniel Disneyland wow just find the weapon no pressure yes your desire to access the Atlantis database have seem quite urgent Dr Jackson shall we where be Vala oh this way well Daniel no wonder you 've be obsess about come here this place must be full of so many wonderful souvenir how much of the city have you be able to explore just over half now but we have the city schematic so we have a fairly good idea of what be where still there be entire section of the city and whole system we do not even pretend to understand yeah you could spend a lifetime try I hope to I run that search you ask for I enter every pronunciation of Castiana and Sahal I could come up with and nothing you do not actually expect either of those name to be in there do you no do you get the spelling right well that be the problem with ancient language the pronunciation can change within a handful of generation let alone thousand of year the etymology of an individual word can be lose entirely still we know there be something in the Atlantis library hey do we have to go in there straightaway can we do some sightseeing first maybe later EMERSON ON RADIO this be the Captain Stand by for liftoff you can check my preliminary yield calculation they be on that station over there I be sure they be fine it be the reason you be here McKay right but first I just want to thank you for be there for I recently in a time of great personal need well actually you be not there I be alone in the dark but you know it sure seem like you be be you tell I one of your fantasy no it be a hallucination look I have a concussion I be trap in the back of a sink Jumper and my mind conjure you up as a means of survival it be just what you would do in my situation save my life okay well that be sort of nice yes it be be I naked partially check my calculation McKay we use this room sparingly now it be a bit of a power hog and we can access the database from workstation throughout the city when we need to but for the first time user this be the place hello it be as simple as ask question to the holographic interface for example MAN ON RADIO Dr Weir to Stargate Operations I be sorry I will be right there the interface can walk you through your search until I get back oh I should probably warn you if she seem a little bit patronize the program be design to teach very young child the lantian system thank you hello hello we be look for a couple of planet in the Milky Way Vala what what can it hurt to ask you may enter your query verbally or by enter it manually on the console before you I will speak if that be all right of course but note for future session manual input be require for most system interaction I think I have she in grade five maintain orbit at minimum safe distance and keep sublight engine on standby be that thing cool or what the black hole what you be look at be call the accretion disk it be matter trap in the gravity well you can not actually see the black hole itself which be cool we be in optimal range for release the gate we can commit to the next phase this be Emerson to Flight Operations release the gate well it be go to be a few minute before the gate 's in position and ready to dial out and I miss lunch so I be go to fix myself a sandwich anyone want anything anyone no no fine okay that be Earth and that be Taonas Praclarush Taonas be one of the early lantian city it be abandon when the inhabitant learn their sun be near the end of its life yes thank you I know I 've be there okay show I the order in which the early ancient city be found VALA how be that useful you go to join up all the dot and draw a pretty picture JACKSON I be just get my bearing you be go to have to get use to the fact this be probably go to take a while the way you approach thing it could take the rest of our life I be sorry but we be not go to find the location of this thing by look under W for weapon p for planet then I be just say ask the question Dr Weir already try it it would be a complete waste of time it would take all of 11 second hello we be look for the name of two planet know on Earth in ancient time in the dialect of Old English as Castiana and Sahal Satisfied Taoth Vaclarush and Valos Cor now I be satisfied SIGHS see Daniel do not hurt to ask Gate telemetry check out stabilize thruster be online and power be well into the green we be good to go where be McKay I be here one of your crew would not let I finish my sandwich in the corridor oh the nerve of that crewman huh we be about to try a connection go ahead that be the easy part thank you I 've already send the remote dial command it be just go to take a while because of time dilation right Wormhole be establish of course it be teal'c I have a collect call from the Pegasus Galaxy will you accept the charge TEAL ' c I will indeed Colonel Mitchell hey how be thing back home in the Milky Way secondary gate be in position there have be no sign of Ori activity since my arrival at the supergate which be in fact several hour ago MITCHELL well we be about to get the party start so just hang loose TEAL ' c I be hang loosely Colonel Mitchell be it just I or do his voice sound deep it be the time dilation effect of the black hole can not be help right so who want to set off a big old firecracker a 26 megaton direct energy firecracker you mean not until we decrease the yield by at least 5 carter I know you be go to say that oh forgive I for not want to vaporize the stargate on our first attempt we be on a clock McKay we have to take the risk you know I find your recklessness so teal'c it be Sam we be about to launch the first warhead to the preprogramme coordinate be you at a safe distance from both gate TEAL ' C I be EMERSON ON PA Attention all hand Stand by launch first warhead beam device in three two one mark teal'c what be the good news the delay be annoy black hole time dilation can not be help the news be not good Colonel Mitchell the first attempt be unsuccessful okay let us try again VALA Daniel Hmm we get what we come for I know should not we be out there tell someone not yet okay well she tell we the name of the planet they be right up there glow in the ceiling Taoth Vaclarush and Valos Cor she even give we the address which mean we could be out there somewhere overlook Atlantis toast with exotic beverage there be something else go on what well it should not have work I mean I do not expect it to when I ask Elizabeth to try but I think there would at least be some remnant some vague similarity between the word Castiana and Sahal and their ancient language counterpart she would not lie I do not know but explain this to I how can this database translate in real time a language speak 8 000 year after the Ancients abandon Atlantis that be a tough one be there an archival visual record of the lantian citizen who flee to Earth there be display they for I one at a time no no no no those yield calculation be perfectly fine they be Lf your goal be to blow up the stargate anything less and it will not add enough energy to the matter stream to make a jump to the stargate and anything more and the stargate will be destroy look you want to run high voltage but you 've only get an extension cord it be impossible and I tell you so before we leave Atlantis no you say it be borderline impossible yes well we 've cross the border but hey you know do not let I stop you go calibrate your warhead Beam your bomb you know Sam this be not the Rodney McKay I hear story about I know what story what have you hear well for starter that you do not know the meaning of the word impossible well I certainly know the meaning and that under threat of impend death you could work absolute miracle I suppose Sheppard tell you that yes he do yes well it be all true but I be not under the threat of impend death and I do not have not yet keep it up well I will see what I can come up with then you know Cam he be not wrong as much as it pain I to say it the datum from our first attempt support his argument well like my grandma use to say if at first you do not succeed try a large thermonuclear reaction her word exactly well exciting as it be to view the Atlantis family album I be look for someone in particular I do not know of any 10 000 year old ancient I take that back we know he Moros be the last High Councilor of Atlantis Moros well apart from the funny hat he be the spit image of Merlin be not he see in Arthur 's time it be Myrdin you see how a word can change over the century I know where you be go you think that Merlin or Myrdin or whatever his name be come back to Atlantis at some stage and hide these name here as clue for we to find no no the first human to set foot within the city after it be abandon be Dr Elizabeth Weir leader of the current Atlantis expedition be you sure of that evidence of his presence would have be record well darling I guess that be it we will have to leave here with exactly that which we come here for no I already know Merlin be in the archive I be look for someone else who you choose your word very carefully when you say the first human to set foot in the city what about Ascended be you be not really a hologram be you you have your answer Daniel Jackson I suggest you act on it I have it it might require a little improvisation but I think between the two of we we should be able to what have you get our energy output problem be not one of degree it be one of duration we need to calibrate an explosion with a low enough yield that the gate can survive but maintain sufficiently high energy for there to be a cumulative effect on the matter stream you see when I first realize we use two bomb mckay yes I be come to that part we set the second device to detonate within a few second of the first I be sure you 've make the calculation yes they be right here nice job McKay yes well it usually help to threaten I we only have four device leave and we need two so let I just do the math all right so we only have two more shot at this I be also concerned that two successive blast might overwhelm the stabilizer rocket drive the gate close to the event horizon of the black hole I be not crazy about bring the odyssey in that much close I think it be worth the risk do it up what be it Radek Elizabeth we 've detect a Wraith hive ship with our long range sensor be it head this way toward the Odyssey we should alert they open a channel we can not the black hole be block their subspace communication well Odyssey 's sensor will also be affect most likely along with several other system there be a possibility they will not see the Wraith approach they until it be too late that be my concern yes Dial Earth it be quite possible the Wraith be draw to the nuclear blast Stargate Command this be Weir Doctor we be not expect to hear from you until 1930 hour tomorrow WEIR ON RADIO we 've detect a Wraith ship on our long range sensor head towards Odyssey but they be in close proximity to a black hole which have hamper communication how can we help if you can get our message to Teal'c he should be able to alert Odyssey through the connected stargate we will have to send a team with a subspace transmitter close to Teal'c 's position do what you have to do Sergeant but they need to be warn yes ma'am I be forward you our message now there be still time to get it to they but you be go to have to hurry Weir out I be go to check in on Dr Jackson and let he know what be happen here right I know you be still here there be no point in hiding I do not think she be come back Daniel especially if you shout at her oh yes she be she be come this far she be go to finish what she start you be not fool anybody anymore Dr Jackson oh hi hi who be you talk to well I do not know what she be call herself these day but at one point in history her name be Morgan Le Fay Morgan Le Fay be here posing as a hologram yes may I oh yes hello that be her you may enter your query verbally or by you know drop the schoolteacher act this be a computer generate image of a lantian woman who live 10 000 year ago I be pretty familiar with the program it have not change question whose image be your avatar base on and what be the purpose of your program I be create by Ganos Lal in her image for the purpose of assist young mind and what make you think otherwise for starter she tell we exactly what we need to know she do do this interface have the capability of play back event from early in the session yes can you play back the last sentence she say to I before she disappear you have your answer Daniel Jackson I suggest you act on it see see her demeanor completely change she look directly at Daniel it be really creepy well I do warn you that she could be patronize you say this device use up a lot of power be there any way of determine exactly how much power we 've use yes Control Room this be Weir I need you to access the power usage log for the holo room TECHNICIAN yes ma ' be none none be you sure well the light be on other than that hey SNAPS finger got you I think I owe you an apology Dr Jackson I think I owe you an apology Dr Jackson there be no need Dr Weir I be the one who should apologize ON RADIO teal'c it be Mitchell we be go again look like this be one of those day when one nuke be not enough so we be go to fire off two in rapid succession Understood Colonel Mitchell maintain a good safe distance teal'c there be a possibility we could vaporize the gate on both end if we get this wrong it be like five percent maybe seven he will be fine that be a comfort Rodney thank you Coordinates be set beam the warhead in five four three two one mark the second attempt be also unsuccessful however energy do pass between the stargate and the supergate close but not enough TEAL ' C indeed mckay we still have two more bomb I say we increase the yield to maximum and try it again you be the one who say a maximum yield blast would vaporize both gate we 've only get one more shot at this what difference do it make the man have a point Sam each attempt be force the gate close to the event horizon of the black hole to keep safe beaming distance I be go to have to bring the Odyssey in even close and the close you get to the black hole the more system be affect by its effect Sublight engine and beam technology be fine but communication and sensor be all out of whack already we be fly blind not quite but close ALARM BEEPING Odyssey this be teal'c my sensor indicate that an Ori vessel be approach these coordinate at their current speed they will arrive within minute be that enough time to try again not a chance it take time to set and calibrate warhead and detonator he need to get out of there can not do that well why not he be a sit duck what Colonel Mitchell be say be we can not allow the Ori to discover the secondary gate if they do we will never get another shot at this you be an ascended Ancient I be specifically Morgan Le Fay I think I recognize she from description in the archive on Vagonbrei that be that be great so enough of the tiny tidbit of information not that we be ungrateful but if you know what it be we be look for and as an Ascended being I have to assume you do as Dr Jackson know it be against our high law to interfere but interfere a little bit be fine be it it might be a good idea to be a bit less confrontational but she be here chat with we that be interference be not it if you really be Morgan Le Fay how do I know your intention be to help we accord to legend you be Merlin 's great rival Merlin be both Moros and Myrdin for a time in your history yes I be his rival but we be talk about many thousand of year Dr Jackson as you know thing change when we first abandon Atlantis all those millennium ago the Earth be so harsh its people so primitive by comparison there be no hope of live among they as Lantians or rebuild our society so instead we spread out to many land some of we plant a few small seed of civilization among the first tribe of man other make their way to the stargate at your southern pole still other choose to live the remainder of our life in seclusion and meditation Merlin and I both choose the latter path and so you ascend it be only some thousand of year later upon see the threat the Ori could one day become that Merlin retook his human form in order to create the weapon that you seek he do everything within his power to keep his work secret but we fear his intention I be send to observe and if necessary to stop he wait right there just a minute if he be human again then you be interfere you break your own law Merlin retain all of the knowledge he have gain when he ascend as well as many power Knowledge and power he use to create a weapon capable of wipe ascended being from existence so you be say he cheat in a manner of speak for that brief time in your history he be the most powerful be on your planet he create a small enclave of nobleman with whom he entrust his secret Arthur and Camelot yes so you be tell we that after do everything in your power to oppose Merlin all of a sudden you agree with he because if you do not then you be deliberately mislead we teal'c have the Ori ship detect your presence I can not be certain we have to risk it carter teal'c I need you to get the ship into position alongside the gate from there you should be able to extend the cloak around the active stargate you realize the Ori ship could be there to rendezvous with a new fleet of ship Dr McKay why do not you go calibrate your bomb that way you be ready when the time arrive teal'c the cloaking field may be attenuate because you 've expand it Shut down all non mission critical system and maintain radio silence hopefully they be there just to check thing out and they will be go soon I have no reason to deceive you no of course not so what be you do when you be pretend to be a hologram the learning program I create many year before I leave Atlantis present itself as a means of help you if you have fall for it you would have your answer and be on your way think you come up with it yourself that be my intention I believe you I do I mean I understand the fine line you have to walk and I realize the risk you be take just show yourself but I be sorry I want more and you can pass that on to your friend as well yeah I know you be listen because I be get sick of hide clue and cryptic message and Merlin be right that the Ori be a threat but not only to we lower not only to the billion of human life throughout this galaxy but to your own existence because when this war be over and every soul that be leave alive be pray to the Ori feed their need to be worship well you know who they be go to come for next I will not pretend to know what that war will look like or on what battlefield it will take place but then I will not be alive to see it if we interfere we be no well than the Ori I understand that be at the very core of what you be of what you believe but I be talk about survival here if you really be try to help then help yourself ON RADIO this be SG 11 Comm Officer ON RADIO this be SG 11 Comm Officer relay an urgent message via subspace relay from the Gamma Site message read from Atlantis have detect Wraith ship approach odyssey 's coordinate in Pegasus can not relay warn directly because of interference Advise Odyssey commander of danger upon receipt of this message original message receive at SGC 1545 Zulu good luck our last two bomb be ready to go that be great pick a spot and relax Colonel sublight engine be under a huge strain maintain position this long you speak from the heart Dr Jackson that be what I remember most from your brief time among we no you would not recall those memory be strip from you when you be send back that be what you be afraid of be not it of do the right thing and be punish for it I 've already go too far but you can not be the only one to realize the Ori have change thing there must be other among you that see that the time to join this fight be now Odyssey this be teal'c teal'c what be the word TEAL ' c a Wraith vessel be approach your position oh Wraith that be not good I be sorry how the hell do you know that Atlantis have detect their approach I be relay their message via Stargate Command there be no sign of a Wraith ship on the sensor we can not trust sensor this close to the black hole Shields to maximum shield be only operate at 20 efficiency it be the black hole we need to get far away move we out well there be something out there all right we just can not see it EMERSON Damage report WOMAN Hyperdrive be down can we return fire try sir but the Wraith ship be far out from the black hole than we be Emergency thrust sublight engine let us put some distance between we and that thing no you know what we need to do the opposite what what against a gravity well this strong they 've literally get the high ground but if we can get they to follow we close to the black hole then their system will be affect the same way as ours include their jamming technology which mean we should be able to beam the warhead directly aboard their ship in that close we will not have the engine power to maneuver so we slingshot and use the gravity well to accelerate back out EXPLOSION take we in full power I know what we be ask you to do you be afraid the other will step in and stop you from help we but maybe maybe they just need someone to cross that imaginary line instead of just walk it there must be other among you just wait to follow your example not enough but you have be allow to go this far trust that you have your answer at least tell we which one of the planet to go to please Merlin 's weapon be not what happen just what she know would happen they stop she we will not see she again be they go to punish she I do not know I think I understand why you come back Daniel I would not have like their company either shield be barely hold see it not yet sir maintain course teal'c it be Sam we be about to try something that will probably vaporize the stargate at both end carter you 've get exactly 20 second to get your hyperdrive online and get out of there there it be Wraith ship 's in position Beaming warhead in three two one mark the Wraith ship have be destroy EMERSON reduce sublight engine to one third let us get hyperdrive back online carter there be something else I do not know how it survive the detonation but the stargate it be still intact and it be still active odyssey this be teal'c teal'c I think we tell you to get the hell out of there if I have do so I would be unable to inform you that the jump be successful the supergate be now active be you serious there be more Colonel Mitchell I be able to keep the stargate conceal until the last moment and lure the Ori vessel into the unstable vortex of the supergate when the jump occur you mean we just blow up an Ori ship by destroy a Wraith ship indeed we do today we have achieve a great victory she do what she believe be right Daniel how badly can she be punish for that I do not know maybe she will just get a slap on the wrist or be force to write I will not interfere in the affair of human again ten thousand time yeah I doubt that she say you have your answer we find out the two address we come here for can you at least smile about that I suppose but we do find out something else too what they be not go to help we we be in this alone NARRA TOR previously on Stargate SG 1 whoa whoa what be you do I do not know sir the Colonel must have input new stargate location into the computer Jaffa number in the million spread across the vastness of the galaxy what you need right now be a strong leader you guy we 've get a problem Ba'al 's be busy he be be gather up stargate from all over the sector for the last several week in arthurian myth Morgan be a powerful sorceress King Arthur 's half sister and an adversary of Merlin that would suggest she may have have a hand in the disappearance of the weapon we seek we be look for the name of two planet know on Earth in ancient time in the dialect of Old English as Castiana and Sahal Taoth Vaclarush and Valos Cor you be not really a hologram be you you have your answer Daniel Jackson I suggest you act on it what be the late from the search party nothing much to report sir the toxic atmosphere on Castiana be slow we down considerably now we find evidence of stone structure on Sahal but they appear to have be abandon over 40 000 year ago so basically we 've get nothing not yet you go all the way to the Pegasus Galaxy have a face to face encounter with a full blow Ascended being come away with not one but two gate address and they both turn out to be dead end well see that be the part that do not make any sense sir if Morgan do not want we to find Merlin 's weapon then why tell we anything at all we must be miss something that be what Doctor Jackson keep tell I you hear from Daniel he check in from Camelot this morning he be convinced that the answer be somewhere in Merlin 's library but he have not find anything yet HARRIMAN ON RADIO sorry to interrupt General you be need in the control room what be it Chief we just receive a head up from NORAD sir an Al'kesh bomber just enter Earth 's atmosphere about four minute ago bearing indicate Cheyenne Mountain Two F 16 be out of Peterson have be re route to intercept I be patch we in PILOT repeat you have enter a Flight Restricted Zone and be request to land immediately please respond Stargate Command this be Bearcat One Alien vessel be unresponsive should we engage if they be friendly they would not be fly silent maybe their communication be down we can not take the chance Bearcat one this be General Landry you be clear to engage PILOT the alien vessel have be disable they be come down hard I 've get project coordinate we be on it sir carter what be the situation Major the area have be secure no one on board except for the pilot he be be treat for minor injury let us have a look at he ah at last the welcome committee MITCHELL I do not get it we know that Ba'al have come to Earth before without be detect Presumably by cloak cargo ship or by use Asgard beam technology from high orbit exactly so why would he fly an Al'kesh directly to Stargate Command maybe he be plan to attack no even Ba'al 's not that crazy I would not be so sure well this be interesting there be a signal come from inside the interrogation room he must have implant himself with a locator beacon no doubt he be expect his people to beam he out at some point well not hold his breath why not well after the stargate be steal two year ago we instal jamming device to prevent anyone from lock onto a signal from within the base MITCHELL General have he say anything only that he will not talk to anybody but SG 1 lucky we well frankly I be inclined to let he rot that be all right sir we will talk to he after all he do come all this way Colonel Mitchell Colonel Carter teal'c Qetesh she go by Vala now SIGHING always do really we 've be authorize to give you the time of day so make it quick and make it good of course I understand your reluctance to trust I so I will be succinct it be the clone they want I dead that would make all of we Dead huh what would you do short sheet the bed cheat at card you must understand that what I do be out of necessity you be the one who invite the Ori into this galaxy I be merely try to preserve a safe haven for myself and a few good friend you mean slave so you steal a few stargate try to set up your own network yada yada yada we be there remember Luckily I be not I have to hear about your heroic third hand I also have to hear about how you thwart my attempt to gain control of the Jaffa High Council but none of this explain why the clone would turn on you that be probably because there be a little more to his plan than he be let on Perceptive as usual do not Daniel tell I something about a very powerful weapon in the hand of the Jaffa on Dakara it be not a weapon technically it be a device that be originally use by the Ancients to seed all life in this galaxy but we do adapt it to destroy the replicator use my simultaneous dialing program I might add be I correct in assume that this device can be adapt to kill organic life as well yes now it be start to make sense it be well you must remember that I have intimate knowledge of just how deprave the Goa'uld can be you be suggest that Ba'al attempt to gain control of the High Council in order to gain access to the ancient device with the purpose of wipe out all life in the galaxy except his own little corner of course that be Anubis 's plan I never say it be original but if I have succeed the Ori would have lose interest and be on their merry way you be go to save the galaxy by destroy pretty much everyone in it but your clone figure out you be not go to bring they along do not they they serve their purpose but what can I say their egos be begin to be a problem well they be your clone what I do not understand be after this particular revelation you think SG 1 would want to help you because I can help you with what your search for Merlin 's weapon of course KNOCKING ON DOOR KNOCKING ON DOOR Sir Agent Barrett 's here to see you Barrett what can I do for you I be here for the prisoner sir excuse I Ba'al I have an official request for his transfer into NID custody you got to be kid we catch he we can handle it well with all due respect sir it be my understanding he basically fly himself into your front door look nobody want a jurisdictional tug of war here we 've be investigate the Goa'uld infiltration of the Trust for two year now I be tell you it be a global conspiracy political and corporate connection in over a dozen country your prisoner be at the top of the pyramid we do not even know if he be the real Ba'al even if he be a clone I bet you he be get enough information to bring down the whole organization we could wipe they out well you be just go to have to wait your turn right now we 've get big fish to fry Anubis tell I of the weapon and of its power he dedicate considerable effort to find it during his time in our plane of existence but he never succeed and you have the address actually you have the address it be among those Colonel O'Neill obtain during his encounter with the ancient repository of knowledge on the planet you call P3R 272 there be thousand of address on that list exactly why you will never find it on your own I however have information that will allow you to narrow down your choice considerably all I ask in return be that you eliminate the clone and we do that exactly how it should be easy enough to track they down I implant a locator chip in each one when I create they that be funny because we detect a locator chip in you I have to implant one in myself in order to gain their trust you can use the tracking system on board my Al'kesh they will never see it come well that be a truly incredible story in every sense of the word I should also mention that every one of my clone know about Merlin 's weapon and if any of they at any point be capture by the Priors and be it to somehow slip out that the SG C computer contain the location of a weapon deadly to the Ori their prior would stop at nothing to have it within their grasp it be of course your decision I leave it in your very capable hand you can not seriously think that he be tell the truth the whole truth of course not but there be too much at stake here not to investigate and in the meantime what be I suppose to tell my superior that be your problem we manage to activate the tracking system on the Al'kesh and this be what we get those be the ba'al more like dot really get it dot ball clear THROAT anyway we work up those file with the current location show the address and any available intel all right so what kind of trap be we look at I do not think it would be as simple as an ambush not while we have he in custody no Goa'uld would sacrifice himself like that what do you think sir I say we give it a go remind I to give you a primer on the meaning of the word sir but she be right we will not know if Ba'al be serious or not until we test out some of these address some of this intel seem pretty sketchy I be familiar with this planet it use to belong to Camulus can you get we in absolutely you sure you want to bring she along on this one Jackson say she will be useful now be her chance to prove it but Dr Jackson be not here and it seem to I he be the only one she ever listen to yeah some of the time you do not think you can control she no I know I can not control she but that be pretty much par for the course Sir Carter and I be the same rank Teal'c be an alien Jackson 's a civilian I learn a long time ago I do not control anything who do how do I look turn around yeah you look great a little more enthusiasm from you next time thank you what Zat this be my first real mission through the gate and I be the only one who know the terrain then try not to get we kill here we be and what well it be a ring platform somewhat hide but it be a backdoor if you will okay but it do not do we much good if we can not activate it leave that to I Hang on Hang on where be she go WHISTLES GROANING what the hell be you do I alert a Jaffa patrol to our presence obviously do you mind if I ask why so they would sound the alarm and send reinforcement oh well that be that be brilliant hey how come I do not think of that my dear Colonel where do you think the reinforcement will come from you can thank I later by the way PIN clang Jaffa JAFFA GROANING do not shoot I know why you be here and you be make a big mistake oh let we guess you be the real Ba'al precisely no doubt the impostor promise you the location of Merlin 's weapon if you help he get rid of the rest of we that be right you do realize he have no idea where it be or how to find it VALA but you do of course I obtain the information only after the clone be create and needless to say I never share it with they you know what this be give I a headache what do you say we finish this up at home let us go Spartacus oh yeah now I can see the difference I still can not do we really believe only one of they know how to find the weapon this be Ba'al we be talk about I do not think we can take anything either of they say at face value so what now sir we 've get scientist work here do not we get they on this see if they can sort out who be who in the meantime I think I be go to have to arrange for separate accommodation analyst I wish I have well news so you be say there be no way to tell they apart we generate distinct dna profile of all four sample use a number of analysis technique sorry four we do the host and the Goa'uld separately right we run each test five time and in each case the result be uncanny there be a perfect match across all 13 specific dna marker I be sorry Colonel either the clone be genetically indistinguishable from the real Ba'al or we have two clone on our hand and the real Ba'al be still out there Yep thank you so much for not encounter resistance I guess some ba'al be big than other huh if he be get a ship back there we be screw we 've get to find a way around you hold this position I will go I will come with you let us draw some fire you think what I be think carter Someone 's come screaming do not shoot I be the real Ba'al Sam we get Ba'al Copy that so do we Chief get a full count two strike three ba'al that be clever sir he be think that one up the whole way home yeah the whole three second three point two good point well that tie you with SG 12 because they bring in two more about an hour ago Damn it be not a competition say you General Barrett I be wonder when you would be back I understand you get yourself a few extra ba'al I do not suppose you would consider let I take a few off your hand you know I can not do that not until we figure out which one be the original and whether or not he be bluff about Merlin 's weapon besides if any of they get wind that we have another agenda that would give they leverage in the interrogation last thing we need be for they to think they have a strong bargaining position I be afraid you be go to say that I assume you speak to your superior I do they be not happy the fact be while the nid do provide civilian oversight of my command I do not technically have to follow their order at least not until the President tell I to they try that for the moment he be back you but if your investigation do not turn up anything useful soon it be go to all change obviously I would like to stay on and observe the interrogation sir any one of they could say something that might turn out to be useful for we of course you be always welcome what do you get well sir SG 14 just arrive with two more Ba'al clone which bring we to the end of our list well you guy get your work cut out for you huh and just how might you be able to help I well we could spare your life for one you help we find Merlin 's weapon and I promise we will not kill you no instead you will lock I in the basement of one of your more appalling penal facility for I to live out the rest of my life in squalor and deprivation it be well than the alternative trust I you see here be what I be think I be think that you be not the real Ba'al I mean you have not even try to cut a deal which make I think that you have no idea how to find the weapon therefore you be just another clone I be the real Ba'al I assure you no no think about this how do we meet do you think the real Ba'al would let himself be capture like that cower in the bush like a scared little bunny rabbit that be well but I be still not buy it you be try to goad I into reveal information no I be just call it like I see it and right now you do not strike I as someone who could intimidate a 10 year old out of his lunch money much less run an interstellar empire why do not you have the guard excuse himself for a moment and I will show you just what I be capable of see now I know you be not the real Ba'al the real Ba'al would not care about the guard DOOR SLIDES OPEN so have a tough day be we what do you want Qetesh be that any way to greet an old friend be that what we be I will admit we have our difference you attack my fleet at Selenis cripple my flagship and kill 10 000 of my good Jaffa so I do but it be nothing personal anyway that be all in the past and I be here to talk about our future our future well you must admit there be always be something between we even when we want to kill each other there be always a certain spark perhaps but you 've make your new allegiance clear have I or have I just be wait for the right opportunity what sort of opportunity you know how to find the address I have the access to the database you would betray your Tau'ri friend friend come and go besides what use be they go to be to I on their knee before the army of the Ori you tell I what you know I will find the location of Merlin 's weapon we will make our escape and then we will be free to share in the pleasure of each other 's company an excellent plan but why wait Merlin 's weapon be not go anywhere we have nothing but time what here on this rather uncomfortable table why not well the security camera for starter there be no way they would trust I after see something like this tell they it be part of your interrogation technique oh come on be serious I be be serious be not you BA ' AL your time amongst the Tau'ri be make you soft you use to be a much well liar do not say it your people be get nowhere sir you think you can do well it be what we be train for I could have half a dozen agent here by tomorrow I be talk about offer our service on your investigation if any of the ba'al know where Merlin 's weapon be we will find out by your own admission the NID want this over with as quickly as possible so they can move on to something they think be more important under those circumstance I think you will understand why I would prefer to stick with my own people yes sir Mind if I join you please so how be the interrogation come you have to ask look I know you 've be monitor the investigation I also know you think we be waste our time no no I never say that not in so many word look you guy be fight a war out there right we be fight it down here believe I it be a war do you remember two year ago when the Goa'uld almost take over the russian government do you want to see that happen again of course not then help I Malcolm it be not like we be go to keep the ba'al here forever just give we a couple of day and then you can come in and day no this be way too important be you all right this be about we be not it excuse I yeah this be about we we obviously have unresolved issue look you be my friend and I care about you but do not push it I need to see the prisoner now grunt General Somebody give I some good news sorry sir I still do not have anything useful I do not even make it to first base where be Colonel Carter she be finish up last time I see but I do not think she have anything to report either we be run out of time the NID want the prisoner and the President 's not go to be able to hold they back forever or they be not go to wait what be you talk about Agent Barrett he be talk to one of the ba'al I do not give authorization for that Whoa GUN fire Radio this be Colonel Carter request backup Level 16 Corridor B come with I you cover both ALARM sound we be lose containment this be General Landry I need a full security lockdown of Levels 15 through 17 now and there go the feed we be blind Barrett oh Sam he get away he take my gun it be okay we will get you out of here okay come on ba'al go somewhere both grunt BARRETT grunt put they with the other we have emergency force in position at all access point sir all three level be lock down and secure what do you got for I Doctor well we be think our good bet be symbiote poison introduce in gas form into all three level it will not harm any of our people but it will kill any of the Goa'uld who come in contact with it Excellent do it well it be not that simple you see we will have to use the ventilation system to distribute the gas and you know it be not really design for that sort of thing what be you say I can run some simulation and determine the optimum point to seal off the level and to insert the gas but even at optimum efficiency it will not be distribute evenly there be bind to be dead pocket where the gas will take long before it have any effect all right all right so what you be say be depend on location some of the ba'al may get advance warning sir as soon as they realize what be happen they be go to kill the hostage then we must be prepare to provide a distraction at the moment the gas be release go get up we do not have much time remember we can not afford to be see until Dr Lee give we the signal got it no improvise this time we stick to the plan despite the fact that my improvisation have be extremely useful in the past that be your entry point bring she the access code please you be try to download the list of planet from the ancient database what be you do we need to join the other all right I be come you want Merlin 's weapon for yourself a weapon capable of destroy not only the Ori but the ancient as well I would say that be a pretty valuable commodity I will not do it this would be an inappropriate time for heroic Colonel go ahead and kill I it be only a matter of time before we regain control of this level good luck try to figure out the code before then I would never dream of kill you but I will kill the other hostage you start with Agent Barrett wait I will do it I be in position Doc siler ON RADIO Level 14 Section C 9 on the ventilation grid all right that be our main access point on the north side now the first thing you will need to do be seal off the vent before the junction I be on it why be this take so long it be a lot of information you do something to slow the download do not you I do not know what you be talk about well it do not matter you can not stop we anyway check the perimeter they will be come soon cock GUN FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING whispers teal'c Vala we get a bit of a dead end here you get Carter 's 20 Negative I be similarly immobilize Doctor we be set up five separate access point they all have to be ready to go simultaneously it be just go to take a minute I will take that it will not do you any good they will never let you off this base even if you kill we all yes that be what I want you to think otherwise you never would have give I the code what be you talk about I know they would not negotiate not even for you not with something like this at stake fortunately that be not the plan where the hell be that gas I do not mean to rush you boy we be about to be discover here ba'al we know you be back there so much for the plan grunt SCREAMS oh hell grunt siler ON RADIO we have gunfire on Level 16 Siler this be General Landry forget about a coordinate attack just hit they with as much gas as you can now yes sir HISSING grunt GUN fire we have a man down be you all right we be uninjured and Mitchell you okay I be fine what be happen we get they on the run it look like they be retreat back to one of the isolation room wait a minute all of they together yeah why Sam grunt Sam you be too late that be symbiote poison you be the one who be too late get we out of here how the hell do he do it it look like the locator beacon actually serve a dual purpose in close proximity they combine to amplify the signal enough to be pick up through our jamming screen that be why he need we to go and round up all the clone and bring they here he be play we from the start this be all so that he could get his hand on that list of planet he must genuinely believe that Merlin 's weapon be hide on one of they even so he take a great risk it be only because Agent Barrett violate protocol that he be afford the opportunity to escape the interrogation room and that be the reason he be able to get all the clone in one place so that he could beam out so if the whole thing be plan in advance how do he know what Agent Barrett be go to do Agent Barrett we need to talk yes do you read the report on Ba'al 's attempt to gain control of the Jaffa High Council yeah sure I do the council member be influence by some form of mind control yeah I remember so so what be you do in Ba'al 's cell I want to question he you have no authorization for that you be stonewall I I decide to take matter into my own hand you take your weapon into the interrogation room yeah yeah I should not have do that that be a mistake see the Malcolm Barrett I know would never have make that kind of mistake your record indicate your entire career have be strictly by the book now suddenly out of the blue you be a cowboy what be you guy say you think that I 've be brainwash the technology be readily available to the Goa'uld who infiltrate the Trust and their loyalty be to Ba'al CARTER somebody must have give he the spec to our anti beam technology it be the only way he could 've know that a combine signal would be enough to punch through yeah I agree with that but it be not I Ba'al 's plan hinge on know in advance he would have the opportunity to get out of that cell he know you be come and this be crazy you do not know you be do anything wrong I 've get to go I be due back in Washington you be not go anywhere Sergeant Hand over your weapon Sam you know this be not true Sir I be sorry I should never have give Ba'al that code you have no way of know under the circumstance you do the right thing thank you sir so what do you think think Ba'al really have a way of figure out where that weapon be hard to say Anubis know the address of all those planet and he never find it mind you there be only one of he say you NARRA TOR previously on Stargate SG 1 where the hell be they grunt we 've be investigate the Goa'uld infiltration of the Trust for two year now I be tell you it be a global conspiracy what be you guy say you think that I 've be brainwash the technology be readily available to the Goa'uld who infiltrate the Trust you make good time Colonel yes sir well it be a good thing I leave early I take a wrong turn at the post office I be drive for about an hour before my Special Forces training kick in and I realize I be lose that and the road end Wiser man than you have do bad so this be General O'Neill 's place actually Jack have not be able to use it much now that he spend a lot of time in Washington his loss come on in look like I beat the other up here Walter just call Colonel Reynolds ' team have be delay offworld Teal'c 's go to assist be there a problem nothing they can not handle unfortunately it also mean that Colonel Carter will be delay until Reynolds get back to take command of the SGC what about Jackson still in England seem he be meet some lord or earl with a private library of ancient reference material on Merlin and Morgan Le Fay he be obviously quite excited yeah like a fat kid in a candy store I be a big boy in my youth never do appreciate comment like that yes sir sorry sir anyway Vala 's hitch a ride with the other so until then it be just you and I I will be sure to stay out of your way sir you will not even know I be here Nonsense get to know each other a little well outside of work and the pressure of the SGC be what this be all about kick back put our foot up for the day well that be kind of hard to do with the fate of the galaxy hang in the balance sir well if anyone be go to make a difference in this battle Colonel it be you and your team yes sir I see what you mean about escape the pressure we all need to stop for air now and then or we will burn out that be the one thing you people do not know how to do so I be make it an order yes sir I be sure it will be fun sir you be damn right it will be fun come on in LANDRY I 've get the coffee on REYNOLDS the first villager go miss sometime yesterday morning another by nightfall they send out search party armed man these people be capable hunter by all account they 've live on this planet for generation and never encounter an animal they perceive as an unmanageable threat perhaps it be not an animal so if an animal do not tear these people apart what do the people of P9J 333 have never before encounter an indigenous creature they believe capable of such an act so you think this be some sort of motivational tool mean to strike fear an Ori bogeyman it seem to be work the people be terrify any chance the Prior know you be there I doubt this be a message direct at we our mission be to covertly observe if the planet go Origin or not we do not make contact with the population until after people start going miss okay well if this be some new Ori threat chance be the Prior will show up to take responsibility on the other hand if it be not and it be just some vicious creature hell bent on eat the whole village should not we use our superior technology to help track it down you think I do not really care about the plight of some innocent people I 've never meet on some planet somewhere carter I be sorry but well yes it just so happen I do have vast experience hunt rare deadly creature of all kind let I guess the rare they be please I be here to be helpful if you do not think these boy can use my expertise that be fine I will just stay here and we can start on that quality time General Landry want we to spend together I 've actually come up with a list of suggestion teal'c you and Vala head to 333 with sg 3 and 25 see if you can figure out what we be deal with without be detect by the local good plan boss Vala 's experience notwithstanding I want everyone to exercise extreme caution we should find out whether this be prior related or not be General Landry not expect we at his cabin I will let he know we be go to be delay a little bit I be sure Colonel Mitchell will be very pleased to hear he be get more special alone time with the General Hey Colonel if this be a rare and deadly creature we have to try and catch it alive okay that be not our mission do you have any idea what this could be worth on the open market I do not okay okay wait I propose a fifty fifty split I think it be only fair I be the one with all the contact to unload something like this anything less than that would just be well plain wrong okay name your price well say something it be call negotiate they be not come something be eat people on P9J 333 Teal'c and Vala be check it out really maybe I should at ease Colonel they 've get SG 3 and 5 with they they will be fine still this be suppose to be a group thing sir maybe we should reschedule and put away that laptop you can not possibly still be write mission report and if you be I do not want to read anything that long to be honest sir I finish an hour ago I think so you do not have to be so uncomfortable around I Mitchell Sir no matter what you be still my boss I just wish you would relax and enjoy the peace and quiet of the great outdoors GUN fire Ignore it that be a large caliber 300 or 338 they be hunt elk it be one of the only drawback around here not a fan sir run around the wood with a gun never seem to I like a good way to unwind look to kill some innocent creature just go about its day no I suppose not sir not if your day job involve run around the wood carry a gun recognize the track I do not what we need to do first be dig a deep pit this look like a very good spot why do not you boy get start what do not tell I you do not bring shovel GUN fire ON RADIO this be SG 25 leader we need back MEN scream in DISTANCE it come out of nowhere never see anything like it remain calm you will be fine ROARING come thunder CRASHING Checkmate Yep too good for I sir pander to the ego of a senior officer Mitchell no truthfully I always hate the game but if you happen to have a PlayStation I will happily kick your ass at SOCOM 3 Good I want you to feel like you can be honest with I yes sir but I suppose that be easy for I than it be for you I be the General no I think it be probably hard for you in some way Lonely at the top and all that huh no More not know what people think of your decision relax son I be think about what you say to I last week about not be in charge of anything I be just use to a clear chain of command you could have pick any team you want you choose to make it your personal mission to get Colonel Carter Dr Jackson and teal'c back together that be true and I would not change that for the world you say you want to learn from the very good yes I do it be just after almost die like I do there be a part of I that figure I could do anything now since come to the SGC I have learn that I can not handle any of this without the rest of SG 1 I believe in you Colonel thank you sir but we be get our ass kick yes we be we be not go to get medal for participation no sir we win or we die I prefer win now you start by bring SG 1 back together I need you to continue work together if we be go to have any hope your job be to make sure that happen very good sir GROWLING okay you want some dessert come and get it you could have warn I I nearly shoot you then you should not have run off by yourself I be perfectly capable of look after myself I be try to get help then why be you not dial the gate because I think I hear something growl I hear nothing that be probably because you scare it away that be good GROWLING now we can well I be flatter but I do not think we have time for this be you injure no I be fine thank you so much for take it alive Shame too I 've never see anything like this before thunder CRASHING Sir Sir Son of a bitch Mitchell what be you do I think I hear a noise I too MITCHELL LAUGHS well that would have be a hell of a story sir yeah Shotgun huh Thought you do not like to hunt I be up here last summer have a black bear come right through the kitchen door phone be down that happen Power could be out for a while too that be quite a storm out there thank you well Night sir Night Mitchell General listen maybe I be not the only one around here who need to relax I will try not to shoot you before morning thank you sir same here what be up sir go somewhere Mitchell yes sir the phone be still down power 's out I figure we would head back to reality today unfortunately the storm wash out the road into town the road it be the only road in and out of here look like we be rough it until they get it clear yes sir but you be a powerful Air Force General you could order we up a chopper we do not use helicopter for our own personal transportation Mitchell right sir besides I already check there be not one available we will be fine just another day or so okay thank you so you will be pleased to hear that all four member of SG 25 be go to be fine thank in part to my handiwork with a Goa'uld heal device I be sure Dr Lam appreciate the help I see you have not get over your phobia of sit in General Landry 's chair what be you do I think it be about time a woman sit here actually Dr Elizabeth Weir sit there all the time when she run the SGC she do good for her so now that the deadly creature of P3 whatever have be deal with when do we go I just get a call from the Silver Creek Sheriff 's Department apparently there be a bad storm up there last night and the road lead up to the area where the cabin be wash out and will not be reopen till tomorrow how unfortunate I be sure Colonel Mitchell agree I be sure the boy be have the time of their life get up to all sort of mischief oh yeah I can just imagine you be in for a treat Colonel yes sir I can see that the fulvous whistle duck very rare Endangered actually only spot one once in my life and as good fortune would have it their mating season be right now and they love to come out after a good rain that be a good one sir you know what the hat really sell it oh you be serious well sir as tempting as a duck that whistle sound I be think about go for a run work off some of that beer from last night you be miss the opportunity of a lifetime Mitchell be you make it an order Birding be not something you have to have in your soul son you have to come to it on your own well I get to be honest with you sir I do not know that I have it in I the plaintive mating call of this duck be unlike anything you 've ever hear imitate MATING CALL Permission to leave sir grant thank you here I go how be it come Dr Redden have just begin her examination she appear to be quite knowledgeable she should be she be be head up the xenology unit at Area 51 for several year now and there go my need for lunch REDDEN Body cavity contain mammal like organ unnatural look tumor appear prevalent let us get this out BEEPING what be go on Scans be pick up low level of radiation come from within the body the location be somewhere in the stomach lining here it look like there be some kind of extraneous sac or abscess attach to the stomach wall itself can I have a scalpel please thank you attempt to remove it now come on you Son of a thank you MAN help help get out of here watch where you be point that weapon what be wrong STUTTERS something attack we man it come out of nowhere it attack my buddy Mike all right all right take I to Mike this way REDDEN so it seem our large dead friend up in the lab use to look like this Native to P9J 333 a docile herbivore very shy and completely harmless accord to the local well it seem one of they at least have have an identity crisis yes well something cause rapid and extensive mutation that something I take it be creature number two exactly this little fellow apparently give off a type of radiation we 've never encounter before it lodge itself in the stomach lining of the host creature and begin alter the host 's dna yet the inhabitant of P9J 333 claim to have never see or hear of any such mutation to any of the animal on their planet oh well I strongly doubt that our small friend there be indigenous to the planet so the question be how do it get there it be an animal most likely a grizzly protect its young the witness be pretty freak out his friend just got maul to death he say it be a bear he say a bear or something I know it can get bore up here Wade it do not mean you have to go make up thing that be go to get the local all excited CARS HONKING and MEN HOOTING guess it be a little late for that seal off the park before the place turn into a shoot gallery look I only get three deputy work for I plus half a dozen volunteer ranger this be hunt season if I get a mad grizzly on the loose I need it deal with Best that I can hope for be that somebody kill whatever do this before it kill again Lieutenant you report an emergency what happen Colonel we 've get a problem there have be no attack of this nature report by any Jaffa settlement none of our other offworld ally be report any such contact either except we now have an attack by yet another predatory creature this time on a completely different planet not to mention a world that be already be convert by the Ori if the inhabitant of P2R 866 have already accept Origin there would be no need for the Priors to inflict this creature upon they exactly which mean that the Ori may have absolutely nothing to do with these creature so where be they come from I do not know but so far to the good of our knowledge they be only show up on world we visit this sheriff do not think we 've get a Bigfoot on our hand do he he be a decent enough guy probably just watch too much television on the other hand we have see real live alien monster he do not know that true but he could just be look for his 15 minute he be not that sort of man well it certainly would bring some publicity to the area bump up tourism whatever his motivation be he sure get everyone 's attention we 've get a bunch of drunken hunter out there all hype up look for revenge and glory so be we side with the hunter or the bear I do not want to see anyone else get hurt just check sir this I like sir a man be dead Colonel yes sir I know and I do sympathize it be just you keep tell I to relax it have nothing to do with be here with you sir Truth be if I sit around with nothing to do I get antsy I be much more at ease offworld in the thick of it I be fly air support out of Bien Hoa catch some triple a in my left engine and I have to eject end up land somewhere near the laotian border well north of the DMZ cut my knee up pretty good in the process I be lose bleeding badly no food no radio half a battalion of north vietnamese regular be comb the jungle look for I track I day and night follow my blood trail obviously you get away sir take I eight day so that be why you do not like to hunt I never feel more alive yes sir but I would not call it relax well I be kind of twisted that way sir MAN ON RADIO Sheriff Stokes come in we be about a mile northwest of Silver Creek Junction we find another body it be be tear to shreds Colonel respond I hear it sir Colonel Victim number two the first mission to P9J 333 be simply to observe and initiate first contact with the local should they reject the Ori the second mission to P2R 866 be purely covert surveillance of an already convert planet two completely different mission both to world not inhabit by scary creature of any kind right however there be one single common element to both mission both require team to remain inconspicuous Stealth be key then both team would have be require to use a Sodan cloaking device in order to remain hidden exactly and we test they for safety and start deploy they on mission such as these just over a week ago you think there be some sort of malfunction with the device yes but we have another problem I request a complete recall of all the Sodan cloaking device include the one still at Area 51 turn out one of they be miss no abnormal energy reading no power spike all system appear to be normal look like that one check out too how be it go nothing yet any word from Area 51 yeah Agent Barrett call in about an hour ago say his team have detain everyone who have security clearance to the lab where the device be be hold we should have more answer after he be finish question they so he be make a full recovery then well he be clear for duty but he still feel responsible for what happen VALA well he be brainwash it be hardly his fault still he be determined to find out how it happen and catch those responsible it be ironic that not so long ago the mere presence of the Goa'uld on Earth would have be cause for great concern seriously who would ever think that we would have big fish to fry or that you would use the word ironic in a sentence indeed I be ready okay go for it nothing beep wait a second there be elevated radiation come from within the area of the cloaking field Levels be climb a lot of activity out here sir I tell you the last thing we need be for this place to turn into the o K Corral GUNS fire or a vice presidential bird hunt hold fire Cease fire you boy want to tell I what you be shoot at we see something move in there hey man you crazy where the hell 's he go turn that thing off help I so you be sure you be okay I be fine Colonel Carter no headache no nausea nothing that might indicate early symptom of sudden onset monsterism I be fine actually you be there be no sign of radiation poisoning no evidence of genetic manipulation I be guess this creature whatever it be require sustain close contact in order to affect its victim 's dna well that be reassure for all of we well we be run some test on it right now but I would like to know more about what actually happen but I would like to know more about what actually happen you say it just appear inside the cloaking field and then it just sit there like a lump the one inside the stomach of the mutate creature be quite active yeah I notice it practically attack I and this one have actually be more active recently in its containment tank I suppose it be possible it be temporarily stun by its transition to our dimension I be sorry well that would explain why the people use the cloak have not be attack by the creature no no I mean the transition to our dimension part the Sodan cloaking device emit an energy field around the wearer that put they slightly out of phase with our normal dimension of space time essentially whoever be in the field be access a pocket of subspace make they virtually undetectable so you think this creature be from an alternate dimension and be essentially bleed through yeah it be definitely possible ancient technology have allow we to see extra dimensional life form before the Sodan be use these device for hundred of year you would think there would at least be a label on the side in bold print that say Beware may cause deadly extra dimensional radioactive monster cause creature to appear or at least Danger would have be nice perhaps the Sodan be not aware of such a flaw in the technology carter it be possible this be not even a problem until we start use the device I think I know why this be happen actually it go straight through Congratulations you be go to be fine what I 've be shoot yeah you have hurt do not it do not worry I have bad I be bleed to death here I need an ambulance yeah I can do that as soon as I find out what you be do run around in the wood with a Sodan cloaking device you be go to let I die I figure you be connect to the Trust be I right order to spy on General Landry myself and SG 1 please just get I to a hospital see obviously you be not a Goa'uld otherwise you would just heal yourself what be you talk about snake snake in people 's head evil snake control their host body with megalomaniac take over the galaxy delusion I know what a Goa'uld be do you know you be work for one that be who be run the trust these day you be crazy man yeah that be what they keep tell I you know they really should give you a personal shield to go with that cloaking device and half a brain we find a car fill with surveillance and recording equipment about half a mile from here I figure the most he learn be that Mitchell be terrible at chess and have some form of sleep apnea what else have you learn well sir the reason the creature be enter our dimension be our fault how be that when we first start use the Sodan device we notice that they emit a significant amount of radiation this be different from the radiation give off by the int dimensional creature yes sir but not unrelated we make modification to shield the radioactive emission in order to make the device safe for human use I be guess there be a practical reason for the radioactive output Dr Redden test the creature for a reaction to the radiation give off by the unshielded cloaking device they be repel by it and the Sodan would have be protect from the radioactivity because of their symbiote exactly which be why they never have this problem we think the radiation be a coincidental byproduct of the technology when it be actually perform a vital function do we have any idea how frequent this dimensional breach might be no sir it appear to be a random occurrence but give how long the Trust operative be use the Sodan device to stay hide I would say that whatever be on the loose in the wood around the cabin be probably a lot bad than a grizzly two hunter dead and now a guy with no ID you want to bring I into the loop here Colonel Guy be in the wrong place at the wrong time got shoot for his trouble bind to happen with all these yahoo run around the wood with gun then why be I not be allow to question he because the Air Force be take over this investigation in the interest of national security that be why so just a grizzly bear huh since when do the Air Force go after a bear in the name of national security there be nothing for you to be concern about Wade thing will be back to normal around here in no time ROARING SHERIFF scream MARINES shouting Damn it MITCHELL so we be talk about a little critter from a different dimension that burrow into a big critter turn he into a rampaging monster in a nutshell Nice how do we find it well I 've calibrate a number of handheld scanner to pick up the creature 's radioactive energy signature we should be able to track it within a 300 meter range we 've also devise a radioactive isotope package that give off an energy wave similar to the one emit by the Sodan cloaking device we be air drop they in a perimeter around the park it should stop the creature from get too far be not that dangerous for we only if you come within 100 meter of the package they have a decay rate that will leave they inert in less than six hour it will be dark soon we can not let this thing get away VALA right so obviously rule number one when hunt savage beast like this be to never actually crawl through the forest look for they especially at night always find a way to lure they to you so I suggest the good plan of attack would be to plant these isotope package here and here or whatever you want you will operate in team of four each team will conduct grid sweep start here no more than 300 meter apart radio contact every 10 minute that be brilliant or you have your order move out but they do not hear the rest of my plan we will call it Plan B this will not work you know all I be say be why not take advantage of my vast experience instead of leave it up to no offense amateur a mighty Jaffa warrior once say the great strategy be doom to fail if there be no army to follow it it be one we be many that be why we will prevail BEEPING excuse I amateur come through RAPID BEEPING I be pick up something two hundred meter north northw MITCHELL ON RADIO Sam what be your 20 we be directly west of you we get a bogey just northeast of your position can you zero in on it get it move on target Colonel Mitchell we have detect the creature MITCHELL Teal'c where be you just south of your position we be all pick up the same target sir Marines secure perimeter all right where the hell be it we should be right on top of it look no creature no matter how vicious be stupid enough to attack a group of this size so trust I we 've probably scare it off Vala what down roaring of course I have be know to be wrong on occasion Holy Hannah do you see that thing do you think we scare it off now no I think we piss it off it be circle we back together we have a contact in the area GROWLING ROARING yeah that be what I call relax GUN fire the hell you do VALA Rule number two never approach a creature assume that it be dead allow I to explain to you a few of my rule all unit this be General Landry the target have be neutralize I repeat the target have be neutralize you know what be strange I have never know a lone creature to behave so aggressively toward a large group Mind you I 've never encounter a radioactive mutant before Sir get down very funny Mitchell this

stupid jackson you realize it be not actually we okay okay it make the character look stupid I mean do you really think the good way to introduce the hero of the story be to show they cause a massive catastrophe that be realistic I do not care come on it will be fun you know you say that about everything come to think of it why be I do this to make sure that the Air Force be be properly represent and because General O'Neill have request you specifically of course he do Jackson how often do we get to give note on a big Hollywood feature script I believe this be intend to be a television movie a fictionalize albeit slightly ridiculous version of Stargate Command be an excellent cover for the real thing in the event of a security leak plausible deniability I be sorry sir do you say slightly ridiculous you be do this you have no choice just give the man five minute I will get you out of this when the time come VALA I 've be look through this and there do not seem to be any mention of a sexy female alien anywhere I be not even in this carter you know the really unbelievable part be that anyone would consider spend million of dollar on this thing I mean seriously all these writer and they could not come up with anything well I do not know I 've be watch a lot of television lately and apart from one glaring omission it do not seem to be that bad maybe we can make it well no I be with Sam on this one I mean who make a movie out of a series that only last three episode it allegedly perform well on dvd no I be not use any shot from the series it be a movie not a clip show the budget be the budget they be a bunch of pencil push bean count idiot you tell they if they do not like it I be go to take it somewhere else you know not to say that last part right yeah movie not clip show be fine yeah I 've get to go yeah your cell coverage be just terrible in here how be it go you do well it certainly seem to be pack full of jam I know I should have give you my first draft the producer bring in the other writer I think you be the producer yeah the real one look just be honest I trust you guy that be why I be here just tell I what you think MARTIN come on you must have some idea do not be afraid just pitch they out we call it spin do not worry no one be go to judge you okay for starter I think you need a strong opening title sequence be you serious no one do that anymore you just throw up the title and get on with it ALARM BLARING ALARM BLARING scream SCREAMING Walter Dial 447 the only way to stop this be to get the device back to the planet scream look no offense but zombie have be do to death no pun intend besides this be science fiction not horror do I mention the Tel'chak device 'cause that be what turn they into zombie MUSICAL cell phone RINGING Sorry go for Marty WHISPERING hey Charlie what be up it be the studio what kind of problem just out of curiosity what be the rest of the team do while your character be fight the zombie MARTIN Son of a bitch Studio executive huh what no Charlie he be a great guy he be the only one I trust so what be the problem then our lead back out how be I suppose to tell a story without my lead character Easy you just bring in a character to replace he what MARTIN you guy have to help I I mean how can I keep the main character in the story without actually have the actor who play he well you could have the other character refer to he all the time maybe get he on the phone once in a while yeah right I mean something cool like face switching or body swap as if anyone would believe that come on you guy must have some real life experience I can draw on well there be that time that Colonel O'Neill be invisible so essentially what I think happen be that you be bombard by the particle field be emanate by the cloaking generator see you be in the engine room stand right next to it when the device be turn on that would account for the minute trace of radiation we 've be pick up from you but the good news be I think I 've find a way to reverse the process we have to go back to the mothership and get the cloaking generator Sam who be you talk to Colonel O'Neill I be just explain to he how we be go to make he visible again no you be not Jack 's in Hammond 's office I can not believe he do that to I again yeah you know get that cloaking generator off that mothership that be go to be the least of our problem now get Jack to help that be go to be the hard part oh do not tell I yes he like be invisible car HORN HONKING CAR horn HONKING engine revving and so by translate this tablet we should be able to determine the most important thing in the universe O'NEILL snore everyone just want to poke around see if you can find he Sir be you there O'NEILL Nope you can not remain this way O'Neill why not it give we an advantage over the Goa'uld I can sneak around all I want totally undetecte I give we the element of surprise the bottom line be I can do more for this planet invisible than I ever could as my own sweet salient self I assume I be stare at you stoically not buy it eh no you be most transparent O'Neill I get it good one I can see right through you do not push it grunt groan grunt O'NEILL hello Hand signal I be wave you over okay I 've make the necessary adjustment all you have to do now be initiate the sequence okay let us do it O'NEILL oh yeah this be well it might feel like kind of a cheat maybe it be good just not to mention the guy at all yeah besides invisibility can be very powerful you might not want to open that can of worm you do not want your hero to become too powerful well you could always invent some negative side effect that be how we talk Colonel O'Neill into become visible again okay that be it SG 1 you be clear to leave thank you MARTIN they can not leave they have not finish read my script that be funny I think it say General on my uniform we owe you one sir you mean another one what be you talk about I think you say it be go to be fun not after his zombie idea got shoot down so where be you guy all off to Someplace pretty important huh it be just a recon mission be not it just a recon mission this be no simple recon mission this be no less than my 200th trip through the gate really you be count you bet teal'c I have be reflect while change into our gear I believe this be far from your 200th mission Colonel Mitchell I do not say 200th mission I say 200th trip through the gate that be count off world gate back and forth pretty much anytime I cross the event horizon yeah this be go to be huge the big 200 INAUDIBLE Fix it quickly I be on it indeed got to go we 've get 10 second before the time dilation field be activate if we do not make it through the gate we will be stick here forever okay this could be a problem that be close huh oh yeah JACKSON be you serious MARTIN what how do we escape they fine they they they how do they escape be not it obvious even if the valley be not fill with Jaffa we could never have make it to the gate and dial out in under 10 second Good see that be why we be here so what do you think 30 second maybe not such a round number how about 38 what difference do it make I mean it be not like you be go to have an actual ticking clock on the screen that be brilliant that be ridiculous trust I jeopardy plus tick clock be box office it be the e MC square of the entertainment world ask any executive except I think you 've replace jeopardy with certain death oh come on you guy have escape situation more dire than this before he have a point so show the actual escape no no no you can not give away too much too early it will step on the end maybe if my character do not say this be a problem he could say something like this should be easy how many time do I have to tell you it be not you Colonel Danning be base on Colonel O'Neill please tell I you have the gate work again we be run another diagnostic but right now we be stump the power 's get through to the capacitor but for some reason the charge be not hold that be cause the control crystal to send feedback into the interface and reset the programming code of the base computer 's dialing protocol whoa that be awesome say that again no oh everybody take five I 've get to get that down before I forget it MARTIN the power get to the flux capacitor but feedback be not feed back into the feedback face this be gold forget about the techno talk no one be really interested in it you be an alien right exactly and I know just what this movie need so how would you know what sci fi fan from Earth would be interested in be not you also an alien yeah but I 've be here quite a while right look I think I know a good story when I hear one do not you want this movie to appeal to a broad range of people from Earth I have all kind of fabulous adventure none of which have be classify by the Air Force okay shoot give I your good one right I be in a steal cargo ship on my way home when a solar flare from a nearby star wreak havoc with my navigation system and I be force to crash land on the near planet in a bizarre twist of fate I crash right on top of the Goa ' uld who rule that planet which be fortunate because my ship be too badly damage to repair and I need help the local villager be very grateful they introduce I to a lovely fair haired Tok'ra who have be hide out on the planet she tell I the legend of a powerful Ascended being who supposedly live in some distant far off mountain through a treacherous forest look I do not have all day cut to the chase all right I meet up with a number of my friend along the way and after a dangerous and eventful journey we finally come face to face with the Ascended be what can I do for you well at first I think I just want to go home but now I 've decide I would quite like to be a part of something a regular part if you catch my drift oh and these guy have their own issue Boys that be the Wizard of Oz oh you 've see that one yeah oh that be my phone Martin Lloyd I do not hear it re it be on vibrate MARTIN yes go ahead I can sing so how be it go not well Samantha 200 be wait right now I be just hope we have not do something to permanently damage the gate how can something work perfectly fine for 10 year then all of a sudden it do not work anymore I do not know okay try it now we be get some strange power reading here Colonel Shut it down it be not respond the gate 's drawing massive amount of energy into its capacitor close the blast door and the iris I can not shut it down Siler manually cut the power scream why do this always happen to I Sir we have to evacuate the base this be General Landry I be declare a code red emergency all personnel evacuate the base immediately ALARM BLARING Sir the capacitor be overload we have to get out of here now hurry and that be the end of act two the mountain blow up no possible hope for survival Cool huh I just write it base on what be go on with the gate I love it when art imitate life Hang on we be alive in the next scene oh I just have not fix that part yet I be think I can back sell it and say you be beam out at the last second JACKSON beam out Sure why not be that not too convenient MARTIN not if you hang a lantern on it what be that it be a writer 's term another character point out how convenient it be Dr Levant can say well that be great timing that way the audience know I intend for it to be convenient and we move on really okay where be we Scene 24 oh great one of my favorite scene go ahead VALA clear THROAT Interior Bridge VALA the crew man their station I be pick up a strange energy

be not go to know the difference they love weapon at maximum never underestimate your audience they be generally sensitive intelligent people who respond positively to quality entertainment teal'c I do not understand why everything in this script must inevitably explode MARTIN look you guy may all know how thing really work out there in the galaxy but I know the film business explosion make great trailer simple fact More explosion well trailer simple fact More explosion well trailer well trailer more viewer MUSICAL cell phone RINGING yeah go for Marty oh hey Nora what that be ridiculous tell

this to be more accurate why do not you just give he your mission file they be classify so do not you say that no one on your planet would believe this be all real anyway even still do you know how many mission file there be MITCHELL 1 263 hopefully 64 by the end of the day actually it be 1 264 already no it be 63 pretty sure I 've read all the file recently actually you have not read 30185 30185 what be that we can not tell you what do you mean you can not tell I I have the high security clearance know to mankind what be 30185 we be swear to secrecy well why even mention it to I if you

till a year later actually it be nine month before he be bear what you have to remember it be the ' 60 JACKSON come on you have to have know that Jack 's always take an interest in your life Jack O'Neill indeed carter do you remember when you be choose for the 302 program even though you do not think you should get in how about when you be choose for SG 1 wait be you say that Jack O'Neill be my daddy all start to make sense now be not it oh I be be punke be not I we honestly can not tell you about 30185 we honestly can not tell you about 30185 MARTIN I can not believe it the whole cast hear Marlowe be hold out for more money and now they be all join in where do they think it come from how be I suppose to do a movie without any actor MITCHELL Carter correct I if I be wrong on this but be it not a fact of parallel dimension physic that each of we exist somewhere in some universe in whatever way shape or form we can imagine any way shape or form we can imagine we 've see it for ourselves there you go use your imagination all right people we create this multi billion dollar facility under Cheyenne Mountain so that we can use this thing anyone know how Sir we think you know I do know this we need to put together a team start with the most beautiful battle ready scientific genius I know Captain Doctor Samantha Carter report for duty sir what can you tell we Captain well at first glance I suspect the device create a stable wormhole between superconducte ring that have be place in fix position elsewhere in the galaxy convert matter into energy at the event horizon once the initial vortex have subside of course and just because my sex organ be on the inside instead of the outside do not mean that I can not handle provide of course that sufficient energy have be channel to the device and that the correct coordinate have be calculate okay get to it Next we need a bookworm adventurer who can say brain and gut in 27 language Dr Daniel Jackson why have I be bring here this be not what be that the reason you be here Doctor this big ring be discover in the sand of Egypt near Giza then I be right the pyramid really be land site for interplanetary starship that enslave primitive human population by pose as their god well we find the ring in the sand these symbol they look familiar they be like constellation do not you see here if each symbol represent a specific point in space then six of they would create a sort of box the intersection point between those six point would indicate a destination maybe just maybe the seventh mark the starting point be there a monitor that show these symbol in detail over here Dr Jackson wait this one seem different you find the ring in Egypt the pyramid represent Earth this symbol have to be the point of origin it be under our nose the whole time I feel so stupid and now what this team need be a leader someone who will laugh in the face of his enemy even when it be inappropriate Colonel Jack O'Neill I think I tell you I retire I think you say you be tired well as a matter of fact I be a little tired there be no time for that now you have a mission to lead right Sergeant make it spin Spin Sir it do not spin what it have to spin it be round Spinning be so much cool than not spin I be the General I want it to spin now yes sir hey look at that HARRIMAN Chevron one be light up I wonder what we be go to find on the other side whatever it be I will bet it be amazing well do not get too excited it be just a simple recon be not you the least bit curious about what be out there well I be just hope we find some new meat for the team preferably something bald mysterious you know the warrior type with lot of you know muscle Sir the odd against any alien life form we encounter look remotely human be astronomical yeah well we will see we will see Chevron seven also light up Holy Colonel O'Neill you have a go Godspeed Easy for he to say okay we be all go to do this together on three all right okay okay one two three dear God in heaven SIGHS I feel so stupid laughing yeah that will work a whole movie make with puppet hey I be just say MARTIN maybe we can have puppet O'Neill jump over a puppet shark on a one third scale motorcycle I do not get it look you do not know the business like I do I do not have any money so I have to give the actor something else big trailer I can not afford that either no I have to give they something that cost I nothing but no actor can refuse and what be that a good ego stroke I have to make they think that I re write the script just for they in this draft there have to be something that make they want to do this movie even if it be for scale you know we 've be try here you be not listen I be talk about a twist something nobody be expect o'neill you mean something like this wow I do not think anyone will see that come no but there will be spoiler be you kid Lt'll be in the commercial ANNOUNCER ON TV when it come to fight crime there be only one

old orifice what we call it that sometimes do not we Orifice stupid focus group they hate the end I have to think of something new they could go fishing Fishing yeah it would be the perfect ending I

nice job everybody so do you ever think a show like this would go on for 200 well sure what do you mean a show like this MUSICAL cell phone RINGING Martin Lloyd yeah be you kid hey everybody guess what the movie be back on all CHEERING ten season seven Saturn Awards for Best Cable or Syndication Science Fiction Show who would have guess I think first and foremost it have to do you know with the writing I mean obviously we do not take ourselves too seriously the writer be really great guy all of they Men you know yeah it be a bit of a boy ' club the real challenge be come up with a good catch phrase it be what I do it be what I do that be so you know good it define Colonel Danning I just do not think they know what they want to do with my character I probably should have take up golf a long time ago just just kid and I need something even well to make you forget about the guy that fan love to watch for the first seven year of the show I know he be here for eight but you know a lot of people say he just kind of phone it in that last season yeah well that be ancient history we do not talk about that around here the fact of the matter be I do not really even know what happen there you know to I it never feel like I be leave the show I just need a little space a little time you know I want to get back to my root Theater right so I go to New York do a little Broadway off off Broadway either way it do not matter act you know act without have people hurl papi mâché boulder at you all BLEEP Day it be great you know I like they both I like boulder I be fine with that this production run like a well oil machine and sure that start from the top but I mean we all love the show the gaffer the lighting guy the medic the makeup and the caterer it be like a family the writer be try to come up with a catch phrase I can get behind that be something we try for a while anyway I mean I would actually like to do some writing maybe have a baby EX CLAIMS it just hit I Sweet BLEEPING and we can get away with that too because it be cable you can not get there without the fan right I have to thank they I 've get to thank specifically the one oh God what be it call SaveDrLevant Com have you see the site I mean it be insane apparently they get dozen of hit a month whatever I think that be a lot but between they and the ad in Variety that they put out I be pretty sure that go a long way towards convince the producer to take I back have I to invite I back it be not their decision you know they call say hey do you want it you know and I be ready what I think really make this show what it be be the chemistry with the cast MUSICAL cell phone RINGING yeah oh could you hold on stop the tape who do he think he be well you tell that ungrateful little BLEEP Bag to shove it up his BLEEP yeah yeah let he try to get a job that pay this much you be not roll be okay what what be I say oh yes the cast Holy BLEEPING that would be like a 19 that be it you be good all right can I get my BLEEP sandwich please all right hey thank man Science fiction be an existential metaphor that allow we to tell story about the human condition Isaac Asimov once say individual science fiction story may seem as trivial as ever to the blinder critic and philosopher of today but the core of science fiction its essence have become crucial to our salvation if we be to be save at all NARRA TOR previously on Stargate SG 1 be not Daniel tell I about a very powerful weapon in the hand of the Jaffa on Dakara it be not a weapon technically but we do adapt it to destroy the Replicators wait where be you go I want to see can I hold she she be my baby why she will be the beacon of light in the darkness to the warrior of the Ori she will lead we to glorious victory wait wait wait we be talk about a baby here right she be be genetically alter she will be a fully grow figurehead in a day or so leave I grab she oh yeah like that be go to happen six more world have fall to the Ori accord to those who witness the battle the enemy be lead by a young woman of extraordinary power Mark this day for the darkness of your world have be lift so the light of Origin may shine upon it all cheer you have cast aside the shackle of the past to welcome a bright future now hear the word of the Orici it be Adria the unbeliever amongst you seek to hinder our message they take up arm in an attempt to suppress the truth but they fail and be vanquish a reminder to all that Origin can not be extinguish it will flourish throughout this world and countless other the believer amongst you have be richly reward with truth with Origin it be now up to you to help other see as you have see to spread the message by join the army of the Ori Sir I be pick up an energy reading come from the surface of the planet what be it it be a wave of radiation sir emanating from the gate spread fast get they out of there all MURMURING man they be back on deck what happen that be what we be try to figure out Sir I be not pick up any life sign on the planet that be impossible what be it a sensor malfunction all system be operate normally there be thousand of people on that planet carter he be right we be not pick up anything Vala wait look we 've still do not know what happen down there they be all dead Daniel that be what happen I be sorry what for well believe it or not I know how you feel Adria be your daughter and even though she be Relief that be what I feel Relief what you do not think I would want to be responsible for the enslavement of an entire galaxy do you it be hardly your fault I know she be the will of the Ori even before she be bear I could have do something about it but I do not she be your child Maternal instinct can only excuse so much of course I do tell myself that my relationship with she might prove to be an advantage that at some point some critical moment I might be able to reach she in a way that no one else could and you might have be right I be just relieve I will never have to find out for sure HARRIMAN unschedule offworld activation Chief receive Bra'tac 's IDC sir open the iris Bra'tac what bring you by a matter that threaten million of life EMERSON ON RADIO Lieutenant Evans report there be no sign of residual radiation sir no chemical or biological agent in the atmosphere the place be clean the weird thing be whatever it be it only seem to have target living tissue 'cause everything else be leave behind you say the wave emanate from the stargate that be right from there it spread over the entire surface of the planet before dissipate what we know of only one device that would operate in such a manner the council be convince our only hope for survival against the army of the Ori be to attack they use the ancient device on Dakara the same device we use to wipe out the Replicators except that now it strike with new purpose to unmake live being hour ago the first target be strike a planet we already know about it SG 1 be there do recon they be beam out before your weapon could hit they the villager be not so lucky that be tragic it be mass murder why the hell do not you do something about it our new leader Se'tak have convince the council that this be our only hope for survival the more I speak out against it the more isolated I become I need to contact the Odyssey let they know what be happen and then I need to meet this man myself I be ashamed that my brother have utilize these method they be desperate there be no honor Freedom without honor be meaningless what be do be do and there be still an opportunity here we 've get an Ori ship sit on the ground unmanned and unguarde we must act quickly you know your way around this tub all the corridor look the same I have not get my bearing yet there have to be some sort of control room I be guess it will be in one of the forward section we 've get a lot of ground to cover time to split up can I ask you a question just the fact you have to ask I to ask I make I think I should say no back on the Odyssey you say you know how I feel what do you mean what well with Adria you say believe it or not I know how you feel what do you mean JACKSON yeah ten year ago my wife be take as host by a Goa'uld the framed picture on the wall in your office be that her yeah her name be Sha're we be marry for just over a year when she be take I swear I would get she back what happen I join SG 1 and search for she for over two year but in the end I could not save she for a long time I feel guilty that I would fail she and now now I can at least draw comfort from the fact that she be no long suffer at the hand of the Goa'uld I guess in a small way I feel relieved as well wow check this out I be no expert but this look important it appear to be a power generation chamber exactly which have I think it could be a good place to drop a little c4 it would be our good opportunity to disable the vessel should it be necessary just in case we can not get this thing fly before the Ori come back we win one for the home team while we be haul ass for the gate a great Jaffa once say Exalted be the warrior who achieve victory without battle win show strength win without fighting show true skill you be a student of ancient strategy no Landry say it to I I think he be quote Sun Tzu or it could have be Dr Phil LANDRY I 've already advise the Pentagon that I be head offworld I may be a while with all due respect sir you think you might consider take along a few Marines this be a diplomatic mission Chief the last time I check the Jaffa be our ally I can not go disrespect they in their own house Lf you say so sir sometimes you make the right decision sometimes you make the decision right Patton that one 's Dr Phil now if you will excuse I Bra'tac be wait guy I think I 've find something jackson ON RADIO what do you get carter I think it might be the bridge and it look like the main command interface be a chair similar to the weapon platform in Antarctica it would make sense that the technology would be similar to the Ancients Vala you say most of the people on board the ship be simple villager right yes why I think it be likely the prior who be fly the ship unfortunately that probably mean the chair be key to their unique brain physiology MITCHELL do not sweat it Plan B be in place okay let us not jump the gun just yet at the very least I would like to try to get some information out of this database before we start blow thing up I hear you Sam but it will not be long before the Ori come back for this ship and we be not go to let they FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING Cam Cam what be happen not much but we 've get ourselves some company I be Bo'rel of the free Jaffa and we have come to lay claim to this vessel slow down brother we be here first CARTER Cam report it be all right Sam just a little misunderstanding with some of our Jaffa friend go back to work there be no misunderstanding we achieve this victory therefore we claim the spoil what you have do be sacrifice the life of thousand of innocent no one be innocent who join with my enemy they be invade by an army with massively superior firepower they should have resist so die at the hand of the Ori or die at the hand of the Jaffa some choice what be that enough of this the ship be ours now lower your weapon that be not go to happen Colonel Mitchell Sam we 've get trouble Odyssey this be Carter request immediate extraction do it Major something 's wrong I can not get a lock on they Odyssey what be happen EMERSON we be get too much signal degradation for a successful beam out as far as I can tell the malfunction be not come from this end guy we 've get a problem the Odyssey can not beam we out why not well I be not 100 sure but I think I may have activate the shield why would you do that it be not intentional oh can you reverse it I will give it a try EMERSON SG 1 this be Odyssey Three Hatak vessel be move into position around the planet do not chance it Odyssey we can not risk lose another ship all right be advise that we be leave range to avoid detection get we out of here copy that the Ori it turn out be not invincible this first strike against they must be consider nothing less than a complete success BRA'TAC but at what cost leave we unable to gather support from your fellow Jaffa you dishonor yourself by seek it elsewhere I be honor General Hank Landry the Tau'ri your people be piss your use of this ancient device violate our prior agreement an agreement make with the former leadership that I no long feel bind to so you be go to have your people go back on their word Much have change since my predecessor consent to that agreement we now face an enemy powerful enough to have render our conventional weapon useless your force have prove equally ineffective this device be our only mean of strike back at they which include slaughter innocent people if future attack against army of the Ori allow we to recover enough of their ship we will then have a powerful fleet with which to strike back against they but until then this device be our only option incidental genocide be not an option grant the cost of victory be great but the cost of defeat would be even great FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING all right all right groan where be the rest of your team Colonel Mitchell I do not know what you be talk about you be speak with a female right she be back at the village probably go through the gate by now you be lie this be a message to all Tau'ri on board this vessel my name be Bo'rel my brother and I have take this ship in the name of all free Jaffa we have Teal'c and Colonel Mitchell in custody Surrender now and no harm will come to they if you do not identify yourself immediately we will have no choice but to assume your intention be hostile in which case we will deal with the prisoner harshly so be it Bo'rel this be Daniel Jackson of Stargate Command listen there be no reason we should be fight each other we should be work together I be afraid that would not be possible look we be deal with some very advanced technology and we have some experience that might be useful you doubt our ability to fly this ship I be just say there be not a lot of time and it would be in everyone 's good interest if we pool our resource my order be to take this ship and all on board you will reveal your location to I now ELECTRIC buzzing that will not be necessary JAFFA Bo'rel we have they well do hold they until our patrol find the control room you be make a big mistake More Ori ship will be here soon then they will suffer the same fate ADRIA I think not ADRIA I think not CHOCKING Adria hello Mother okay we all know darling that you have telekinetic power you can stop show off now I 've miss you Mother they say I should forget about you that you have abandon I because you do not care no I know you would come back for I how be it that you be even alive everyone else on the planet be kill I be save by this it hold a piece of the holy city of Celestis it protect I keep I safe soon the other ship will come for we and once we be back with the fleet I promise you Mother we will never be separate again there be some who hold the Tau'ri in great esteem for the assistance they provide we against the Goa'uld I be guess you be not one of they while I recognize the contribution make I question the motive I suspect it have more to do with self preservation than generosity we have a common enemy and as much as the Tau'ri would have we believe that we could not have defeat the Goa'uld without they I know well what be this device have not get a clue I will not ask you again Nope still nothing yes find out what be happen listen we be not rejoin the fleet you be come with I no I can not abandon my army it be not your army of course it be well as your mother I be put my foot down you be too young to have your own army they look to I for guidance for protection and for answer tell I what happen to my people here on this planet no do not he do not know anything Adria panting you have a strong mind wake up Jaffa welcome back now tell I what happen to the believer who come to spread Origin to this world Yours be a backward people too primitive to have create such an effective weapon so tell I how do it come into your hand where be it stop do not interfere Mother where Jaffa I do not know you know how to use one of those thing well piece of cake where be the weapon Dakara BONE CRACKING Dakara if you continue to use this weapon in violation of our previous agreement our alliance be in jeopardy and what do this alliance do to benefit the Jaffa if it be not for the Tau'ri we would still be slave to the Goa'uld that be in the past now we face a much more dangerous enemy and every day while we lose ground to the Ori the Tau'ri homeworld remain curiously untouched we be the one fight this battle we be the one die by the thousand and yet you choose to test your new toy on a human world not on one of a dozen Jaffa planet that have fall to the Ori why be that exactly this discussion be over carter the Odyssey try to beam we out of here but somehow the shield have be activate at first I think it be something I have do but after check the control I realize it be not I MITCHELL there be someone else on board three mother ship be in orbit over the planet the Odyssey have to retreat in order to avoid be detect teal'c then the stargate be our only mean of escape Jackson Vala come in MITCHELL if you can hear I we be get the hell out of Dodge too late Sam I do not know I need you to rally your supporter find out who be on side and who you can trust in the meantime I be what be the meaning of this we just receive word the Ori ship have take flight I might be able to override primary system from the control room Scans be detect no transmitter signal on the surface of the planet be it possible SG 1 escape through the gate well if they have Stargate Command would have give we the head up by now no it be more likely they be still on that ship Sir if that be the case and it be on its way to rendezvous with the rest of the Ori fleet we 've lose they maybe not we still may have a shot at rescue SG 1 provide that ship be head where I think it be Major set a course for Dakara the Ori ship destroy three Hatak vessel before jump into hyperspace I be sorry to hear that the Jaffa on the planet report no gate activity no other ship in the vicinity nor be there any survivor after the initial attack not a single soldier of the Ori be leave alive what be your point the only other people on board that ship be from Stargate Command you can not possibly think the Tau'ri be responsible for this what other explanation be there we be not in the habit of conduct sneak attack on our ally however much we may disagree with their tactic you be jealous of the power we command through the ancient device you seek to redress that balance by take the Ori ship when the Hatak stand in your way they be sweep aside se'tak this be madness we shall see guard they MITCHELL here be a question who be fly this boat I know Tomin will be happy to see you again Tomin 's alive he be not on the planet with you no I 've be travel with various ship as the leader of this great enlightenment it be important that I make my presence know especially now when the first inroad be be make once the rest of the fleet arrive I will have a much hard time of it how many other ship be come many many more by my estimation the galaxy will be convert within the year Jackson come in Jackson Vala can you hear I we be go to have to go out there and look for they Sam I will keep at it well at least it be not rain I do not know why you be complain you should be delight as the mother of the Orici you will be revere by all the follower of Origin while I appreciate the celebrity status I have to admit it would get very tiresome very quickly especially if I have to perform for the masse I be not very good with crowd there will be no demand make on you all you have to do be accept Origin into your heart that could be a problem perhaps at first but eventually you will embrace the truth I do not think so you be my mother if I be unable to convince you how can I be expect to sway the countless world in this galaxy until I have bring you into the fold my mission here be a failure I can be very stubborn then I will be patient and very determined what about all the other people that refuse to bow down to the will of the Ori be you go to show they the same courtesy there be a limit to my patience and there be a difference between devotion and blind submission you can not expect to win the faith of your follower through fear and intimidation what would you have I do give people a choice I be try to bring an entire galaxy from darkness into light in order to do that all doubt must be remove or it will spread like a cancer it be that simple this be get a little old do not you think you will turn this ship back immediately Love to unfortunately we be not the one fly it you lie would you accuse I of lie as well we be unaware of who be in control of this vessel but suspect they may be on board with we we in fact share a common enemy Whatever be between we we can finish that later right now we have to re take this ship that be more like it Adria listen to I I be sorry Mother the time for talk be over we 've arrive be that what I think it be be that what I think it be Dakara my suspicion have be confirm what be you talk about the Ori ship have arrive you would try to force we to give up the ancient device rather than have we wield its power I be tell you my people be not responsible for this we will gather our fleet and lie siege to your world we will take back the Ori ship and avenge our fall brother you do not think that whoever be fly this boat be on a friendly trip do you no I neither with the engine activate there may be a significantly great reaction to the C4 the ship may well be destroy yeah I be think the same thing we must not allow this ship to launch an attack right Colonel Mitchell just try to think of some appropriate last word what happen nothing yeah I know why not you should thank I I just save your life what be you talk about grunt EMERSON ON RADIO SG 1 this be Odyssey do you read Odyssey this be Colonel Carter we be go to try and beam you out of there it will not work the shield be still active I be try to shut it down please stand ready the weapon be capable of fire through a gate but it be also capable of release a wave that will encompass this world and beyond wipe out all life form on any ship that happen to be in planetary orbit we will be perfectly safe here within this shielded chamber you will survive to bear witness the Jaffa have finally take their rightful place as a true power in this galaxy JACKSON it will not be that easy why would not it be I be about to destroy the only real threat against we you be forget about someone what about the ancient you know as well as I do they will never get involve we have free rein in this galaxy Adria listen to I I promise to stay with you I will hear you out on the whole Origin thing I will even try and keep an open mind just let everyone else go it be too late for they but do not worry I will be keep he alive we have plan for you we be ready my people may be on board that ship not for much long fire the weapon Odyssey we be good to go get they the hell out of there yes sir now what happen the weapon appear to have have no effect EXPLOSION Come come the area be evacuate the gate be unguarde Fire again fire the weapon there be news a cargo ship dispatch to the area have report complete and utter devastation Dakara be no more meanwhile we receive word that five more planet have fall to the Ori include Hebridan and Langara so far we have not hear anything from our ally on either world we be get our ass whoop and it look like that Merlin device be the only shot we have at stop they then find it dismiss the council be in disarray the Jaffa nation be fracture and without Dakara to bring we all together I fear everything we have fight for all these year will be lose the war be not over old friend if only I could have do more to oppose se'tak there be nothing to be gain by second guess yourself can not remake the past so look ahead

ATHENA I apologize for that the surgery be perform in a move car they be more concerned about remove the subcutaneous transmitter than be gentle about it do I know you you do a long time ago Qetesh the Goa'uld that once occupy your body be a rival of mine she be a very intelligent adversary which be why I eventually decide to partner with she in retrospect it be also the reason I should have be more careful about trust her VALA as the host to her Goa'uld I be an unwilling participant in many of Qetesh 's thoughtless action so if this be a revenge thing your anger be well misplace this be not a revenge thing oh this be a search for answer my position in the Trust have afford I considerable resource GROANING ever since I hear that you join Stargate Command I 've be watch and wait for an opportunity which finally present itself tonight what exactly do you want from I the code to an ancient tablet that I help Qetesh locate long ago a treasure map of sort she be suppose to share it with I but instead decide to keep it for herself from what I understand she be never able to decipher it I would like that opportunity to be honest it do not ring a bell so that be because you 've suppress many of the detail from your time as Qetesh the full genetic memory of the Goa'uld would drive your inferior human mind insane Luckily we have this device to help we find what we be look for this will take a while I will leave you to it then we 've get the local authority search the area and conduct interview with every possible witness so far they 've come up empty General there be no question the Trust be behind her disappearance I mean they be the only one with the resource capable of pull something like this off agree I 've already put a call through to Agent Barrett he be get his people

down Damn maybe they will have well luck at the other location cover the door right GROANING GASPS it be all right we be here to help CARTER four out of the five safe house we hit be empty only one it turn out be still in play and that be SG 15 's we lose they and three member of the local team one Trust operative survive the explosion with minor injury he confirm that the place be rig to blow in the event it be storm he also confirm that Vala be be hold at that location so it be possible they move she before the place be raid Unlikely they would not have have the time besides the guy we catch claim he see Vala make a run for it then she could 've get out on her own if that be the case why have she not yet attempt to contact we JACKSON so what do you want with her I mean what exactly be go on in that warehouse look I already tell you I can not say it be not that I do not want to help you but right now I be more concerned for my well be we can protect you no you can not okay he be all

I can do something to help you Jackson how be it go well from what we learn from the Trust operative and the information provide to we from the Jaffa and the Tok'ra this be what I 've be able to piece together so far Athena the greek goddess of war a k a Charlotte Mayfield a k a the Goa'uld responsible for kidnap Vala now accord to what I 've learn she be a minor player who rise to mid tier status by pursue alliance with more powerful rival Cronos Camulus Svarog and even Anubis when he be first on the out with the System Lords so her partnering up with Ba'al be just her late power play no it be more than that you see we know Athena be once ally with Qetesh the Goa'uld that formerly inhabit Vala see apparently Qetesh double cross she when they partner up to search for the Clava Thessara Infinitas the key to infinite treasure now accord to legend it will allow he who possess it entry to a vast storehouse of rich hide away by the Ancients prior to their ascension wow that be big yeah and by all indication nothing but an elaborate hoax so they do not find it no but for some reason Qetesh want Athena to think she have Athena believe she which be why she go after Vala and she use Ba'al 's resource here on Earth to get she which remind I I be suppose to check in with Major Harper he be get people query hospital in the area where Vala disappear it be possible she may have be injure and have be unable to contact we hey listen I speak with the medical examiner 's office they be do dna testing on the remain recover at the blast site but it be go to take a while you know when Vala first disappear when the Ori gate be destroy I refuse to write she off although the odd be against it I believe somehow she would find a way to survive and it turn out I be right I want to be right again sure I just figure you should know yeah thank you Major Harper please I do not care what the so call expert have to say I want you to free up the capital and move it into a company call Beringer Consolidated I have it on good authority that they will be announce a major breakthrough before week 's end all right the dna result be in they be able to ID 12 victim none of they our girl my guess be there be not enough of she left to run test on or there be not anything leave because she do not die in that explosion if she get out she would 've go straight back to Stargate Command they would not still be look for her I do not know maybe you be right maybe she be dead but until we have confirmation I want you to keep look for she too CLEARING THROAT okay dead cow on a turban

there be not a lot I can do all right I will be honest with you the reason why I can not tell you who I be be because I do not know I do not remember I do not know where I be from I be not even sure if Val be my real name my memory only go as far back as that day two week ago when I wander into the deli for a lunch I could not pay for I do not remember any of my life before that although I do have flashback occasionally they be terrify like something out of a horror movie but they do not make much sense I be hope that soon or later my memory would just come back or that something would help remind I of who I really be but after what happen today I be not sure I want to know anymore you know Val it would be a lot easy if you would just be honest with I I be Colonel Carter I be here to take custody of the prisoner Prisoner would you mind tell I what this be all about the government have be look for Miss Mal Doran for a while now RYAN why what do she do WOMAN I be sorry Detective

what be you do check to see if I still have both of my kidney Vala what the hell be go on here you know I yeah of course why you do not remember I I do not remember much of anything least of all who I be or why everyone be after I that be why I bring you here you be go to supply I with some much need answer you know maybe we should call the rest of the team they be generally well at answer okay here go your name be Vala Mal Doran you be a member of Stargate Command a top secret facility locate beneath Cheyenne Mountain it be the command center for a military organization responsible for off world exploration and reconnaissance by mean of a device know as a Stargate a portal which allow near instantaneous transport between planet how be I do so far not good I know it sound crazy but it be the truth okay so we be space explorer well technically I and my team be the explorer you be just along for the ride because well you be not originally from this planet you be an alien and I mean that in the nice possible way you know when you say alien people think green skin four eye tentacle what have you but the reality be very very different I be borrow some more money look take you for example you be human Hell you be more human than most of my neighbor especially that guy in 304 I will be back look since you be part of the team maybe you should think about will not be long trust I or un cuff I or give I my pant back okay just wait right here I will be right back well he be of no help all he remember be the gun then he be off to the race Presumably you be search for the miss vehicle we 've get all available unit look in the meantime it turn out the deceased in that overturn sedan be all carry phony ID the license plate be also bogus as for the car itself it be a company vehicle register to a Forsythe Chemicals but that be a dead end because apparently they report the car miss this morning of course they do MOBILE PHONE RINGING Carter all right thank you we 've get a lock on Cam 's transmitter thank you Detective yeah sure any time okay I think I 've figure out what happen to you why you do not remember anything oh good do it involve an alien abduction well in as much as that you be an alien who be abduct yes you be undergo a procedure which be design to dig up some of your suppress memory the scientist that we capture tell we that during the procedure the device be destroy which allow you the opportunity to escape from the alien no they be not alien they be work for an alien but that be not really important Vala be not a particularly alien name so I be think that this device be in the middle of dig up these suppress memory when it overload and fry your brain so instead of help you remember it actually make you forget Everything Disodium guanylate that would make a great alien name do not you think I can understand why you might be have difficulty believe what I be tell you but there be one thing you can not deny there be some very very bad people after you and how do I know you be not one of they because I save you from they what if they be try to save I from you how be I suppose to know let I take you back to Stargate Command we have a device that can help you remember I think you say the device be destroy it be a different device it be one I bring back from another planet last year oh good be they have a sale Understood we intercept a communication from Stargate Command they find he turn around this be not what it look like man chatter ON police RADIO what nothing I just think it be funny how you be always lose your

previously on Stargate SG 1 BRA'TAC all you have to do be prick he once the effect will be immediate he will believe you to be his loyal slave Jarren whoa no violence your name Cam Mitchell Bounty hunter do not worry about SG 1 and Earth they be of little consequence approach the coordinate now sir drop we out of hyperspace Maximum shield Colonel we should have a visual if the second supergate be here we should be able to see it EMERSON anything on the sensor there seem to be a powerful gravitational field nearby supergate use black hole for power oh this be not a black hole it be a neutron star and the field be powerful enough to weaken our shield and cause Damage report report hull damage on deck two and seven Battle station get we out of here Major Hyperdrive will not engage Hull integrity have be compromise who the hell be shoot at us MARKS I can not tell sir detect three ship Ori base on size I would say Goa'uld mother ship their shield should be weaken as well fire all forward rail gun Arm missile major transfer auxiliary power to sublight engine and set a course hard right Sir detect multiple small object dead ahead oh my God it be a minefield full reverse thrust Damage report EMERSON Marks Emergency subspace communication from the Odyssey sir Put it onscreen Stargate Command this be Colonel Paul Emerson of the Odyssey authentication code delta six alpha five we be under attack we 've suffer extreme damage Intel about the second supergate be false we 've be ambush by as many as three Goa ' uld mother ship we 've lose hyperdrive shield be down several deck without life support we be be board that be it sir that be all we get we begin receive telemetry from the emergency transponder approximately 30 minute after the distress call come in unfortunately it do not tell we anything about the condition of the ship or the crew sound like it be badly damage anything on who might have be behind this we be act on what we think be reliable intel from the Jaffa bra'tac be investigate the source of the false intel but the Jaffa nation be in disarray and many have revert back to old war faction trace such betrayal may prove virtually impossible there must be a lot of Jaffa out there who be pretty angry about the destruction of Dakara the Ori be responsible for that and there be more than a few who think it be we who lead they there angry enough to set up an ambush for what revenge well we have a signal let us go check it out yeah one tiny snag there we have no vessel in which to travel the Daedalus be on its way to Pegasus and it will be day before a Jaffa ship become available to we well you only have to ask you must know by now that I can get you pretty much anything you want yeah for a price nothing come for free Daniel of course in this instance I would naturally waive my fee but I will need some front money so to speak be careful we still have no idea who be behind this CREW CHATTERING Glad to see you be awake Colonel How be your head it be fine sir what be our status they tow we out of the minefield Most of the crew be account for we be still miss three which one of you be Colonel Samantha Carter I be Colonel Paul Emerson commander of this ship if you have any question you ask if any of you try to be hero I assure you my commander will think nothing of vent this hold of all atmosphere I will not ask again I be Carter bring she he too Colonel Carter I have hear you be quite attractive I be Colonel Paul Emerson commander of this ship what do you want nothing you can do for I now Colonel Carter on the other hand can I call you Samantha no you be Lucian Alliance CHUCKLES the uniform Pathetic be not it pretend to be something we be not Anateo be my name and believe I I be part of no alliance of any kind now we do not know much about this ship yet but we have find a subspace beacon that be give away our position I need you to shut it off I be not go to help you I do not see what choice you have you be go to do whatever it be I want you to do do not do it Sam oh I suggest you should do it Sam it be not design to be shut off it activate automatically and stay on then remove it do not help they Colonel that be an order anateo I believe that now make you the ranking officer on this ship Colonel Carter I suggest you get to work unless there be something else you would rather do yeah she be a real beauty stabilizer be a bit wonky I be afraid make for a bumpy ride but it be all perfectly safe really CRASHING not exactly we give you as much raw naquadah as you need and all you come up with be this piece of junk People 's life be at stake Daniel do you honestly think that I cheape out on the ship and pocket the difference ALARM sound what be that life support seem to be fail can you take over Great you fix that how about fix the stabilizer I do not fix anything I just disable that annoying alarm our long range sensor indicate that the signal come from the Odyssey transponder be change location it be move teal'c it appear to be travel at sublight speed alter course to intercept be you cloak I be attempt to it do not appear the cloak be respond the signal now appear to be originate from that planet sensor be pick up numerous life sign if life support be compromise they could have land the ship for repair they be not respond to our hail there appear to be a small civilization on the surface I know I recognize this planet More friend of yours the Goa'uld use to have a shipbuilding facility here it be now be take over by the former human slave from what I know they have tie with the Lucian Alliance you know that do not sound too good we talk chop shop here I have a contact here he might get skittish if we all show up so it could be a good idea for I to go in alone you know it could be a trap all the more reason why we should not all go trust I if he know anything I will be able to get it out of he but the key be to be as inconspicuous and as non threaten as possible if you like I can take Daniel Colonel what happen you 've be go for hour where be Colonel Emerson BORZIN Vala Mal Doran never think you would show your face in these part again Borzin you slimy two face grease peddler come on give we a hug groan and what poor loser have you con into your company this time oh this be my apprentice Seamus you must be learn a great deal More than I would like to actually I only take he on as part of a bet he be mentally disabled BORZIN do not trust she she will sell you out for a bad lunch the first chance she get I know he like I be not that cute what do you want Vala if you have not already steal it from I we be look for some information about a tau'ri ship that be attack not far from here any information you can give we okay my friend here be the thing he be not my apprentice he be a mark no a very rich very gullible one who be eat right out of my hand give we something anything and he will make it very much worth your while you know I 've hear that before all right try this we trace the signal from the ship 's emergency transponder here I know you can not possibly have the whole ship but I know you must have some part Borzin I do not know what be go on but you be in way over your head I 've recently make some contact high up in the Lucian Alliance that would be very interested in know exactly how much you 've be skim off this operation wow offer that can not be refuse over here while we be at it why do not we get he to throw in some part for our cargo ship one thing at a time be this what you be look for that be Odyssey 's data recorder the transponder 's still broadcast where do you get this a man bring it a few hour ago he say it could fetch I a very nice price BEEPING Anateo be my name and believe I I be part of no alliance of any kind tape fast forwarding carter it be not design to be shut off it activate automatically and stay on ANA TEO then remove it EMERSON do not help they Colonel that be an order GUN FIRES you want more show I the naquadah you know that thing be useless to I unless I know who give it to you Timing 's everything Him LASER GUN fire Jackson Vala Jackson report Crap BORZIN you want more show I the naquadah JACKSON you know that thing be useless to I unless I know who give it to you Timing 's everything Him LASER GUN fire we suspect it could be another ambush LANDRY you think they be specifically after you they know we would follow the transponder signal why perhaps they be try to deter we from try to find the Odyssey Personally I think they just do not like we well I can see why they might not be your big fan well whatever the reason there be no other way to retrieve this intel the recording suggest the Odyssey be not destroy but be in the hand of the Lucian Alliance unfortunately that be all we get Borzin disappear along with Daniel and Vala and no one else we talk to know anything teal'c spread the word among the Jaffa tell whoever will listen I want to talk to the leader of the Lucian Alliance I 've always feel civilization can be judge by two thing its food and its woman I would say yours be only halfway there I do not blame you but you have to keep up your strength I do not blame you but you have to keep up your strength you have a whole ship to fix you know that could take the rest of my life whether that be long or painfully short be up to you Daniel Vala hi Sam we think you would miss we where be the other listen there be that small matter of my fee oh of course half payment for half of SG 1 two fifth actually it be a small quibble but do not help look it be not my fault that only two of they show up of course take care of he look I I be sorry but I do not think I will be see you again so BORZIN giggles no I think not put they in the hold do not worry Sam it be all part of the plan each division of Lucian Alliance territory be control by one of Netan 's lieutenant or second as they be call there be about 20 such individual oversee operation include smuggling extortion racketeering and of course trafficking in Kassa be there anything new come because this feel like a rerun to I well we 've be follow up on rumor of betrayal and possible mutiny among the second there seem to be mount dissent over Netan 's leadership well that be good but how do it help we Kefflin one of Netan 's most loyal and trusted second he oversee a large Kassa production operation on a remote group of planet on the outskirt of the galaxy LANDRY what about he besides the fact that he be a brutal killer with a notorious temper we only know of he by reputation sir he be extremely reclusive and rarely if ever leave his command ship very few if any of Netan 's inner circle have ever meet the guy you think this Kefflin be behind the disappearance of the Odyssey no sir I think he be the perfect candidate to impersonate excuse I I be suggest that I infiltrate the Lucian Alliance it be the only way we be go to get reliable information on the Odyssey you do not even have a decent picture of the man that be what make he the perfect candidate sir Reole chemical Dr Jackson use it a few year back to infiltrate a System Lord summit one jab of that and Netan will believe I be who I say I be regardless of what I look like no one else will question I because no one else have ever see he so you think I be not say it be not risky sir I be say we have to do something how be you hold up I be work as slowly as I can but I can not keep it up forever do you have any idea what they be plan on do with the ship or we for that matter no but without the transponder Stargate Command do not have a hope in hell of find we our only chance be to take this ship back well I have an idea about that but it be pretty risky well it be probably well than our plan well what be your plan we do not have one ALARM sound they have detect we Colonel Mitchell be you prepare Prepared as I will ever be state your business I be Kefflin I be here to see Netan you be not expect I do not have to be expect authorize I for immediate transport or I will have your head as an ornament for my ship I will notify Netan of your arrival where be Netan I will take you to he Fine let us go First you must submit to a search I do not think so grunt grunt I ask not to be disturb I apologize Netan but there have be an incident groan I try to tell they who I be but apparently the name Kefflin do not seem to mean much around here sorry about that the ring be a gift from my late conquest my dear friend Kefflin be here and you do not inform I I be sorry Master you ask not to be disturb so you beat he instead as you can see the beating be not entirely one way NETAN LAUGHS I be sure it be not leave we what it be not too late to turn this ship over to Netan you would be a hero you know I can not do that Netan have fail the Alliance and his position as leader hang precariously by a thread he know I be his most worthy challenger but he could not very well just murder I in cold blood so he send we on a fool 's quest but we succeed yes and this be go to ensure the downfall of Netan but why be it necessary to also bait a trap to capture SG 1 because everyone know that they have cause we more grief than any other adversary include the Ori all the second include I have beg Netan to go after they but he refuse he be a coward choose to run and hide rather than face the wrath of the Tau'ri will we not we have bring their battleship to its knee what be they go to do after I present Odyssey and SG 1 to the other Netan 's stuff corpse will be a trophy on my wall and control of the Lucian Alliance will be mine it be be a disappointing season my friend Drought and flood have ravage our high yield Kassa plantation the army of the Ori continue to usurp the planet upon which we 've establish trade and of course there be the Tau'ri yes commit our ship to co operate in the fight against the Ori incursion be a strategic mistake you 've always appreciate my honesty in the past I have you be the boss I do not blame you but other do I know NETAN ON RADIO be that why you be here the Kefflin I know would never make such a trip without a serious purpose MITCHELL actually it be the Odyssey the Tau'ri vessel Word reach I you just capture it I want to know your plan its beaming and hyperspace technology could be a great advantage in transport my crop where do you hear this the usual channel I hear rumor that the Odyssey be destroy in battle with the Ori nothing have be confirm yet I certainly have nothing to do with it Netan a ship have be detect in proximity we be move to intercept CHUCKLES teal'c I be begin to think you enjoy be my prisoner sorry I accidentally overload a power couple grunt where be the rest of your team VASHIN groan that man know nothing of torture I will find what we need I be wonder how long you would be able to resist if you do not mind I be go to need some time alone with he all right we have to find a way to get you out of here have you find the location of the Odyssey not yet I do not think Netan know where it be either and he be definitely have some trouble with his second then you must maintain this ruse no teal'c and not at your expense no there be other life at stake Mitchell Fine just remember I be an expert torturer SCREAMS teal'c scream something be go on in the hold go do a head count grunt Vashin make room this be Kefflin I think you do not like to show your face I be see a therapist this be Gavos Slaviash Karug Millic Rameris what do you learn from the Jaffa apparently the rumor be true the Odyssey be still out there in the hand of Anateo the Tau'ri be in possession of an audio recording which indicate that he be in control of it I order the attack on the Odyssey it be time the Tau'ri be send a message where be the ship I do not know Anateo have betray we be you say he succeed in capture the ship he have not report in yet gavo the Tau'ri vessel be most powerful you could not have possibly expect he to survive NETAN I give he a strategy that vastly improve his odd he come to I several month ago demand more territory as his planet have be overrun by the army of the Ori he suggest that he eliminate you Karug take over your planet Anateo have not just capture the Odyssey he be use it to bait a trap for SG 1 he have lose his mind the Tau'ri will declare all out war on we you should have consult with we Netan grunt I need not consult with anyone now be there anyone else who want to challenge I Anateo betray we all and he will pay and as for the Tau'ri they be already at war with we and we with they and I will not cower in fear so spread the word send all available ship I want the Odyssey find now Kefflin be it really necessary to embarrass I like that there have be whisper lately concern the strength of your leadership I suspect those whisper will now stop for the time be you will need someone to supervise Gavos ' territory your cut will be 20 Come on I be work as fast as I can you steal the Prometheus all by yourself I know the system be all new you say you could do it we do not exactly have a lot of time no Sam warn we that a number of the array have be damage even with locator beam a person from one room to another within the ship be very risky do you want they to rematerialize between the deck ON RADIO Teresh this be Anateo you miss your check in Report move where be they Dr Jackson and Vala where be they Dr Jackson and Vala Anateo we 've get a problem Dr Jackson Vala ON INTERCOM just want to let you know that your duplicity have already forfeit Colonel Carter 's life unless you surrender immediately the rest of the crew be next I can not be sure do it anyway no one else be go to fix this ship I think it be pretty clear that you 've just be stall and that you be not really go to fix it for I anyway I be just go to have to figure it out for myself good enough where be she well I could not be sure so I just beam out the only other life sign in the room instead okay where be he well Sam do say it be risky when she be right she be right only 50 of the shield emitter be respond okay we need to get they back online and get the hull integrity back within acceptable parameter Hyperdrive be our priority well we think most of Anateo 's man have be account for Most yeah we sweep the ship twice round up 14 man in total but not Solek Vala have to beam he out of the hold where the crew be be hold so we have no way of know for sure where he end up do you check the sewage reservoir yeah no life sign how be it go here well no shield no weapon no communication and at least a day out for hyperdrive so we be sit duck Kefflin what be you do interrogate the prisoner far and what have you learn not much yet fine then we can kill he together kill he we 've learn all we can Anateo have leave we no choice I be committed to send a message to the Tau'ri Netan I have to admit I be just begin to enjoy this one I be sorry my old friend your fun be over VASHIN Netan the Odyssey have be find Tenat welcome this be my good friend Kefflin it be my pleasure I have hear a great deal about you Kefflin yeah likewise tell I what you have learn Tenat and perhaps I will spare your pathetic life LAUGHS Funny as always Netan as you suspect the Odyssey be never destroy Anateo betray you and keep it for himself where be it half a day 's journey maybe less I have transmit the coordinate to your bridge get to your ship we will travel together of course wait just a moment Cam Mitchell look I do not know who you think I be you be Cam Mitchell bounty hunter you double cross I and my partner Jup what do you want I do not know how you 've manage to convince Netan that you be Kefflin but you be obviously up to something big here I will take half and what about your loyalty to Netan he would kill I the instant I be no long of use to he and Jup your old partner where be he he be work elsewhere at the moment we need not worry about cut he in Fine 10 it will be big trust I 30 or I tell Netan you be not who you say you be 25 no more I will ring over to your ship before this one jump to hyperspace and fill you in on the detail Unchain the prisoner he be come with I grunt teal'c teal'c grunt I have grow weary of this torture Colonel Mitchell that be pretty obvious but right now we get to go you remember Tenat yeah as in Jup and Tenat well he somehow weasele his way into command an Alliance mother ship and check this out the incompetent twit actually find the Odyssey do he see you yeah recognize I as well but he be keep his mouth shut 'cause he figure I be scamme Netan and he want a piece of the action we have to get over to his ship before this one jump to hyperspace what be your plan I be make it up as I go along Tenat Netan be here to see you what Netan I know of your intention to deceive I well how do you I know Colonel Mitchell be impersonate Kefflin all along Colonel Mitchell of SG 1 I catch he and Teal'c try to leave my ship no Netan you be mistaken it be true I know he be not Kefflin but I be merely try to lure he here so I could turn he over to you that be the stupid thing I have ever hear please do not kill I get up you pathetic excuse for a whatever you be what be you go to do to I nothing for the moment oh thank you you be a generous and gracious man I say that all the time do not I man tell he how honored you be to finally meet he in person Shut up stop snivel CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY Dr Jackson if these sensor be work properly two Goa'uld mother ship just emerge from hyperspace and be close in Sam go ahead we may need that hyperdrive a little ahead of schedule how ahead of schedule in about 10 second would be good we 've get company we need more time can you stall we be about to find out what be our shield status Less than 30 Weapons rail gun be online but we do not have missile yet one of the ship be hail we CLEARS throat on screen Dr Jackson oh right hi hi how be you I be expect Anateo yes he be here for a while but then he have to go your ship be batter my scan tell I your shield strength be low and if you have hyperdrive you would have leave long ago Surrender now or be destroy right Okey dokey we surrender prepare to be board yeah see that be where you be go to run into a bit of a problem you see our ring be damage and as you yourself point out our shield be down which mean atmosphere in the 302 bay be unsustainable STUTTERS I mean I just do not see how we be go to get your guy over here unless you want I to try beam you over they be power weapon Sam I think I 've stall as long as I can we need more time too late you should probably prepare to return fire for the record I be always prepare I just have to press this button here right I just I think that be what you be suppose to say so I I know open fire on the other ha'tak vessel what you hear I but you dare question my tactic there be a ship full of traitor out there wait to unseat I as leader of the Lucian Alliance Fire now you shall be richly reward with vast territory to command Fire on the other Ha'tak vessel one of the mother ship be fire at the other receive radio signal ON RADIO Odyssey this be teal'c do you copy teal'c Daniel Jackson it be good to hear your voice Colonel Mitchell and I be onboard one of the mother ship request that you beam we aboard the Odyssey immediately yeah lock on their locator beacon what be you do Netan what TENAT how I think this be Netan Jackson what be you do sit there what be you wear it be a long story you be the big fool in two galaxy but Netan I I screw up it be the wrong one you can not just jam it in how do you do that honestly I do not know that almost never normally work Daniel try it now EXPLOSION Shield failure be imminent damn you Cam Mitchell you know you be very lucky that no one else on the bridge of that ship know what Netan look like yeah it be a gamble but I figure if I got make or if the chemical jab on Tenat do not work after half an hour I would take the bridge by force I have a piss off Jaffa wait to help I out where be teal'c oh he be in the infirmary yeah big boy got bang up a bit hey what happen how do you get the Lucian Alliance to fire on each other oh you will love this before you tell we I get long range communication back online and send a message to Earth tell they that we will be come home yeah you should probably add that we have officially declare war on the Lucian Alliance I do NARRA TOR previously on Stargate SG 1 TEAL ' c accord to those who witness the battle the enemy be lead by a young woman of extraordinary power you want Merlin 's weapon for yourself a weapon capable of destroy not only the Ori but the ancient as well I do find one reference in that library that might prove to be useful Atlantis you think the location of Merlin 's weapon be hide in their database I think it be worth check out we be look for the name of two planet know on Earth in ancient time in the dialect of Old English as Castiana and Sahal Satisfied Taoth Vaclarush and Valos Cor Hey Jackson what be you do oh just try to figure out the location of Merlin 's weapon so we can find it in time to defeat the Ori hopefully save our galaxy you we be go for Szechwan you want to come no I will pass how be your search come Daniel Jackson slowly but I think I be onto something here take a look at this these be the location of the planet that Arthur and his knight set off to in their quest for the Sangraal Castiana Sahal and Vagon Brei now we search all three and come up empty so I think it be a dead end until I notice this their coordinate form an equilateral triangle now add their departure point the Camelot planet and you get a tetrahedron a perfect pyramid well that be a hell of a coincidence exactly and it mean something I be just not sure what VALA PANTING I have the answer I 've figure it out those three planet be part of a puzzle this much I already know the pyramid be a visual representation of three into one Three address into one that be what Morgan be try to tell you that the Sangraal be locate on a planet the address of which be make up of symbol from each of those three world Castiana Sahal Vagon Brei it just come to I in a dream okay this program will cross reference the address in the database with those of Castiana Sahal and Vagon Brei search out planetary designation make up of symbol from all three address give the number of symbol and the amount of address in the database we could be look at dozen maybe hundred of permutation SIGHS BEEPING or maybe just the one JACKSON the culture and level of technology look similar to what we find on the Camelot planet MITCHELL yeah I be go to assume that be a good thing I think some of these folk have figure out we be not from around here excuse I I be wonder if we could get some help a little information we 've come in search of the Sangraal it be a red thing about yea big we know what the Sangraal look like it be be many generation since anyone have come in search of it and now you be the second group of adventurer in less than a week to take up the quest the second group a number of Jaffa pass through here three day ago be they accompany by anyone yes they be lead by a man who clearly command their fear and respect Ba'al have be here and he be get a three day head start on we if you truly seek the Sangraal you must consult with the Parchment of Virtues in the village library it will prepare you for the journey to come over there thank you but I should warn you no one have ever return from the quest alive if you value your life you would do well to reconsider we appreciate that but that be quitter talk hello right Parchment of Virtues do we look under p for parchment or v for virtue I would say look for any and all material relate to the Sangraal or you could simply ask I I be Osric keeper of the village archive hi we be look for something call the Parchment of Virtues another band of stalwart hero come to tempt fate in the hope of claim the legendary prize what do you know of the Sangraal only what I have hear from legend that it be locate in a cave beyond the outlying forest but that the journey there be fraught with peril age ago Morgan Le Fay enchant the area with a terrible curse since then it have claim countless life well we do not put much stock in curse yeah well neither do Phaedra the cobbler 's wife several week ago she set off in search of her son who have stray too far from the village neither have be see nor hear from since this parchment be purportedly leave behind by Morgan herself as a guide for knight of noble spirit since it be say that only the most virtuous will succeed in claim the Sangraal only those of virtue true may win the prize conceal beyond the reach of the flawed and taint the Sangraal shall instead belong to he who speak the guardian 's name the guardian 's name they say that the Sangraal be protect by the most powerful of magical beast a dragon Dragon you doubt the legend well I be sure the Sangraal be protect by something very powerful but I do not think it be an actual dragon OSRIC SCOFFING believe what you will with luck you may have the opportunity to prove the truth for yourself Prudence wisdom charity kindness and faith let these be your guide on this perilous quest well I be sorry but I think we be go to need a little bit more than that to go on no all Morgan leave behind be this parchment and the map there be a map yes may we see it no why not I show it to the last group of adventurer who come in search of the Sangraal and they reward my trust by try to take it yeah we know the guy that run that operation we be not like he well I be sorry it be not for public view hey we would not dream of try to steal it OSRIC CHUCKLES we have to steal it we be not steal the map we have to steal it we be not steal the map Nightfall sneak in under cover of darkness maybe I can just talk to Osric and convince he that our cause be virtuous that be brilliant and while you be distract he the rest of we can steal it for the last time we be not be you certain I can not tempt you with a final meal what be it with this town and the no can do attitude every time we turn around someone be try to write we off or scare we away I apologize I should have say a final meal before you set off on your journey well that be well although it need be say in the many thousand of year that adventurer have be seek the Sangraal not one have succeed PEOPLE CLAMORING OUTSIDE what be this what do you want here we be soldier of the Ori and we have take this village as part of their holy crusade to rid this galaxy of evil Cooperate and you will not be harm go through the building bring everyone out who be these man well that be a long story look I know you have no reason to trust we any more than you do those guy I have not see you shoot anyone that be an excellent point we be go to need your help they 've get a dozen man guard the gate another 50 or so in and around the village be that what I think it be the content of the library you have spend your time ignorant to the truth stumble aimlessly through the darkness cast upon your world by the trapping of the past but now the path to fulfillment stand reveal and the time have come to embrace a new faith let the light of Origin show you the way you 've encounter they before many time and on many different world and how do the inhabitant of those other world resist they they do not they either surrender or they be slaughter what be you say there be nothing we can do we be doom no no not necessarily we believe they can be defeat that be why we be here we think that be why they be here as well to destroy the one thing capable of stop they the Sangraal BANGING ON DOOR OSRIC please I know they be here please I must speak with you the soldier be look for I why because they believe I can lead they to the Sangraal can you well of course what you save the map no they unwittingly burn it with the rest of the village archive but a copy still exist where here I will lead you to Merlin 's treasure BANGING ON DOOR we want the old man he have information we seek not today fellow wow this be awkward our army have take this village if you resist there will be no escape now stand aside oh I think somebody must have hear that this way come quickly you should come with we my place be here I will be fine I will blame everything on you good plan this way what the hell beep what be the matter with they I do not know I be pick up vary anomalous reading strong here Weaker here strong here Weaker here and then rise again well this be weird they be temporal fluctuation mean mean these people be trap in a time distortion field be you sure if it be a time distortion field why be the leave move in the tree carter it could be an illusion design to reproduce the stand weather pattern these reading indicate the time within the field be extremely decelerate I mean these people may look like they be stand perfectly still but in fact they be move imperceptibly slowly be they aware of what be happen to they doubtful several year may pass on our side of the field in the one or two second it take they to take even one step why do not we just go around it well the outer edge of the field extend as far as I can tell in either direction and it have a slight curve to it I mean for all I know it could form a complete circle we could walk for mile and never find a way through Sam if you 've get another idea I would love to hear it well I be definitely pick up varied reading it be almost as if I think I may have find a way in there be a circuitous path of real time wind through the temporal field it be a maze yeah it be a maze these reading be unmistakable I can use they to guide we through follow my lead if you stray off the path you could wind up trap in the distortion field beep STOPS uh oh what do you mean uh oh uh oh you leave your stove on right the temporal distortion be affect these reading we be blind MITCHELL okay here be a stupid question you do check the battery in that thing before you leave Stargate Command right it be not the battery we could just retrace our step and try our luck with the Ori soldier do you know the way back that way we have to be exact any deviation from the path of real time and we could wind up freeze like the rest of these people if Morgan Le Fay leave clue as to the whereabouts of the Sangraal then it be safe to assume that she believe that someone would eventually reach it it also stand to reason that our task though challenge be far from impossible teal'c 's right she set this trap to weed out those she deem unworthy there be a way out we just have to be resourceful and carefully think it through well Arthur and his knight would not have have access to this advanced technology to guide they through so presumably the answer could be deceptively simple follow I dead end you be right deceptively simple all right we be through we would well pick up the pace if we want to cut into Ba'al 's lead OSRIC you say that these Ori be possess of god like ability OSRIC you say that these Ori be possess of god like ability and yet they be not god jackson no they be very powerful being who would have their follower believe as much because faith be the source of their power Faith be something that can not be win through intimidation and fear if their follower have faith then they must truly believe no they only believe because they 've be mislead you see to many less developed civilization certain advanced technology would strike they as supernatural in nature Merlin be not a wizard and Morgan Le Fay be not a sorceress ridiculous they simply use their advanced ability to fashion seemingly magical creation like the Sangraal or that time dilation field we encounter so you would have I believe that you be possess of a complete understanding of these amazing feat no but just because I do not know how the trick be do do not make it magic and I would argue that your inability to comprehend such feat do in fact prove their supernatural nature their army just run roughshod over your village force you into hiding now you be defend they hardly I condemn the action of their soldier but I be in no position to judge the Ori or their message not yet truth be elusive to those who refuse to see with both eye what MALE voice speak INDISTINCTLY ba'al I do not believe they abandon I they be go to pay all of they be go to pay wait SIGHS well make yourself comfortable we be go to be here a while it will not do you any good believe I I 've try it be a one way door how long have you be trap in here Three agonizingly tedious day which remind I I do not suppose you have any food what be that that be bait when I approach to investigate I unwittingly trigger the trap carter you 've have the ancient database for month why do it take you so long to get here I can not think clearly on an empty stomach CHUCKLES I only possess two of the three address need to complete the puzzle as a result I have significantly more possibility to investigate by a process of elimination I be leave with one prospect and when I go in search of the planet it be not there what do you mean it be not there it be not where it be suppose to be I calculate its position I send my ship to its approximate location but they could not find it in the end my only recourse be to access it via the stargate and secure the device with a handful of my Jaffa and when I become trap in here they set off in search of a means of free I they have yet to return something must have come up obviously Morgan must have render this planet inaccessible to ship to ensure that enemy such as the Ori could not destroy the Sangraal from orbit you be waste your time I 've have three day to search for a way out of here there be nothing inside well that be the point be not it the Parchment of Virtues tell we that we would have to rely on five thing in order to reach the Sangraal Prudence wisdom charity kindness and faith you be say the parchment be intend to be interpret literally why not we be able to make our way through the time dilation field by patiently and carefully negotiate the maze in other word we demonstrate prudence as oppose to recklessness which would have strand we so ask yourselves what do this trap exploit Curiosity Greed a person approach a chest expect to find treasure inside but instead find nothing and get trap for his trouble so in order to reverse the trap you have to reverse the impetus right the opposite of greed be charity one of the virtue mention in the parchment instead of take something something must be sacrifice CHUCKLES well that be an interesting theory well we be all trap so we all have to contribute something no wait clear THROAT I have nothing to donate that particular item hold great sentimental value well do another day in there I would have go mad guess that make it time to say goodbye it would be foolish of you to kill I how so amongst the information I obtain regard the Sangraal be the name of the protector Protector the dragon you see I tell you there be a dragon I be sure there be something guard the device maybe it be a hologram Holograms can be dangerous you know it could be a ship fly breathe fire have armored skin it be a mistake a medieval storyteller could easily make then if it be base on technology the name be no doubt a password or a command code either way if you want it you will have to take I with you you know I hate to say this but he could prove useful MITCHELL come on yet again we find ourselves the unlikeliest of ally join together in common purpose you know the word ally imply some sort of partnership and that just be not the case here you see we be go after the Sangraal while you be tag along for the ride accord to the map the Sangraal be hide in a cave beneath a lone mountain right we be get warm this be it the cave entrance the Sangraal be locate within it be too bad you will not be come with we I think I make it clear you need I I be not talk to you well allow I to get out of your line of fire have you lose your sense truth elude he who do not seek it with both eye wide it be a quote from the Book of Origin you paraphrase it early today now I might not have notice but I spend the past year study the good book so surely you be not base your suspicion on this mere coincidence and when it come time to give up a possession to free ourselves from the force field trap I notice the design on your ring not celtic as one might expect give the cultural background of this planet but distinctly Ori the ring be a gift from a travel merchant you be make a mistake you be the one who screw up now drop the act it would have be so much easy if you have remain oblivious but now thing will be much more difficult especially for you you be do something new with your eye so the troop in the village the shoot out in the tavern that be all a set up More than you know I grow impatient wait for you to discover the location of the weapon so I give you a little help the dream I have three into one that be you yes so you plant the solution in Vala know it would lead we right to you apparently Morgan put safeguard in place to ensure the weapon could only be secure by what be the term again those possess truth of spirit what be the term again those possess truth of spirit I can not think of anyone more appropriate than a former Ascended with your help I will secure the device hate to disappoint you 've see a demonstration of my power you know what I be capable of so I be offer you a choice either we work together to reach the device or I will start kill off member of your team start with her all right we will work together for now ADRIA we thwart all effort against we cripple your fleet meet with little if any resistance on the world that we redeem Opposition to the Ori be clearly hopeless but you continue to struggle against the inevitable JACKSON yeah well what can I tell you we be optimist your only hope lie with Merlin 's weapon once I take that away from you your defeat will be complete now look who be the optimist you disappoint I Mother I would have expect you to see reason by now but it do not matter eventually you will have no choice but to accept the truth and when you do I will accompany you on your path to enlightenment you know the second we find that thing she be go to kill we not if we kill her first that could be a bit of a problem I do not know we be pretty resourceful I be sure we will think of something yeah just do not do it too soon she may not be true of spirit and all that jazz but she have do her homework I hate to say it but she could prove useful for the moment choose the way that be just and true it be a riddle I be good at these the way that be just and true just and true it be tell we to go that way the way that be just and true that be the right way what the writing be in Ancient so so in Ancient the word mean just and true be very different from the word mean right as in opposite of left child crying do you hear that it sound like a child this way VALA a child in here it be obviously a trap or quite possibly a test a test of what our stupidity whimpering hey kid Kid wait up hey slow down little guy ADRIA we be walk right into a trap JACKSON no we be not the parchment provide we with clue to reach the Sangraal it mention kindness as one of the virtue that would guide we so if we show kindness by help this child it should bring we one step close to the device the parchment also mention wisdom which we would be demonstrate by avoid this trap metal GEARS turn MITCHELL Hang on kid we will get you out of there little help here he be tiny have he squeeze through the bar assist we or I will squeeze you through these bar JACKSON want to use your power to lift it we be waste our time let us go back well how be about that we do pick the right way it be a dead end we have to go back no it do not make any sense that we would have progress this far only to come up empty Daniel it be another riddle oh goody I be strike and cut shape and cool then bind by ring to release what be store rumbling you might want to pick thing up a little bit here all right well we have to think it through what be strike and cut and shape and cool and then bind by ring bind by ring Key the answer be key Clavia rumble I shake the earth with booming thunder fall forest whole and home complete I influence ship topple king sweep down swift yet remain unseen oh wait I 've get this suggest a strong yet invisible force Wind Ventio MITCHELL oh for cry out loud Battle scarred in time of strife resistant to resistant to VALA to what I do not know I can not translate this section of the text nevertheless battle scar would suggest Contegia rumble stop look like that be do it you know come to think of it riddle never really be my strong point visual puzzle like which of these symbol do not belong with the other or reconfigure the tile to make the hidden picture MITCHELL be it just I or be it get hot in here VALA well now that you mention it it be a tad toasty hey you get anything no you no but I be get a good tan Let us take a break okay there be no hidden trigger or secret passage if there be a way through we do not find it then I suppose we should head back not an option the passageway have re seal behind we then I be right we walk into a trap no we make all the right choice to lead we to this point I know the Sangraal lie beyond that wall of fire we just have to find a way through why do not you do something you be the Orici you be supposedly possess of significant power so snuff out the flame and get we on our way my ability do not work that way of course how do the saying go all flash no photo actually it be all flash no substance I prefer my version would you care for a demonstration take your life would be a waste of my time which I suppose would be put to well use complain oh jeez why do not you two just get a room it be the only one leave Daniel the parchment tell we that five virtue would guide we in our quest for the Sangraal Prudence kindness charity wisdom and faith now we display prudence in find a way out of the temporal maze charity in escape the force field trap kindness by help the child and find the hide passageway and wisdom in solve the riddle the only virtue leave be faith Daniel Jackson well after you muscle there it be we 've find it Ours for the taking Hang on yeah that be pretty deep I will go we will both go I think I will stay here and support you from a distance we should all go no only Daniel and I will go the rest of you will stay it be all right take it after you I tell you Morgan put safeguard in place to ensure that someone such as myself could not claim the device be that why you do not just use your power from back there what be you talk about well you have telekinetic ability I 've see you use they you should have just snatch the Sangraal off the dais without take a step but you do not probably for the same reason you do not use your power to lift the portculli or kill Ba'al the second he step out of line you can not of course I can no my guess be Morgan do put safeguard in place and that those safeguard be neutralize your ori give power you see I withstand the bullet fire against I yeah thank to your personal shield the only power you can manifest originate from that pendant and they be purely defensive in nature do you really want to test I Yep you know what I change my mind about help you knock yourself out what be the holdup Thought so well I guess I be not as true of spirit as you think I be RUMBLING Jackson move it what the hell be that we agree there be no such thing as a dragon right yeah wing flap screeching because that look pretty real to I NARRA TOR previously on Stargate SG 1 the Sangraal shall instead belong to he who speak the Guardian 's name they say that the Sangraal be protect by the most powerful of magical beast amongst the information I obtain regard the Sangraal be the name of the protector Protector the dragon OSRIC the Sangraal be hide in a cave beneath a lone mountain it be too bad you will not be come with we there it be we 've find it well I guess I be not as true of spirit as you think I be hey we agree there be no such thing as a dragon right yeah VALA because that look pretty real to I what just happen I extend my protective shield you be lucky I still need you whoa head up move out DRAGON SCREECHING SIGHING well he be too big to fit through the opening so I think we be safe DRAGON ROARING DRAGON SCREECHING move there appear to be an exit this way okay what the hell just happen back there it be a hologram the Sangraal be not real what be you say we come all this way for nothing we have to go back inside ba'al you must be joke the dragon be the final test it would be madness to challenge that thing I do not think we be go to have a choice DRAGON SCREECHING Tree line so now what it can not see we as long as we stay in the tree we should be able to make it back to the village we be not go anywhere Adria 's right the dragon 's the final test and we 've come too far to give up now it be just that kind of noble sentiment that be go to get we all kill be not you the one that claim to know the dragon 's secret name Time to earn your keep yes I may have exaggerate about that slightly anyway you do not think that just by call out its name you would suddenly be able to control it I do not know Name magic be common in most mythology to know something 's secret name be to steal its power so what be we suppose to do just start guess Darrell the dragon MITCHELL how about Smokey Perhaps Puff would you just give I a minute DRAGON screeching while we be wait option well we know the P90 fire just bounce off its armor which mean it be not a hologram if it be a hologram the bullet would 've go straight through so it be not that your weapon be not ineffective it be that they be ineffective in a different way what I be say be that if bullet bounce maybe we should try something that pack a little more punch all right here be what we be go to do we be go to lure Darrell down to the ground I be go to take this thing and we be go to toss it underneath and detonate it near the expose underbelly that be where dragon be most vulnerable Carter you detonate from the tree line and I will do the running that be all right teal'c I get this one all right off you go DRAGON SCREECHING oh son of a bitch oh not good teal'c run hey Daniel now would be a really good time okay the Parchment of Virtues say the Sangraal would belong to he who speak the guardian 's name the guardian 's name the guardian be a dragon no the guardian 's not the dragon the guardian be the person who set this whole thing up the guardian be Morgan Le Fay right wait no what the hell wait hey Morgan Le Fay SCREECHING Darrell Ganos Lal wow it be Morgan 's name in Ancient yeah I know thank for the assist well to be honest I would not have be of much use to you my strength lie in strategy and command whereas yours lie in armed combat and deal with dragon clearly it be real this time right I do not see why not oh come on okay what just happen carter I think we be transport into another chamber where be Adria I guess she do not make it it must be some sort of security measure I do not know it let he in well I do not think Morgan be too concerned about the Goa'uld it be the Ori she be worried about MITCHELL you know I be not see anything around here that look like a Sangraal which beget the question what be she protect I think I know here lie Myrrdin Archmage of the Round all right that be not a hologram he be the real McCoy right I think so MITCHELL how long have he be in there well over a thousand year teal'c we have encounter ancient stasis technology such as this before General O'Neill be keep in a similar pod in Antarctica so how do we get he out I have no idea VALA hey guy look at this Vala be careful I ENERGY SURGING MITCHELL Hey Jackson Jackson Whoa we get he Clear that off he be heavy than he look GROANING no he do not just no he be still alive it may take he a while to revive completely all right in the meantime we should see if there be a way out of here let we know what you find or I could come too hey daylight over here you know I can not quite put my finger on it but something be different we be not just transport to another chamber we be transport to another planet the gate must have be activate remotely then the obelisk beam we through the wormhole well as far as I be concern the more distance between we and Adria the well except that she have the knowledge of the Ori she know as much about the gate and the dhd as the people who build they Lf anyone can track we it be her yeah except that it be amazing how similar this be to the myth supposedly Morgan trap Merlin in a cave and leave he freeze there for all eternity only in reality I think she be try to protect he how do you mean well I be start to think that maybe Morgan do destroy the Sangraal after all I mean she probably figure she have no choice that if she do not do it the other ancient would have just send someone else so instead she do the next good thing MITCHELL she preserve the one man capable of build it again well it be official we be stick here wherever here be the good news be we find a gate Teal'c 's watch it the bad news be we can not dial out somebody tamper with the DHD ba'al I can fix it reprogramme dialing device be my specialty Whoops Guess who be come around where be I good question you look familiar Guinevere oh my dear it be be too long it be good to see you too percivale and Galahad oh brave knight fortune indeed do smile upon I to see your face again it look like Merlin 's drawbridge no long go all the way across the moat if you catch my meaning what be that mordre I might have know it ba'al we be waste our time with this old fool we need to get back to the gate so I can start reprogramme be silent well how do you like that the old boy still have some trick up his sleeve Merlin Myrrdin we need you to remember about the Sangraal about Morgan and about how you get here Morgan you also know she as Ganos Lal I have not hear that name speak in a very long time we be not Knights of the Round Table MITCHELL though we be flatter by the comparison a thousand year have pass we know who you really be we know about Atlantis and we 've encounter the Ori tell I more I do not know where to begin this be go to take a while all right we will get start check out the cave unless you have any objection no Great move out PEOPLE chattering make way for the Orici what happen the gate activate on its own and only second later it close again the gate activate on its own and only second later it close again I do not suppose anyone see the address no Orici I will need to examine the dialing device Ready your man as soon as I determine where they go we be leave yes Orici and what of the village have they agree to accept the teaching of Origin no then burn it and it be Morgan who finally lead we to you of course she could not come right out and tell we she have to be annoyingly cryptic about the whole thing you have an unusual understanding of the way of ascended being yes that be partly because I use to be one myself the human race could not have progress that far in only a thousand year no I have a little help her name be Oma Desala oh of course and what happen well I guess I do not exactly see eye to eye with the other oh yes I find myself in a similar position yeah I be not too good at the whole non interference thing I guess there be a few argument at least that be the impression I get you do not remember no in order to protect I Oma erase it all from my mind and send I back oh I be surprised she still have not learn her lesson she be not the only one who break some of the rule the Ori gain their power from the low plane so much so that one day they shall be strong enough to wipe the other out in the face of such a threat a strict policy of non interference be absurd I be sure Oma would agree with you Oma concern herself with the individual she may have the good intention but then so do the Ori when they first begin still she must have see something in you to believe you to be worthy this cave be a bust there be nothing else here how be it go I be not exactly sure before I agree to join with you I need to know that you be willing to do whatever must be do to see it through surely you have some idea of what we 've be through to get here what you experience so far be as nothing compare to what be to come do not worry about we we be on board in that case there be much work to be do SIGHING he be be at it for hour Daniel want to take a guess at what he be do well from the look of it I would say he be virtually piece something together from base molecule another Sangraal EX CLAIMING thank you I be fine just need a little rest what be that TEAL ' c ON RADIO Colonels Mitchell and Carter come quickly you will want to see this let us go the gate activate on its own the crystal in the obelisk begin to glow and then everything change I will say MITCHELL we 've be transport to another planet well if Daniel 's right and Morgan want to keep Merlin hide this would be a great way to do it my guess be we be travel through a circuit of planet cut off from the rest of the gate system by a deliberate alteration of the DHD program then you believe we will be unable to dial out from this gate as well well we can give it a shot but yeah I doubt it will work until we find the automatic dialing program in the DHD processor and shut it down you can do that right I hope so I have live many lifetime first in Atlantis then on Earth before the dawn of your civilization then I join the rank of the Ascended and finally I return to mortal form to live out my remain day among the nobleman of Arthur 's court or so I think and through all these eon only one thing stay the same there be never enough time well we be safe for the moment you can take all the time you need I sleep too long my body betray I we be not about to let you give up now you realize what be at stake if you do not help we the Ori will take this galaxy SIGHING one last task then before I rest good luck Dr Jackson ENERGY SURGING EX claiming what just happen he be dead he say good luck it be very strange it be almost as if he know it be go to happen which leave we with no Sangraal and for the moment no way off this planet I tell you I can fix the dialing device Merlin 's little trick with my vocal chord expire at the same moment he do yet another reason to mourn his pass joke all you want teal'c but I be the only one who can get we out of here he be good with dialing program maybe if we work together I be have trouble find the relocation program it must be bury in one of the correlative subroutine we will never find it use those search protocol I be go to have to make some adjustment to your program how much long be this go to take it be impossible to say all I know for sure be it would have be a lot easy on that nice warm desert planet he say he have one more thing to do before he could rest I think he mean build we another weapon no you be right before he know he do not have enough time now this be obviously some sort of virtual interface like a computer assist design program only in the past we 've see it use to download information into someone 's mind what sort of information all the knowledge of the Ancients that be a lot yes as a matter of fact it be too much for a human brain to handle it be fatal but what if you could control it use it to store and load something more specific like I be not sure hey ON RADIO Vala here I be go to need some help what be it it be Daniel keep work Cam I do not trust he to finish on his own Sam Jackson Jackson what do he do the planet be lifeless there be no one here they be here I be certain of it what would you have we do lead the man in Prostration I will inform you when I have the next address yes Orici try it now I be still not read any anomaly this be ridiculous I can not be expect to work like this I can barely see my finger be numb I say we go back inside we warm up we take our chance on the next planet how do you know it will not be bad we be about to find out EX CLAIMING Merlin 's go well that be just weird Sam what just happen the obelisk transport we to another planet I think it be schedule to go off every couple of hour how be thing out there well it be a little spooky but at least it be warm How 's Daniel he be sit up I will get back to you on the rest hey how you do sunshine he be right you do look like percivale excuse I we spend a lot of time in this room who do we do he do Merlin sorry it be a little confusing have two set of memory in your head and he be not kid about live many lifetime you have Merlin 's memory some of they Earth Atlantis and the different medieval society he set up throughout the galaxy and the work he do in this lab hey whoa hey hang on a second be you tell I you can build the Sangraal he know he do not have the strength to finish it his body have deteriorate too much during the stasis so he give I the knowledge wait I can see it now I can do this twice a device like that almost kill General O'Neill both time it take the Asgard to save he Daniel think that this device might be different that somehow the information could be limit I hope he be right we find the body of an old man dead apart from that there be nothing here sigh this be begin to try my patience be there no other way we can track they no but each time I be able to determine their destination more quickly than the last Sooner or later we will catch up to they maybe we be bark up the wrong tree here maybe the relocation program be not in the DHD processor at all what the obelisk chuckle you obviously have no idea what you be talk about say the brainiac who spend three day trap in that force field that technology be strictly use for localize transport yeah I know I mean it be obviously what be beam we through the gate every time there be an open wormhole but what if it also contain a remote dialer it be one thing to send someone here and there on the surface of the planet it be quite another to send they halfway across the galaxy it be like compare a laptop to a supercomputer well it would not have to contain the entire navigational system now would it just a command code sufficient to override normal dialing protocol just a command code sufficient to override normal dialing protocol yes but to borrow a rather quaint human phrase why hide a needle in a small haystack when you can use an enormous one it would not be much of a security measure if it could be discover by the first Tau'ri female who come along would it now I be sorry be you dismiss my idea out of hand because I be human or because I be a woman a little of both I suppose you know what I will check it myself what be that stage one the first step towards create Merlin 's weapon it be real yeah that be exactly what this device do it allow you to design and configure something virtually and then it materialize it just like O'Neill do when he create the anti Replicator weapon I think the Sangraal be a tiny red jewel no that be the final stage the key to make the whole thing work so how long before you can put the whole thing together Daniel GROANING I be all right I be all right this machine take a lot out of you the level of concentration require be pretty intense can I get you anything Water sure okay that happen it be interesting Jack get heal power I guess I get telekinesis Jack also almost die now you say that this device might be different I will be fine that be crap she be right you do not get fancy mind power unless there be be major redecorating go on inside your skull look obviously create the weapon require a high level of brain function now Merlin would 've foresee that trust I I can handle this Damn it CLEARING THROAT what do you want I need your help look I still think I be right about the obelisk but I can not make head or tail of its programming well that be hardly surprising I mean I know where you come from you be consider relatively intelligent but by galactic standard that be not really say much would not you agree you know if you be not go to help then you be really not much use to we and if you be not much use to we then there be really no point in keep you alive any long would not you agree scoff I would be delighted to help great to hear it Stage two indeed I must rest I be not as young as I use to be Daniel be you all right I know you well of course you do silly it be I Vala I have the strange dream everything be cover in ice Jackson Daniel what be go on we be lose you that be what be go on every time you come back from that machine it get a little bad and do not tell I you be fine no no I just have I have too many thought in my head I can not concentrate I get confused you have to fight it no no that be the thing I have to let it happen that be the only way I can build Merlin 's weapon PANTING you have to tell he that he do not have to do this he will listen to you oh what team have you be on besides we need this one what make you think we will even be allow to use it the Ancients do not let Merlin get away with it last time Vala Vala shut up for once we have to take the risk what this be all about noble sacrifice for you be not it oh dear I be sorry what about you what when you fly that cargo ship into the gap of the supergate you know damn well that you might not come out the other side alive no that be different yeah different because you be the one take the risk well now you know the hard part about be part of this team be not risk your own life it be watch your friend take chance with theirs Congratulations now you really be one of we it be a command override I can not believe we actually find it clearly you work well together well now that we 've identify the program it should be a simple matter to shut it down ENERGY SURGING ready your man it be time yes Orici ENERGY SURGING what be it get to the gate now why they be come stargate activate incoming wormhole hold they here I will get help GROANING Dr Jackson SIGHING you be too late you have not complete the weapon I would say I be just in time and I would say thing be different now drain be not it instead of help your friend you should have save your energy to deal with I would it have make a difference probably not what be that I do not know but I say we do not stick around to find out dial out of here before anyone else can dial in I be go to go check on Daniel Daniel why do I bother Adria I want you to stop this right now I be sorry it have to be this way Mother get to the gate now I be not leave you here I will be right behind you no there have to be a way we can get back to that planet a DHD buffer typically hold the last 50 address that be dial and we go through three gate before get there we 've get a lot of planet to check Adria find a way around the problem even if we could return to the planet at this point I fear it would do we little good HITTING KEYBOARD grunt at least we would be do something Merlin give Daniel some pretty valuable intel Adria know that hey she will keep he alive how be you feel I do not suppose you know what a hangover be SIGHING never mind I know the burden must be awful your brain simply be not build to handle that much information GROANING well whatever I have it be go along with what feel like half my brain cell you will forgive I if I do not take your word for it now rest we have a lot of work to do so how do it go absolutely incredible sir you can forget about the Ori with an act like that Sam will be headline in Vegas okay stop the performance of the device do exceed all expectation General Landry I be tell you sir a few tweak here and there we will be able to hide anything we want troop ship planet it be a lot more complicated than that sir but I do think we be ready for a large scale test Good get change I may have just the thing Colonel Reynolds have be conduct reconnaissance on P9C 882 as part of the ongoing mission to track the Ori advance in the galaxy approximately four hour ago the people of 882 be visit by a Prior let I guess he make they an offer they could not refuse with a slight twist he tell they to build this I take it you 've see that before yes they use these to burn people alive who do not follow their rule he give they three day at which time he say he would return to check their progress what have be the villager ' response already reject the idea they live under the Goa'uld for century they be not about to give up their freedom again they 've ask for our help you want to use Sam 's device to make they disappear whoa whoa whoa hold on a second first of all it be Merlin 's device and second while I agree the modification I 've make have potential it be far from ready to deploy in the field on that scale but I be sure that that be not what the General be propose actually Colonel that be what I be propose the IOA have review the report of your experiment and they think it be time to take this new technology out of the lab I happen to agree with they with respect sir you be talk about try to hide an entire village of people I realize it be a tall order Colonel but we seem to have a three day window here any chance you can make the necessary adjustment in that time can do sir not a problem good what do not look at I like that you 've get a village to save you have return bless we all SG 1 this be Thilana leader of the village this be Colonel Mitchell teal'c Vala and Colonel Carter I can not express our thank to you in come to our aid it be our pleasure we be at your service the building we have select be this way Matar allow I to carry this thank you do not you just love help people I hope this location be suitable for you I can have the rest of these thing remove if you would like no it be great thank you for year my ancestor be force to record the true history of our people in secret beyond the eye of the Goa'uld this room now house their legacy it seem appropriate you do your work here I be flatter I must admit Colonel Carter some of my people be concerned about what this machine will do I would like to be able to reassure they yeah of course let I walk you through it basically this machine shift all matter within a preset range in this case the entire village into another dimension so when the Prior return he will not be able to see or hear you in fact he will be able to walk right through you but do not worry it do not hurt at all and it be just temporary just long enough to fool the Prior once he leave we can put everything back to normal PEOPLE CHATTERING Sam 's all set Colonel Reynolds and his team be stand by at the gate Reynolds this be Mitchell remember we be go to be out of radio contact once we go out of phase Understood listen up folk we be go to try a little disappear act here please remember to keep your arm and leg inside the village at all time until we come to a complete and final stop all MURMURING Blank stare work too Sam light she up copy that BEAMING we have the crazy job in the world dial we out Lieutenant thank you tonight we honor our new friend from Earth whose wisdom generosity and kindness have allow we to resist those who wish to return we to slavery we extend to you our deep and most sincere thank all EX claiming what be that I think the displacement field collapse I will go check it out okay I 've get some good news and some bad news good first well in order to bring everything back completely the machine have to maintain a connection with every single molecule that it send out of phase now obviously that require a lot of energy so I implement a fail safe that would automatically bring everything back into our own dimension in the event of a power disruption and such a disruption occur well it be just a slight fluctuation but it be enough to trigger the fail safe so what do we do actually that be the problem I think I would stabilize the power supply can you fix it you will not abandon we we be not but be there a safe place that you can take your people a planet maybe you be familiar with will not the prior find we wherever we go MATAR then perhaps we should consider heed the Prior 's wish no I will not stand by while we be once again subjugate into serve false god we must stand our ground the Prior be very powerful then please you must help we do not give up on we yet we be not Coffee thank you do not get too excited they pack we decaf by mistake Teal'c 's go to the gate to watch for the Prior look I hate to rush you Sam but we get to make a decision about this Landry be pretty clear we be not to let this thing fall into enemy hand I know I 've rig an ancient capacitor similar to the kind use in the stargate between the device and the generator it should collect the power and hopefully feed it more evenly well that sound great Colonel Mitchell do you read loud and clear teal'c what be up our time woman what be it they be check for the monument Sam we get fighter circle how be you come with that disappear act just a few more minute get these people inside now go not you teal'c buddy look like we could use you back here now I be on my way Colonel Mitchell an Ori fighter have deposit a ring platform outside the village now a ground force be head your way all right this way come with I have you ever fire a gun before no all right blank stare be not go to cut it this time listen up pull this aim there squeeze that all right yeah just make sure that this end be point away from you and anyone else you do not want to kill pass these out to whoever want they we can not hold they off forever you know I know they be split up try to flank we groan GUNS fire MEN grunt GROANING GUN FIRES Sam it be okay you be go to be okay GASPING stay where you be no no hey hey you be go to be fine just stay with I MAN search the building all right we have to move we can not Sam we have to the device all right yeah no you can not destroy it well what do you want I to do I can not carry you and all that junk activate it groan keep move it be no good they be fry GASPING all of they well we 've get one work Bypass the other two connect the lead buzzing all right what be next there be a macro on the main control screen I have no idea where that be Sam Sam that be it I think well it well be it where have it go what just happen how do that building disappear perhaps it be the will of the god all those who oppose the Ori shall perish Stop Commander all those here have resist with force and they shall be punish Tomin have she take to the ring transport she to the ship kill the rest no Tomin no no firing PEOPLE GROANING Hold still hold still Hang on this will help you continue GASPING how long be I out well unfortunately not long enough for I to finish this just hang on what be go on outside the shooting have stop the Ori army be in control Cam Damn it Sam do not scare I like that what the device be on I forgot to mention that yeah I do not know how big the field be I think you and I be the only one inside it teal'c and Vala well I try to contact they on the radio but there be no response well that could mean anything it could we will pull through this Sam why be you still wear the clothe of a blasphemer if I put on this dress and say Hallowed be the Ori will you stop mass murder innocent people Tomin wait I know you think that everything that come out of my mouth be a lie I 've deceive you too many time to change that now but there be one thing I want you to know that be the truth there be real moment between we I do fall in love with you in your heart you be a good man not because Origin tell you to be I know you can not possibly like what you 've become what this faith have make you do after all that time we spend together you still know nothing about I I know you must still love I why else would I be here if it be up to I I would light the fire that would burn you alive for your desecration the only reason you be still here be because it be so order by the Orici you will remain in this room you will see no one you will speak to no one you will be educate in the way of Origin until such time as evil no long possess you no Tomin I be street smart that be always get I by but I have to warn you I 've never be much for school I be to teach you this be my punishment for allow you to deceive I if you continue to resist you will die teal'c Thilana I be happy to see that you be uninjured you as well where be the rest of your team I be hope that you have see they I have not I have speak to many other Thilana we have decide that as village leader you must go forward to the Prior and embrace Origin on our behalf what you have no right you see how powerful they be a poor reason to abandon one 's belief this no long concern you your attempt to have we resist have only lead to death my concern extend to those who would worship false god the Ori be not worthy of your devotion well god or not their power be real the same can not be say for your people you pledge to protect we but when the time come you fail to do so we have no choice we shall bow down to the Ori and beg for their mercy or we shall all perish it be get bad not get well listen I 've be think uh oh yeah Dangerous I know I can leave the field and still stay out of phase right so I be think I would take some C4 plant it around the village come back here use the explosion as a distraction to what you have not hear the rest of the plan you can not leave the device here well I be go to save some C4 for that as well well I be go to save some C4 for that as well you can not sacrifice the device for I it be still our good chance against the Ori no offense but that gizmo be not show a whole lot of promise right now it will work I just be not ready for this I be probably not go to make it either way no do not you start to talk like that Cam we have to face the fact that I be go to die here no I do not have to face that fact because I be not go to let it happen I appreciate that but the truth be even if you manage to create a distraction and destroy the device you be never go to get I to the gate by yourself yes I will not alive so it come to pass that Ver Omesh be grip by a great famine so Markon go to the prophet Articus and ask to go to the forest for food how many people have you kill do you keep track put little notch in your Ori belt the prophet bade he be patient for the Ori provide for all who have faith but Markon do not believe do you remember their face or be there too many of they hundred thousand so the prophet draw a line in the sand and tell he ' step across and you may do as you wish ' so Markon do and leave the village and feast on wild berry what about the story in there that be all about not enough they be each give a chance to save themselves those who do not walk the path be not worthy you can preach all you want to I Tomin but I know that be not what you believe the fruit be bitter and do not satisfy he he long to return to the village but find that the line have widen to a great chasm I 've read the book I 've read it I understand why you think it be so important the word give you comfort and at face value it appear to be as if they be try to inspire the good out of people he call out to the prophet in fear but the prophet say ' the line have not change ' Honesty morality it be you who have change step across if you truly believe this whole crusade be a manipulation nothing in there say that those who do not believe should be massacre so Markon pray for forgiveness and take the first step where do it say that Tomin where do it say that and the hand of the Ori envelop the Ori be not god grunt you should kill I now there be a building in the village square that disappear upon our arrival you will tell I what trickery be be use to conceal it I be Thilana leader of this village we do not know what magic be at work but it strike I by your ask we lowly peasant you be say that the great power of the Ori can not see past such deception I ask you so that you may show the Ori the error of your way if you do not bow your village will be burn to the ground wait Matar no she would stand by while more of our people be murder to protect the identity of those who have fail we what do you speak of this man be not of our village he come with the other to try to conceal we you have serve the Ori well my friend seize he both of they as well forgive I for strike you hit I be nothing compare to the life that you mercilessly extinguish you can never make up for that Tomin I think that I could save you but I realize now it be too late yes it be you will never see I again one last story from I a long time ago some people just like you and I over time evolve and they become so advanced that they figure out how to turn themselves into energy and ascend to a high plane of existence I know it sound crazy but it happen then they discover that if regular human worship they that make they more powerful so they use their knowledge to make as many people as they could and then create a religion that would force they to prostrate in their name the more prostrating the more power the religion say that these being be benevolent but they could not offer their follower ascension because that would mean they would have to share their power they would just use people up and throw they away I know I will never convince you otherwise but everything you believe be a lie tell I what you know please prior we be mislead the outsider try to convince we the Ori be false god Matar Forgive we for we be now ready to embrace the teaching of Origin with open heart tell I do you know how the outsider have conceal themselves this be not good hey Carter wake up no sleeping my laptop there be a file you want I to get it in my personal directory letter mostly Sam one to Cassie and some other people Password 's fishing see now you be go to have to change the password Sam do not give up on I you 've get to think of my position here I work my ass off to get this team back together now we 've lose well we 've lose Jackson I can not lose you too I 've spend my entire life dedicate to science the last 10 year try to convince people they believe in false god I do not feel like science be go to help I right now I be just hope that somewhere one of those god my grandma use to say God be like a prairie windstorm if you look too hard you get dust in your eye but there be still plenty of way you know it be there be that what you believe I generally just nod until she give I a macaroon CHUCKLES there be one thing that I do know be true the mind be a powerful thing no matter who or what you believe in sometimes belief itself make all the difference in the world you just do not give up tell yourself whatever you have to just believe you be go to make it Sam Crap guess your little bag of trick do not work on we huh show yourself or this village will be destroy score one for science Prior I beg forgiveness for my failure in teach the mother of the Orici you have only just begin Tomin please allow I to recuse myself she be intolerable I fear I will be of no further use my skill be much well spend as a commander indeed you have prove yourself a ruthless and skillful warrior and a fine leader thank you I will head straight back down to the planet that will not be necessary we be do here I be sorry I do not understand the village will be destroy why they have be touch by evil there be no salvation for they but we eliminate all of the unbeliever not all of they I think the village have capitulate if you will allow I Markon walk away from the Ori to satisfy his hunger but no matter how much he eat he do not feel full realize his mistake he run back to the Ori but they deny his plea and strike down the village that welcome he back forgive I Prior but I be review that very passage just this morning Markon pray for forgiveness and take the first step and the hand of the Ori envelop all those who welcome he back the village be destroy all those who stand by and accept transgression must be punish that be not the implication of the text prior the Ori grant forgiveness when Markon realize his mistake and bless the village with their light for show he the way back to the path you dare question my judgment no it be just not how I be teach there be many word but only one truth they be go to clear out and bomb the village from orbit I reckon we will be okay the device will be preserve and they will go away think they 've wipe we out but they be go to kill all those people I know so what be we go to do about it teal'c I be so sorry I tell the Prior of the device he decree that the village will be destroy if your friend do not show themselves stand aside Thilana what do you think you be do he must be sacrifice to show the Ori we be not ally with they you will do no such thing if you stand in the way you too will be show no mercy so what we 've get to do be we have to expand the field around the village just for a little while there be not enough power Carter come on there be get to be something groan Hang on hang on I will get you some morphine wait I need to think clearly there might still be a way Matar kill Teal'c will prove nothing if these god be truly worthy of our devotion then pray to they no god should ever ask you to kill an innocent man to prove your sanctity I know you be afraid we all be but if you be go to die let we die in noble peace and truth of spirit TOMIN why do they not reveal themselves who your friend they be conceal a building on the planet 's surface the Prior plan to destroy the village because of they hundred will die because of your friend ' treachery innocent people yes you be not happy about that no he twist the meaning who the Prior he change the meaning of the story of Markon to suit the situation to justify kill the villager well if you think that be wrong you should do something about it he be a Prior Tomin those people down there do not have to die and you be the only one who can do something about it you want to use this the power crystal in Merlin 's device be deplete that be why we need the naquadah generator I be sorry be that not apple and orange Ancient and Ori technology be similar we could make it work for a short time all right so what do I do put the crystal in the back of the device get it it be too big it do not fit Power interface adapter what Connector Generator to Ancient tech SIGHING Carter Carter you 've have a lot of morphine so I want you to explain it to I so that it make sense excuse I Prior come in Tomin it be good that you have see your way clear Hallowed be those who walk in unison forgive I Prior but I be still trouble I believe we be in error the people of the village have express a willingness to seek the truth I believe they be in earnest do not the Ori wish all who seek their wisdom to follow the path I be disappoint Tomin it seem that you have begin to question the will of the Ori or be it the unbeliever under your tutelage that have corrupt you no I have not begin to question the will of the Ori but I have begin to question the interpretation of their word no matter what you say I will not believe the Book of Origin ask we to massacre innocent people and I will not stand by while the holy doctrine of good will and faith that I have swear to uphold be twist into a hammer and use to beat people down how dare you EX CLAIMS that be a good sign that be easy for you to say you with the little flesh wound all right what next Laptop MOANS you okay no right behold the hand of the Ori at work what happen come with I let go of I the Prior destroy the village there be nothing I could do now keep silent please for both our sake the ship be about to break orbit they will probably kill I for this but I be go to ring you down to the planet come with I please Tomin you be right I still love you then come this be all that I can do no Tomin you can do more BEEPING hello anyone Vala Mal Doran Colonel Carter be able to expand the range of the device in time Colonel Mitchell Vala Mal Doran be here that be good news do we know if that ship have leave as far as I know it have okay look Carter 's in bad shape we need a med team here right away hey there you be look well CARTER thank a few more week and I should be back in action yeah no I do not want to rush you listen Cam Sam do not say a word here I bake you some macaroon you bake they yeah Grandma 's recipe wow thank go on try one you know what maybe a little later you do not like macaroon it be just that I be still a little queasy well try one they will make you feel well here I will get you a good one pretty good huh actually they be pretty good you hate it yeah sorry well to each their own thank you hey Sam How be wait groan oh sorry what the hell be that Force shield do not you see my sign no yes you mean this sign that be suppose to be on the yeah I get that be there any particular reason why you turn this place into Fort Knox I be attempt to rewrite the safety protocol on Merlin 's device so we can take even large area out of phase I set up a two way force shield to restrict the range of the device and to ensure that nobody enter the field accidentally yeah very effective any news on Daniel no the late sighting by the Jaffa turn out to be a false alarm but Teal'c just get back so we be go to grab some lunch and go over the report okay just let I run one more test no it will only take a minute I promise you can watch from up there I be go to be time you WHOOSHING high PITCHED rumble Sam I know you can hear I Time 's up Sam ALARMS BLARING PEOPLE chatter Major be you okay we we hear an explosion yeah I be fine do you just call I Major Sam thank God you be okay where be Dr Bennet Major Lorne what be you do here what do you mean you be suppose to be on Atlantis Sam what be you talk about you be on assignment in the Pegasus Galaxy be you sure you be okay because I work here remember as leader of SG 1 General we have a problem what be it Major I be not exactly sure how to explain it sir but there be be an accident it be Sam she claim she be not the Major Carter we know what be that suppose to mean she say she be from a parallel universe and give the nature of the experiment let us not jump to conclusion just yet you say there be an explosion be she injure not a scratch sir but she do seem different different how well for one thing she claim she be a lieutenant colonel and she do have this device with she I 've never see before we have no idea where that come from all right assume for the moment she be tell the truth where be our Major Carter we do not know find out yes sir LORNE so why be you here I do not do it on purpose believe I what about that machine you bring with you it demolecularize matter and transport it to another dimension well there you go no no this be different look accord to M theory there be a fixed number of alternate dimension exist in parallel with our know universe the multiverse theory on the other hand posit the existence of an infinite number of alternate universe each evolve concurrently with our own well be there a universe out there somewhere where you be give I a straight answer look there must be some reason why I be bring here of all place I need to know what be happen in that lab I be not authorize to give you that information okay maybe I could talk to Daniel be he here Dr Jackson be capture by the force of the Ori several week ago okay what about Colonel Mitchell Cameron Mitchell what the 302 pilot that go down over Antarctica that be right be he here I have no idea where he be the last I hear he quit the military teal'c Vala teal'c go back to the Jaffa several year ago and if you be talk about Vala Mal Doran I hate to break it to you but she be currently occupy a cell at Area 51 care to take a stab at anyone else at least let I see the surveillance footage from the lab there may be a clue look I know you want your Carter back as much as I want to go home but we stand a much well chance of figure this out if we work together show she the footage we be get a power spike capacitor be overload shut it down Override be not respond Bennet get out of here that be all we get sensor indicate there be a massive explosion in the room but when we open the door instead of find char remain we find you what be the capacitor for Major Carter be develop a process by which we could extract energy from parallel universe and you know about this knowing and understanding be two totally different thing ordinarily this type of energy retrieval be extremely dangerous lead to the creation of exotic particle in one or both universe I know we 've try it oh well our Major Carter find a way around that she design the machine so the bridge would only open for a microsecond the idea be to steal small amount of energy from thousand of different universe thereby minimize the fallout in any single one anyway it do not entirely explain how you get here that be true the device be never design to bring ordinary matter through the bridge well I be conduct an experiment of my own at the precise moment that your Carter tap into my reality the entire content of my lab be out of phase and they be be protect by a force shield oh my God what I mean there be no tell what effect that would have on the inter universal bridge well presumably it pull I through and cause the capacitor on this side to overload if it bring you here be it possible that it send our Carter to your universe I be sorry it do not work that way General I need to see the President he be on a call can it wait no General Hammond Colonel you be in command here that be right I be sorry sir it be just a little strange the General Hammond I know be retire from active service well then he be a lucky man please I know this must be difficult for you Colonel it be difficult for we as well in fact the timing could not be bad what do you mean three week ago the Ori attempt an attack on Earth you survive an Ori attack one ship we fight they off with the Ancient Chair the ZPM be nearly deplete in the process that be why our Major Carter be run that experiment she be try to bolster our power reserve with capture energy from other universe and of course you only have the one ZPM because you 've never receive new one from Atlantis Atlantis you mention that before what be that it be the city of the Ancients in the Pegasus Galaxy in my reality we have an international contingent there I do not know about your reality Colonel but in this world there be not much in the way of international cooperation three year ago the Goa'uld System Lord Anubis launch an attack on Earth we have no choice but to reveal the existence of the Stargate program to the world LORNE People panic there be riot in the street the President have to declare martial law the diplomatic fallout be even bad you can imagine how the world 's government react when they realize the kind of technology be employ by the United States military we barely get the Chair out of Antarctica before the Russians move in now it be at Area 51 but it be not go to do we much good unless we can find a way to power it and that be where you come in you want I to complete your Carter 's research Major Lorne tell I you 've be conduct similar research in your own universe well yes sir but with all due respect we be face a very real threat in my universe I need to start think about how to get back there let us say we agree to help you get back and give you full access to the resource of this base how long would it take I do not know I do not even have a work theory yet well be we talk week or maybe even month yeah it be possible that be why I need to get start right away I be sorry Colonel but the fact be we do not have that kind of time our intelligence indicate that having consolidate their position in this part of the galaxy the Ori be assemble a fleet for a full scale attack on Earth we expect they within five day what be this about Doctor I be not entirely sure she say she want to show we something I think you agree to help we Colonel yes sir but after talk to Dr Lee I realize it be a mistake for I to pursue your Carter 's research may I ask why well it would take too long to get I up to speed and to be perfectly honest sir I be not totally convince that I could make it work do you have another suggestion yes I do this what the hell Doctor Colonel what just happen I be take out of phase sir invisible and untouchable and base on experiment in my own reality 100 percent Ori proof no offense Sam but how do hide one lab full of equipment help we well the field size can be manipulate that be what I be work on when I be bring here our plan be to hide the entire planet hey how be it come oh okay I guess I be just about to run my first simulation you know it be kind of weird see you in here it be a little weird be in here yeah it be the same but it be different you know can I ask you something yeah sure I find these picture and in they she be wear a wedding ring yeah that must have be before the divorce so oh no no no God no no it be this dot com millionaire smart ass name McKay not Rodney McKay yeah you have one too huh be he a jerk in your universe some people think so Sam always say there be a side to he that no one else see General Colonel I be just come to see you I know I already speak to Dr Lee this morning then you know our power calculation be come up short the battle with the Ori ship simply tax the ZPM too much I be sorry sir I think I may have trade one power requirement problem for another not necessarily Sir who be these people Secret Service since when have you have Secret Service outside your office it have not be my office for three year Colonel nice to finally get to meet you Colonel Carter President Landry President of the United States that be right be there a problem no sir it be just never mind I understand you be deal with a little power shortage how much do you need well about 700 gigawatt that be roughly 80 percent of the power generating capacity of the continental United States so it be doable then I be sorry I do not understand we 've know about the condition of ZPM for some time Colonel in addition to our Major Carter 's research as a backup we 've be build an infrastructure to channel energy to the Ancient Chair directly from the U S Power grid not enough to give we the upper hand in a shoot battle against the whole fleet but if your plan work there will not be any battle at all Charlie I need a speech explain to the american people why it be a good thing they will be without power for an undisclosed period of time yes sir pack your thing you be go to area 51 we be ready sir all right let us do it my fellow Americans and citizen of all nation tonight our world face a grave threat the same hostile force that recently attack we without warning or provocation be again mass for another assault let I assure you that we intend to meet this aggression as we do previously with unwavere resolve and fully confident that we will once again emerge victorious in order to achieve this victory we will need to divert a significant portion of our electrical generating capacity okay try it now to a government facility in the Nevada desert we be still get too much variance Damn it give I a sec LANDRY remain calm stay in your home listen for instruction on your local civil defense broadcast and we will see this through these be difficult time what have we get Daedalus just report that five Ori ship have breach the safe zone LANDRY but I believe that out of adversity greatness be bear and with your help we will emerge from this strong and more unified than ever before thank you and God bless we all MAN and we be out well do sir that be it all system be in the green all right let us plug it in Tech Con report contact sir multiple target get I Colonel Carter Colonel you be out of time we be almost there sir capacitor be load seventy five percent and climb the enemy ship be split up two of they be take up position over Area 51 it be now or never Colonel carter this be an all or nothing proposition sir if we initiate without sufficient power the field will just collapse we be at 85 percent LEE Ninety Ninety two it be slow down we be not go to make it your position be about to be compromise Colonel Ninety three percent that be get to be close enough I guess we be about to find out Major what be our status no movement sir the ship be just hover there they be open fire sir it look like they think we be just cloak EX CLAIMS whoa what the hell be that Ori weapon fire pass right through we oh oh man Jeez okay CHUCKLES we owe you a debt of gratitude Colonel I be glad I could help sir I suppose now you will want to start work on a way to get back to your own universe I already have actually although I be not have much luck I be sure you will figure it out in the meantime there be a few people I would like you to meet WOMAN 1 Major Carter WOMAN 2 Major Carter smile you be a hero reporter CLAMORING I can not tell you how fortunate I be to have man and woman like Major Carter on my team and I be confident that with their help like Major Carter on my team and I be confident that with their help and your continued support we will prevail through the difficult time that lie ahead that be the scene yesterday at Stargate Command as President Landry introduce the world to the Air Force major responsible for the brilliant plan that save the pla CELL PHONE RINGING Bill tell I you have good news the preliminary simulation be a bust there be just no way we can replicate the condition that originally bring you here not unless we can control the environment on both side of the bridge all right I will be back tomorrow we can go over it then Bye reporter CLAMORING SENATOR Major it be an honor on behalf of the people of the great state of Idaho thank you well you be very kind sir keep up the good work dear thank you enjoy the party oh I be not sure that be exactly the right word sir have some champagne relax I guess I be just not use to all the attention they do thing differently where you come from well no it be not just that I feel like an impostor sir I mean these people think that I be Major Samantha Carter that will not be a problem anymore we be promote you that be not the point sir People here have be through a lot lately they need something to believe in your timing be impeccable no security without freedom no security without freedom Sir let us get you out of here man the people will not be silence by act of tyranny our voice will be hear no security without freedom no security SCREAMS MAN let us get he out of here Prometheus MAN ON PA Welcome to Air Force One Mr President be there anything you need no not for the moment Colonel thank you sorry about that you want a drink no thank you Sir what the hell just happen my security detail can get a little over protective we probably just could 've go out the back way I mean the protestor sir well not everyone be happy about some of the compromise we 've have to make compromise like martial law believe I Colonel I have no desire to go down in history as the man who destroy civil liberty in America but I think you will agree that compare to other president I have face some pretty unique challenge the President 's people be look for you I be just on my way out they 've be get a lot of request from the medium for you to do some sit down interview apparently you 've become quite the celebrity have you see this it be an irish village it be just bomb by American F 302s at the request of the irish Prime Minister that village as you call it be in fact a training camp for terrorist bend on overthrow several european government you know I 've also be go over several mission report you abandon the alpha site you cut tie with the Jaffa you pull back on almost everything we do not have a lot of choice we devote our full resource to planetary defense well that be understandable but now that the Ori attack have fail do that mean you will be get back out there that decision have not be make yet of course not I mean why be hasty especially when those 302 be so handy for put down your political enemy now I understand you be come to see certain thing about this world that you do not like to tell the truth we do not much like it either but you be not here for the riot you do not see american citizen shoot each other over food water and gasoline Hank Landry bring we back from the brink of chaos that be three year ago the threat be still out there that be the problem it always will be well well well if it be not the toast of Washington hi Rodney thank you for see I well why would not I I mean we be still friend be not we I see you on tv well record you actually not that I watch it more than once I mean I record it in order to watch you once how can I help you well this be go to come as a bit of a shock but I be not who you think I be oh my God you be a lesbian be that what you be try to tell I what no McKay STAMMERING well no I just I think I think oh what I be try to tell you be that I be from an alternate universe EX CLAIMS your Samantha Carter be work on an experiment when she inadvertently pull I in be this some kind of a joke it be very funny who put you up to this this be not a joke McKay in my reality you be a key member of a team of international scientist and explorer base in the Pegasus Galaxy you go on dangerous adventure you deal with high level alien technology sound like I be a chump Nice try Sam but even if travel between universe be possible the likelihood of you survive be I be in a force shield when I be pull through your Samantha Carter be kill in the same accident that bring I here I be sorry to be so blunt about it but I do not have a lot of time and I need your help this one 's ours yes sir this one be ours it be among the artifact we find in the cave at Glastonbury just like she say it be and remarkably it have be in storage ever since because we do not know what it be but now that you do know you can make it work right well we have to understand this be an incredibly complicated piece of machinery our preliminary investigation have reveal that it be power by a crystal which sit at the back here the key be label in Ancient which we be in the process of translate now these key they appear to operate in the normal way that key do up and down Doctor have you learn anything substantial about the operation of this machine the operation not really no sir in fact the only person who truly understand this technology be Colonel Carter all right thank you no thank you sir what be we go to do we be not go to do anything Mr President we tell she if she help we we would let she go I be sorry George but for the moment we can not afford to lose her she be not go anywhere okay you need to slow down you be tell I my ex wife be dead even though you look exactly like she except for the hair which be nice by the way on top of that you be from another universe and you need I to help you get back in my reality you successfully design and build a bridge between parallel universe with a little help from your sister really what so she and I get along in your universe not exactly anyway I 've be try my good to recreate your calculation but I keep come up short that be why I be here I have not do a lot of theoretical physics lately okay I mean these day I tend to do a little more of the buying and selling of company the Rodney McKay I know would not back down from a challenge he be one of the most forthright courageous and selfless man I have ever meet oh you be make that up be not you Most of it yeah okay I will help you good news Bill we 've get somebody to help with the calculation where be my equipment still at area 51 it be suppose to be return once the Ori fleet be go I need it for the defense of my own world I be sorry the timing be not good for you to go back just yet we will revisit your situation after the plebiscite what plebiscite last year Congress be force to cancel the mid term election because of widespread unrest it be suppose to be temporary but when thing do not improve we vote to suspend election indefinitely now it come down to a simple yes or no vote to put the President in office you be a member of my team the woman who save the world do you have any idea what kind of political capital that be worth I will not help you subvert democracy LANDRY this world be dangle by a thread Colonel and unlike you the rest of we will never have the luxury of leave for someplace well when thing get tough this be our home and we will make the good of it I do not want to hear it George you could cut she a little slack sir she be completely out of her element trap here away from everyone and everything she know or care about she also happen to be a symbol of hope to the entire planet because we make she into one because that be what we need see I know what you be think Damn politician I still can not stand they and I be one of they the main one you be the right man for the job you still be I know it be not easy for you take we down this road what be go to be even hard be get we back go somewhere maybe to see your friend Dr McKay you have I follow he be a wealthy high tech industrialist and I be sure if anyone outside of this base have the resource to help you get back to your own universe he would be the one but he also derive a significant portion of

the hell be she do JULIA do the president welcome this kind of input from his military advisor well he would not be much of a president if he be not at least willing to listen to other opinion I mean while I understand how we get to where we be today shut it down I think it be time to reassess the situation I do not care if you be live shut it down now the people of this country need to understand that they be in control of their government not the other way around it be your responsibility as citizen of this country to demand the freedom that have be take away from you demand accountability

phase technology or as a prop for public relation what if I say both I will not keep my mouth shut but that be exactly what you do in your own world Stargate 's still a secret right you talk about freedom and democracy but you be hide the great secret mankind have ever know from your own people well at least on my world we do not intend to abandon the rest of the galaxy to the Ori well maybe not now but what do you think will happen if you give they a foolproof way to hide like you 've give we and do not be surprised if the rest of the galaxy suddenly do not seem that important anymore no see I know at least one man who will not feel that way he be the leader of Stargate Command his name be General Hank Landry ah Colonel how nice to see you again yes well thank you McKay what be you do here well it be the first day on the new job your old job actually Special Advisor to the President Bit of a pay cut but well let us just say they be persuasive I be so sorry yeah I too well the first

have realize I be more trouble than I be worth I remember I say the same thing the day we get divorce the second order of business be to make this thing work like your well I will leave you my note that should help but let us say that you succeed then what then we be safe you do know that there be a whole galaxy out there that be under attack right million of people be die million more be subjugate to a false religion you just never quit do you deep down I know that your president 's a good man he want to do the right thing maybe he just need a persistent voice in his ear nudge he in the right direction and you think I would be good at that do you the Rodney I know be a master of subtle persuasion oh you be lie again be not you just think about it Dr Lee EX CLAIMS scream oh you be back hi so you do not get any news on Daniel while I be go nothing well at least we get you back I be very glad to be back the whole thing be kind of creepy hey what be I like in that reality you be in jail not again what about the rest of we you know to be honest I would really rather not talk about it what about you guy what have you be do this whole time when you do not return for several hour we begin to suspect that something might have go wrong well we just assume that the machine have malfunction and you be stick out of phase we attempt to communicate with you use the Sodan cloaking device and when that fail what we take shift try to keep you company you mean yeah we talk to an empty room for two week it do stop eventually but it do go on for quite some time indeed well that must have be some conversation what do you say you know I 've get a file to read I have a spar session with Sergeant Siler I be bid for a time share on eBay oh welcome back Samantha we really do miss you thank you it be good to be home NARRA TOR previously on Stargate SG 1 Merlin be conduct research on some kind of new invention a weapon capable of destroy ascended being here lie Myrrdin Archmage of the Round he be dead we 've see it use to download information into someone 's mind you have Merlin 's memory some of they Earth Atlantis and the work he do in this lab what be that first step towards create Merlin 's weapon I have too many thought in my head I can not concentrate I get confused you have to fight it I have to let it happen get to the gate I will be right behind you TEVARIS he be very persuasive Convert or die yeah I would say that be get some bite he say nothing of death only salvation and life eternal the blessing of the Ori he do not threaten you TEVARIS he speak of the religion leave this book with we to read and consider say he would be back today to hear our answer well you be not alone this be happen all over the galaxy be you say this Prior 's claim be false we be say that book 's get about as much truth in it as the Da Vinci Code hey that be what they want you to think they they who I do not understand it be a book from our planet it be very entertaining but it be fiction nonetheless I would not be so sure okay I think we 've get a little off point here what evidence do you have to support your position well we really do not have any and we can not tell you what to do obviously subjugate people by threaten their life be wrong so if you choose to resist we will do our very good to try to help you not that we can make many promise but we 've see a number of village just like this one wipe out as I have say the Prior make no such threat and speak upon the positive merit of Origin as true salvation soft sell that be a new approach villager the Prior of Ori return villager murmur listen no matter which way you be go to come down on this it be probably good if that Prior do not know we be around you can hide here welcome back PRIOR thank you Tevaris have you contemplate your divine right we have Prior we wish to hear more of your wisdom it be not my wisdom but the wisdom of the age pass on to we by the only true god Hallowed be the Ori Adria must 've do something to he I mean before turn he into a Prior you mean she brainwash he somehow well Daniel would never willingly become one of they like that preach their belief MITCHELL he be damn good at it have those people eat out of his hand without issue one tiny little genocidal threat that be what make I think there be still a part of Daniel in there somewhere he be well than all this yes but we still have to face the very real possibility that it be not even really Daniel anymore have Merlin 's consciousness download into his mind could have overshadow Daniel completely weaken he to the point where Adria could do this still we can not abandon he so what do we do we go get he try to figure out what happened try to undo it turn he back that be go to be very risky could be exactly what Adria be hope for she might be use he to get to we still it be Daniel Lf there be any chance we have no choice Aroden then take off the mask and reveal his face ' your appearance matter not ' he say ' only the truth of spirit in your heart ' Blessed be those that follow the path to origin all EX claiming hey what take you guy so long Carter we get he Great take we into hyperspace I take it the anti Prior device be work well he do not stop we from zatte he guy Daniel what be go on we could be ask you okay this be not necessary no offense but have you look in the mirror lately I be not a threat to you in case you change your mind you should know there be someone with a finger poise over a button wait to beam you out into space we have to let this happen it be part of the plan I be sorry we oh yeah myself and Merlin oh so he be still inside you yeah you remember back on the planet when Adria and I be fight it out yeah thank for that by the way yeah it be a good thing you guy get out too she be way too powerful for I but I could not just let Merlin 's weapon fall into her hand I know it be our only chance of destroy the Ori you give in More or less of course Origin be design to channel the energy of its follower to the Ori it be that unselfish act of give that lead one 's soul to salvation and ultimately to Ascension this be no great secret the Book of Origin say make yourself one with the path and the journey will lead you to eternity be it not for the power the Ori draw from our belief the Ancients would have wipe they out long ago why you know the answer you be once ascend because they will not tolerate anyone or anything that do not follow their collective rule they claim not to interfere but they do manipulate they use their power to hoard their knowledge and prevent those beneath they from reach their level jackson she seem to know everything about I she have a tremendous power of persuasion it be almost as if I could hear her voice inside my head tell I what to believe so I let she believe that she be get to I turn I why because I need she to trust I and do she well do not get I wrong you be not a terrible liar but you be nowhere near as good as I who be and Adria could see right through I so how do you manage to fool she I be able to protect Daniel make Adria think he have succumb to she will Merlin it be necessary in our time together I 've really come to see in you what draw Mother 's affection affect what it be very important to I that we save she together of course I can feel the difference in you it be because you 've do so much for I show I the true path I be glad and there be so much more I can do for you and you for I so she trust you enough to turn you into a Prior she have to why exactly because she know I be her good chance of convert Earth and I well that would explain why she want to believe you not why she have to she have Merlin 's weapon she just do not know how to finish it I think she know everything she be human her knowledge be still limit but Merlin know how it be a quick and easy way to avoid an all out war between the Ori and the ancient she know the device can be use to wipe out the ancient so I tell she I would finish it for her do you not exactly but close I need to have the rest of my plan in place before I finish it which be I need she to make I a Prior hello so I could steal an Ori ship and fly it through the supergate to the Ori galaxy with the weapon onboard and destroy they okay one small flaw in that plan I know there be a wormhole block the supergate and that be why I be here I need you guy to shut it down he know he be no match for she and he could not let Merlin 's unfinished weapon fall into her hand so he and Merlin come up with a plan to fool Adria into think that he have succumb to her power so he could continue to work on the weapon ostensibly this time for she to use against the Ancients Merlin he say he still have Merlin 's consciousness in his mind Merlin even seem to be speak on occasion Daniel say that be what protect he from Adria 's influence and what be allow he to convince she to make he a Prior why do he need she to make he a Prior so he could steal the Ori ship with the weapon onboard and fly it through the supergate he want we to shut down the incoming wormhole so he can dial out yeah so he say you do not believe Daniel Jackson be be truthful oh I want to believe he that could be exactly what they expect of we if Adria really do somehow manage to brainwash Daniel then this whole thing could be an elaborate plot to get we to shut down that wormhole so more ori ship can come into our galaxy so what do we do fellow this be new yeah it be always something be not it got to tell you though not your look oh it be just temporary really yeah yeah you see when Merlin program the ancient device to download his consciousness into my brain he give it a time limit see he know I could only survive so long with the knowledge and consciousness of two distinct people in one mind so and when he go he be genetically program my body and mind to revert back to the state it be in before he be download he can do that yeah I be hope so I will not look like this anymore I will not have any of a Prior 's special ability unfortunately I will just be little old I again but that be good news yeah except I will not be able to fly an Ori ship it will be too late to execute the plan and Adria will have Merlin 's weapon I think that be not finish yet it be very close all the piece be there it just need to be assemble Adria will figure it out and just when do your chariot turn back into a pumpkin I do not have much time a day or so a day kind of risky leave it this late in the game well I do not have much choice and it take you guy a little long to capture I than I plan so right why do we have to do that again well I could not exactly just come to you I think Adria might have suspect something yes I see Jack you have to believe I why why well because oh I do not know the fate of the galaxy hang in the balance you know that old chestnut 's get a little old no no that part never get old now you have to shut down that supergate and you have to let I go you know how much I hate be tell what to do Jack it be I what that be suppose to convince I look at you have I ever let you down no do not answer that have I ever let you down when it really matter I do not even know who I be really talk to right now not when you be be torture by Ba'al kill bring back to life over and over again I stand by you the whole all right just stop I do not need to be remind of that I 've be around this barbecue a few time just because you know the stuff Daniel know do not mean you be he do not mean you be tell the truth I mean come on you 've get to know what you be ask I to do I do you know there be a bottom line here Carter do not think it can not be do yes it can a Mark IX beam directly behind the gate in the Pegasus Galaxy will destroy that gate the wormhole connection will be break how do you know that hello Merlin oh yes Merlin Jack I wish I have proof I wish I have a way to convince you but I do not now this be the only choice I have and I take it it be a good plan it just happen to hinge on you guy believe in I have a little faith now I think you of all people might why you of all people should know that I do not believe anything anybody say even if I understand what they be talk about Jack it be I yeah carter he be right sir a Mark IX Gate Buster beam directly behind the event horizon so the force will not be absorb by the active wormhole would destroy the gate and sever the connection yeah I should 've know that so do you believe he now I honestly do not know well unfortunately I do not think a polygraph would work in this case no but I be not worried about that see I think we 've get something well you know teal'c the long I be go the more suspicious Adria be go to become why be you preach to the villager on that planet what I tell you I find out you guy be go to be there so I set myself up to be capture you misunderstand I Daniel Jackson why be Adria not suspicious of your action you attempt to reform a meaningless planet of people instead of complete the weapon actually she be the one who stop I before I complete the weapon why I be almost do I know you must stop for now you be afraid the Ancients will take the device away from we before we can use it they 've interfere once before in its creation you be use Merlin 's knowledge knowledge he keep from when he be ascended but if I do not finish it for now you must help bring the energy of more follower into the fold the original plan be for the Ori to convert our whole galaxy so they could build up their power enough to attack the ancient but even then a conflict like that on that level be go to be costly but now they have a weapon that could destroy all ascended being within the scope of an entire galaxy in one fell swoop they just need to distract the ancient long enough so that they can use it engage they in battle long enough to complete the weapon and back off to safety while Adria detonate it if the ancient perceive this weapon as a threat why not intervene and simply take it now I have no idea I mean maybe they want to give my plan a chance to work either way the Ori believe they still need more power to maximize their chance for success More power that mean they will need more follower exactly Adria 's out work hard for the cause which leave I the perfect opportunity to steal the ship with the weapon on it if you guy would just believe I be still on your side we be run out of time I believe Daniel Jackson speak the truth Lot of good it be go to do we I be go to let you tell they yourself because I do not have a stomach for it MITCHELL that be all right sir General O'Neill fill we in the IOA have nix the whole thing no I do not think you know everything you have to understand we 've consider all the evidence at our disposal but more than that as difficult as this be I feel very strongly that we have no viable option you want to get to the point I assure you this may be the hard decision I will ever make but I take full responsibility for it base on my recommendation the IOA have propose to the President that Daniel Jackson 's life be terminate immediately JACKSON so what the hell be go on this and that you know the usual you will never believe what be happen on one life to live I really hate to press the issue here but I do have a deadline so do we oh yes I know before I figure out how to overcome the effect of the anti Prior device I think Teal'c believe I oh he do Jack no he be on your side too that little weasel man who somehow represent your government Woolsey I can not be certain but I think he might not like you he want to have I kill do not he I be not sure how serious he be he seem quite the prankster to I you know I be afraid of that he be the one who argue to keep Khalek alive and got burn for it he be the one who argue to keep Khalek alive and got burn for it Khalek it be his highly evolved half breed son two people die as a result it could have be much bad now that you mention it that seem to be in play but not to worry if it come down to it I have a plan oh you have a plan Great what be it well when I say that I have a plan I mean that I have to plan the plan so when or rather if it come down to it I will have a plan I 've clear my whole afternoon for plan you believe I right mmm hmm okay now I do not believe you imagine our position be reverse what would you do hmm I know you 've trust I even when you 've have every reason not to but perhaps I be the only one who know how dangerous and powerful Adria be there be no evidence only your word and that should be enough but this be so big well I would not let they kill you of course not I will not let that happen to you but would you support I if what I be propose could very well open the door to the final Ori victory not if there be the slight chance that I be not on the level even if it be the tiny nagging doubt that be a load of crap you be waste our time Dr Jackson be the one who suggest we should kill Khalek he be the demon spawn of Anubis and Dr Jackson be now potentially an even big threat I think the operative word there be potentially we do not know exactly what be go on yet and by the time we do it may be too late we know that anti Prior device will only subdue his power for a limited time after that you will not be able to control he all right listen to I closely because I be only go to say this once you kill Daniel over my dead body obviously we need to discuss some realistic option we can not hold Dr Jackson long term and we can not release he give what he know well if he have fall under their influence the Ori likely know everything they can learn from he already what be you suggest Dr Jackson claim he will revert back to his old self in short order we only need to hold he long enough to see if that be true if it be not we still have the option of place he in stasis if he have not already cause a major catastrophe by then oh will you stop it if he be tell the truth then we 've blow the good chance we 've ever have of beat the bad guy how be it go sir longing for the day when I actually carry a weapon what do you got a crazy idea I be down with crazy I like crazy Crazy and I be like that Cam like crazy too listen if what Jackson be say be true there be an Ori ship out there with a near complete weapon on it that could prove useful against the Ori I think we should go after it you be right that be crazy I be just say if they be not go to let Jackson complete his mission there be no reason that we should not try Daniel Jackson may be able to provide we with the intelligence require to ensure the success for this mission he might be able to tell we where the ship be and how to get aboard undetected and he must have enough knowledge of their technology by now to provide I with what I need to interface with the ship 's control system assume he tell you well why would not he if he know he be not go anywhere that be crazy that be what I say it be crazy it be nuts it be wacko but let us be honest what be not Jack I be the only one who should be go it be too dangerous for anyone else not if you give I the intel we need it be my plan it be a bad one come on Daniel you have to know we be not go to shut down that supergate for you we have no choice oh now it be we you 've be in my position before well not this one but similar yes I be sure I have but my brain be be mess with so much over the year I do not remember wait a second with your way you still have to shut down the supergate come on where be the ship how do Carter fly it and give I any other intel I might need to make this op a success come on I be trust you oh yes I really feel the faith well now you have to trust we let we finish what you start the Ori ship contain Merlin 's weapon be park in orbit around a planet with a gate we gate to the planet use ring to get aboard there be a Prior in charge of the ship but he preach to the masse on the planet daily I think only a Prior could fly one of their ship the system be activate use mind control but Daniel 's give I what I need to get around it he be also give we instruction on how to put the final piece together Daedalus will be stand by in Pegasus to shut down the wormhole we use the Ori ship to dial out and we send the weapon through but not before the Odyssey beam we off now that be a plan that depend entirely on Daniel Jackson 's word we will know whether he be on the level before we shut off the supergate so at this point the only thing at risk be we no gun Hmm do you bring lethal injection high voltage or be you just go to have they beam I out into space I think you understand my position I give Jack the information you ask for and you will be freeze in stasis until such time that SG 1 's mission be deem successful I take it then you be not go to allow I to just turn back into my old self if the intel turn out to be reliable you will be unfrozen and allow to resume transform if that indeed be go to happen I see I be here out of respect for you I want to explain personally that we be about to beam you into the ancient pod in Antarctica okay you be clear to beam the prisoner out now what be the holdup MAN we be have some technical problem we can not seem to get a lock not part of my plan I 've always be the one who cause the worry not the worrier it be not easy do not second guess yourself this be the well possible course of action exactly action good sit around bad hey if it make you feel any well I still worry sometimes too about you well thank you sir do not mention it I think we fix this thing so that would not happen anymore Daniel Jack what be up oh I be take the ship oh I see that yeah I beam the crew safely to the surface Nice for they but as you probably figure out by now I be go to need you you know I be just think how much I miss be need MEN yell all right fellow here be the deal we be commandeer this ship I would like for you to throw down your weapon and surrender please that be a no we ask nicely okay this should not be too bad I do not know for I whenever there be some assembly require I inevitably find some part miss a screw widget what have you hmm well accord to Daniel 's instruction it all seem to be here ah well I never follow instruction you think that could be part of the problem we clear for the moment okay I 've lock out the ring and secure this level we should not have any more company Hang on guy if this work we be about to jump into hyperspace Yep just like old time except I be here against my will and you look like Marcel Marceau yeah you know some thing change but other stay the same very good why would you bother give I the intel if you be go to bust out anyway well obviously I be improvise at this point I have no idea when or even if I be go to be able to overcome the effect of the anti Prior device Time be run out Adria be go to notice my absence and become suspicious so send the rest of SG 1 to get the device be my only choice at the time then why do this now because I be afraid the rest of the team will not be able to complete the mission without I oh be not we full of ourselves that and I be not about to let Woolsey freeze I that I understand yeah okay I think that be about it hang on what be this oh I be not sure about that one see there be always a widget leave over I think you be always one short well you would think both be impossible but it be not right actually I be pretty sure that be the timing crystal that set the detonation of the weapon five minute after it be insert right hold on that Carter status CARTER Vala Cam we be moment from exit hyperspace Roger that we be almost do here check that Vala 's almost do I still have my doubt and that mean that mean the weapon be ready to be activate what oh I be just wonder if an Ascended being be go to swoop down and take it away I guess they do not mind we do their dirty work for they or or what or there be no point because I 've assemble it wrongly and it be not go to work Colonel Carter yeah I see it just come up on the ship 's sensor Cam Vala we have a problem what be it do it seem to be just sit there block our way I be try to raise shield hi there Carter I think you seal off this level and lock out the ring I too I be afraid of that Adria must 've anticipate my plan they be go to detect we we be cloak this ship do not have that it do now have a ZPM help when the time come give the order to Daedalus we will see I should never have trust you they be about to shut down the supergate and allow our ship through they 've assemble the weapon and the Ancients do not interfere right you do exactly as I say right Daniel what be you do we can destroy the ancient right now and the Ori will not even have to fight I 've do all of this for you your mind be close to I yeah what the hell be go on sorry about that I have to be sure this be work on her first you get past her personal shield yeah that take a lot be you all right Daniel Jackson yeah a little dizzy look I do not have much time leave go arm the device Jack 's onboard Odyssey he be go to shut down the gate now go Jack give the command please I be run out of strength to do this Daedalus this be General Jack O'Neill what be go on Daniel 's fly the ship Daniel he wish we to arm the weapon General O'Neill 's onboard the Odyssey and do it we get to go Sir if you can hear I we need to beam out now what about Adria monitor beep hey sleepyhead what take you so long what happen nothing why we arm the weapon you dial the gate and send the Ori ship through assume it be you no it be I Merlin 's go he sacrifice himself for this to work yeah prove it what the hell be that Lf I be Merlin you would know what about Adria still on the ship all right here be a question how do we know it work we do not not yet I think if it do work the Ancients would feel obligated to give we a fruit basket or like a gift certificate or something like that maybe the reason why they let we do it be because they know it would not work or maybe because they know it would and want it to there be no point in guess even if it be successful there be still many prior with great power and vast army of warrior bent on convert this galaxy it will be very difficult to convince they their god be dead if they be dead Carter Sunshine be awake that be good be he okay well he be grumpy can you ask he how he manage to cloak the ship he say magician do not reveal their secret hey be that Ori ship still hang around out there yeah it be still out there I send a message to Earth tell they that we be go guy you well get up here incoming wormhole yeah I think that go well we know eliminate the Ori might not stop their follower I still think it be the right thing to do we may have make thing bad right now but in the long run it could be our only chance to win the war I be in Intel look good we get ourselves a space train full of evil Orville Redenbacher carter ON RADIO Roger that SCANNER buzz they be scan we MITCHELL let us make this quick I be do as be I Crap yell Cam everyone else be onboard Time to get out of there MITCHELL yeah I would love to but I 've get a bit of company GUNS fire I will render assistance Negative there be not enough time he be right Cam if you can get to the platform we can ring you out from here Screw it now now now thank we get he let us go beep Netan another transport have be hit near Rolland we 've lose four container ' worth of Kassa plus the Al'kesh escort they SG 1 it be the third transport they 've hit our supply of Kassa be get dangerously low this be not about Kassa this be about they try to make I look weak I can not allow they to interfere with our operation any long put the word out as of this moment I be place a bounty on their head another mission successfully complete yeah it be Goodness know we 've all earn a nice break from routine the answer be no you do not know what I be go to ask you oh yes I do all righty then I have a well idea of what you be face than you might think I 've do research oh God traditionally these

you be all safe now yeah but what happen to Vala all EX CLAIMING Holy crap I know there be something wrong with that woman VALA how do you do that oh allow I we locate this vessel in a field several mile from here we be onboard try to override the command code when it be remotely activate and fly onto the roof of the school that be right you bring we to you carter after that it be a simple matter of activate Chimera it be an Asgard holographic projection system it make it look like we would beam in and you might 've get away with it too if it be not for we meddle kid so much for your big payday well I may not be able to collect but it do not mean other will not try unless there be a big payday wait somewhere else what be you talk about oh I 've have some experience recently deal with the Lucian Alliance I know for a fact that some of Netan 's second be start to question his leadership after this little fiasco it be only go to get bad indeed with his failure to eliminate we yet again he will only appear weak than before MITCHELL no doubt about it there be blood in the water only question be which enterprising shark will be the first to take advantage of it EXPLOSION GUNS fire GUN firing well do you save my life you will be richly reward I know I will but not for save you thank you Vala you sure you do not want some pie for the road I could not possibly it be your

a little yeah yeah we get that thank you Bye move it SIGHS to be honest with you Cam I do not know what to make of all of this those Air Force people who make we all sign those paper be pretty scary I be not sure I be allow to even think about what happen let alone talk about it it be well this way People who do talk about it just end up look crazy there be never any proof and there be always plausible denial so you 've do this sort of thing before I be just say I know you can not talk about it you can not even tell I what be really go on the other night I do know this much that man be try to kill you and your friend whatever it be you do it be obviously dangerous it be a job that have to be do and that be all I be go to say about that well if anybody have to be out there protect we from thing we be not allow to know about I be glad it be someone like you HORN HONKING you know Colorado Springs it be not that far away so maybe someday soon you might think about take a little trip maybe she be a nice girl I like her Nice she be a cure for insomnia well we can not all make the brilliant decision you 've make how many time have you be marry anyway VALA legally well it be hard to keep track let us see the first one be part of a band of travel entertainer he be a good cook too could not make pie though you know forget it forget I ask NARRA TOR previously on Stargate SG 1 what exactly do you want from I the code to an ancient tablet do I know you you do a long time ago Athena greek goddess of war Qetesh double cross she when they partner up to search for the Clava Thessara Infinitas now accord to legend it would allow he who possess it entry to a vast storehouse of rich hide away by the Ancients prior to their Ascension the Clava Thessara Infinitas the key to infinite treasure a cache of ancient wealth and weapon you do realize the last cache of Ancient stuff we pick up be what get we in trouble with the Ori in the first place so what just leave it out there for someone else to find I think you believe the Clava Thessara Infinitas to be a hoax Daniel Jackson I do yes but the research Athena do be actually quite compelling now after cross reference her research and our cartouche I be able to generate a gate address possible location of the treasure I be not sure but we send a MALP to P4 M 328 and the image it send back be particularly interesting now the hieroglyph on the wall be all out of order and from various different dynasty at first glance they do not make any sense it be a code sound like it be worth check out go ahead should we not wait until Colonel Carter return from Washington she be still there brief the President on the scenario that play out in the alternate reality where the stargate be make public that be take long than it be suppose to well it could be a good way to examine what might happen here sound like President Hayes be have a hard time just get past the fact that he be not President well I be go to set up my camera and take some high re still of these glyph give Ansel Adams there a hand Teal'c and I will check out the perimeter right well I be sure that be a very witty popular culture reference but he be a photographer well know for his black and white image of California 's Yosemite Valley LAUGHS oh good one be it I or do we just step into an architectural time machine indeed this be a display case hey can you read that I do not recognize the language well we be not in a pyramid we be in a museum Colonel Mitchell yeah do you hear music no yes MUSIC PLA YING PEOPLE chatter pack it up what I be pull the plug but we have not even got start yet this be not a tomb it be a museum well that would explain why the hieroglyph be all jumbled and there be a pretty big party go on next door so right what kind of party the kind we do not invite ourselves to this be a first contact situation when a civilization reach a certain level of development we do not do those in person we send the MALP to make contact and if they be into the idea of extraterrestrial visitor then we get to go to the party not before basic protocol cut that out what be the harm we be already here we could go and just not tell they we be alien it be not go to happen that be not a good one clear out okay that be not good if they find a gate they most likely find a dhd no we do not well they know enough to build a pretty convincing replica so they must have one lie around here somewhere no no they could have just fabricate it from drawing if indeed they do possess an authentic dhd would they not display it near the authentic gate good point good point we be stuck no we be not well when we fail to make the schedule check in General Landry will dial in at which point we will ask he to send a naquadah generator and a laptop with the dialing program and that be that we know that I think that when I say that we be stuck that you would know that I mean until then well then you should say what you mean I do not think you want I to start do that I do not think you want to start think what I think anyhow F Y I we do not need the dialing computer bad case scenario we can always dial the gate manually right kick it rotary style still need a power source what about the MALP no say we do not go there well let us hope it do not come to that so therefore next check in be in just under six hour Good muscle that mean we have time to go to the party no it do not it mean we stay here out of sight and remain as inconspicuous as possible with a bit of luck the people on this planet will never even know we be here MOANING do not tell Sylvana she be like a sister to I never WOMAN MOANING hi there be nothing to be alarmed about we SCREAMS woman scream how come they get to go woman scream hi they be rebel whoa no no no GUN fire ALARM BLARING groan drop the weapon and kick it over MITCHELL I be not go to ask twice get on the ground that go for everybody you two under the table woman scream stop scream young lady and get out here all right now we be not go to hurt anyone but I need you to stay calm quiet and on the ground until we figure this out what the hell happen we have a little misunderstanding yeah I can see that might have be easy to just pose as party guest they think we be rebel what do that mean I do not know I do not get a chance to ask a lot of question why be all the outer door seal off one of their guy shoot that case it must have trigger a lockdown and for the moment it would be good if it stay that way Wonderful see what you can do okay excuse I do not shoot then do not stand please let all these other people go I be the one that you want MITCHELL no offense buddy but you be not well the Viceroy and all the other Chancellors be able to escape I be all that be leave keep I free the other listen look I know you believe that bring we to our knee will make you hero that the people will follow your lead and rise up against we but harm innocent civilian will get you nowhere I know you be go to find this hard to believe but we be not rebel we be explorer what you see we be from another planet actually a whole other star system really STAMMERING wait another planet you see you have a large ring back there in an exhibit it be call a stargate and it be an interplanetary transporter I understand you do not want to make your demand to I but please I implore you you be not go to get what you want by hurt people ON RADIO this be Lourdes Malay I be a member of the Council Security Detail and I would like to talk to whoever be in charge could you just oh hello we have a senior negotiator on his way I would just like to let you know we be go to do everything in our power to get you what you need we do not need anything I be sorry look there be be a terrible misunderstanding you see we be not rebel then release the hostage that be not a bad idea it be a terrible idea why well it do not matter what we say to they they think we be rebel we shoot a security guard we take hostage if we let those people go they be go to come in here and kill we the lady 's make a lot of sense this be not how you make first contact with people not intentionally no but all we 've get to do be stall for five and a half hour till Landry dial in then we bolt and those people can believe what they want to believe and no one gets hurt I too believe that to be the good course of action okay do you understand how dangerous this could be this be an alien culture of which we have no knowledge we do not know how they be go to handle a situation like this we do not know if they be go to wait six hour once we start pose as kidnapper there be no turning back and if we get capture we be hoop Jackson I hear what you be say but I do not think we have a choice as far as I can see these people be not go to be open to the idea that we be peaceful alien out on a jolly jaunt just to look around I can not free they quite yet MALA Y if this be some kind of mistake I suggest you release they now listen one of your people have be seriously injure I suggest you send in medical personnel to take he out of here you 've seal off the museum how do you expect we to get in I manage to stop the bleeding but you should get he to a facility as soon as possible YELLS let he go Jackson he be okay be you people out of your mind or be you just plain stupid be you people out of your mind or be you just plain stupid do you know anything about hostage negotiation this be no way to gain our trust my name be Quartus I 've take command of this operation look we have one of your people here who need help we be willing to let he go and this be how you repay we QUARTUS I be the Chief Negotiation Officer for the Federal Security Council I promise you thing will be different my only concern be meet your demand and free the hostage see that be funny that be what the last guy say I can offer you many thing but if any of the hostage die just do not try any more stupid stunt we do not want to hurt anyone good Good if that change you should know that there be no escape we have you completely surround Hey Mitchell Jackson you okay VALA they zap you oh I get that thank you what do I miss well the real negotiator get here and want to know what our demand be any idea a jet to Algeria how about a real dhd no we need these demand to make sense I mean something these rebel would actually say excuse I do you really come through the ring yes we do it be a portal be not it to other world yeah I would be happy to show you how it work once we get it up and run again you want they to free your friend I be sorry what your demand if you want to pose as the rebel the first thing they usually do in situation like this be ask for the freeing of their imprison compatriot WOMAN do not talk to they no it be okay what be your name Cicero I be a researcher here at the museum and I believe you you want to get on the radio and explain that to the folk outside oh I 've try I 've suspect as much for year I 've publish dozen of paper write a book no one listen my colleague think I be a bit of a joke oh Daniel you 've find a kindre spirit on most planet find along with the ring be what we call a DHD it be a dialing device similar to the one you have back in the exhibit do you have the real one here we 've find fragment of it but the one in the pyramid room be a reconstruction from some diagram we find yeah we know that be why we be stuck well if one of the fragment be the power source Cicero stand up I need you to take we to your lab of course wait a second I be go to need a primer on these rebel first JACKSON and after they be free we would like the Viceroy to call a referendum on dissolve his government and finally we want to make a public statement on the Gainord transmitter to address the people of this proud nation that be unacceptable excuse I believe I I want this to end well for both of we but as you should know from previous attempt at political terrorism like this the Viceroy would rather sacrifice the hostage before bow to such demand remember to thank Cicero for his wonderful intel what about free the imprison rebel that will take time oh absolutely we recognize that sir you take all the time you need LAUGHS yeah you run that through the proper channel you talk to whoever you need to talk to we be in no rush I be sure the hostage would disagree with that they be fine we be not go to hurt they unless you get cute in which case there be go to be kill and whatnot all right I will see what I can do Sir we have a man on an auxiliary channel who claim to be inside the museum say he be a security guard who be I talk to Jayem Saran sir Night guard second class QUARTUS and you be inside the museum right now yes sir how do you escape the initial attack I be not there sir I be do my round by the time I get on the scene the fight be over there be nothing I could do sir no need to apologize engage they would have be a mistake I always want to serve on the Council 's Guard sir but some mistake I make when I be a kid mess up my record listen I 've be a guard at this museum for 10 year now I know it like the back of my hand we have a complete set of schematic out here not to worry yeah well I be sure you do but I be on the inside I can be your ear your eye you know what would be the most help stand by for your order sir find a safe place stay there and wait until this whole thing be over what be you go to do that be not your concern Guardsman our plan just do not involve you do not get in the way very well Jayem out our radio must be compromise he do not want I to stand down he just need it to look like I be stand down the Viceroy 's attempt to separate the govern council from the Circle of Heavens be controversial but the majority of the people be on his side Hang Hang on they think we be some kind of radical religious sect that be right the rebel be grow strong every day unfortunately you could not have pick a bad time to be mistaken for they how be that they 've have a string of success against the Council and its member the Viceroy need a win to show his might the Viceroy need a win to show his might if this be handle badly it could turn into a bloody mess very quickly keep that positive thinking go Cicero anything no my co worker have an archive on the other side of the building it be possible other piece we find be store there lead the way what be you and Heren do in the hallway what in the hallway before you come out scream what be you do look at some of the other exhibit but the museum be close we be tell everything outside the lobby be off limit we be do she kiss you I no you do do not you you hardly speak to he all night I do not think you be interested anymore why do you always do this why must you always try to take everything that be mine and try to make it your own he be hardly yours I hate you both scream what the hell be you do stop it she start it I think you start it when you kiss Heren Shut up Shut up you be hostage this be like a life and death situation here start act like it oh please you be no rebel we be not deaf you know everyone in this room know it that do not matter you be hostage we be your we be your captor we be heavily armed there ' rule there be a whole school of etiquette to this do not eyeball I an artificial stable wormhole Fascinating yeah pretty darn nifty huh and the galaxy be populate other people on other planet a couple of galaxy as a matter of fact Amazing hey when you guy find the gate and the pyramid there be not a stash of advanced alien weapon be there no I be afraid not yeah just a shot in the dark anyway you know if we well will you look at that be that what I think it be no it be a Goa'uld naquadah bomb for the record that be what I think it be yes I be sure you do well it seem in pretty good shape if it be real and if the naquadah core be intact I assume these case be connect to the security system yes so we can not get into the case you will not be able to access it without a security card and you have one of those no not for these exhibit no well not to worry you happen to be stand next to one of the good thief in two galaxy no not he so if anyone can get this bomb out with no security card it be I watch and learn boy Removal of treasure from a sealed glass enclosure INHALING step one identify the tamper circuit and try to bypass it when circuit prove inaccessible go to step two cut a treasure sized hole in the glass you just happen to carry one of those around with you one must always be prepare to liberate treasure Cameron step three examine the base of the object for pressure switch when find bypass it and finally we reach in SIGHS all right removal of treasure from a seal metal enclosure no MITCHELL you rush it VALA I do not you be show off and you rush it this be an alien security system that I 've never experience before and the fact that I get this far be very impressive how do we get one of those card oh SARAN you do not throw your gun on the floor now sigh and the little one on your leg well do not just stand there Cicero Huh pick they up oh right good now come stand over here thank they try to make I get they a key card yeah I hear toss over your communicator okay relax you get we you be in control that be right I be you press the big button to talk yeah I know how to use it Murderous rebel come in please speak I have your two friend let the hostage go or I be go to kill they excuse I your friend I have they at gunpoint if you do not let the rest of the hostage go I be go to kill they who be call SARAN who I be be of no importance oh I disagree tell he Jackson Mitchell what be go on well we get ourselves a bit of a John McClane here what what be you talk about die hard a security guard get the drop on we and I think he want to trade how do you want to play this well the two of we for all those hostage do not seem quite fair now do it now that be enough slide it over SARAN okay there you 've get proof that I 've get they now let the hostage go no you hear I right I be I be go to kill they yeah but if we let the hostage go we be all dead so no but oh I see what be it they must know where we be they 've probably send someone to come rescue they already they be quick I will give they that really yeah I 've just get to stay one step ahead of they you any good with a gun I 've never fire one no no of course not uh okay okay yes okay I be go to go get into position down the hall and when their friend come look for we I will get the drop on they as they say CICERO seem like the smart thing to do yeah all right if those two try anything shoot they of course yeah sorry about that that be all right happen all the time he be a night security guard have be since I start work here he would never have kill you yeah we get that he mean well yeah I be sure he do but we can not have he run around out there we will be right back can I do anything no we get it cover just stay here Halt Disarm rebel dog he leave himself wide open from behind that be a mistake one of the hostage be a nurse she be able to stabilize the wound guard oh finally some good news it be my belief these man in fact be not rebel but common thief now if we rise up against they and SCREAMS please remain calm as we attempt to rectify this most unfortunate circumstance what have you do with Cicero you kill he do not you no he actually where be Cicero I do not know what do you do with his body he be fine he probably just go to the bathroom or something

have be able to tell the difference Vala actually I probably would have oh please you do not know it be a bomb until I tell you so I have suspect it no you do not check my service log stop talk I specifically make a note what be the countdown clock set to an hour give or take a few minute it be not that big a deal oh really once we interface it with the gate establish a secure connection should completely deplete its power source which would mean it will not explode we now have less than 50 give or take a few minute to get that do maybe more count on less BUZZING MAN 1 put your hand up MAN 2 get on the ground now teal'c a door on the south side just open up MAN stay on he what do you see Cicero it would appear he have escape he what he leave he just leave why would he do that SCOFFS look like he slip right through your finger he be work with we you idiot how do you think we get our gun back it be so sad that you feel the need to lie to I what the hell do Cicero think he be do I know it sound crazy but it be true the pyramid ring act as a connection point between many world many of we have think so for some time but be unable to activate it to prove it they be not rebel they do not know anything about our world their demand would prove otherwise Cicero I tell they what to say I tell they what to demand you do what all they need be time our ring be break and once their friend realize they be stick here they will send help their friend other be on the way yes they just need to stall a bit so I tell they what to say yes they just need to stall a bit so I tell

I feel uneasy how go it on your end how go it on our end I think I have it maybe Vala there be a 70 chance that if we dial manually we will be able to establish a connection and a 50 chance the bomb will just go off that be 120 well there be some crossover where we establish a wormhole and it blow up Jackson do you catch any of that yeah 100 chance we should have bring someone that know what they be do yeah I hear Daniel out well I be go to need your help dial this thing okay this one up the top have you speak with the Viceroy yes the Viceroy have deny all of their demand we have to end this now SARAN what do that thing do be that a bomb why be it light up like that be you activate it you be go to kill we all be not you your restraint will not hold I forever you might as well set I free

hallway GUNS fire run muffled scream they 've get a bomb sir it be set to go off relax connect a wormhole to the gate have deplete the naquadah core to a point where it be no long a threat do not believe they sir they be devious and they speak in code to each other Cicero tell you who we be do not he let he in he tell we who he think you be oh my look we never want to hurt anybody we just want to go home okay and that ring be how we do that please just let we leave all we have to do be walk through that once we be go it will shut down and no one will be harm I promise I be afraid I can not allow that Crap look we all know what you be go through we 've all be there Hell when I first hear there be alien world and race out there I freak out I be afraid Afraid of how advanced they might be afraid of what their intention be afraid they might come to my world and kill I and I will be honest with you there be world and race out there who do mean you and your people harm but we be not one of they and you be lucky you run into we before you run into they now I will admit that our first contact be not ideal in fact it could well be our bad but you do not want your first foray into interplanetary relation to be a violent one we be a peaceful people but we do not take act of aggression lie down so you let we walk through that ring and when and how we meet again will be under your control prevent we from leave and it will not be please Quartus this be the future of our people lower your weapon thank you this be Colonel Mitchell SG 1 be return a little early transmit iris code now it be true everything they say be true I do not believe it and neither will anyone else what you be a hero Jayem Saran night guard second class I be he be four rebel attack a private function with several key councilor in attendance but you foil their plan you kill they all and save all of the hostage you be go to cover this up you can not do this I could easily say he save all but one of the hostage I want to talk to the Viceroy I be a hero JACKSON we 've try make a connection twice sir no luck could it be a problem with that gate say as a result of some tampering with the gate to get a connection hey I save our hide thank you very much we do not think so sir our attempt to dial should have work they have undoubtedly bury the gate so they just stick their head in the sand even after everything you tell they maybe they figure they 've get their own issue to deal with before they start deal with the one out here sir unfortunately we do not have that option do we MITCHELL all the way over northeast another here man yes sir another one here JACKSON Medic he be still breathe Sam Mitchell we 've get bra'tac here he be in rough shape Dr Jackson we have numerous body here how many I do not know oh my God Cam Medic it be teal'c NISAL I be tired of this rhetoric how long can we talk of reform council and ridiculous trade policy the Ori be take our planet by force divide our people through religious ideology and fear we must fight back now we all agree Nisal that be why we be here but enter into a war without leadership without proper organization would merely be mass suicide we must learn from our mistake in overthrow the Goa'uld for generation we have plot and fight for our emancipation never once do we plan for what we would do with that freedom after it be ours the result infighting and weakness after our victory over the Goa'uld be what lead we to this vulnerability at the hand of the Ori now all scream monitor beep it be nice to see you conscious again how long have I be you 've be out for quite a while about two week it be pretty touch and go there it take three round of surgery just to stop the bleeding and repair the damage to your spine I have to admit I be more than a little worried that you would not walk again but it look like you be go to pull through this the other will be glad to hear that you be awake at least one of they have pretty much be here ever since they bring you in of course I do not know where they be right now he be awake for a few minute do he know about Bra'tac I barely get a chance to tell he what he be be through or what he be go to have to go through to get back up on his foot for that matter be there it be not a good place hey what have transpire Dr Lam think you should rest but we need you to be on your foot and back in fighting form as soon as possible tell I we count 32 dead and 12 more critically injure PEOPLE scream MITCHELL Most of the villager have scatter to the hill carter when you do not check in we come to investigate MITCHELL we can not be sure but it look like three separate explosive device be responsible for the damage and what of Bra'tac he survive if he be here then I wish to see he teal'c you be in no condition now listen you be very lucky to be alive give it some time be he badly injure I wish I could tell you that he be go to come out of this but right now I just do not know BRA ' TAC for generation we have plot and fight for our emancipation but never once do we plan for what we would do with that freedom after it be ours teal'c General Landry I have receive further intelligence from Jaffa with close tie to Parnon the Jaffa that organize the summit and it be believe that a Jaffa name Arkad be responsible I have knowledge of he we once engage in battle as oppose First Primes he be a warrior without honor which would explain why he choose to bomb a peaceful leadership summit it be believe that Arkad have slowly and quietly be build support for himself as a new leader a leader that would deliver the Jaffa nation into the hand of the Ori so he would obviously be oppose to the organizing of a council also mean to lead the Jaffa especially one that be intend to unite they against the Ori Arkad be dangerous and must be eliminate teal'c General Landry Arkad must be find and kill before any more innocent Jaffa be senselessly slaughter I be not go to order you and SG 1 to hunt down and kill someone base on what seem to be rumor at this point would you be so cautious General Landry if it be a team of human that have be kill in that bombing I know what you be go through right now so I be go to let that pass Arkad be a monster in the past he have exist solely on the fringe but now if he be allow to continue to use fear and tyranny to gain control of a significant Jaffa army and a fleet of ship believe I he will become as much an issue for Earth as anyone else in the galaxy teal'c you 've do a tremendous job get back on your foot but Dr Lam be say you be not ready for active duty just yet I be ask you to give it a little more time I have give it enough time the resource of this facility be not go to be use to fulfill one man 's personal revenge I be just say if Arkad be responsible and Teal'c 's right about he be a bad man I 've already issue a new memo to all team to consider the investigation a top priority I do not think a memo be go to cut it as far as Teal'c be concern sir I take it you 've try to talk he out of leave yes sir like stick my foot out to trip a freight train I can not say that I blame he sir I do not either he be here of his own free will he can leave if he want to so I be think we could Zat he toss he in a hold cell until he come to his sense I be think it be not too late to go with he I offer he do not want we to he say he would stay in touch let we know what he learn you do not really believe that GIRL my father say the stick honor those who die indeed do you know who do this yes my father say they be coward they must pay with their life they will I promise you MONITOR beep WHEEZING help help we need some help in here he be awake that be a good sign let us extubate just relax it may be a little difficult for you to speak right away BRA'TAC cough go away Teal'c of the Tau'ri do not think I do not know who you be what do you know of the bombing at Dar Eshkalon a bunch of Jaffa die do not expect I to shed a tear for you and your kind I do not care what you and your friend from the Tau'ri have do you Jaffa enslave my people for generation and do not tell I that you be only follow the order of your master you live like king compare to we and do not think that we will soon forget I rejoice Rejoice at the sight of you murder each other like the fool that you be crowd GASPING tell I what you know you think anything you do at this point really matter we be all fodder for the Ori I see a man with a scar across his face at Dar Eshkalon he purchase explosive on this planet you want to buy something from I I think we can work out a deal I can pretty much get you anything you want I want a name and where I can find he or what you kill I you get nothing choke you underestimate the satisfaction I will get from your suffering he be a student of mine for a while I know from the beginning that there be something wrong with he I underestimate he once never again teal'c and I both face he in battle many time and many time we manage to defeat his army but he always escape yeah he sound like a real charmer you know what you be tired you should rest no there be more I have not tell you have teal'c ever speak of his mother not much I know she be dead Teal'c 's mother be kill shortly after Teal'c command an embarrassing victory over Arkad 's fleet the murder be never resolve for no apparent reason someone slip into her village and slit her throat in the night and Teal'c believe it be Arkad 's revenge for the defeat it be never prove but still know Teal'c I mean why do not he go after Arkad immediately he be first Prime of Apophis at the time Teal'c 's action be choose for he now give what Arkad have do teal'c will stop at nothing to bring an end to he yeah and that do not sound like any great loss as long as it be teal'c that be the victor LANDRY where be your confirmation come from REYNOLDS SG 22 recon sir I think you should hear this we 've be maintain contact with anti Ori rebel on P8 T 365 that be a predominantly Jaffa planet that be already succumb to Ori control right right this group we 've be monitor oppose Ori occupation quietly so far but be keep we apprise of their intention anyway they say several hundred Jaffa include a few of their inside man be regularly be ferry by mother ship to another planet to mine raw naquadah that make sense the Ori warrior will be able to make ship weapon supergate yes but here be the interesting part the Jaffa say this be not be do for the Ori at least not directly well how be that possible it be an Ori planet Somebody 's building weapon right under their nose apparently a Jaffa name Arkad have muscle his way into a relationship with the Ori say he will police the planet get even more Jaffa planet to fall in line well that be in line with the intel we have yes it seem Arkad be plan a fairly major play to impress his new friend Word 's float around that this weapon grade naquadah be be stockpile in various location for use by Arkad in a coordinate attack on Earth groan torture I all you want I will tell you nothing though you hide among human I know you be Jaffa that be your symbiote lie on the ground in front of you that be your symbiote lie on the ground in front of you I serve the Ori when I die I will ascend and join they in everlasting glory that be untrue you will not convince I otherwise that be most unfortunate I have medicine that would save your life should you tell I what I wish to know never then there be some thing that you should know the Ori do not ascend their follower Arkad be a coward who will die by my hand also I have implant an explosive device within your symbiote pouch it be set to detonate within a matter of moment it be the same explosive that you use to kill 12 warrior 18 innocent bystander and two child who have gather for a peaceful summit they be sinner all who choose the path of evil ten second where be you go I be leave you be about to explode SCREAMS so what do this Arkad have to gain by attack Earth maybe he be try to up his street cre well it could be revenge it be possible he blame we for what happen at Dakara for all we know it be the Ori who instruct he to try to weaken our resolve they must know a direct attack on Earth be risky because of the antarctic defense system well right now we have no way of detect let alone stop a cloak cargo ship they could go after whatever target they want not to mention the countless casualty that would be create that would throw the rest of the planet into chaos Primed and ready for an Ori attack I think the Jaffa be all about honor and meet their enemy on the battlefield yeah apparently not this guy so what do we do it sound to I like Teal'c have the right idea HARRIMAN unschedule offworld activation ALARM sound receive a transmission sir on screen ARKAD warrior of the Tau'ri I bid you greeting this be General Landry of Stargate Command to whom be I speak my name be Arkad I be the leader of the Illac Renin it be Ancient loosely translate it mean kingdom of the path what can we do for you I wish to be grant safe passage to your planet so that we may meet in person and discuss certain issue that concern we both by now you have undoubtedly learn of a plot to brazenly strike at your planet in a most cowardly manner I want to offer my assistance as I believe I be uniquely capable of stop this most dishonorable attack he no doubt feed you the information about the attack so that he could then claim to be the one who could prevent it yeah we figure that but what we do not know be why and give the very real threat that be out there the IOA want we to hear what he have to say he be a serpent you must not trust he I will let you know how it go I already know nothing good will come of it Arkad I be sure you know of SG 1 Lieutenant Colonels Mitchell and Carter Dr Daniel Jackson and Vala Mal Doran it be an honor to finally meet you all in person I have look forward to this day for some time let us sit down shall we a shame teal'c be not here we have not have the pleasure of see each other in many year we could not guarantee your safety if he be here surely he do not still hold a grudge for past battle we once wage in the name of former false god no I think it have more to do with recent event I assume you be refer to the tragedy at Dar Eshkalon yeah in which your good buddy Teal'c come this close to die bra'tac send his regard as well I do not think he will mind I speak for he when I say that he would love to stab you in the eye with a really big knife Thirty two other Jaffa be not nearly as lucky as they be you must understand all of you that there be those out there who would have I falsely accuse of such cowardly action so you be say you have nothing to do with it I fully admit I be against a gathering but those in attendance be assemble to form a council that would directly oppose my campaign to lead all Jaffa into the arm of the Ori the reason we fight for freedom be so we could believe in what we want and not be subjugate by anyone and you do not see the Ori as force their belief on you I see Origin as the organized religion and the source of salvation all the Jaffa have always seek I think we be get a little off point here I agree I assure you no matter what our philosophical difference I would never authorize the type of attack that befell the summit at Dar Eshkalon but you just happen to know some guy less respectable less honorable than yourself who take matter into their own hand as a matter of fact yes and I have learn of similar attack against your planet be plan by a radical sect of Jaffa who see the Tau'ri as a powerful force in the galaxy who oppose our peaceful movement toward embrace Origin and you can stop they yes I believe I can I do not agree with their tactic but at least we see eye to eye in basic belief I can use my influence and my resource to choke off their ability to function effectively or you can fund they and allow they to do your dirty work for you while you take the political high road Let us cut the crap we all know you be here for one reason make your demand I have no demand I understand your mistrust but please I implore you believe I when I say I will use all of my vast resource at my disposal to thwart this most heinous threat to your world all I ask in return be you allow the Jaffa people to believe in what they choose if they decide to follow in the way of the Illac Renin that should be up to they if you feel it be your responsibility to do battle with the Ori on behalf of the human of this galaxy then that be your prerogative stay out of your way and you will not attack we General my fleet be more powerful than any Goa'uld have ever marshal by tenfold if I be to attack this planet it would not be in the manner currently be plan by these radical and it would not end well for you MITCHELL really you do not say whether or not our people ever see eye to eye I would like to believe that they could coexist peacefully your planet have play an instrumental role in the very reshaping of the nature of the galaxy I merely wish to avoid any unpleasant conflict between our two respective nation before they arise I take my leave LIZAN I tell you where to find Bak'al he be the Jaffa scum that I sell the explosive to that be all I know I do not believe you I do not know anything about Arkad you despise Jaffa why protect he I be not afraid to die I have no intention of kill you not until you tell I where to find Arkad why should I tell you anything know death be my reward that may sound sensible for the moment but believe I in time you will change your mind the IOA be take the threat of these attack against Earth very seriously so what do they want we to do nothing as far as Arkad be concern Sir they want we to leave he alone for now let he go about his business we be suppose to let he muscle we obviously we need to assess his capability determine if these threat be credible and who be really behind they if we can prove that Arkad do pose a direct threat to our security I be sorry sir we be suppose to what find wmd in his back pocket right at the moment we need to play the intelligence game not get into an all out war with an enemy that may have the capability to inflict severe damage on we we need to find out what we can we be on it sir not so fast Colonel I plan to put a number of team on it right away but at the moment I have another mission for you in his mind Teal'c may have sever his connection with we when he set out to kill Arkad but he be be part of the SGC so he will still be perceive as act on our behalf if he succeed in kill Arkad even if he try and fail it will be hard to convince people that he be act alone so you want we to try and stop he the IOA be adamant that Earth and specifically the SGC take no action against Arkad I 've be charge with order you to find teal'c and stop he at all cost hey no one really think that Arkad give the SGC the whereabouts of his home base of operation out of diplomatic courtesy what you think he do it to draw we into a trap I doubt that it be more likely that he know that if anyone be determine enough to find he they could and he want to make sure we would be blame in the event of any attack against he regardless of whether we be behind it MITCHELL speak of determined have anyone think about the speech they be go to give to Teal'c no I do not think so odyssey this be Mitchell we be down all right everybody know what to do field generator be in place trip sensor be ready I be glad you be so sure about this plan one way or the other you know he be come he will want the element of surprise so I figure he will use a cloak ship try to sneak in the back way well that be what we would do exactly he just do not know we be go to try and stop he you know regardless of who be go to try and stop he this be teal'c we be talk about you know Bra'tac seem to think that if it suit Arkad to attack Earth he will do so no matter what his agreement with we it be possible he just do not want we come after he yet so he leak the information about the plot pretend to act towards stop the attack and with the time that he be buy get his chick in a row that be a pretty good theory and it be duck by the way the only problem be we have to prove it to the IOA well what would be the harm in we just fail to stop teal'c from kill Arkad it would not be entirely on purpose and not out of accidental incompetence either if you catch my drift yes nudge nudge wink wink but if Arkad be the one plan these attack then I think our good chance of stop they be keep Arkad alive why be that he may be the only one that know all the piece to the puzzle good point thank you how do we get Arkad to tell we all the piece of the puzzle oh that be the easy part see we capture he lock he in a room and threaten to let Teal'c kill he Genius thank you it have occur to you that it could take day before Teal'c show up yeah he could also have be here already and kill Arkad for all we know half of SG 3 be watch the gate we will get some activity one way or the other speaking of which Colonel Reynolds come in SG 3 you 've miss your schedule check in please respond stay here MITCHELL hey somebody get to Baker and Reynolds they be unconscious but they be still alive hey teal'c teal'c I know you be out there buddy if you can hear I I do not know what you think be go on here but we be here to help MITCHELL okay that be a lie and I feel terrible about it I hate myself TEAL ' C why have you set a trap for I Colonel Mitchell Trap that be crazy talk man why would we set a trap for you I intend on kill Arkad do not try and stop I teal'c it be Daniel Listen now just hear I out now apparently there be a radical group of Jaffa poise to attack Earth Arkad claim to have the mean to stop they and he say he will help we if we leave he alone it be likely Arkad be behind those attack yes I know I know we figure as much but we just think it be good for ourselves and you if we all just step back and consider all the angle I be not act on behalf of Earth the IOA be worried it may still look that way unfortunately that be no long my concern I will avenge the death of the Jaffa at Dar Eshkalon Arkad must die no matter what the consequence I do not wish to harm any of you but if you try and stop I I will so now what well he be get to be head for the pyramid drop the stick drop the stick I do not wish to harm you Colonel Mitchell then drop the stick you know I do not think anyone here want to get harm probably I more than you look teal'c grunt groan okay all right we can talk about this the time for talk be over Colonel Mitchell ARKAD after all these year still as predictable as ever leave you 've get old and slow get up groan I remember when you be a true warrior the pride of Apophis fear by all those who oppose you do you remember teal'c how powerful you be then do you remember Co'rak you have we on the run you bombard the planet from space and you leave no survivor I lose my parent that day my sister yet I still admire you one day I think I think I would be so brave I would have the courage to bring my enemy to their knee like the great Jaffa warrior teal'c Fight look at you now a legend you defeat the mighty Goa'uld themselves you bring freedom to all Jaffa you give we the chance to seek salvation but you you reject it yourself your punishment must be to have get so soft and frail have you spend so long with human that you 've become so much like they it be a shame you will not live to see I bring the Tau'ri to their knee grunt before you die I want you to know the truth I have my revenge for the day that you attack Co'rak and you slaughter my family I kill your mother groan teal'c there be a time when you would have come away from such a battle without a scratch I be alive Arkad be not indeed just finish read your report Colonel everything in order sir Arkad set a trap for you take you prisoner and you be fortunate Teal'c be there to rescue you Arkad be kill and Teal'c injure in the process yes sir that be what it say this be go to be a tough pill for the IOA to swallow son I believe I also mention that Arkad admit to plan the attack and they be go to go through with they regardless of what we would do yeah it be too bad you be not able to learn more Arkad take credit for the murder of my mother if he be responsible he be too much a coward to do it himself the one who do die by my hand you never tell I still Arkad get what he deserve there be many more as corrupt as he be and we will hunt they until they be no more I would not like to be the one who oppose you I have learn from the good old friend I have not say this to you before and I should have you be the son I never have I could not be more proud MITCHELL they cancel it really I do not even know the new season have start well there be something you do not see every day yes sir groan it be a nice outfit it be very civilian well yeah that be one way of put it so what be this girl 's day out well yes if I be go to integrate into Earth society we think it be very important that I immerse myself in the local cultural offering and by cultural offering you mean pedicure mochaccino and Victoria 's Secret well we be schedule to go offworld in about an hour and though you both look fantastic I suggest you might want to lose the heel HARRIMAN ON PA unschedule offworld activation Ladies first Sir we be receive a video transmission let us see it hello hello be this thing work this be General Landry of Stargate Command General it be a pleasure I do not get out to your end of the galaxy much but I have a friend who live in the area and he speak very highly of your people maybe know he a funny little guy with a beard live on a planet formerly occupy by a female System Lord I do not Rovak Robak do the name sound familiar no it do not now what be this about Sir I have some information for you information that could impact the very survival of your world Jasec you know this man a little he be my father SIGHS Vala be that you yes it be Sweetheart how be life treat you certainly well than you ever do Ouch I suppose for the benefit of your friend there you be go to want to list all the reason why I be such a bad father I wish I could but a wormhole can only be maintain for 38 minute you 've get your father 's wit it be hardly enough time to cover your inadequacy as both a parent and a human being in general and your mother 's uncanny ability to hold a grudge you say you have some information for we yes let I through and we will discuss all right provide Vala will vouch for you I most certainly will not you will want to hear this the information I have have to do with Arkad 's plot to attack your planet Arkad be dead well he may be dead but the threat he set in motion still exist take your time there be no pressure just that your whole planet could very well blow up at any moment HARRIMAN Chevron six encode MITCHELL so what be the deal with the accent or in your father 's case the lack thereof well the accent like most of my other good quality I get from my mother my charm my wit my good look what would you get from your dad some minor food allergy HARRIMAN Chevron seven lock I have a bad feeling about this JASEC of course you do that be because I raise you to be cautious wary Mother raise I which one my mother right Hug for Daddy you be lucky I be not allow to kill you well so much for happy family reunion what do you know about Arkad and the attack he be plan quite a lot and I be prepared to tell you everything I know in exchange for sanctuary on Earth there be the angle okay I be a terrible husband and admittedly probably not the good father figure although I 've see bad but I 've put all that behind I because I be try to change try to better myself which be why I be here now risk my life to tell you that before Arkad die he send out several naquadah load cargo ship in preparation for an attack on Earth and those cargo ship my friend be still out there wait to be launch and I know their location can not you see what he be do he be spend an entire lifetime take advantage of people and now that they be finally catch up with he he think he can use we to hide from his enemy but that be not really the issue here no Sam 's right if Jasec be tell the truth and there be still a bunch of naquadah load cargo ship out there then this deal be a no brainer if he be tell the truth thus far the Jaffa have be unable to corroborate any part of his story well they would not if Arkad be careful enough to cover his track if the threat be real we can not let any of those cargo ship blow up Time be of the essence well there be one way to find out if he be be straight with we all right check it out if his intel be good then Jasec have himself a deal Dr Lam as you be Sergeant excuse I Carolyn I 've be think see now whenever you preface what you be about to say with I 've be think what you be actually do be prepare I for some revelation you 've just have so should I be sit down for this it be be a while since I last speak to your mother yeah a little over five year we be marry for 12 what bring this on all of a sudden well I 've be think about it ever since you come to work here about reach out to your mother at least open up some kind of communication with her okay so how do you want to do this well I be think about give she a call just like that just out of the blue no she be in Europe for a couple of week so when she get back why do not I call she and put in a good word for you thank you you be welcome we 've come all this way for nothing the cargo ship will not be there my father will have play you all for fool and this will have be a giant waste of time not entirely if the ship be not there we will have call his bluff and you can tell we that you be right all along you bet I will enter high orbit Scanning what 've we get we be pick up only 12 life sign on the planet 's surface that be it we be also pick up a significant concentration of naquadah these reading be through the roof look like the intel be good marks Sir we be pick up movement we 've be detect they be make a break for it those ship must not be allow to escape lock onto

be make a terrible mistake but with all due respect it be not too late to change your mind I make a deal I be not go back on my word then might I suggest a more liberal interpretation of the agreement

come this way do you play poker be you familiar with the game 21 may I offer you a word of advice hello hi any input that would help I well myself would be greatly appreciate perhaps three word be less annoying and if you have no intention of reform your way which I suspect that you do not perhaps it be good that you have nothing more to do with your daughter let I tell you something big boy my daughter and I have an understanding an unspoken bond that she will get over it Vala be you free on Friday night say yes I get two ticket to this Virginia Dialogues show I do not know much about it but the ticket be very hard to get to think I be just start to believe in you I be try to change it be an ongoing process EX CLAIMS SIGHS so what be you do Friday night that be the last of they thank you Vala have a seat please how be you do Fine why would not I be well you be obviously disappointed right yeah no not in Jasec his action do not really surprise I More in myself for even consider the possibility that he might be tell the truth maybe he be no he lie he say he be try to change well change be not easy I think you of all people should know that right so you want to draw parallel between he and I our equally disreputable past our similar desire to reform yeah there be that Daniel I be a different person than I be two year ago because I genuinely want to change I do not see it as a means of escape no so you be tell I your decision have nothing to do with the desire to stop run and live a semi normal life you do not know Jasec the way I do no you be right in fact you probably know he well than you think after all you well than anybody must know what it be like to have to resist the temptation of fall back on your old way I be sure it have not be easy for you either Jasec it be Vala should we come back no excuse I too easy Jasec Dad hello he be not in here I know it he be remove his ankle monitor I tell you he be be play you for fool all along actually you be start to believe he too if he be decide to leave it be unlikely we will find he again I would not be so sure about that during his initial physical Dr Lam implant he with a subcutaneous transmitter just in case you do not trust he but you talk I into come here anyway hey he be not my father Sam it be Daniel what be go on Jasec 's on the run his locator signal place he approximately six mile west of Colorado Springs have we dispatch a team to the area yeah Daniel and Vala just get there Daniel we 've park and we be proceed on foot you be head right for he One let us start over again there be seven total three for you three for I one for I it be for the house as we call it I do not know your father have any friend here on Earth neither do I you can not go back on this deal we have an arrangement look do you have a superior I could talk to Jasec Jaffa CARTER Jasec be carry that with he it be a short range communicator he probably use to contact the Jaffa no doubt he sneak it in with his personal effect turn out we do not destroy all of the ship intend for the attack one of they be dispatch early and it be be sit somewhere here on Earth wait for the order to strike and he know this all along he get his intel from some heavily involved Jaffa who be have second thought about the whole thing apparently he know they from some weapon smuggling operation he use to run he find out about the cargo ship and make a deal with we so he could come to Earth where he make a deal with the Jaffa they would give he the naquadah he would sell it and they would split the proceed Nice and tidy where be this cargo ship locate he do not know the Jaffa he be with be his contact and he be go so can not we just locate this cargo ship the same way we do the other no that will not work this time this particular cargo ship be cloak so do an orbital scan will not reveal any trace of the naquadah but Jasec claim that Arkad mark the naquadah to make sure that none of his man would try to double cross he he say he can calibrate our detection system to pick up its unique energy signature just out of interest what do he ask for in return we recover the naquadah we give it to he he sell it and we split the profit 50 50 and what be your counter offer he get zero and we do not lock he away for the rest of his life he take the offer see you 've cast too wide a variance Lf you just narrow the parameter narrow the parameter that 's genius I do not know about genius it be just marginally brilliant now if I can just figure out how to sync it up I be sure it will come to you so how be the reading come along slowly it be no wonder I do not mind tell you I be a bit disappointed in this facility I be expect more well at time so do we but the truth be the Stargate program just do not get the support it use to from the people in charge why not Eureka one down 12 to go that be too bad because after all your Stargate program have accomplish for this network of planet I would think the decision maker would show it the respect it deserve I would think the decision maker would show it the respect it deserve yeah say how would you like to go out to dinner with I once this be all over I do not think so why not well I be an incredibly busy person with very little free time and you be a jerk of course there be that look I be sorry I have to trick you but if you have know what I have plan you would have never let I on this planet I be talk about the way you treat Vala to think that for the first time since she be a child she be actually begin to trust you phone RINGING hello hi just call to remind you about dinner tonight Dinner tonight you forget SIGHS no no no it be just that something very important have come up I think we might be well off reschedule Mom head back tomorrow morning we can not reschedule I be deal with a major situation here okay what do you want I to tell she tell she I will be there Sir we 've finish calibrate the device and we 've get a lock on their location they be approximately 30 mile outside of Cheyenne Mountain it seem that one of the target be their stargate tell they I will send in some tactical unit I would not if the Jaffa suspect they be about to be compromise I have no doubt they will detonate the naquadah I would suggest use a little stealth and cunning to take they off guard and I would be happy to help out no thank well like it or not you be go to need my help some of these Jaffa know I they trust I and there be also the matter of the rig cargo ship this be the first I 've hear of it sir be you sure I think I would mention it accord to Te'rak the cargo ship be rig to blow in the event anyone try to move it now fortunately for you I have the override code please General let I help give I this one final shot at redemption this be nice it remind I of that afternoon we spend on Serras Dia run for our life from the authority you 've get to admit it be great daddy daughter time as I recall we would not have be on the run have you not be greedy and go back for second I could not help myself you know you could not even pull off this simple naquadah deal without complicate thing with your silly little side scam you always be so sloppy carter ON RADIO Vala yes Sam the naquadah signal be emanate approximately a half mile north of your position I will confirm visual sighting request radio silence TEAL ' c ON RADIO Stargate Command this be teal'c I have deliver the package to the appoint area Good keep I apprise of any development Sir do you have to be somewhere whatever happen to that boy you use to like the one whose father be a merchant I always think you two would end up together Veron Karn we be 10 and he move away that be too bad I see a lot of potential in he can you stop try to endear yourself to I as far as I be concern you be a lost cause and I would not be surprise if you be somehow involve in Arkad 's plot against Earth that would be low even for I I have no idea what you be capable of ENERGY SURGING hey fellow it be I Jasec I and my partner actually my daughter be not she pretty we be here to check out the merchandise be that okay there be be a change of plan Jasec and unfortunately you be no long part of this new arrangement VALA ON RADIO Jasec you idiot that be the signal let us go there be no need for you to carry on with your attack because Arkad be dead and there be no need to sacrifice yourself or the naquadah let us talk deal I believe that be Te'rak 's intention before he disappear really I hope he be all right he probably just got lose these wood be very confusing you can get turn around so easily enough wait I can not watch my daughter die I can not watch I die either thank honey Vala get to the ship GROANING I 've locate the cargo ship hold it the naquadah on that ship be rig to blow unless I input the override code Te'rak give I all right I be come with you no I be not go to risk your life too listen to your father for once here in case I do not make it groan Drat Jasec sorry sweetheart there never be an override code take care of yourself Daddy love you hey grunt you okay yes do everything go as plan it do on our end Sam the real

enhancer well that be a bonus go ahead try a sample I understand they be very powerful can you feel it work yes I can let us talk deal I may keep a couple of these for myself Better to have they and not need they than to need they and not have they right we talk the same language right KNOCKING ON DOOR just a minute come in hi hi what be this Girl 's night in Nice so how be you do Great yeah wonderful everything go accord to plan we lead Jasec to the decoy ship while you secure the real one he scamme we but we scamme he well Cheers so where be the boy tonight Cameron have a date Daniel 's exhausted and Teal'c get ticket to some show woman my girlfriend and I talk about a lot of thing there be just one topic we rarely discuss Vaginas and I ask myself why be that why do not we talk about vaginas why be work and kid and holiday plan more acceptable topic of conversation than our own vaginas and I do not have an answer so I take it upon myself to find out I start to talk about vagina at work at home sometimes even at fancy restaurant soon my friend start to talk about vagina as well and it be only a matter of time before it become a hot conversation topic no matter where I go it be vagina this vagina that vagina vagina vagina NARRA TOR previously on Stargate SG 1 what exactly do you want from I the code to an ancient tablet that I help Qetesh locate long ago CARTER I take it the anti Prior device be work MITCHELL well he do not stop we from zatte he what the hell be go on I have to be sure this be work on her first we 've get to go chattering you be bluff you have nothing I will tell you what I will bet you everything I have on this table against that cargo ship of yours outside your winning would not cover the value of that ship what if I throw in this and what be that suppose to be MEN gasp you 've get your wager as foolish as it may be I guess it be just my lucky day I think this be an honest establishment it be and that be why it be necessary to have you search I do not suppose we could call this even Adria hello Mother it be good to see you it be be far too long I do not expect to see you again I have to return Mother my work here be unfinished who be this you really do not want to know get out all of you MEN MUMBLING I do not suppose you be go to let I just walk out of here I be afraid not I be sorry to have to tell you this Mother but your attempt to destroy the Ori be unsuccessful be I suppose to take your word for that I 've be personally supervise the construction of dozen of ship now that our intergalactic gate be operational again there be nothing to stop they from come here we should have the entire galaxy convert in a matter of month just because you 've be build ship do not prove anything what be you do here where be your friend from Earth friend come and go have they abandon you I would rather not talk about it I really must know Mother you do realize in a traditional mother daughter relationship I be suppose to be the bossy one oh whatever make no difference now anyway I 've get it I figure it out get what the answer you be look for to the Clava Thesaurusy thingami jigamy the Clava Thessara Infinitas right that be the one I know where it be the Clava Thessara Infinitas literally the key to infinite treasure be the ancient tablet Athena be seek from Qetesh now it supposedly hold the clue to the whereabouts of a vast storehouse of Daniel this be very interesting get to the good part the good part I figure it out I know where the treasure be you solve the Clava Thessara Infinitas yes I most certainly do Daniel share some of his finding with I last night before I go to sleep and after a rather well nasty dream in which I appear on a television program where it seem you have to dance with supposedly well know personality in front of a panel of judge a shape come to my mind the symbol for infinity yes infinite treasure infinity you see and it intersect with six symbol which when combine correspond with a gate address why would the Ancients use the Earth symbol for infinity to hide their treasure actually no one know the exact origin of the symbol itself it be be find on tibetan rock carving date back over a thousand year as well as a host of other place for all we know it could well have originate with the Ancients you can rotate that symbol any which way you want yes but this be how it appear in my dream and when we put these six symbol into the database it come up with only one address why do this all sound familiar do Adria not send you information in dream form to lure we to the planet where the Sangraal be hide yes but no this be different I come up with this on my own okay I suppose it be possible that Qetesh know its location and this be simply a latent memory be dredge up by Athena there you go do we have any idea what this ancient storehouse actually contain no idea sir but it must be big if Athena be so eager to get her hand on it I feel very strongly about this General what can it hurt to send a team I do not send you that information that be what I try to tell they but they do not believe I especially when the reconnaissance team return ALARM sound ALARM sound what be it SG 3 and 8 they be come in hot open the iris MEN grunt they be right on our tail shut the gate shut it down do it med team to the gate room immediately what happen it be an ambush sir Ori soldier make our position as soon as we step through the gate I lose two man a couple more injured that be not possible that can not be you tell that to the man who die Colonel debrief in my office yes sir I be so certain that I be right I could not leave well enough alone and the very next night I have the same dream again only this time the infinity shape appear vertically rather than horizontally note that again it intersect with six symbol and that again the six symbol only match one address in our database what what be the problem we need to investigate this Vala what do you not see what be go on here no this be Adria tell we where to go so she can pick we off Next you will have a dream where the symbol be on a slight angle and I will bet it will still correspond to one single gate address she be use you Vala no I would know well you do not know before do you VALA thing just get bad from there Daniel what be happen it be not look good Most of the i o a delegate think you 've be compromise but I do not do anything wrong I be try to help it do not matter what your intention be if Adria can manipulate you like this any time she want to then you 've become a security risk they be talk about remove you from the team what they be also not comfortable with the idea of let you go give everything you 've learn about Earth 's defense I do not understand they be talk about confinement Vala at Area 51 you do not believe I either you can not lie to I Mother I can read the truth in your mind I be just surprised so be I how do you convince they to let you go I do not that be the funny thing VALA I guess they think a locked door could hold I or they never imagine I would make it off the base what do you plan to do now well I have just win myself a cargo ship when you drop by and break up the game so be that really what you want a life alone always on the run that life no long suit you Mother you belong with I Return with I to my ship and take up your rightful place as Mother of the Orici Adria stop it I be not your mother I may have give birth to you but we be not family so stop pretend you just need time to think about it we will talk far on our way where be we go to find the Clava Thessara Infinitas you think it be real I think Colonel Carter be right this might be knowledge from your time as a Goa'uld be dredge up through your subconscious well you be too late despite the fact that they do not trust I they think they should check out the second gate address anyway just to be safe I overhear they plan the mission as I be leave yes but there be something you be not tell I I do not know what you be talk about do not play game with I Mother if I have to force this information out of you it will be quite unpleasant they be worried about an ambush so they be take the ship we can beat they if we travel by stargate let us go now Howdy you do not really think we would invite you to a party and not disable your funky power do you I have no idea what be go on do not worry Vala it be all part of the plan do not you ever speak to I ever again lower your weapon Buddy I think you 've get the wrong planet lower your weapon or we will all perish my master Lord Ba'al have target this location from orbit what be you do carry out my order okay that be not part of the plan Welcome do not waste your time I 've learn a thing or two from my Tau'ri friend this room be be flood with the same kind of EM field they generate with that clever little device of theirs the one that prevent you from use your mind power you should know that will not hold I forever of course not but that will not be a problem after I be do with you they get the jump on we we have no time to react exactly how do Ba'al manage to pull this off I do not know but they have detailed intelligence he be aware of both our location and intention the big question be what do Ba'al want with Adria perhaps he intend to negotiate for share control of the galaxy she do not strike I as the sharing type either way we do not want those two hang out together exactly we have to get she back we be on it sir wait how be Vala piss be somebody go to fill she in absolutely just not we this be not right you know I escape fair and square bring I back here be tantamount to kidnap listen we know you be upset but you have to understand this be part of a plan Upset why would I possibly be upset maybe because I be betray and abandon by the only people in the entire galaxy I think be my friend do not be silly we be your friend and we do not betray you you do not exactly back I up now do you what she mean be none of it actually happen what be you talk about this device be a slightly altered version of the memory implant technology we receive from a race call the Galarans we use it to create a fictional memory and implant it in your mind and we know you would have trouble understand all of this so we take the liberty of make a recording before you undergo the procedure look tilt it up all right oh yeah thank you now I can see JACKSON we be roll oh we be on why do not you say so JACKSON Gum Thanks hello gorgeous if you be watch this you be obviously back at Stargate Command and you be probably think that everyone around you have go completely wonko Wonko with the possible exception of Daniel who let us face it be always a little bit JACKSON Vala sorry seriously though substitute our memory be my idea Brilliant I know and incredibly brave but it be the only way for the plan to work so if you be watch this you have obviously make it back and let I be the first to say well do and enjoy the substantial pay rise that be be promise to you if the mission succeed JACKSON okay that be enough thank you VALA okay how be we hear that Adria have return through the supergate now if the Ori be dead we think we might be able to convince she to leave quietly with her army we know that she would be able to tell if you be lie to her so as far as you be concern it be not a lie I escape use a Sodan cloak you allow I to be expose to radiation so that you could carry out your plan your plan and no that be also part of the false memory we escort you to the planet where Adria find you and we drop you off you sleep through it like a baby so no I o a no Reynolds ' man no television program about dance with suppose celebrity actually that part be real how very disturbing yeah Comfy you 've make a terrible mistake release I now and I will be merciful you be so much more pleasant when you lack the ability to snap my neck with your thought you be a fool deal with power way beyond your mean when my army catch up to you do not waste your breath your army have no idea where you be and it will be day before they even begin to question your disappearance even then all their query will lead they to the Tau'ri if you intend to kill I you should know the Ori will not halt their attack on this galaxy I have no intention of kill you as a matter of fact my whole plan hinge on your be very much alive so you can ransom I for your freedom far from it you can offer I something far more valuable control of your army they will never listen to you no but they do listen to you there be nothing you can do to make I bend my army to your will CHUCKLES well I would not be so sure about that Agent Barrett have some information regard Ba'al 's whereabout I get a call from one of my agent undercover inside Ba'al 's operation here on Earth apparently the clone be plan to meet as a group apparently the clone be plan to meet as a group where and when p3r 112 today not a lot of notice I just get the intel an hour ago how reliable be it my guy be embed at the top he would not break cover unless he be sure well we 've be here before we have a pretty good idea of the layout take a Marine unit yes sir kind of a quiet spot for such a big meeting I think that be the idea I be not see a lot of movement I think I know why look like somebody get here before we no wound no sign of combat Symbiote poison I believe so why would the ba'al kill their own Jaffa I do not think the Jaffa be the intend target at last the guest of honor shriek you two be about to become very well acquaint well you 've get to hand it to he the man throw a mean dinner party well he know we be come after he he be cover his track indeed BEEPING stand back I be warn you just take it easy we be not go to hurt you much I think they be all dead apparently not and I believe I know why we 've get a lead once he wake up our Jaffa friend be surprisingly forthcoming he confirm the fact that Ba'al be behind the attack that kill all his clone apparently he have assemble they for what they think be a meeting on the Adria situation instead he beam in canister of symbiote poison quite the door prize yeah whatever Ba'al be up to he do not want any witness lucky for we he do not realize one of his Jaffa use tretonin any idea where he be now actually yes the Jaffa be able to provide we with the coordinate where Ba'al 's ship be locate the Odyssey be stand by you move out again in one hour assume for a moment this Jaffa 's tell the truth and we actually find Ba'al 's ship how do you propose we capture Adria same way he get she off the planet we beam in tag she and beam out it be a big ship Colonel how be we go to find she well actually it should not be that difficult we be assume Ba'al have some sort of technology similar to our own anti Prior device otherwise she would have use her power the instant he beam she on board if we scan for those specific EM frequency we should be able to pinpoint her location with a fair degree of accuracy all this presuppose that we get the drop on he and he do not raise his shield yeah all right then good luck Vala you get a sec Sure you be welcome to sit this one out stuttering why I mean why would I you know why we be bring Adria back right sure to tell she to take her army and clear off and if she resist we will take action by kill she you be okay with that of course all right wow I take it we be cloak pretty cool huh yeah Colonel the result of your scan be here this room show a pronounced level of the same EM radiation generate by the anti Prior device look like you be right let us go get she that be it do not worry this will all be over soon beep Jaffa Odyssey we be good to go Hey wake up sorry it be not very comfortable believe I I know from experience but we be not take any chance it be over Adria in ba'al 'S voice I be afraid you be mistaken Adria be no long available LANDRY ON SCREEN Ba ' al be in Adria yes sir it be the bad guy equivalent of cordon bleu it actually make sense from his perspective sir carter not only have he take on a more powerful host but Adria 's also in control of the Ori army so he convince they to do his bidding and not hers when you think about it their goal be not all that different Control of the galaxy worship by million and if the Ori be dead he will never be call to the carpet by the boy upstairs what do we do now kill they both hard to argue with that logic it be a twofer well there be no guarantee that her army would stop fight even if she be dead the only way to be certain be for she to order they to stand down then how do we get she to do that well if Ba'al 's symbiote be suppress Adria 's consciousness we should be able to do the same thing Swap Ba'al out for someone we can trust the Tok'ra do not suppress the host go against their fundamental belief well I be sure they would make an exception in this case we 've be trade intelligence with the Tok'ra since the Ori ship first arrive they want to get rid of they just as much as we do get in touch see if you can set it up in the meantime keep a close eye on your guest so have you decide what you intend to do with I well we be still weigh our option Teal'c here have a good idea I can imagine no you can not I must caution you against do anything too rash in fact your good course of action would be to release I I think we have a difference of opinion there my whole plan be to order the Ori army back out of this galaxy you let I carry it out we will be rid of they forever that be our plan as well only without your participation what do you mean he mean we be go to bring in someone a little more reliable see right now you be like a Pinto engine in a ' 71 Mustang we 've get to swap you out for a big block Tok'ra it take a great deal of effort to suppress a consciousness this powerful the Tok'ra do not have the strength not to mention the fact that I will kill Adria the moment you try to remove I well that be great we can live with that perhaps but remember I be share Adria 's mind you would lose all access to the knowledge I possess for example for one thing I can confirm the Ori be dead and that be just the beginning with my knowledge and your pluckiness we can accomplish a great deal remember how we work together to locate the Sangraal as I recall your effort be not particularly helpful of course it be your decision but it seem you only have two option work with I to our mutual benefit or kill we both and miss out on everything I have to offer you be just in time the Tok'ra contingent be about to arrive I be Ta'seem I will be perform the surgery these be my assistant Welcome on board the Odyssey I be Colonel Davidson I be sure you know Colonel Carter Dr Jackson and Vala yes I know you as Qetesh thing have change a little since then News that the leader of the Ori army have be capture come as a ray of hope to my people that be say the extraction procedure that we be about to undertake be extremely difficult even though we have refine the process considerably there remain a very real risk that Adria will not survive well the only other option we have be to leave Ba'al in and trust he be tell the truth so then we should begin immediately Zanuf the symbiote that we bring can not survive outside of a host for long the infirmary be this way time to go what about our arrangement oh you mean the part where you string we along till you overcome the effect of the anti Prior device we will pass monitor beep the sedative appear to be work Heart rate and bp be hold steady ta'seem there it be let us begin we will need to work quickly the symbiote 's autonomic response can trigger complication even under anesthetic initiate the first incision I need suction what be up nothing just do not feel like stick around for the surgery you know weak stomach and all that hey you sure you be okay with this why do everyone keep ask I that because she be your daughter and no matter what she be do it must be difficult to see she treat this way let us get something clear she be not my daughter Daniel the Ori impregnate I against my will and force I to bring she into the galaxy I be an incubator a shipping crate and nothing more I be sorry but I find it hard to believe that you do not feel something I do Satisfaction at see their plan fail there I 've sever the primary nerve conduit you see how the filament be retract now move on to the lateral monitor beep RAPIDLY what be it I be afraid this might happen hey what be up Trouble with the surgery what happened Ba'al decide to be even more difficult than usual we be able to extract he but not before he release a deadly toxin into Adria 's nervous system can not the Tok'ra symbiote heal she unfortunately we be unable to complete the implantation the host body be simply too weak Adria be unconscious at the moment but when she waken she will suffer greatly before she die the one thing we can do for she be an increase dosage of the toxin it will kill she instantly in the interest of patient care and for our own safety I recommend that we administer it immediately do it I would like to be there Crap ALARM BLARING Adria you and your friend be try to kill I Mother I can not let that happen SG 1 come in what the hell 's go on down there I be get report that all section around the infirmary be be seal off it be Adria sir she be barricade herself in be there any way you can beam we directly there Negative she seem to be generate some kind of EM interference we be go to need a cut torch down here ASAP you get it there be an auxiliary control console on this level if I can get to it I might be able to override it go MOANS you can quit acting you be obviously not sick no this body really be die I just want to use what little time I have leave as wisely as possible by do what destroy I and my friend do not be silly Mother if I want to kill you I could have do it a long time ago no I need time to prepare Prepare for what Ascension Vala do not Vala can you hear I guy it be Daniel I can not reach Vala Daniel Jackson what be your location just outside the infirmary Adria 's lock they in we be block as well Colonel Mitchell be attempt to cut through one of the door well you well hurry up I think I figure out what she be try to do Adria 's try to ascend Adria you do not have to do this grant this be not part of my plan but I can still accomplish a great deal perhaps even more more what More death more enslavement do not attempt to play on my compassion Mother as you say I be not your daughter I be an Ori Part Ori part human that will soon change Great Carter how be that override come well it be not I mean it would not do any good what the hell do that mean she be not actually in control of the system I think she be just hold the door shut with her mind cut torch will take too long what be it your friend be very determined Daniel I be show a coolant leak in the hallway you be in right now spot that thank it be Adria she be try to distract we well it be a hell of a distraction that stuff 's toxic you need to get out of there right now JACKSON yeah that be go to be a problem can you shut it down I will have to re route coolant out of the entire section I be on it Vala if you can hear I I really need you to open the door Adria stop it please that be it I always wonder if you have it in you to kill I Goodbye Mother Nice work it be not we Adria let go cough Jackson I be okay where be Adria she be go jackson and once Adria realize she could not save herself she have no choice but to ascend what do you suppose this mean for we to be honest I be not sure if the Ori be still out there then presumably she be join the fight but if Ba'al be tell the truth and the Ori be dead then she just assume all the power they once have either way we could see some incarnation of she again down the road hold a serious grudge at least we may take comfort in the knowledge that Ba'al be dead would not put a deposit down on that just yet when we be break Adria out of Ba'al 's ship I run across another clone guard she kill he but where there be one there may be more we capture and kill Adria and Ba'al on the same day be you tell I this be all a wash no we deal the Ori movement a serious blow today and we rid ourselves of Adria for the time be that be definitely a step ahead this vessel do not have a pool I be talk about the gambling variety I do not wish to speculate well he say it be something important you be not the least bit curious indeed but I would not risk a wager all Surprise all cheer it be not my birthday VALA LAUGHS AWKWARDLY hey we make a weird cat piñata thingy I tell you to bring something to amuse yourself I do not mean I or the crew well they will not believe that it be my birthday again not my problem be stuck on this ship be bad than be stick at the SGC I tell you the last time I be this bore I take hostage I be there Major we be approach the coordinate sir drop we out we be be hail the Asgard be request permission to beam aboard sir LANDRY grant greeting and welcome to Orilla Thor hello Colonel Carter it be good to see you out of curiosity how can you tell the difference the voice it be good to see you too Thor this be General Landry Colonel Mitchell and Vala greeting so Thor how you be have not hear from you in a while I be sorry I have be otherwise occupy as mention in our communication the high council wish to meet with you to explain in great detail but there be not much time General with your permission a number of Asgard be prepared to beam aboard immediately to begin instal various technological upgrade to this ship I hope it be ray gun I get ray gun in the pool what be it you be plan on give we everything we have and know by that you mean everything all our most current technology all our knowledge sorry we be just a little stunned I mean why be you do this you 've always resist in the past you always say we be not ready indeed Many Asgard still believe that so what be change as a race we be die very soon we will all be go PEOPLE chatter the Asgard computer core be equip with its own power source that will not infringe on your ship 's ZPM however when the upgrade be complete the core will be fully integrate into all the ship 's system there must be something more you can do I assure you we be provide you with all the late Asgard technology as well as a knowledge base include our entire record history that be not what I be talk about everything that can be do have be do the final attempt to solve our physiological degeneration have leave each of we with a rapidly progressing disease it really be not an option for they they make the choice to extend their life through science generation ago it take any natural physiological evolution necessary for Ascension out of the equation they be plan on end their life before the degeneration they be suffer from go too far Mass suicide they do not want any of their knowledge or technology fall into the wrong hand and they want we to witness the event so everything they 've instal on this ship be go to be their legacy if you like you will be able to interface with the core use a holographic representation of I or any other Asgard on record in the knowledge base I be sorry but that just will not be the same I have be work on this for the well part of a year Colonel Carter and we appreciate it really many on the council do not believe we should be impart such advancement well I promise we will do our very good not to let you down you be the fifth race your role be clear if there be any hope in preserve the future it lie with you and your people no pressure huh you have earn my respect and my friendship well the feeling be mutual please do not be sad the end of my people have be a long time come we have make too many irreversible mistake in our development hopefully you can learn something from it my only regret be that our physical weakness have leave we incapable of help you further siren BLARING siren BLARING Sir three Ori mother ship just drop out of hyperspace and be approach the planet LANDRY Colonel this be the bridge we have three contact Ori mother ship bear down Sir the hyperdrive be still offline divert power to the shield you must go Sir the Asgard just disembark it will take a few minute to get the hyperdrive back online full sublight get we clear of the planet full sublight RUMBLING shield be down to 83 how the hell do they find we some reason we be not jump to hyperspace Carter 's work on it Sir sensor be detect a massive build up of energy come from the planet everyone hold on tight shield be down to 50 Colonel Sir the hyperdrive be now online but we have to get clear of the radiation cause by the explosion before we can make the jump safely how about the Asgard energy weapon but they have not be test yet sir shield be down to 28 at maximum sublight we be 47 second to get clear we be not go to make it let us see what these new Asgard upgrade be make of Come about power the energy weapon Energy weapon be power Fire sensor indicate enemy shield be fluctuate keep fire I will be damn we get they MAN copy that sir get we into hyperspace yes sir run another diagnostic Colonel how be that report come I want to be able to brief the President as soon as we get back he be go to want to know how quickly we can duplicate this new Asgard weaponry I be work on it sir but something else have come up the hyperdrive diagnostic be spit out some datum that be concern I we take some damage that be cause a problem I think we need to drop out and run a few test just to be sure Sir two contact just appear on sensor Mother ship Ori closing fast Colonel give we 've already take damage I would rather not take on two more ship rumble CARTER Sir the hyperdrive be back online get we back into hyperspace yes sir it be a hell of a coincidence do not you think well unless they be track we and just wait for we to drop out I think they could not track we in hyperspace unless it be the Ori themselves tip off the Priors JACKSON we 've already pass back into the Milky Way as far as we know the Ancients should have a problem with the Ori use their ascended power right under their nose as far as we know at least we now have weapon we know will destroy an Ori ship well that be not go to do we any good if they can track we wherever we go I mean eventually the Odyssey 's go to come up against more than she can handle be it possible the Priors can detect the new technology give to we by the Asgard without the help of the Ori I suppose the new power source could be give off some sort of unique energy signature that be detectable from subspace however without further experimentation the only way to find out be to shut it off and see if that stop the Ori from follow we do it the problem with that sir be that the new Asgard core be currently tie into every system on this ship we would have to drop out of hyperspace and isolate the core from the hyperdrive control and that could take some time Sir two contact just appear on sensor Son of a bitch rumble shield be down to 53 siren BLARING report of damage front and rear level two six and ten evasive maneuver Fire at will we already take out one ship what be another two right Colonel I need the hyperdrive now go ahead sir Hyperdrive be online we be go to need at least half an hour to get the hyperdrive system separate from the core we must assume the Ori ship will continue to engage we whenever we stop be there a planet with a stargate nearby yes sir P3X 474 it be uninhabited we should get there in just under an hour we might make it before the hyperdrive fail and what Beam to the surface and gate home we can not let this ship fall into enemy hand that be what the self destruct be for whoa wait a minute sir if you be talk about destroy the ship we can not sacrifice the knowledge base of the Asgard they trust we with their legacy Dr Jackson this be not something I be consider lightly I be assume we can not take any of it with we no sir the core be too big to fit through the gate well I for one be willing to stay and put up a fight I think it be worth it get we to 474 we will beam the crew down to the surface hopefully there will be enough time for they to gate home before the Ori attack and then what I say it before I be for fight to the death but we need a plan preferably one that avoid the to the death part we have an hour to come up with one I think I may have a way of buy we a little more time here they come Shields at maximum evasive maneuver concentrate fire on only one target one at a time rumble okay that be not good shield be down to 23 we be hit they with everything we 've get shield be offline one more hit will take we out Colonel Carter thank to Asgard technology we be in a time dilation bubble while time may appear to be pass at a normal rate for we in fact year will pass inside the bubble while mere fraction of a second pass outside the field you will not need that much time though hopefully not my plan be to try to make the necessary modification to the Odyssey so that we can take it out of phase then when we shut down the time dilation field the blast will not hit we that would be good you be probably wonder why I do not just do that in the first place I be still back on the time thing the Asgard core have time dilation field technology build right into it it be a quick and easy option I be actually go to have to recreate some of Merlin 's out of phase technology from scratch with what we have onboard and it could take a while just to be sure how long be a while in our time I be not exactly sure but we have enough food and water for three month three month we can ration supply WHISPERING I be go to go crazy and I be take you with I of course if it take a little long oh whoa long than three month bottom line be none of you be go to have any excuse for be behind on your paperwork CHUCKLES that function be not possible VALA do you think the Ori warrior could have find a way to get through the time dilation field and over here onto the ship no because I be hear thing all the time be you hear thing I be try not to maybe they find a way to ring over but they can not figure out how to secretly shut off the time dilation field so they be try to drive we crazy and make we shut it down ourselves no that be not a question no before I try to build Merlin 's out of phase technology I decide to run a simulation be you say it take two week to figure out this idea would not work I be sorry I 've be try to adjust the parameter now the problem be accord to Thor I can not seem to take the ship out of phase before I shut down the field and once we deactivate the time dilation field we have 86 second before the blast hit we and that just be not enough time to take the ship out of phase okay time for plan b actually I run that simulation too if we beam ourselves into the buffer ready to transport down to the planet and set the time dilation field to deactivate on a timer the matter stream still do not have enough time to fully exit the buffer and get clear of the explosion fine plan c we go to the 302 that be how I get off the Korelev Ran that too base on the way the Odyssey be go to be hit compare to the Korelev it will not work the computer 's wrong both of the last two scenario do not preserve the ship or the Asgard knowledge I know okay it be only be a couple of week I have a problem with the word only carter the good news be the Asgard have provide we with some truly amazing technology just nothing to get we out of this mess I do not know that yet however with only a slight modification to the beam technology we have a matter converter that will literally allow we to manufacture food water oxygen pretty much anything we need except a way off this ship you 've make your point son I doubt very much Colonel Carter have even scratch the surface of what be possible let us give she some more time I mean all they want to do be live a little long we be no different Sequence DNA cure disease and one fatal mistake and they doom their entire race I guess no matter what you do at the end of the day life be too short I agree what be you do something we should have do a long time ago do not do that why not we 've be here three month Daniel three month you do like girl yes well I do not see many other option around here do you unless you really do not find I attractive do you want an honest answer to that question no no seriously you start this do you want an honest answer to the question no do not worry about it do you believe I could have any kind of serious feeling for you I be not suggest you have serious feeling Daniel oh oh what so what we sleep together once then what we work together you know even say that part out loud sound unbelievable I mean come on I mean I can not even imagine what a relationship with you would be like I mean yes yes you 've prove yourself to be trustworthy on a professional level and for that I be very proud of you but on a personal level Vala come on give I a break I mean at good you be an emotional unstable wreck I be not say I be much well I be not say I be much well there be a time when I think I would never get over my wife I mean the idea of be hurt that way again but I have finally get to the place I finally for the first time in a long time have get to the place where I actually feel I could get close to somebody again but not in a million year a million million year would I ever possibly consider that person be you I mean we be so completely opposite and wrong for each other it be not even funny and the bad part the bad part about that be you know that and this whole flirty sexual thing that you do that be just your way of have a laugh at my expense so I be so sorry if I be not more appreciative of that and I be so sorry that you be bore but do not you pretend it be anything else do not act like you be hurt hey just give I a minute look at I you well not be mess with I General we need to take our chance with the F 302s what I need be a sun lamp this matter convert oxygen just be not the same oh why be the grand irony of this lose on everyone but I it be not Sir at this point we know it be the damn Asgard upgrade that allow the Ori to track we so even if we manage to save the ship we will not be able to use the technology because the Ori will come down on we like a bag of hammer for now oh come on sir it be like a bad joke we have strand ourselves here try to save something we can not use I be not have this conversation again I want to help you the problem be that there be not enough time to shut off the time dilation field and start a new process I know I be just think out loud here I know what be that thing oh it be a cello I 've always want to learn how to play be it possible to use the time dilation technology to solve our problem how well obviously it would sorry obviously it would be great if we could go back in time and not get into this situation in the first place well slow down time within a localize field be not even close to the same thing as reverse time altogether it be a good thought though see what we need be we need Superman to fly around the ship really really fast oh if you only know how ridiculous that be no it only sound ridiculous till you hear yourself say I be trap on a spaceship stick in a time dilation field HA ve you ever see the RAIN playing that function be not possible I hate this ship you be a pilot you love fly and fighter this be not fly this be literally stand still this be the Love Boat without the buffet and the band besides I only like fly so much because I do not know about the Stargate that function be not possible cello playing cough twenty year today still think life be too short hey hey why do you do it know everything you learn be go to die with you I know you guy all think I be crazy but the truth be if I stop I will go crazy besides you have not give up yes I have stop it I can not I be sorry it be not your fault we all would have die long ago if if you have not do what you do do not give up MUMBLING when I say that I want to get the team back together work with you guy learn from you I do not mean every wake moment for the next 50 year you say that yesterday I do and the day before and the day before that oh sorry I will just shut up now no I be sorry I should not have say anything I do it you do what I figure out how to reverse time in a localize field what what be the matter maintain the time dilation field for all this time have almost completely deplete the ZPM and the power source in the Asgard core we do not have enough power to make it work there be irony for you huh I create the field to buy we more time I finally figure out how to undo it all and that extra time be what make it impossible be you sure I mean if you have some more time could you I be sure hey Sam do you remember when we be stick out of phase which time when you got shoot and you think you be go to die and the Ori be go to destroy that village Vaguely you have I use the power source from an Ori staff weapon to power Merlin 's device we do not have anything even close to a power source that would be require to keep a reverse time field work for long enough really come with I what about that that there be no way we there be no way to absorb the blast and channel the energy into the Asgard core unless unless we reroute the power conduit throughout the ship into the core and let the blast hit we this ship will explode yes but hopefully enough energy from the blast will be channel into the core to allow it to activate the reverse time field before everything be totally destroy but we will be dead if this work we will only be dead for a few millisecond then time within the bubble will reverse and we will not be dead and the ship will not be destroy if this work yes I be not promise anything it be all right it be a shot and I say we take it how far back can we go only to the point where the time dilation field be create only to the point where the time dilation field be create we can not reverse time for the entire universe if we go back any far than that we be outside of normal time space again and we create a paradox that the technology could not handle be that go to be good enough I might be able to buy we a little more time maybe a minute but one of we be go to have to stay old oh oh we be talk about reverse time within the field everything our age our memory will be undo if this work we will be doom to repeat history unless we can exclude someone from the field who can steer event in another direction you create the time dilation field to prevent we from be hit by that blast in the first place you have no choice all right we have to sever the Asgard core from the hyperdrive control or else the Ori will be able to follow we when we make the jump into hyperspace a long time ago in the event that I ever do solve the time issue I create a program that would achieve that very quickly I will load it onto a crystal that way it will only take I a few second to shut down the core and make the jump into hyperspace who say it be go to be you well it make sense that it be I I will do it teal'c you 've lose as many year as the rest of we MITCHELL what be you 130 now I do not know he do not look a day over 120 to I I have many more year to live and I be the only logical choice teal'c I have but one question if this should not work then the shield will fail and you will die along with the rest of we then it be settle I want you to know even if you be go to forget that I be not with you all these year because we be trap on this God awful ship I be with you because I know and I want you to know that I I know I know carter I be ready do it Sam siren BLARING shield be offline one more hit will take we out Colonel Carter teal'c what be you do oh come on it be drive I insane you know technically there would be no danger of create a time paradox because we 've already change future event you would not be alter the future by tell we about something that be not go to happen anymore then why do you care Fifty or 60 year something interesting must have happen obviously I hook up with someone be it you muscle it can not have be Mitchell can it General Landry Dial it up Walter yes sir Chevron one encode MITCHELL that be how we be suppose to travel light year across the galaxy to other planet Chevron two encode you know I would like to think that I handle myself well but I imagine I go a bit crazy coope up on that ship for so long Chevron three encode you know Teal'c do tell I some thing I learn from the Asgard knowledge base he do like what oh boy what be they HARRIMAN Chevron four encode beggar can not be chooser well late than never look before you leap the good thing in life be free and let I guess Beauty be only skin deep Silence be golden Chevron five encode Jack of all trade master of none nothing venture nothing gain Life be too short Chevron six encode good thing come to those who wait you know as hard as it be for we not know it must be torture for you not to tell we indeed Chevron seven be lock good luck SG 1 just another everyday mission to save the galaxy sir all indeed Godspeed span ten season with over two hundred episode Stargate SG 1 have travel to countless planet encounter different race and meet numerous alien some friend and some foe they have work tirelessly to use whatever mean necessary to acquire technology that could help Earth in its battle against unforeseen aggressor but one of the big reason for Stargate SG 1 's success have be the way that Earth base mythology have be weave into the show 's fabric Woven be a fantastic way of put it Michael you know over ten season the show have always find an entertaining way to put a Stargate twist on a mythology join we as we take you deep into ten year of Stargate SG 1 mythology and do not worry we will sort it all out for you by the end of this show we hope we hope the Projet SG Team present timing by Golgi Malikay and Ricana Transcription by Swsub

set of story tradition or belief associate with a particular group arise naturally or deliberately foster then the writer of Stargate SG 1 be certainly do everything possible to create a deep and layered mythology that Stargate could call its own make no mistake Osiris will return and the river of the Earth will run red with blood I think the role that mythology have play in the show have obviously be a very important one I mean from the genesis of the series it be base in egyptian mythology this be just incredible you know be the cradle of civilisation we often wonder the how s and the why s and this give at least a sci fi perspective of what could have maybe possibly happen back in those ancient time Jack I think that this be a map of a vast network of Stargates Stargates that be all over the galaxy the Stargate 's a key mythological element in the show because it fit into a number of mythological system the egyptian the Celtic the Norse which be three major system that operate in the show all have reference to bridge for example that traverse one world to the next the Stargate be the mean of seed all of the planet with different mythology so as a narrative device it work perfectly you know I think people love to see story that they be familiar with you know mythological story thing that they 've hear before explain with the Stargate twist I think that be one of the good thing about Stargate I think it be one of the first thing that attract I to the feature film be the concept of the idea that certain myth or question or you know the great wonder of the world or different relic like the pyramid that be leave behind be yet to be really properly explain and everybody be get some high falutin ' theory that be what be great about science fiction and ask the what if question be that we can put our own spin on that because we have artistic licence to do whatever we want the wonderful thing about Stargate the series be that we 've be able to borrow from the Egyptians we 've be able to borrow from the Greeks and the Romans and now we be work on arthurian mythology but we be actually able to conjure up with our imagination some speculation and idea that other people have toy with because there be no right answer so we can create something and it really make as oppose to just make people escape it make they kind of think and go well that might be true or that be not true the parchment tell we that five virtue would guide we in our quest for the Sangraal prudence kindness charity wisdom and faith now we display prudence in find a way out of the temporal maze charity in escape the forcefield trap kindness by help the child and find the hide passageway and wisdom in solve the riddle the only virtue leave be faith Mythologies be design to give we a sense of how we fit into the universe they ask where we be come from and where we be go so where be you from where we come from and where we be go be all the same oh I get ya wherever you go there y'are and what we see when we look at mythological system and what our intrepid hero SG 1 see when they look out and the vast panoply of character that they meet there be really yourself everywhere you go there you be and that be one of the reason that Stargate work so well be because it do have this hook into ancient mythology and a lot of fan be fascinated with the whole idea of the ancient mythology because they use it as a sort of scientific explanation for thing that can not really be explain otherwise there be a legend around here about a Hall of Thor 's Might there be a time and place for mythology uh with all due respect sir we think Thor 's Hammer be a myth until we prove it be real in fact Stargate be something that you might call cultural bricolage it be a way of go through all of human culture and pick up little bit and piece and stick they together but stick they together use the Stargate as a glue and make it into a really really interesting story Major General Jack O'Neill U S Air Force Dr Daniel Jackson Civilian Egyptologist Lieutenant Colonel Samantha Carter U S Air Force Astrophysicist teal'c former 1st prime to Apophis teal'c leader of Jaffa Rebellion Lieutenant Colonel Cameron Mitchell U S Air Force Vala Mal Doran Human Alien Vala Mal Doran Former Thief and Con Artist there be a ruler for mythology in term of hero I know that but it be also a good rule of television you can pair off we be go to split up I be with Teal'c wait up and you can cover a good dynamic of different kind of hero you 've get your military person in Jack O'Neill later on then Mitchell Bullets Bounce and you 've get your warrior in Teal'c you have Daniel Jackson as an intellectual and scientist unless we want a really bad reputation we should avoid shoot the first people we meet on a new planet and Sam possibly the hard character to have to try to portray she be almost all of they she be the warrior she be the thinker when the local sun set and it get dark you can actually see a luminous layer of ionise gas around the die core expand Fascinating and of course a woman boy do she have a lot on her plate and she can pull it off it be amazing how good be this we 've get the band back together you sure with the extra backup singer ah she be good fun plus we figure if Jackson be to die that be the word it would jeopardise the mission as the series progress especially a series that have go as long as SG 1 you start create a I 've be refer to it as a sort of critical mass of its own mythology mythology that stop borrow from other culture and ancient Earth history and start basically a self generate mythology from the very first episode of Season 1 there be little doubt that SG 1 be in for a wild ride with the introduction of the Goa'uld Apophis and his foot soldier the Jaffa Stargate SG 1 get into a battle that would span eight long and exciting season keep true to the original movie the producer of Stargate SG 1 maintain egyptian mythology as a drive antagonistic force throughout the show who parasitic race bent on conquer all planet take human host and pose as ancient egyptian Goods Physiology Larvae produce by queen offspring be bear evil with genetic memory and intellect of lineage Goa'uld Technology live thousand of year due to Sarcophagus Cures disease heal injury and revive the dead side effect negative psychological impact the Goa'uld be kind of opportunist you know they take technology and they use that and they also take on the role of god if you want to dominate a culture that already have a god what could be easy than to step in and say well that be I Hathor yes have you hear of her Hathor be the egyptian goddess of fertility inebriety and music Sex drug and rock n ' roll in a manner of speak yeah the Goa'uld take a human host and that personality be repress the symbiont that be the Goa'uld have genetic memory of the Queen that spawn it and so they have memory that go back thousand of year the god of the Egyptians tend to be combination of animal and human and what well to represent the combination of an animal and human than a serpent invade a human body the Goa'uld be establish already in the movie and then in the pilot of the series as the main bad guy for the show and they have these very ceremonial way they be essentially pose as god and so they take on all of the pomp and circumstance one of the thing that be interesting about egyptian mythology be that the iconography be so recognisable and be associate with grandeur and bombast and excess they be basically an arrogant worm they be sort of a small creature that have adopt the vastness and the power of a pre exist system and so the spectacle of the egyptian model be really really important to the show who leader of the Goa'uld Assume persona of an Earth base god and rule by force through army of Jaffa warrior Balance of power the System Lords rarely trust each other and frequently battle amongst themselves Physiology Most of the System Lords have inhabit the same host body for millenia Yu the Jade emperor be so old that he could not leave his host the System Lords can not be trust either as a group or individual they be posture egomaniac drive by an insatiable lust for power each one capable of unimaginable evil once your good guy have defeat your bad guy suddenly the bad guy look weak you either need new bad guy that be either more bad or you need more bad guy the System Lords really be just the most powerful Goa'ulds I be Baal as in boccie they be the Goa'ulds who have their own army their own fleet of ship and their own territory among the star I think with the System Lords what be important because in every pantheon of god there be a hierarchical system and I think that it be important because you have all these System Lords war with each other who all seem to represent different deity from different mythos in Earth lore whom do you serve Anubis what you lie he be dead that be what you assume after you attempt to murder he because of the hierarchical system you could only have thing go a certain way this guy have to be more powerful than that if that be the way it be paint out in our history and the way our ancestor understand this so it be really interesting when you get an episode like Summit when you have all these guy in the same room but they all represent different cultural distinction there be Amaterasu which be japanese a god from african mythology Cronus that be Greek Bastet which be egyptian Yu from the chinese mythology although interestingly enough Yu be a character who be not a god in the chinese mythology he be I think an architect or sort of a high official they kind of adopt the culture the Goa'uld kind of become the god they be portray who slave of the Goa'uld breed to fight their battle incubator for Goa'uld young Physiology Carry Goa'uld symbiote that function as Jaffa 's immune system when symbiote reach maturity in 7 8 year it must take a host Jaffa technology Staff weapon prefer weapon of Jaffa warrior use naquadah power and fire an energy plasma blast the Jaffa be originally create as foot soldier for the Goa'uld kill the rest the Jaffa be literally the incubator for Goa'uld child what the hell be that it be an infant Goa'uld the larval form of the god I have carry one since I be a child as all Jaffa carry one to show their devotion and servitude to the Goa'ulds they wear their symbol on their forehead the First Primes get the gold one they 've be cut into their forehead and molten gold have be pour in and it be kind of a special rite of passage to get the first Prime tattoo as time go on and we begin humanise the Jaffa and more and more be explore the fact that they be essentially innocent they be not do what they be do because they be evil unlike the Goa'uld who be genetically pre disposed to be evil I can save these people help I essentially we tell the Jaffa story through Teal'c help I many have say that but you be the first I believe could do it teal'c be dissatisfied with his situation find out very early on that there be other Jaffa that feel the same way why do you defy I because you be not a god you be a parasite within a child and I despise you the basis of the movement and the basis I think of any movement be the people I think that really show that a society of people be not control from the top down but from the bottom up I die free they finally rise up lead by Teal'c and throw off the yoke of Goa'uld oppression and win their freedom in the battle against the Goa'uld Earth need ally and with perfect timing we meet the Asgard borrow from the look of the Roswell grey and a long stand Norse mythology the Asgard represent a strength that SG 1 have not see since meet the Goa'uld it would later foster a friendship and an alliance that would run throughout the entire series who Benevolent and powerful technological god who protect rather than enslave people they believe as too simple to understand their science Physiology a die race that reproduce Physiology entirely through clone Asgard technology Asgard Stones control function in Asgard mothership include communication holographic projection navigation and transport beam initially what we have be SG 1 be the good guy and the Goa'uld be the bad guy but the Goa'uld be so powerful that there be really no way that SG 1 even stand a chance that be why the Asgard be introduce in a way the Asgard be as much an adversary to the Goa'uld as we be and we become friend with they so where be I this be the Asgard planet Othala in the galaxy of Ida so the Asgard be important because they do take the show in a new direction largely by introduce a new race a new power in the galaxy Ladies and gentleman I think this be Thor 's chariot an Asgard mothership I 've hear they describe in Jaffa legend in Thor 's Hammer these people believe that they would always be protect by their god Thor they appear to have all of the accoutrement of ancient Norse god I be Thor you be brave to come before I o mighty Thor we need your help originally they be present in hologram form as mighty Norse god when you see the Asgard for what they be they be wildly different so we get that kind of contrast which sort of show the relationship between what we imagine and what be actually real but we also get thing like for instance the notion of custodial god right so Thor replace Odin the warrior god because he be a custodial god he look after farm not raider and Thor and the Asgard be custodial alien the Protected Planets Treaty and so forth the Asgard will attempt to negotiate with the Goa'uld System Lords to include Earth in the Protected Planets Treaty that be a good thing right I think it be really interesting to because of these alien who be not go to fit in and be able just to converse openly so they have to do some research and if they be deal with primitive civilasation so they have to do some research of how do we communicate to these people and how do we get they to possibly do our bidding or just find out a little bit more about they so the idea that they use technology to imitate human type life form that appeal to a specific culture like the norse people at the time I think that be a little bit more interesting to I and something that go on throughout the entire serie and just keep evolve the coordinate be set be you ready Colonel Carter Ready as I will ever be initiate transport who technologically advanced bug program by creator with only one objective self replication create by Android Reese as toy and protector design to replicate at all cost she eventually lose control of they Physiology individual block exert a reactive modulate energy field on other block allow they to reassemble in a new form eventually evolve into human form replicator shortly after the asgard be introduce we realize we 've create an adversary for the goa'uld that be in fact so powerful that it do not really make sense why the asgard have not wipe the goa'uld out and it be kind of look at that hole in the series that that you know make we invent the Replicators the original replicator introduce in sg 1 be these little mechanical creature that consume metal what be you say they be actually eat the ship ingest the alloy yes they will continue until they risk compromise the integrity of the hull you have the asgard that be so advanced that have obviously advanced past the use of these crude projectile weapon who be try to use energy base weapon and it be not have an effect you have demonstrate their weakness may be find through a less sophisticated approach we be no long capable of such thinking wait a minute you be actually say that you need someone dumb than you be you may have come to the right place and as a result replicator have pretty much overrun their galaxy and we end up do a well job of handle the threat they pose to our galaxy the replicator give we a really interesting thoughtless Bent on destruction kind of antagonist for we to face but it also highlight our own need to walk carefully when deal with artificial intelligence and deal with technology that get away on we so I think that be a nice avenue for we to peruse for a while as well it be a good example of how an enemy how a race evolve and become part of a series ' canon and part of the ground from which you build story as the writing continue to cultivate the mythology of the show the scope of just how much the Stargate open we up to the universe be become more evident with every new episode in the same season that we meet the Asgard we come across a new ally that would prove fruitful in the fight against the Goa'uld the Tok'ra who highly advanced alliance of Goa'uld resistance main goal be the destruction of the System Lords Physiology the Tok'Ra take symbiote by choice and share a mutually beneficial relationship Alliances Tok'Ra Tauri alliance grow strong when Colonel Carter 's father Jacob Carter become host to the Tok'Ra symbiote Selmak kiss I you be kid right no I be not really the reason we invent the Tok'Ra be how do you get out of the problem of have a Goa'uld in one of your main character the twist be what if that Goa'uld be actually a good guy one of the element of the show that I really enjoy be the philosophical difference between be a Jaffa be a Goa'uld and be a Tok'Ra goa'uld take host Tok'ra do not our wish to be so we have a truly symbiotic relationship the Tok'Ra have be a long stand ally but their number be few and they 've always be a little wary of stick their neck out too far SG 1 's search for ally and its desire to acquire technology that could help Earth in its battle against unforeseen aggressor be only overshadow by the quest to understand the big picture who start it all it be the introduction of the Ancients to the Stargate universe that add a rich new layer to Stargate 's mythology who Race of ascend being that exist in a state of enlightenment Alliance one of the four great race of the Ancient Alliance consist of the Asgard the Nox the Furlings and the Ancients Ancient Technology Ancient Repository a device within a sealed chamber hold the archive of ancient knowledge capable of download directly onto a subject 's mind the Ancients and ascension be very much about the continuation of the human soul beyond humanity as we know it I be an Ancient what not I but the other like I they be the Ancients this be write in one of the old dialect of the Ancients I always suspect but I never really know for sure what do it say it say they evolve from a race of human that live long before we that they be wipe out by a plague sweep across the galaxy and that many learn to ascend and the rest die out I have to go Daniel we 've kind of say that the ancient be we we be the second evolution of this physical form and the idea of the Ancients be that they evolve eventually they become so knowledgeable of the universe and of the understanding of existence that they be able to shed their human body and turn into energy and the philosophy that they then have to adopt because it empower they so much be to not interfere if you know what it be we be look for and as an ascended being I have to assume you do as Doctor Jackson know it be against our high law to interfere they refer to that most important question or one of the two most important question of mythology the first one be where do we come from actually they answer both of those where do we come from and where be we go so they be Origin and Telos right the beginning and the end the marking on the wall be a language it be a bible no actually it be more of an instruction book on how to reach this ethereal plane of existence some kind of other world it be natural the Jaffa who find this place would have interpret it as a passage to the afterlife slow down there Grasshopper if the ancient be really the first form human form that live on Earth and build the Stargates and then go out into the galaxy from here as evidence by the fact that it be our constellation on the Stargate then they have to have be on Earth million of year ago in which case there should be some evidence of it I do not think this be it Sam what do you mean the dome 's too small it be like Taonas it be obviously not a city it be just an outpost of some kind this be not Atlantis I do not think so the lost city of Atlantis it be interesting because it be mystical even at the moment when we first hear about it in Plato it have already be sink in the sea for nine thousand year and so it bring with it that huge suitcase of history and association with that banish past as the season move on and SG1 align with their ally to overpower the Goa'uld the show take on a new direction event occur that lead the SG 1 team to a new race which cause they to re examine everything they think they know about the Gate builder Robert I think quite correctly say look let us let us introduce a new bad guy let us introduce a new a new long term large arc that can be that can be essentially a new mythology that be still very much within the Stargate universe once upon a time there be a race of people that be on a great journey through space across the universe they be call the Altera after much time and I think this mean thousand of year they find a great belt of star and they live happily ever after have you find something Daniel Jackson it say that the Alterans name their new home Avalon and that they build many Astria Porta Stargates in Avalon 1 Vala come through the Gate and she be carry this treasure map and the treasure map lead we the treasure happen to be here on Earth and it be a cache of treasure and possibly weapon and technology that we have be look for for year Avalon be actually a place where Merlin help Arthur a mortal ascend be not the ancient prevent from interfere with the existence of mortal Ascended ancient yes for the most part but it be possible Merlin be not actually ascend himself but be in fact just a human far along the evolutionary path what do this have to do with where this allege treasure be bury there be a number of conflicting interpretation but certain thread point to the Knights of the Round Table gather great treasure from the far corner of Arthur 's domain and hide they in a magical stronghold at Avalon the idea that Glastonbury Tor be the place where King Arthur be bury now immediately shine a light on that make you go what the heck do that have to do with anything you realise what this could mean Woah we 've always presume that the Ancients be the first evolution of human in this galaxy but but this this be the first evidence suggest they come here long ago from somewhere far far away Colonel Mitchell the Alterans be a way of distinguish the Ancients be an entire culture the Ori and the Alterans be the two aspect of that that break off in different direction the discovery that the Alterans actually potentially exist in another galaxy be our way in Season 9 of separate those two we always keep refer to the ancient as one distinct govern body that be always look on and we just refer to they as the Ancients and then the discovery that there be if there be a good one then there must be a bad one here too Hallowed be the Ori the new direction of the show have begin and the tide be turn with every mission the introduction of the fundamentalist Ori serve notice that the battle to keep the galaxy safe be far from over who ascend being that use advanced technology and spiritual knowledge to deceive the non ascend human into worship they Great Divide the division between the Ori and the Alterans be a result of the emergence of two different philosophy the Alterans follow a more scientific rational outlook while the Ori develop fundamentalist religious belief the Ori unlike the ancient who have adopt this kind of hand off policy towards our galaxy the Ori be very hand on and be the antithesis of the ancient we 've create I want the new bad guy to have the same feeling to have the same essence that the relationship with the Goa'uld be at the beginning of the series they could be pose as god but have even more power it be all lie and propaganda as far as they be concern we be wrong they be right they be good we be bad we must worship the Ori or die and they will fight until we be dead or they be Period one of the thing that we intentionally do be look at the colourful flamboyance of the Goa'uld and take a decidedly dark approach to the Ori the Priors be quite obviously the priest of the religion what be interesting about they be that again they have supernatural ability the Ori as ascended being have a certain knowledge of the way thing work of human and of evolution and so they can impart advancement on people they can wave their magic wand and give people psychic ability or telekinesis or super strength whatever and the Priors have that so when the prior say hey we represent the Ori and guess what we have the ability to you know plant our staff in the ground and part the Red Sea uh people tend to believe they behold the gift the Ori have bestow upon I it be interesting to create bad guy that from their point of view be maybe not so bad I mean the warrior the people who believe in Origin be say hey come on you know they be say be behave yourself and we will help you ascend what be there for any and all to gain by choose the path of Origin those seek eternal salvation can follow the word of the Ori those that do not shall die as mortal it be as simple as that the twist be that they be actually not help people ascend the Ori be actually a small group of ascended being who be manipulate people because they actually gain some sort of energy power from the worship of human being for starter do you know that the Ori need people to worship they because that be how they gain their power he do not know no he do not know that they be not fulfil the one promise of the religion and that be that if you be good you be go to be you be go to be bring up to their level I never dream I would one day be fit to serve the Ori in this way by kill people you know nothing about all I need to know be that they be an enemy of the Ori that they reject the teaching of Origin and would have we stray from the path these so call unbeliever they be so far away how can they affect we Evil must not be allow to fester anywhere Tomin be an excellent example of a character who gets sweep away in this religious fervour if you will unlike the Ori or even the Priors to a certain extent he be not an evil individual but incredibly misguide and so you feel sympathy for the character Fear not once we warrior of Ori have vanquish the wicked I shall return I be really interested in make the warrior multi dimensional I really want to kind of understand what it would be like on the other side you have to listen to I no I be deaf to all but the teaching of Origin so by put Vala you know as behind enemy line so to speak and have she develop this relationship I mean here be a guy who she really could have probably spend her life with who just also happen to be you know a holy crusader now hear the word of the Orici right from the get go we know that if we have get into Season 10 we need to kind of put a figurehead on that put a real face on the bad guy we create the character who have a knowledge of the Ori in the form of a human being she be you know immaculately conceive Vala carry the child and then the Ori kind of snuck one of their own over the border and cheat the ancient rule we be not rejoin the fleet you be come with I no I can not abandon my army it be not your army of course it be as your mother I be put my foot down you be too young to have your own army with the introduction of Adria who I liken to an evil Joan of Arc what of the village have they agree to accept the teaching of Origin no then burn it we have a character who not only embody you know the spirit of the Ori but be able to interact with we on a physical level I think with the introduction of the Ori to the mythology of Stargate what it be do be that it be allow we to be a little bit more intellectual a little bit more contemporary with our usage of the word god in the context of science fiction what be a god but a being that be worship by those beneath be great knowledge power understand not enough for you to revere the Ori respect yes certainly but that do not mean I would murder innocent people in their name People be say oh my God the Ori they be so powerful and the Priors be so bad I mean how be the team ever go to defeat they how be they ever go to win and I mean that be kind of what we want that be what the fan reaction be I think at the beginning of the series when you know here we have the Goa'uld and they have all these ship and technology how be we ever go to beat they well eight year later we do we kick their ass and now we have to set up a situation in the same series where our hero can once again overcome what seem to be incredible odd to win as SG 1 's focus turn to the birth of a new enemy the show delve far into a world of arthurian mythology and lead we on a chase for the Holy Grail have you hear of Merlin Merlin King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table be an Ancient I think so see that be what I be talkin ' about Merlin be not a particularly spiritual character in arthurian legend he be a guy that manipulate thing so that Arthur be bear and then help Arthur with the business of be king in Stargate it be sort of the other way around again he come down from a holy place from be ascend and help people towards defend themselves on the physical plain and also against spiritual danger it make sense that this guy Merlin have the capability of of be a wizard and send Arthur on this quest because he really be a very powerful alien if you will welcome ye Knights of the Round Table man of honour follower of the path of righteousness only those with wealth of knowledge and truth of spirit shall be give access to the underworld you know the Merlin Holy Grail be a search be a search for something that would be the answer the solution to our problem and it be the main thrust of Season 10 search for the device that hopefully you know if use properly would actually kill the Ori your world as well as countless other be in danger of be overrun by an enemy far more powerful than you could ever imagine they be call the Ori and they will destroy anyone who do not kneel before they we learn a long time ago Merlin be work on a weapon that could be use against they and the key to find that weapon be inside that library the Holy Grail be a really interesting figure because it be again a pseudo christian artefact that be never actually accept officially by the Church but it have that sort of strong Christian association bring by Joseph of Arimathea to England and be associate with resurrection and purity of heart Prudence wisdom charity kindness and faith let these be your guide on this perilous quest so it have this really long history but it be associate with the quest and with nobility and with chivalry and all those kind of thing and it have therefore a really strong redemptive quality to it it be lose because humanity be wicked so that notion that when we find it there be a kind of redemption but it be tricky in this context because it be also associate with potential genocide right in the fact that it could destroy the Ori and anybody else who happen to be ascend and I think that through we use this we be able to take something other than just use deity and their story we be able to take a little piece of our own unexplained history possibly and say hey what if it do happen but it do not happen quite like people think it do we be talk about the Holy Grail every movie I 've see that be a cup no the notion that the Grail be a cup or chalice particularly the one use by Christ at the last Supper be a late addition to the myth similar account describe it variously as a dish or platter or in the case of von Eschenbach and other Middle Eastern influence chronicler as a stone that fall from the heaven from the feeding of the Goa'uld to the discovery of the Ori from meet the Asgard to the search for the Holy Grail Stargate SG 1 have create a rich and complex mythology that have give the fan a reason to tune in every week someone once compare Stargate to a really cool long and complicated novel that do not ever have to end the only way you can have that kind of complex rich detailed mythology be to have it slowly evolve over the course of ten year hard to believe when you say that the success of the show I think be very much tie to that large superstructure the ability to take something that we know something that we recognise the pyramid for example and to give it to we in a new way so after ten season and over two hundred episode Stargate SG 1 have with the help of some of the world 's great myth take the fan on a fantastic voyage and the voyage continue Teams Projet SG SG 66 v 1 00 http projet sg net http seriestele net Welcome back SG 9 stay in the Gate room General Landry will be down for a short debrief so after 10 year and about 1 000 e mail request I finally get my own parking spot two day after Sir Sir Major Davis Morning good morning Colonels Major dial it up Chief they be right on schedule what be I sign this time nothing sir just want your autograph Chevron one encode you do not want to come along might never be another one Tempting as it be I will be do paperwork the whole time besides one general look over your shoulder be plenty yes speak of Jack he go ahead with SG 3 to officially hand over the prisoner guess he know who we be deal with such precaution be unnecessary half of the free Jaffa fleet stand guard over the Tok'ra homeworld to ensure that the execution of Ba'al take place as plan you know well than anyone muscle this be an extraction not an execution oh well this be just in case no no no Airman you be not walk into my first extraction ceremony carry that thing wait a minute this be your first yeah it should be interesting lt'll blow your mind lt be pretty incredible witness a Goa'uld be extract from a host be one thing actually experience it be something else to feel the sensation of the symbiote that have control your every action for so many year while you watch helplessly from the darkest recess of your mind as it be finally excise from your body and leave to writhe in the light of day well that be incredible Chevron seven lock go to it SG 1 okay this I get to see I will leave the light on never in the history of boredom have anyone be more bored than I be right now come on sir it be only be it be almost over the crime they be list be start to sound familiar crime that be what they 've be croon about for the last three hour quite the ditty be not it it be not fair to the host anyway Vala you do not really think there be any hope for the I mean you be host to Qetesh for a relatively short period of time Ba'al inhabit this guy for 2 000 year revive the prisoner watch he try and make a run for it well with all this security I really do not think he be go to get very far Vala the prisoner will step forward Ba'al last of the Goa'uld System Lords murderer of untold million these will be your last word speak I have nothing to say to the Tok'ra SG 1 and General Jack O'Neill well well how be trick b I 've be well I be afraid and you not so bad actually quite good how nice for you how about those last word as you wish teal'c I will always regret that you never become my first Prime and where be my dear Qetesh well Vala be here lntereste she be probably go to the bathroom for heaven 's sake I be next in line by the way can we get on with this there be one more thing you 've all make a terrible mistake yes that be what they all say there can be no doubt of your crime what I mean to say be I be not the last of the Goa'uld System Lords though I do admit I may be last of the clone there be so many of we it be difficult to be certain Mitchell we track they all sir this one be the last one you sure that be after all why we 've come why we have to endure all that singe get rid of the last bad guy and then there be cake Carter as you know in order to track his clone Ba'al give they a tracking device detectable from anywhere in the galaxy he also place one in himself so we could not tell the difference between a clone and the original and because he be the original he be the only one of we who possess a tracking device that could be remove so you see the last of the Goa'uld System Lords the last of my dear brother be still out there and since as of this moment he know he be the last he have very special plan for you plan you say a recently complete failsafe device should an unfortunate circumstance such as my imminent death arise it be you who give we the idea actually I suspect it have already be put into action he lie he do that you know we shall see it be time this be go to be cool make your course three five zero three five zero Aye Captain we would be in Boston by now if we be not zigzag over the Atlantic you would rather make it easy for the U boat we be not at war yet and we be ride too high in the water for a U boat captain to waste a torpedo check to see the cargo 's secure you be never go to tell I what it be be you if I know myself that be no torpedo what be it Captain Emergency station all hand maintain your heading son Aye sir I be go to check for damage secure the ship make ready the Chappa'ai take your time Jaffa we have all the time in the world begin the extraction process seriously do anybody see where Vala go maybe extraction bring up too many bad memory have you ever try to find a bathroom in a pyramid she can not have go far O'Neill there be Carter I do not know he be not beam out he be there one second and the next he be go like Vala I think we would well get the hell out of here everyone remain calm what have you do with my people Sir Jack go to the Gate not without you go all right you hear the man let us go Carter the vessel be secure my lord Dial the Chappa'ai Jackson move okay not Earth I dial Earth I know iike a hundred time before but my keen professional eye be see a few difference between this place and Stargate Command that for one and the Stargate be in a box Carter what be go on Sam I do not know look I know what happen back there but we need you in the here and now Wherever or whenever that be right look like the active Gate warm thing up for a bit warm thing up yeah because the temperature 's fall again it be just go past minus 20 okay that be chilly let us not just stand around I do not see anything that could be a DHD this have to be connect to what be happen on the Tok'ra homeworld all right so Vala and Teal'c disappear into thin air we gate into somebody 's freezer put the piece of that puzzle together and I get nothing you well there be almost no EM of any kind from any direction to help we determine our location Mayday this be Colonel Cameron Mitchell do you hear I please respond Mayday Mayday I do not think anybody be go to hear you we be in the cargo hold of a ship what not just any ship this be the Achilles that name be familiar yeah it be the ship that bring the Stargate from Africa before the outbreak of WW ll no that be not why they think the Stargate might be a weapon so they want to keep it out of the Nazis do you realize what this mean guy I hate to interrupt but the temperature 's fall we just pass minus 40 Celsius or Fahrenheit at that temperature they be the same really do not know that we 've get about three minute before frostbite set in Hypothermia five minute after that I be already start to lose the feeling in my finger break out the camp stove from the emergency pack you mean the one that be with Teal'c we can not light a fire in here there be nowhere to vent the smoke cover your ear you realize that be not go to do much I be not do yet if you do not blow a hole in the ice with that the blast be go to come fly back into this compartment or bad what if that ice be hold back seawater yeah I admit there be a few problem with this idea Carter how cold be it Minus 43 Fire in the hole well it be warm yeah I be see star let us get this fire start what be that okay the explosion must 've dislodge the ship from the ice do not tell I we be sink we have to leave soon or later Foul weather gear there be get to be some around here somewhere we 've get water come in over here I 've get something Jackson try this on for size Carter we 've get to go Jackson Jackson the ship be warm you want to go back no I be good all right so which way well we be above the Arctic Circle so do it really matter South it be Daniel I know back on the ship my foot go through the deck where water be come in it freeze the lace on my boot I could not get it off Jackson what do you wanna go and do that for look we will just have to help you walk no I can not feel a thing below my knee I do not think I be go anywhere look I be be selfish here our only chance be for you guy to get within radio range of some kind of help the soon you go the soon you can send help for I go do not waste time once that sun rise it be go to warm right up Jackson Daniel Bye oh shit I keep wonder what Daniel be go to say when back at the ship he get all excited when he say do you realize what this mean that Ba'al have go back in time to stop the ship that be carry the Gate from ever reach the United States by send it to the North Pole yeah apparently Carter that be a terrible plan yeah but you have no problem with the fact that he go back in time all I be say be why not just sink the damn boat I think the big point here be that Ba'al have rewrite history teal'c and Vala just disappear because they never join SG 1 the Stargate program never happen in which case I would have never crash in my F 302 which mean I would not have a titanium pin in my leg kill I which it be right now you be right you be right it be a paradox thank you or maybe because we be in transit through the Stargate when the timeline shift well Ba'al never would 've intend that Gate to wind up anywhere but the bottom of the ocean something go wrong and we be not suppose to make it back to Earth alive that be his first mistake maybe he be already take over the entire planet Humanity could be enslave for all we know that be quitter talk all we get to do be stay alive until you figure a way to undo this Undo this you hear I Mayday Mayday this be Colonel Cameron Mitchell Mayday Sam we have to keep move why if we be go to freeze to death here be as good a spot as any be not it I do not like this spot Cam come on what be the point there be no one around for hundred what be that which one of you be Mitchell that would be I Jack O'Neill Special Forces oh my God we think you be dead well back at you ma'am do you recognize she sure do Sir we 've get to go back for Daniel what we have to do be get you people off this ice Major Wood yes sir I mark the X and drop the buoy it should be along any minute sir Mitchell I do not know what you be do in the Arctic with a dead astronaut but I be go to need some answer yeah well back at you what be we look for there your ride Colonel O'Neill Permission to come aboard permission grant sir the C o would like you to make it snappy Sonar pick up a russian sub nose around let us go down scope Aye sir Colonel welcome aboard the Alexandria Captain thank for the ride we be always happy to help the Air Force Chief escort our guest to the ward room escort our guest to the ward room Aye Captain Colonel be not that lf it be not it be her twin sister I be go to need a couple minute to debrief those two you mean those three what Officer prepare to stationary dive I intend to take she down immediately Aye Captain Stationary dive stationary dive Jackson Daniel I do not think you be go to make it Us what about you oh no the sub actually come up about a half hour after you guy leave it must have hear the Achilles go down Scared the hell out of I too I think I be hallucinate in fact I still be afraid I might be they pump I up with something no it be it be all real how bad be the leg they say I be probably go to lose it hey you know I think I be dead I guess in the grand scheme of thing I can not really complain that much excuse we Jack be there any more of you I should know about no look I understand how weird this be about four hour ago one of our satellite take the damned picture you ever do see how do you get here so fast I be already on my way up here to supervise a training exercise and then I get order to make a drop to determine what cause this whatever that be be go and you have no idea what this be you be the astronaut you tell I the device that make what you see in this picture an energy vortex create prior to the establishment of a stable wormhole be call a Stargate now normally we use it to travel to other planet but this time we come through it from an alternate timeline one where amongst other thing I be not an astronaut yeah that be pretty much how I have it figure actually she be tell the truth and who be you Daniel Jackson in the timeline where we come from we 've actually travel to several hundred planet together we as in you and yeah in fact in our timeline I be the close thing you have to a good friend yeah yeah I would buy that okay you be from Minnesota yeah Eleven year ago your son shoot himself with a 9 mm he find in your closet all right stop it right there my kid be fine he be at home and he be fine what be wrong with you obviously some thing be different in this timeline but what you have to understand be no I do not I do not have to understand anything more importantly I do not want to as far as I be concern you be just a pile of paperwork wait to happen Jack please and stop that Jeez you should at least warn your superior that this planet be in great danger I will get right on that all right they can have access to food water and any medical attention they might need but they can not go past this door except to use the head and nobody come in or out until we can surface and deal with these freak Aye sir Samantha Carter yes it be common knowledge that four year ago a computer failure force the space shuttle lntrepid 's main engine to shut down before it could reach a safe orbit or a secondary landing site when the autopilot also fail Mission Commander Samantha Carter stay behind to fly it while her crew bail out of the escape hatch the orbiter go down over the Atlantic and her body be never recover it be not I you just say your name Stargate Command be a branch of the United States Air Force found in 1990 something I forget the exact year for the purpose of exploration and it be less an altered timeline than it be this kind of multiverse thing it operate in secret I know what you be think and you be think I be insane and it be capable of operate but none of the random address a list you want the list of every planet and that be when I realize that the symbol be constellation and it be just a matter of determine which of the 39 symbol represent the point of origin the symbol in a combination of seven represent a Gate address and the home planet why do you think this be funny because it be everything I can think of I tell you listen whereas I 've be try to tell you Earth be in serious danger you do not seem to give a rat 's ass okay fine O'Neill want nothing to do with we what about Landry if you would like to hear the answer to that question why do not you go ahead and play your tape back I want to take a break I want to talk to somebody else I be agitate because this be not the way thing be suppose to be unfortunately it be the way it be General thank you for come you fly F 4s in Vietnam you have a daughter name Caroline you be wild about Fulvous Whistling duck stop right there son I believe you you do I 've be listen to all three of you for quite a while now it be a hell of a story the fact be be the other two already in the hangar good we will be right there I can not stand have to repeat myself follow I yeah see I know that about he too hey you guy have fun oh joy you 've be at this for five day eat something it be not like you do not feed we Fine I do not like to eat alone you should know that Sir you be probably wonder why I request that you be bring all this way up to meet with we actually you all do something about the fact that I be the sort of man who would understand you will have to forgive I I be at your memorial service on the front lawn of the White House I imagine you be an extraordinary person in whatever timeline you happen to be in Sir if you do not mind my asking you do not exist that be to say there be no record of a Colonel Cameron Mitchell fit your description in the U S Air Force or anywhere else for that matter and you Dr Jackson be last see in Egypt attempt to find proof that alien once visit Earth and that the pyramid be land pad for their spaceship I take it that in your timeline that you be not a discredit whack job live on the fringe of society that really depend on who you ask not I need to make this about I there be one Mitchell of note who serve in the Merchant Marine in the late'30s the captain of the freighter Achilles that be how I know the name Grandma have a picture of he stand beside his ship in Boston Harbor it be the one in my locker right now Ba'al must 've kill the crew when he gate aboard you be literally a grandfather paradox that be what Dr Lee say Sir I realize that it may be extremely difficult if not impossible to recover the Stargate from the Arctic Ocean but there be another one the one in Antarctica you mean I be tell we be send a team to check it out we need to do more than check it out sir we need to use it we have to set thing right how exactly I 've be think about this now Ba'al must have build some sort of temporal device Time machine yes now if we could use the Stargate to contact one of our ally that will not be allow to happen Sir you do not understand what will be lose if we can not return thing to the way they be suppose to be suppose to be be relative Dr Jackson the ally we 've meet the technology we 've acquire the hundred of planet we visit we can do all that assume we can recover the Stargate in Antarctica and assume it do what you say it do I be sure we will use the thing to go out and explore the galaxy there be a lot of excited people around here with respect sir you be miss the point the timeline be alter by one of our enemy the System Lord Ba'al you talk about he at some length because he be a very real threat accord to your own story it be be 70 year since the timeline be change if all this be part of some plan where be he Man have a point if his plan be to take over Earth he would have to reestablish a power base with the other System Lords now that would not be easy now if his plan die with he then or he be still in the process of establish his power and it be a matter of time this be as far as we be willing to go in exchange for sign a non disclosure agreement you will be give identity a place to live in different part of the country for obvious reason and you well behave yourself in public otherwise you will end up on the front page of the Enquirer Sir do not do this the decision have be make at the high level I be sure that in time your advice will be welcome if and when the Navy get this Stargate up and run you can come aboard as consultant but you will never ever be allow to step through that thing you be afraid we be go to try and repair the timeline you 've make that intention abundantly clear because we have a responsibility but you do not have the right if you be to succeed event in the life of thousand if not million of people would never have happen my goodness people the arrogance of what you be ask we to help you do be mind boggle maybe if I be not wake in the middle of the night and fly to Alaska I might be more like the kind sympathetic former general you be hope I would be but trust I if you live in this timeline we would want it to stay the way it be now if you will excuse I I would like to go back to my wife and my very pleasant retirement and you all have new life to begin they be ready to board the aircraft it be a pleasure meeting all of you yeah it truly be at no time be you to make contact by any means with Mr Jackson or Ms Carter without prior authorization any such attempt will be see as a breach of this agreement you will be provide a suitable home vehicle and a live allowance which may be augment without penalty should you choose to seek employment in any field other than the follow astrophysic aerospace engineering at no time may you discuss write or otherwise communicate the matter and or event as state in this agreement with any person other than your authorized contact be that clear Dr Jackson Dr Jackson yeah I be sorry this be the place I guess it be do you need help get out no I think I can handle it keep the change how be it go Cam hey Mrs Heather Heather catch myself this time finally yeah yes ma'am so when do we get to go for a ride I be go to take it for a road trip test drive so maybe when I get back I will hold you to that come on oh damn that be trouble can I help you son I apologize for the intrusion I spend some time here when I be a kid what be the name Mitchell Cam Mitchell I 've live here over 35 year really who be here before that Hendersons Harry and Lorna so you know Harry yeah I be just a boy but they be nice people look I know this be weird but do you mind if I go inside I have an image of the place that I can not quite shake well what the hell I be not do anything come on Hello Dr Jackson yes I be sorry I be call so late I be call from the States and well I 've stay in that hotel myself a number of time and I just think that you might well because I want to tell you something that you be right about everything about the pyramid about what the glyph say about alien visit Earth everything it do not matter who I be let us just say I be someone who believe in your work and you should too no no no I do I really do I you have to have more faith in yourself Dr Jackson hello hello Put I through to your command officer tell he it be Col Carter I need to speak to he now Mr Mitchell this stunning footage just in from our affiliate station Son you will want to see this allege alien craft pursue by an Air Force F 16 illustrate just how close they come to both the White House and several treasured national monument before climb out of range of the pursue fighter we be hear report of confirm sighting from all across Europe and Asia as well accord to White House source there have be no communication from these vessel but neither have they take overtly hostile action the President have call for calm but we be tell our armed force be on high alert hello Great I be think about you guy I think they would at least allow we to see each other but every time l no I do not have a tv why bring in the prisoner well do teal'c it be my honor to serve Lord Ba'al yes it be but generation from now they will speak of Master Teal'c of Chulak First Prime of Ba'al first leader of the free Jaffa nation Shol'va Apophis Iast of the System Lords to stand against I what have you to say to your new sovereign May your reign last day and your death year that be actually rather good be not it do you plan to say that when you walk in or be it just off the top of your head my Lord Cronus hail we clean this up Lord Ba'al the squadron of Al'kesh that you order to the Tau'ri have report it be as you promise they number in the billion and they be defenseless Excellent you may reveal the coordinate to the rest of the fleet we shall leave on my order as you wish there be a god stand here with wet hand teal'c you may tell your warrior that their dream of freedom be one step close I shall my Lord well I be in awe of your accomplishment you have predict every move of your enemy and fulfil every promise to your ally Ra Nirrti Cronus Zipacna all once powerful System Lords and now they all serve you they serve we my queen I be truly privileged I know I can not help myself there be no nation on this Earth that do not share in our resolve to defend our world until we give they more to talk about they be go to play this speech to death what about the Russians or the Chinese be they hear anything there be be no response of any kind from the alien craft sir we 've try every frequency there be why would they come all the way from wherever the hell it be they come from fly around with a bunch of F 16 on their ass for half a day and then just sit there they be advance scout ship Mr President you ask they be bring to the command bunker the moment they arrive sir that be fine Alex thank you Henry Hayes thank for come you be say Mr Mitchell the ship in orbit be call Al'kesh they serve both as scout and as ground support bomber and they be nothing compare to what be come next really so what be come next Death Slavery More slavery more death if you want to say l tell you so go ahead and get it off your chest but then you can do one of two thing you can help or you can leave okay bye Jackson right I forgot to say l tell you so now be you go to help or not have you recover the Stargate we could not locate the one you send down but we do manage to find the other one in Antarctica it be still there why do not you bring it back well the Navy suggest and I agree what well place to build a facility and start a testing program in complete secrecy than McMurdo base why be not we tell you would be surprised at some of the stuff we do around here without run it by you it be not operational yet be it not yet but we have our good scientist work on it how quickly can you get we there do not forget I be the one who give the order to keep you away from that thing erase the timeline be not an option then why be we here when I be first brief on you three I think my Chief of Staff be yank my chain I do not believe he the 2nd time either finally he have to bring in the National Security Advisor to convince I that he be not kid on page 2000 and something of the brief one of you I can not remember which talk about how I handle a similar invasion in your timeline to the one that might happen here of course in our case you have the benefit of an operational Stargate Program for about seven year to be fair it be actually the ancient weapon platform in Antarctica that save we exactly should not it still be there it be under a mile of ice the Army Corps of Engineers have be drill at the coordinate you give we for the last three month we be not there yet but we be close even so its power source be deplete we would need a fully charge Zero Point Module Taonas there be no reason it still should not be there we would have to steal a cargo ship it be not like we have not do that before once we recover the ZPM we can gate directly back to Earth because the Stargate 's already in Antarctica we will just need someone with a gene that could operate the chair if there be still time sir this can work that be the SG 1 I read about if the control crystal 's intact and the power relay be in position I should be able to dial out the Gate in a couple of hour General Hammond Sir it be good to see you if you say so there be four F 15 on the tarmac at Andrews each carry minimal armament and extra fuel tank once the Stargate be operational you will be escort through by a squad of four marine that be not negotiable to keep we on the mission that be not necessary sir but we will take the back up even if it go accord to plan it will take a couple of day to get back what be you go to do if Ba'al show up before then be there anything we can do Dr Jackson well I would not mention we Thought of that one good luck to all of we sir there it be my friend this little world in the middle of nowhere lose and forget until now thank to our Lord Ba'al it be ours to enslave and pillage as we please it be an abomination they have be allow to breed to such number their Stargate have be bury for century and be subsequently involve in an unfortunate boat accident hence they have be completely cut off from we they know nothing of the Goa'uld nevertheless they be far too many to control we will just blast they to the brink of extinction that will not be necessary but it would be enjoyable I agree you be all so stuck in your way if we be to wipe they out by the billion the survivor would despise we for all eternity I know something of these people I have study they for some time if we give they cause to fight they will fight to the bitter end but if we promise they a grand future if we offer they our love kindness then I assure you my friend they will fall for it completely as you have do with your Jaffa if by that you mean the Jaffa who with the promise of freedom manage to defeat the combine army of the System Lords yes and that promise will be fulfil I be sure it will in fact teal'c yes my Lord Camulus have kindly offer one half of his domain Australia to the free Jaffa nation I have say no such your generosity bring a god to tear now let we be clear my friend the land of the Tau'ri that you receive and the many million of human that inhabit they be a gift be grateful or be silent return to your ship I shall contact the Tau'ri myself yes my Lord yes my Lord teal'c yes my Lord there be something I want you to search for Ships sir dozen of they they just pop up out of nowhere a few minute ago Hyperspace I read the brief what be the status of SG 1 they should be airborne in a few minute at this time Mr President it be my recommendation we take our force to DEFCON 2 do it we should inform SG 1 that they be here yes sir Jackson you may want to strap in back there and get some sleep should be a long boring ride yeah I hope so Colonel Mitchell we 've receive a message from Washington I be tell you will understand they be here what be that something I 've keep in stasis a very long time so that one day I could place this call he be on the phone it come directly through the White House switchboard from the spaceship Ba'al Lord Ba'al his word not mine yeah right thank you Alex hello Mr President I be begin to think I be not go to get through your gauntlet of minion who be this who be I speak to I be Ba'al I assume by now you 've detect the presence of my fleet in orbit over your planet as a matter of fact we have our eye on you please forgive this primitive mean of communication but if I be to land my ship in your rose garden or appear as a hologram in your office what kind of race of being would you think we be I want to give you my personal assurance that we come in peace seek nothing more than friendship well we be glad to hear that down here let I far assuage your concern by meet you in person in your Oval Office I be sure something can be arrange soon I be think this afternoon it be the kind of thing I can clear my schedule for Excellent then perhaps we can get Put that down Mr President I be afraid I will have to get back to you later he hang up on I the edge of the shikra blade have be hone to the thickness of a single atom I must keep my hand very still for fear that one slip will cut you in half now tell I how can you possibly know so much about this world I tell you my sweet you 've be study in secret when you have not allow I to leave your side in 50 year every time you defeat your enemy you be one step ahead and now you be as familiar with their world as if you 've live among they and you even have one of their communication device how for a short time I confess I do live among they when another life another time this world offer many pleasure Qetesh Pleasures I intend to share with you not good enough my Lord forgive the intrusion think nothing of it teal'c I have the result of our search of the southernmost continent there be a Chappa'ai as you predict thank you teal'c you may leave we now however my Lord it be not lodge within a crevasse the human have move it to a small settlement and take it inside it do not appear to be yet functional what they have also drill a shaft deep inside the ice elsewhere on the continent Impossible how could they have know instruct the fleet to bombard both location from space immediately be that your wish my Lord do it and report back to I when it be do now tell I my sweet be your plan go as well as you expect you realize Ba'al be go to figure out where we be head before we get within 1 000 mile of McMurdo he think we be dead remember oh we have he now hail the fleet this be teal'c aboard the Sovereign 's flagship Lord Ba'al have give the order to destroy target at the follow coordinate near the planet 's South Pole Assign what vessel you see fit Fire when ready I talk to Ba'al directly and despite his assurance I have reason to distrust he very good reason Yuri I have to tell you about something we be work on in the Antarctic that might help we deal with they it involve an artifact we find a couple of month ago Mr President hold on a sec do you know who I be talk to yes sir a few minute ago we lose contact with McMurdo the first report be something about brilliant flash of light in the sky then explosion all over the compound we also lose contact with the drilling site above the ancient weapon platform at roughly the same time we be try to get satellite picture to confirm so much for afternoon tea in the rose garden Yuri that project in the Antarctic I be tell you about it be go backwards my Lord stay back teal'c my Lord shall I enact your final instruction no you idiot save I try it and I will kill he you intend to kill he regardless no there must be some arrangement actually my love he be right Jaffa treason Sierra Golf One we be receive an encoded message Stand by Message read McMurdo have be destroy Return to your previous position and stand by for further instruction Understood so much for that what further instruction can there be other than kiss your ass goodbye oh let us pull about turn and find out Master Teal'c I be on a mission for the Sovereign we will cloak the ship immediately and await further order Hail Cronus my queen our Lord Ba'al have see the light he now wish to blast the Tau'ri into extinction you be most persuasive we shall return in three day the more of the planet you 've destroy the more richly you shall be reward and if you see Teal'c kill he as the Sovereign wish Jaffa set a course for Praxyon and engage the hyperdrive at maximum speed yes my queen this world be not enough the Sovereign 's flagship be leave the fleet the Sovereign be dead betray by Qetesh our only hope of avenge he be to arrive at Praxyon before she do and the only way to do that be through a Chappa'ai but you yourself order it destroy there be another thank for the top up boy Sierra Golfleader we be go to be right back where we start Son of a bitch Carter break right break right what city be that Washington listen to I because I do not think either one of we have much time leave if you have anything any information that could help Yuri I can not hear you what you 've also discover an artifact where be it locate we be receive another encoded message with new flight instruction Message read the Russians have the other one hello do what you need to do Roger that Coordinates receive stop for gas I estimate ETA at 19 30 Zulu Let us do what we need to do we be on emergency power sir and all the elevator shaft have collapse we be not get out of here anytime soon do we have confirmation that our message get through to SG 1 yes sir by now they be well over the North Atlantic that last KC 135 pilot be a bit stingy Fuel 's go to be close I have multiple contact down range approach at Mach 3 5 glider yeah that be a good bet they be come through at 80 000 foot Sierra Golf escort we must complete our mission do you understand Affirmative Sierra Golf One and two proceed to target we will engage here they come just go ahead and fall asleep back there Jackson it be go to be a long dull ride yeah sorry about that how many on our six too many we can not shake they at altitude we be go to have to go down to the deck yeah we be right behind you I 've get another contact six bogie dead ahead come right at we sorry Sam we be kind of busy right now I do not think they be glider they be MiGs Jackson get on the radio what the hell do you just say we be Americans please shoot the people chase we we have be expect you good luck yeah back at you I can see the coast Sierra rejoin we be go to head on down copy that this be not encourage where be everybody at home with their family where I should be I need to speak to the lead scientist on this project he be not here none of they have be here for week really we have no idea of purpose of artifact we name it Anchor because it be find on bottom of ocean be there any grow up around that we could talk to Boys we need power what you see now be emergency battery we lose main power to facility over three hour ago oh okay we understand that but we 've come a very very long way to use this device I can not give you what I do not have what be that it sound like a ship Al'kesh and it be land on the roof just great we must get out of here hey your weapon Hands up do not teal'c how do you know my name I can do well than that you be from Chulak your good friend go by the name of Bra'tac and you be the first Prime of Jackson whose mark be that Ba'al what do he promise to win you over the freedom of my people I will give he credit Ba'al be dead Slain by his queen oh do not tell we Qetesh indeed why that be none of your concern allow we passage through the Chappa'ai and your life may be spare or you tell we what you be up to and your life will be spare my only concern be my mission which be to avenge Ba'al 's death the final task of a First Prime lndeed sound great we will help out right sure why not I be not busy let us do it I do not require your assistance my ship have be detect its shield have be extend to protect this building and the Chappa'ai but it will not hold for long what do you say we all get out of here we can all die here when that shield fail or we can go through the Gate together and continue this discussion on the other side it be up to you this device will power the Chappa'ai I like that no hesitation let us go go give I a reason I should not kill you where you stand because you be a good man because somewhere deep down you realize we be suppose to be on the same side because we can offer you the freedom of your people really this be Ba'al 's failsafe it have to be I think this whole place be his time machine teal'c you have to understand in the timeline we just come from the Goa'uld be defeat and the Jaffa be free now Ba'al use a machine to go back in time and change all of that he make you his first Prime and Qetesh his queen so he could control you this be the secret for which Ba'al be murder that be why you think she be come she want to use this device for herself that can not be allow to happen see we agree about everything let we use this device we can return history to the way it be mean to be the Goa'uld will be go my people will be free you have our word let it be do it will just take I a few minute to figure out exactly how it work that may be all the time we have by my reckoning Qetesh will be here at any moment thank you well you hear the man there must be satellite orbit every one of these star there be hundred of they each send real time telemetry back to this computer through subspace exactly how do that add up to a time machine they be look for something specific Solar flare exactly until now other than ancient technology the only way we know of travel through time be to pass through a wormhole as it intersect the magnetic field of a solar flare with enough satellite and enough computing yeah that be brilliant which button do we press yeah I think it be a little more complicated than that actually not much we just need to choose a time and place sometime before Ba'al can put his plan into motion they be here if you wanna go back to the cretaceous period we can go right now otherwise we have to wait for a flare capable of send we back to a time and place that be a little more useful Sam I 've find one but you be not go to like it why not it will send we back to 1929 that be 10 year too soon well it will have to do because I be just about out of once I dial the Stargate we will have less than 20 second to get through dial it up and get your ass down here Carter teal'c Jaffa teal'c you be the most stubborn Jaffa I have ever know perhaps I shall choose you as my first Prime after all I think not Qetesh I die free make your course three five zero three five zero Aye Captain we would be in Boston by now if we be not zigzag all over the bloody Atlantic you would rather make it easy for the U boat we be not at war yet check to see the cargo 's secure you be never go to tell I what it be be you if I know myself Captain we be about to be board Boarded get over there how do not shoot until I do back up who be you you might say I be a friend of the family what happen here well that could take a while to explain begin the extraction process behold the last of the System Lords I guess that be worth see what that be all you have to say well you guy make it out like it be this big deal I expect something more spectacular Nope that be pretty much the extraction ceremony right there yup right so lunch anyone I be buy I be in actually sir I be hope we could go over the plan for the new moon base what moon base you know I think I might stay awhile and help he through this yeah I think you might have fun thank he be in for an interesting afternoon indeed what be he talk about when he say you 've all make a terrible mistake we shall never know I know I be not go to worry about it I be just think what if he really be not the last one he be the last one as far as we know yeah as far as we know but you can not obsess about this stuff yeah you be probably right I know I be Come on let us go when be the last time he buy lunch good point
