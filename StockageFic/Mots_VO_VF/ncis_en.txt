McGee and DiNozzo how long since anyone be live in these unit Base close the tract five year ago plan be to convert it to a park Cutbacks put it on hold unit be become a security and health hazard we bring in a private company to demo it when Gibbs introduce we he introduce you then McGee then I why have he mention I last you be kid no for gibb to mix up the seniority order like that it be just just seem weird that be all well I do not think it really mean Toby no I would not put too much stock in it why do you say that 'cause I do not think it have anything to do with seniority what do you think it have to do with my guess would be level of intelligence and general competence I do not say anything it be what you be think probie soon as we know what he have all work be stop we contain the scene Old bunker we do not know what it be a little bit more left your other leave McGee Sorry boss a little nervous probie hold it right there the tunnel lead to the house that be a little weird Boss over here Kate McGee you be with I DiNozzo wait for Ducky let us do it Nails be hammer in at a left to right angle might have be leave hand ever see anything like this before boss only in the movie where be our bride DiNozzo nine foot down twelve foot over you be kid right this actually remind I of my day at Edinburgh Medical College you take a tunnel to get to school Ducky no the morgue be tiny yeah we have a a fellow student who suffer terribly from claustrophobia constantly hyperventilate yes one day he decide to overcome his fear eh he shut himself in one of the morgue drawer well the ventilation be off of course he ask we not to disturb he for 24 hour we be very impressed with his gumption do it work unfortunately not no he die of a massive coronary so you see people can be frightened to death hey Duck this be really sick Stephen King would love it oh my dear get you out of this place into somewhere more appropriate I promise that be really nice Doctor thank you Mr Palmer now if you would give I the bag for transportation it be in the truck I know next time you will remember the Good Wife 's Guide ten step to please your Husband I think I read something like that in Redbook Redbook yeah you read Redbook yeah all the time well I do not think you read this one McGee it be from May 1955 how long be she be here Duck oh it be hard to say Jethro poor thing be be dead for month how about year perhaps one not more than two Housing 's be abandon for five year well then she be not the last tenant check it anyway the last tenant in that house be Lieutenant Commander Carlton Halpin his wife and two child move out January ' 99 transfer to the San Diego Naval Station as far as we can tell he be never be back McGee all the material use in the construction of the bunker could 've be purchase at any Lowe 's in the area DiNozzo a lot of the furniture in the room be authentic ' 50 not my taste but what the hell all from various manufacturer nothing in production today the way I figure it he would have to have collect the piece from antique shop or garage sale what about the possibility they be hand down from family yeah I be get to that there be of course always the possibility that the piece have be hand down from family member Point be either scenario be not a road that be easily traceable question for you probie Redbook why Redbook be and still be the definitive magazine for today 's young woman plan a sex change no since I 've always be interested in woman I figure the good way to know about they be to you know know about they McGee the good way to know about they be to know they do you think she know he well it be difficult to say she could have be lure by a confidant or grab by a by a stranger the result unfortunately in the case of so many woman be the same either way be your recorder on do you want it to be on no do you want it on it help I to be more accurate in my report well then turn it on it be on then why do not you just say so I be n not sure the victim be a caucasian woman 20 to 25 Cause of death can be attribute to non specific asphyxiation no obvious sign of sexual trauma but due to the dehydration and mummification of tissue it be impossible to say whether she be violate yeah but you would think that she be though right I mean all all the story that you read about these guy they usually do not keep girl down in a cellar for conversation where do you read these story Mr Palmer I I I I do not mean that I actually read they I I mean to say that that she wear a ring a wedding ring yeah no doubt it be remove violently MrPalmer what story what do you have Abby what do not I have Gibbs Clothing fiber carpet fiber dust beetle part soil bed there be even a pamphlet call the Good Wife 's Guide what be up with that ask McGee McGee McGee really the dress Abby as you might imagine it be not exactly virginal it be make in 1952 she would wear it for month before she die and I be run a dna sample as we print all over the room thank to our semi mummy I be able to get a match for our victim your crack team be run it through AFIS only print in the room be hers yeah I be afraid so I find trace of cleanser on the furniture he be cautious so be I when I chain guy up Victim be Carolyn Figgis Petty Officer Third Class 22 go miss 18 month ago I pull the file boss it be a Pacci case do not have much she leave for work one morning and poof go no witness case go cold yeah well it just get hot again Ducky estimate she be be dead about a year that mean she be in the bunker for six month before she die that rule out the last tenant Kate tell I about the killer the basic pathology be obvious he be probably abuse as a child Dad beat on mom one or both beat on he who know he be try to create the perfect relationship that be right and control be the name of the game this one do not live up to his expectation why y be I sure you would understand that part so cut off her air supply leave she in an airtight chamber to die and move on yeah that be the problem this kind of pathology be drive he be not go to stop until he find the perfect one he be play house with somebody else out there something be off Gibbs I recreate it from McGee 's photo gibb everything in here be als'd all pertinent forensic evidence be send to Abby for analysis and then I rebuild it from the photo this room and everything in it be exactly as it be when we find it what be with his ' 50 thing the ' 50 represent an idealize time when the rule between man and woman be simple this be an old guy actually I think he be young as Tony say a lot of the stuff in here be authentic ' 50 but a lot of it be not some be ' 60 some be reproduction but it be not pure he could not get his hand on the real deal I do not think it matter I think he put this room together base on his idea of a fantasy rather than some remembrance of an ideal experience someone who grow up with it would be more pure well I think he would want to be as close to what he actually experience as possible plus he do not seem to have a problem with just pick up and leave everything behind how do we know he do not have to leave transfer it be possible Ducky say her wedding ring be remove well it make sense that would be the one thing that he keep in common from one bride to the next you know it might help if I could observe a reenactment of the victim 's life inside the chamber Put someone in the wedding dress Tony would look cute no he be interview the victim 's parent well McGee then Nope he be with Tony Abby no up to her tat in forensic test well what about you you will not have to wear the dress I hate that song McGee I think you buy ticket to see they next week change my mind I be sell they on eBay well could we listen to something else Sure this be not about music be it this what whatever it be it be not music this be your conversation McGee Tony I be not after your job do you think I be actually worried about you take my place probie no I mean of course not how could I be you be Gibbs ' right hand guy do gibb say that uh not not directly then why do you say that well well 'cause I 've I 've hear he say nice thing what kind of thing I I I do not remember remember um okay uh yesterday yeah yeah he uh say something about file your case report what do he say exactly he say it be not late for once this be not what I have in mind Gibbs you want a reenactment Reenact I want to observe I be observe okay she can make it to the toilet but she could not make it to the threshold of the tunnel I can not imagine what she must have go through Gibbs how many month do she suffer before give up and realize she be never go to be find she have no hope she have nothing leave to do but sit and stare at

nonisotopic chemiluminescent method to compare the charred dna to Newell 's uh huh and and it be not his dna but it be damn close oh come on Abs we be not play horseshoe there be a 99 probability that the fire victim be Newell 's male sible that can not be Newell 's record of emergency datum do not list a brother DNA do not lie Jethro People do the crispy critter be Captain Newell 's brother his OQR be wrong recruit lie about thing all the timeespecially their age why lie about have a brother be Abby sure yeah she double check obviously you two do not we assume his family history be right NCIS agent do not assume anything Agent Todd they check and re check verify everything independently we be on it there be a definite difference I do not see it look at the elongate node it be undamaged the plant inside the crop circle be change in a way that be beyond human ability I be rerun an analysis hope to find anomalous molecular change to the stalk within the circle I be bet they be subject to a very short blast of high energy heat possibly microwave generate rerun because you come up empty Abby you be look for something that be not there you 've be here for two day straight you be tired you 've do everything that Gibbs have ask so go home get some sleep I can not sleep what be you do you be guilty of confirmation bias it be not there abs you be ignore the obvious and you be search for microscopic proof of something that do not exist maybe I should join the CIA look at the big picture the design of the small outer circle be create by bend the corn stalk down in a clockwise direction now look under the helicopter those pant be force outward from the center by the downdraft of the blade the corn be still stand and be force down by the landing of the Cobra Crop circle be a hoax Abby create create around a park helicopter why would anyone do that Orange County clerk fax we his parent marriage certificate Todd Newell be nine year old when his mother remarry he be legally adopt that be how he get the Newell name his mother 's maiden name be stelle which be common in Smoky Corners First husband 's a guy name Sikes they have two boy Greg and Todd Todd Newell be bear in Smoky Corners his co pilot Captain Barnett swear that he never mention a brother or Smoky Corners in fact Barnett could not recall Newell ever mention anything about his childhood we need to find his biological father can not he die several year ago in a hunting accident aw gee where have I hear that one before so we get a dead civilian in Ducky 's cooler we go to turn it over to the local authority Nope not yet I want to know more first Greg Sikes be involve with the girl at the gas station she seem willing to talk maybe I should go back there and try to find she go with her all right so we be on the same page right I guess but let I tell Gibbs tell I what the crop circle be a hoax create around the helicopter after it land you do not sound convince abs yeah well there be still a lot of stuff that can not be explain like what ball of light in the sky the animal act weird like a miss pilot everyone 's story be exactly the same it be too rehearse it be what they want we to hear that be exactly what I tell she but what about the search dog I hear they be act all confused and disorient only the first day the cadaver dog have no problem find the body this morning I know why we have not be able to find Captain Newell thank guy how do you know because I be a Marine Newell be alive yeah well who be body do we find his brother Captain Newell 's still out there how do you know that he receive SERE training Colonel he be evade we as part of his training he be teach a technique to negate enemy dog yeah gs powder the irritant use in gas mask simulation I keep a couple of capsule in my survival vest dog get a whiff of that they be useless for day he use it on the search dog now he also have pilot 's night vision goggle and a survival radio to monitor our search frequency Colonel he be use his Marine Corps training to evade we will you stop that you be drive I crazy sorry do I detect a little PMS I do not think that be till next week hey it be a high stress

brother say to he on the phone get he upset enough to risk his entire careerwith an unauthorized flight in a Cobra boss you sure you do not want I to drive for a while but why land in the farmer 's field um well my guess McGee it be the close clearing to the cabin where be brother be hide only Newell be too late wh what Focus on the case McGee Sorry uh yes Sir why the crop circle well uh I have a theory on that you care to share yeah uh okay Spit it out McGee okay uh whoever kill Greg Sikes think that they could cover it up as another farm or hunt accident but they could not cover up an attack helicopter abandon in a corn field Conspiracy huh make sense take a lot of people to form that pattern in a few hour right and they know that there would be an outside investigation so they create the circle hope that we would do exactly what the Air Force do ten year ago back off and cover up what could not be explain not bad McGee not bad where be she inside she seem to relate well to

have trouble with anyone aboard the ship safety officer be generally dislike they have the authority to stick their nose in anyone 's department no one can say a word that sound like Gibbs so Commander Dornan make enemy make an art of it definitely sound like Gibbs so I 've just be pull file of all the people he put re put on report could be the record for a cruise how the hell do pure

resent it now I quite like it so do I well have you finish the autopsy yes oh oh yes there be one question I want to ask you why do you choose to perform a valve repair as oppose to valve replacement it be a close call but Commander Dornan be insistent if we replace the valve he would not be able to go back on active duty ah yeah true but the team feel that the valve be repairable and it be ironic though be not it we save his life only to have he die in a freak accident I be afraid it be not an accident I review the hospital 's surveillance tape with security between the end of visit hour and the fire all but five people can be identify as hospital personnel I download they onto my laptop you eliminate the hospital personnel McGee no boss no definitely not I be go to check they all out in

surprise she take it to next step from fantasy to reality well if they only communicate online there be a possibility that she do not even know what he look like so you be say the whole thing might have be an accident I do not believe in accident or Davison could be your garden variety psycho he latch on to Laura and he do not want to let go we be miss something here and I think we find it boss Laura Rowans and Jeremy Davison be definitely in contact we can trace their e mail exchange back to the day they meet online four month ago on a little web site call the Scarlet Secret this be their home page oh I get to get one of these DiNozzo I be talk about the plasma screen Kate what be this well um you know Friendster where people make web page with personal profile to connect with their friend online and their friend lead to their friend and so on and so on okay you know what friend be right Abby well it be kind of like that only it be explicitly for sex male female preference fetish and you follow the chain of page it should lead to somewhat anonymous cybersex or a real face to face meeting if you want you be a member no no she just create the page to look online I do a little trial and error with Laura Rowans ' screen name HomeAlone325 and Jeremy Davison 's Niceguy653 Care to guess which fetish they have in common Kate no no I be go to hell just listen to all of this rape

the reason for lure he on to a Marine base to rape a Marine wife well close thing to a death sentence I can think of Abby 's lab now no dice Gibbs the hacker leave no back trace on Laura Rowans ' machine but we can tell when he create the e mail trail the file overwrite on her computer show that it happen right around the time she shoot Jeremy Davison like I say this guy 's good the guy be a dirtbag Abby I want he well unfortunately we can not find he from here we need access to the Scarlet Secret web server and a warrant will take month they have a rep for legally fight any attempt to

Gibbs you share information with I and I share it with you we have a deal that kind of go against my policy Cooper which be throw people in jail who obstruct my investigation I will try to keep that in mind the dental record be conclusive Jethro this be our miss lieutenant any idea how he die after two year in the water difficult to say do you suspect foul play you know I Duck I suspect everything that be an admirable trait in an investigator and also the reason your three marriage end in divorce oh yeah all these year I think it be because I be a bastard well of course that do not help oh there be evidence of a hairline fracture on the frontal lobe of the skull Cause it be consistent with most vehicle accident quite possibly from contact with the steering column what about drug well in this state a toxicological screen would be useless however drug be a possibility too many of those Duck too many well my current opinion be that Lieutenant McAllister meet with a tragic accident most likely he drown keep look alas poor Yorick do you meet any of his wife I introduce he to the last one really what go wrong oh t 's difficult to say Mr Palmer she do not talk to I anymore you know what movie this remind I of Kate the Wizard of Oz I will get you my pretty no I mean the one they make you watch in high school 30 minute of cop pull dead teenager out of car wreck oh my God I love those blood on the Highway Drink drive die I keep hope they be go to release they on DVD yeah I too yeah what do we have ah hey boss I find a suitcase in the back look like he pack enough for about a weekend dive team will be back with the rest of the stuff from the debris field in a few hour abb the brake line be corrode but they be intact Something 's stuck hey Kate I get a present for ya I think it be one of your ex boyfriend it be a cold fish you get it Kate I do not think this be an accident it be a bullet McAllister be murder your speaker be break oh gibb that be the good part of the song Correction your ear be break what have the diver find actually it be more like what do not they find my theory be they be getting pay by the piece they recover everything within a 20 meter radius of the vehicle Sunglasses golf ball Rick James 8 track typewriter I do not see any point in bring the Maytag up from the evidence lock up anything to do with the case as a matter of fact find directly beneath the vehicle can you hear I now I might be able to recover some datum from the memory chip what about the bullet we bring up from the wreck last night 45 caliber 230 grain hardball lot and lot of stop power the grooving match a Colt 45 old school military version do you work up a trajectory yet of course the bullet 's entry angle into the side of the door be as obvious as Anna Nicole 's implant who you know married to that old guy have a tv show get fat get thin get fat get thin fat stop right so use that angle I back trace the trajectory the bullet travel on this path so unless he be drive with his foot from the backseat which be something that I have try but do not recommend Abby the round have to have go through McAllister 's body it be entirely possible Jethro but if Abby 's animation be correct the bullet pass clean through the thoracic cavity unfortunately without leave any evidence of its pass Hell of a shot yeah the vehicle have to be go over 70 to end up where we find it in the lake well at that speed a bullet pass through the rib cage without so much as glance a single bone ha Hell of a shot indeed more like impossible thank you Duck Doctor he mean the vehicle be stationary when Lieutenant McAllister be shoot Mr Palmer Lieutenant McAllister be last see in Norfolk on a Friday then find 300 mile away in Black Lake Virginia which would make sense if he be head here the McAllister family compound in Shenandoah so he be head home for the weekend another 20 mile and he would have make it McGee DiNozzo McAllister 's military record be spotless

other side where the storm have not reach yet see the local only use that road when there be bad storm that be right along Black Lake boss I figure that if somebody want to kill he they have to know the road and the weather the way McAllister do and they would have to know he be come be I right I would not have believe it if I have not see it myself what Kate Todd act like a high school girl with a crush he be not a murderer Tony I be sorry be you use the new NCIS magical murderer detector back there my gut if you be a guy I would say you be use your do not even say it if you want to live what

such a Boy Scout Money be a great receptor because the ink never really dry one bill use to snort cocaine and then go through an ATM leave minute trace of the drug on thousand of other four out of

with the grid give I the hypnotist 's number here you go boss what be next what how do we proceed McGee right well uh we 've get to figure out who Thorne be and find the connection between he and Petty Officer Dillon probably the money and I think it would be a smart move to keep an eye on Thorne 's apartment if he do not know we be on to he he will be back what else I think Erinand the building manager should work on a composite sketch be I forget anything just to keep my coffee hot McGee would you bring I an evidence vial please Mr Palmer this fiber appear synthetic most likely the petty officer do not pick it up from the portable loo you know make your death appear a robbery be a very amateurish attempt at a red herring I 've always find that a very curious expression yes it be be not it you know the derivation Fox and hound how be that Dr Mallard well the only practical way to cure a herring be by smoking and salt yes it turn the fish a crimson red and give it a very distinctive smell in the early 15th century they use to train their hound to hunt fox by drag a red herring along the ground on a piece of string to leave a trail of scent for the dog to follow then later on they would drag a red herring across the scent trail of a real fox to test the dog 's ability to ignore a false scent or false clue hence the term red herring become to mean a false clue design to fool one 's opponent that be fascinating yeah thank you do you know the etymology of the phrase white elephant I should really get this up to Abby because of its rarity the King of Siam declare all white elephant his personal property how be that yes Excellent this be as far as you 've get uh yeah that be as far as we be go to get I be sorry I just can not remember what he look like

the flesh trauma what kind of wound be these Doctor they be coyote he would eat the expose tissue first what be second well if what I suspect be true here the abdominal cavity have be chew open you know the liver and kidney be a rich source of nutrient for these creature that be uh gross Doctor well actually Mr Palmer we be quite lucky here in some case they chew off the head and carry it away

you typical man promise you everything until he get what he want right McGee well actually I thank McGee so I find dirt on her femur bone and identical trace on the inside of the plastic she be wrap in but not on the outside Nora Webb be bury in the ground then remove and then wrap in plastic and then put in that truck Chief Whalen always think she be bury in the wood maybe yes maybe no do you have anything more specific than dirt well I be try except my mass spectrometer crash and there be a certain MIT grad that be suppose to be fix it but be actually make it bad soon than later McGee why do not you just hire a service tech well I would McGee but it be Sunday oh there you be appreciate you come it be a godsend actually Mother have the lady of the kennel club over for cocktail take a ride Ducky oh I have a conversation with the M E at Richfield he come to the same conclusion suicide indeed well the laceration on the young girl 's wrist give every indication of be self inflict but that be not why you ask I in here they be hold Petty Officer Dobbs 's body for you at the Dover morgue I do not get it I think he die in combat I need you to take a look Ducky what do you expect I to find nothing I just need to buy more time oh Jethro I can spend forever find nothing Great thank you Boss track down the two witness who sign Petty Officer Dobbs 's will both be Corpsmen he meet in train One be station at GITMO the other Coronado neither know anything relevant Gibbs Gibbs Gibbs be we still on Weekend at the spa if I 've come up with something really big this be a piece of the plastic sheet that the victim 's body be wrap in you lift a print Negatory Trace evidence no but this a really big but from analysis of the polymer and the resin I track down the manufacturer they 've rework their formula it be polyethylene four mil thick it be more flexible and resistant to tear what be the point Abby this be a brand new product Gibbs it be only be on the market for four month Petty Officer Dobbs have be in Iraq for ten month he could not have put it there so can I make those reservation now what be the matter gibb that do not mean that Petty Officer Dobbs be innocent it only mean he could 've have an accomplice Emmy Poole yeah gibb I will be right there you be not call wi good news I be sorry Gibbs SECNAV make his decision he will not sign off on the Star you think he be go to want we to hang around I do not know I can not imagine there be anything till tomorrow go ask he you ask you be the special agent yeah well he like you more that be because I do not ask he stupid question Rock paper scissor on three something on your mind no no you be not think about leave be you oh uh no absolutely not no I be just go to go um check on the old spectrometer assume Petty Officer Dobbs be innocent why do Nora Webb 's remain show up in his storage locker someone be frame he Emmy Poole know about the locker and she have a key she would 've have to have go there before the bone be discover but after Petty Officer Dobbs die so he could not defend himself there be one problem though boss the computer show that Dobbs 's entry and access code be use only once the time she be with the manager she could 've use somebody else 's code there be a surveillance camera at the entry gate boss I know McGee that be why I be go to Little Creek avoid the 295 it be pack DiNozzo go with McGee he be go to pick up the surveillance tape boss I just you be drive you realize Mother Teresa would have road rage hell out there I know it be a long shot a long shot be you getting lay by Penelope Cruz McGee this be way beyond that look Tony I be sorry but my instinct tell I you have not be around long enough to have instinct Probie well I still do not think that Petty Officer Dobbs be a murderer why because he be a hero in Iraq they come to Cordura what the film of course Gary Cooper who one of the great actor of all time Coop High Noon they come to Cordura be one of his last picture Stick with I here it be 1916 the war against Pancho Villa Coop play an army major escort Rita Hayworth mm what a body and four Medal of Honor winner back to Texas for this ceremony and along the way he try to determine what make they hero in the end he expose they for what they really be corrupt pathetic hypocritical cowardly degenerate DiNozzo it be a movie it be a film you be take the stair McGee why 'cause I be not ride in an elevator with anyone who do not know who Gary Cooper be Abby can you tell if anyone pick Dobbs 's padlock yes no abb I do not have time I be try to tell you I just check it out I know you be go to ask it be scary gibb I be start to think like you the lock be almost virgin it be hardly be open and it show no sign of wear if it have be pick there would be scratch on the tumbler it be open with a key I would swear to it good work Abbs I know you be go to say that too he be the manufacturer 's service tech he get triple time on weekend and it be go to be a while stay on he so what be the verdict I be do really that be quick it be a simple short it be nothing you do not pick up in an intro ITT class I guess they do not offer that at MIT any luck with Emmy 's psychiatrist it be Sunday Gibbs I know as everyone keep remind I well it be not much of a challenge find you I actually do like to drink alone but I figure you could use a pick I up you be not surprised I find you here no no why should I be Investigation be not over it be a lose cause you here to gloat actually I happen to believe in miracle oh really yeah I never have one happen in front of I so I figure if one do I would like to be stand by so I could call the Pentagon miracle take hard work Commander any particular desk I should use Special Agent DiNozzo will be go for a while Agent Todd Richfield case file do you realize at this exact moment we would be in the throe of deep tissue exhilaration do not remind I you guy have spa plan yeah last month a girlfriend and I go to the new one in Charleston Serenity Retreat Ooh ah be you here for a reason Abby I wanna talk dirt Boss I do not know if you miss my lip move McGee but actually I be speak accord to my newly repair mass spectrometer sorry Abbs but this be big well it could be big uh at least we think it be but if it be big it be really big McGee talk make sense we review the entry gate security tape from Little Creek Public Storage now from the day that Petty Officer Dobbs die to the day that Nora Webb 's remain be find uh no sign of Emmy Poole enter but I think I recognize someone else it be grainy but we be hope that Abby 's capable of enhance it this video be take three day after Petty Officer Dobbs die in Falluja this guy open up a locker the same day under the name John Weston ' Kay freeze it right there any chance we can make the driver Abbs not a chance gibb a certainty Webb be there any other surveillance camera on the premise no once he be in he could 've go to any locker he would have to have know which locker be Dobbs 's and he would have have to have have a key because the lock be not pick Emmy Poole Kate McGee start background Bruce Webb DiNozzo you be with I Gibbs gibb my dirt what about it unless someone have be fertilize the forest Nora Webb be not bury in the wood the soil find on her femur contain chemical consistent with plant food yeah Gibbs Bruce Webb be Nora 's stepfather her biological father walk out when she be three Nora take his name when he officially adopt she at the age of six nothing else yet but we be work on it gibb he just cut you off do it to everyone wow the Stepfather you see that movie Guy marry a woman with a gorgeous daughter I think I make it clear we have nothing to say to NCIS Tony I know Security video can be so darn unflattere what be go on by tomorrow we will have your fingerprint from the storage locker rental agreement we will have a search authorization to take soil sample from the nursery and match they against trace evidence from Nora Webb 's remain I I do not understand you dig up and you move the body because you be afraid that the new owner of the nursery would uncover it Bruce Emmy Poole be an impressionable teenager raise by a single mom look for a father figure it be not like that what be it like Mr Webb Emmy be always around with Nora I enjoy be with they it be fun take they place as they get old Emmy be advanced sexually precocious it all happen so gradual and then one day thing get out of hand I want to stop it but what happen that night it be late my wife be asleep Emmy call to warn I that Nora

and blast cap so we should be able to trace its source to the manufacturer you would think so but no Abby every military explosive over the last 20 year have have taggant mix in for identification purpose Yep but these do not you tell I this guy make this stuff from scratch the composition be exact as off the shelf that be not possible how be that possible it should not be possible oh it be possible that be the stuff animal boss right Abby what stuff animal Abbs be you sure these explosive be not traceable um so far but I be still check what about the detonator also weird the electronic be fairly simple but there be no serial number on anything it be like it be be sanitize let us go DiNozzo we get problem someone be try to kill we again I do not think he mean that literally okay thank Sergeant we will uh still need a copy of the dispatch tape boss uh accord to State Police the 911 call be Anonymous yes and it be also untraceable yeah uh they be send a tape with the call over Kate what do you know about the lieutenant they be both pilot Gibbs Lieutenant Curtis Janssen 's an instructor in Pensacola what be he do in Virginia accord to his unit he be on leave visit his friend Lieutenant Dean Westfall also out of Pensacola but for the last two month he be be t a d at the Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland Proving grind it be where they test new military equipment and technology probie maybe they use Westfall 's print to access the base I check Tony None of Aberdeen 's security system rely on fingerprint or palm scanner what be he work on there Classified I will find out so what be go on boss Car do not have any military decal Lieutenants be wear civvie A and the 911 caller specifically say that it be two dead sailor someone want NCIS to investigate the scene why the same reason they rig the car to explode Kate we be set up so someone really be try to kill we yeah and they come pretty damn close you be absolutely certain about this Jethro someone go to a lot of trouble to try to get we out there on that road today Director for what purpose Unclear but what concern I be the explosive use military high grade extremely difficult to trace tough to get outside of certain circle you be not suggest another agency I be not suggest anything sir all I know be I 've piss off a lot of people over the year I would ask you to keep your suspicion to yourself can I ask why sir there may be other factor involve like what sir currently I be not at liberty to discuss it I almost lose my entire team out there today if the 's something I should know this be not open for discussion Agent Gibbs yes sir you be dismiss you have a good evening sir get I the director of the FBI yes sir you want some no thank you pass on free food maybe he be die well I have not have much of an appetite lately Kate on account of have the pneumonic plague yeah I know Tony I be there you do not have to keep bring it up every five minute it be not every day you escape the clutch of the Black Death Kate it be a life change experience how so Tony ask Kate she be there hey I want to know what Westfall be do at Aberdeen by the time I get back where you go out McGee I want other reason why someone would chop off his hand Tony eat something why take someone 's hand trophy okay but why leave the other lieutenant 's if he be chop hand off I do not think we can expect he to be rational McGee we 've get trouble what be your first hint the two dead body downstairs or the explosion McGee no I mean FBI trouble Fornell we must be in bad shape than we think where be Gibbs he be not here where be he Agent Todd he be out try he on his cell I d he be not answer what be go on Ari Haswari be back in country you let that psycho back in the States without tell we he be suppose to be help we uncover an Al Qaeda cell in the D c area what do you mean suppose to Fornell we now think he be here for more personal reason he be plan on kill Gibbs Washington be such a lovely city this time of year do not you agree Special Agent Gibbs not much of a conversationalist be we I be mostly wait here Ari oh for what a reason to shoot you again someone try to kill my team today I be think it be you you wound I Gibbs if it be I they would be dead already you be still come in with I for question unfortunately I 've make other arrangement for the evening it be not a request I know that be why I take the precaution of plant an explosive device under one of these table you be a good NCIS agent I may even tell you where what be you do here an Al Qaeda cell be plan an attack in Washington I be here to stop it yeah what be the target I do not know where be the cell locate Wish I know you be do a hell of a job for a Mossad double agent I can however gain access to that information but it come at a price one you may not be willing to pay try I Al Qaeda send I here to conduct my own mission it be a test I pass and I be allow into the Washington cell they want I to kill you you do not seem surprised it mean I be do my job yes and in order for I to do mine you have to die I wonder what would you do in my position kill myself sadly not an option it be the one part of my religion I subscribe to I could help you out with that a kind offer to be sure I also have one for you I be listen you have 24 hour to find and eliminate the cell if you fail I appreciate the head up it be the least I could do how be Caitlin by the way I 've think of she often since my last visit go near she and I do not care what government agency 's watch your back I will kill you this time I would not have it any other way where be the device oh I almost forget I lie there be none please call I back that be 20 message I leave we should look for he McGee look for who we 've be call you for the last hour boss well yeah my ring thing got turn off you be never go to believe who be back in town Ari maybe you will Fornell say that he be here to kill I yeah I know I just have coffee with he so what happen he try to kill I we find out what Westfall be do in Aberdeen yet uh boss be not you go to elaborate a little bit first well yeah McGee I be alive now tell I about Westfall uh he be only attach to Aberdeen he be actually work with an aerospace contractor in Maryland Danborn Avionics do what testing field service module or something like that I have no idea the FBI send a team over to the company to investigate their security the FBI a lot 's happen in the last hour where be Fornell mtac make the ring thing work be it I or do he take the whole Ari situation really well that be 'cause he be look forward to it look forward to what finally get to kill he how long do you know that bastard be here we have our reason Gibbs how long about a week we do not know what his cover mission be with Al Qaeda until today I be take he down not this time the FBI can handle this the civilian in the coffee shop that he try to blow up today would probably disagree with you Tobias look if it be up to I I would put a round through his forehead it be not you be sit this one out you go to try to stop I no no not I Jethro Ari have be declare off limit NCIS will have no further involvement in the case you be kid sir I 've also be order to place you under protective custody for your own safety Meaning for Ari 's take it for what it be a direct order Agent gibb and you damn well tter follow it to the letter yes sir I would also like to take this opportunity to offer you my resignation sir and I will accept it after you 've complete your current case Sir have you find any evidence connect Ari to the murder of our two Naval officer no we have not sir I will now hand you over to our federally certify protective custody expert Agent Todd I hear she use to protect the President you should be flatter he be all your I expect you to follow her order to the letter as if they be mine that last part he mean in his home two team six hour shift alternate radio check every ten minute outside I want a mobile foot patrol and two permanent observation post Gibbs be not go to like that well screw what he like Tony I be not go to let that psycho within five mile of Gibbs McGee I need full audio and video surveillance inside and out everything tie back in mtac you get it Kate go home it be late uh gibb I do not think we be go to be go home I be stay here I do not need an army of agent stay up all night watch I build a boat you will not leave the building if I do I will call you go go home get some sleep first thing tomorrow morning we be go to check out Danborn Avionics find out what the FBI miss go do you miss I Gibbs you dream about Gibbs what no God no you just say his name no I do not yes you do what be go on Kate dream about Gibbs oh what be it about no I do not dream about Gibbs she scream his name really here you go look if you want to check out the defense contracting company with we today you be wear a vest I can live with that that be kind of the point Gibbs Lieutenant Westfall be the military liaison for Danborn 's Modular UAV project and like I tell the FBI I really doubt his murder have anything to do with it Modular UAV it be an unmanned aerial vehicle we be develop with the Navy it can be reconfigure for different mission in the field what kind of mission Reconnaissance nuclear and biological agent testing uh ground attack so it can be use as a weapon some day it be only a prototype oh and uh before you ask we change all our security code and remove Westfall 's from the system last night follow I any chance of your modular uav be miss Nope we only have one and that be she in the hangar what be these scale model we use in wind tunnel test any of your security system rely on fingerprint or palm scanningtechnology Mr Eberlee why Lieutenant Westfall be miss his hand someone hack they off the FBI do not mention that we do what be the answer our radio flight control system use biometric only pilot enter into the system can fly they like Westfall yeah but we only have one flyable UAV and that be it what about these those be target drone Danborn Avionics get its start make they in the 1970 they be relic they be not operational look like one 's miss it be uh it be probably move where we sometimes use they for spare part look it be not possible I mean you would need a team of engineer to get one of these ap in fly shape not to mention you need a radio flight control and I will bet Lieutenant Westfall 's be miss accord to these schematic the drone 's pretty outdated from a tech perspective Gibbs so be a hand grenade Excellent point the Danborn TX Bravo be basically a jet propel RC plane mean it be manually control by a radio transmitter the transmitter they steal be for a modern UAV they might not be able to fly it true true but Danborn 's flight code be base on the original software so a few tweak what be the range 40 mile unless if they load it down with explosive oh they will Payload would haveo be pretty small 25 pound or less if they want to get it off the ground not a lot of bang for your buck it be if you be go after a soft target Abbs soft target People any way to stop it if it be launch it would not be hard to destabilize the system I have the operational frequency another controller could probably jam it t I another controller but gibb there be a catch you would have to be within a 40 mile range to jam it I have a weird dream about Tony last night not the one where you two be at the zoo and he no no he be fully clothe in this one but he have blood all over his face I wake up cry Kate I never cry never ever ever hey it be just a bete noire get to go what do you get a shot of our drone thief from Danborn 's security footage from two night ago the day the lieutenant be murder can you I d they well they be both wear ski mask but check this out maybe I be paranoid but do that guy look familiar you be not paranoid that bastard 's Ari he be not look for an Al Qaeda cell Hell no he be run it you get Fornell in here how much should I tell he tell he he be about to make the second big mistake of his life what my second big mistake Jethro that be very dramatic what be the first when you marry my second wife you could have warn I I do in my own defense I think he be exaggerate he be not where be Ari what part of sit this out do not you get the part where he steal a Navy UAV and kill a whole bunch of people with it my people check out Danborn Avionics their only UAV be account for he steal a target drone Fornell pull it up pack the nose of that with Semtex he be get a poor man 's cruise missile guess your boy miss it Ari 's play you he be no double agent he never have be where be he all we 've get be an encrypt spook cell phone number call he you can not trace it from

want to give he a teddy bear yeah huh look at this yeah Locator beacon be set you figure it out I do the uh drone be on one of three radio frequency it will take a few minute to jam each of they but

a bridge up here appear to be a power line or some dirt on a picture lf l can make a land plot create scale by compute the distance between these point then we can okay stream and power line lt would take year search just one county McGee never mind a state yeah for we Tony but not for a computer Satellite imagery l should have think of that l need to figure a way to calculate an accurate scale Polaroid camera have a fix focal length that be a good start l'm go to need one know measurement pick one body and l'll pull her stat three know vector should do it okay okay enough with the geek speak gibb want to know how many victim we lD'd all except for the last four in the scrapbook we be run they against missing person report prior to Gibbs put Boone behind bar no match yet the one that stand out the most be the first victim she disappear in 1 97 4 be you sure about that Abs Boone be just a kid back then l know and it turn out his mother do not abandon he she be his first kill you do not have to do this again you know you be wrong Duck l do he be never go to tell you where those poor girl be l know that then why because ten year ago l could not break he no but you do what no one

as a forensic anthropologist l can assure you my examination be strictly non invasive there now l've see several image like this in the past but you can not be certain until you get it out get what out ln my opinion it be a musket ball l do not think this be what Gibbs have in mind when he instruct I to observe do you have any idea how many people get kill in America by bear every year Ziva no but l can not imagine a lot you would be surprise McGee l think it be about one lsn't there something constructive you could be do like what lnvestigate DiNozzo and McGee Report in Casket be uncover by a housing project go up near the Bull Run Battlefield in Manassas boss get the name and address of the company schedule an interview and soil test for tomorrow the only thing remove from the casket be a cell phone damage and non operational l've also get the print of the lab worker to run against any we find in or around the body and tomb Dr Burns be wear surgical glove when she pick this up good work Ms David l'm wonder why there be a nine millimetre hole in my hat Ventilation l'll escort the casket back with Ducky we will meet in the squad room Agent Gibbs l would also like to know if l could drive the truck back to base lt might make I feel as if l actually accomplish something today hey not so fast l always drive fast lt be the good way to avoid possible leds and ambush you be in America now l would not worry about it how about this slow down or l'll puke on you Tony why do not you like the American Civil War l do not want to talk about it lt 's because of his father be she talk to you probie oh you do not get along with your father explain a lot my father and l get along fine lf you say so l think it be good to talk about thing instead of bury they inside what about you

degree to the left she invite I out for cocktail tomorrow evening l be force to decline why she seem nice oh she be more than nice but how do you tell a woman that you have absolutely no mental

would never hit a lady exactly so l suggest we get start Ziva yes first of all do not ever do that again and second what be you do l'm observe you Tony any way you can do that in a less creepy manner who be the woman with Gibbs once you be here long enough you will figure it out ls that his girlfriend l have no idea you just tell I that well you will figure out there be some thing around here you do not ask about all right then Bye where 's Gibbs Tony your 2 o'clock what be wrong Duck l know how our staff sergeant die from your look l'm guess it be not a musket ball at first one could assume that a projectile of such size and mass would produce almost instant death but pre Civil War musket be notoriously unreliable and lose most of their velocity over the first hundred metre our sergeant be grievously wound by a musket ball but his injury be not fatal then how do he die Dr Mallard his lung tissue be coat with an extremely fine film of rust particle and one can only imagine how long he claw at the iron side of his casket try to escape before he suffocate a Marine dress as a Civil War soldier be shoot by a musket and then bury alive in a 1 40 year old antique iron casket and you be tell I this be not your strange case Yep pretty much l do not know what l find more disturbing your eat habit or the fact that l believe you l'm sorry do our strange american food frighten you not at

the same Civil War club our dead staff sergeant belong to get an address yeah but he be not there the club be on their way to Manassas Battlefield Park for a re enactment should be there this afternoon McGee what else do you remember about the map l think l can help with that at Mossad officer who fail to observe do not generally last long and at NClS they apparently get drop kick into

usually wear by southern gentleman to telegraph wealth and status lt 's in fantastic condition where do you find it on a mummified hand in a safety deposit box l'm afraid sound like scavenger Grave robber we 've have more site ruin by they than l care to remember how about the map we find with it abs certainly typical of the Civil War period lcf stand for lrregular Confederate Forces Oxbow may be refer to a prominent Virginia family where do they live Manassas their mansion be destroy in the Second Battle of Bull Run by the Union remember how we find Boone 's dumping ground Gibbs l could run the vector between these feature and satellite imagery do it well if it be Manassas l've have several dig there l'd be more than willing to serve as a guide that be if Dr Mallard would be willing to accompany I boss his club check in with the park ranger Judd Kearns be there now be we roll no not yet Gear up bring back memory for you Tony lt look like fun you know what little Anthony DiNozzo

dressed as a Union sergeant you two with I see if you can match up any of the landmark on the map any suggestion doctor let I look by the orientation of the map l suggest we start near some of my old dig site to the north unless May l during time of war mapmaker often add terrain or change the declination of north and south in order to confuse confuse the enemy before it fall into the wrong hand yeah very good Ziva yes what trouble I about this map be this Confederate flag in the corner lt be unfurled in the opposite direction of most flag precisely l think we should start look to the south Boss your 3 o'clock red stripe that be the guy from the bank video oh he be go fast you think Son of a Ziva l really think we should wait for Gibbs he be the one that tell we to look for landmark Dr Mallard Landmarks yes follow they deep into the wood probably not and please call I Ducky okay Ducky l believe this be the trail indicate on the map l doubt it wait the topography 's completely different today we might have well luck near the site where the Oxbow mansion use to stand we can try that next that be not bad boss l think you be still behind I until you tackle he not likely DiNozzo what be his excuse lt be not an x on the map lt be a cross this be a graveyard Ducky wait here and call gibb tell he to hurry we need to hurry this up yeah that be it they bury these thing so

we be go to get you out of there l promise ls anybody go to join I down here well gibb say not to get too close yeah you really should not be down there Ducky lt 's not safe the exit wound to the petty officer 's neck seem to indicate the bullet go straight through there could be a spent round that might be crucial to our investigation well as you 've point out many time l'm just a junior

nine millimetre round be slow and only accurate to about 30 metre the shooter be in a move car that pull up alongside yeah that be one possibility Ziva but you see we be investigator which mean we investigate thing we do not assume she be right Wife say she hear the gunshot over the phone the shooter have to be close thank you what about Petty Officer Smith l run his military lD he be a clerk at Norfolk have four month leave before his discharge Tony take Ziva with you and check with the c o when you be do sweep the trajectory for brass but why you just say l because DiNozzo 's right too

it well l'm afraid a liver temp be out of the question well talk to I Duck lt be very strange the marbling on the skin indicate advanced decomposition but the complete lack of insect activity on the moist area of the open thigh indicate a cessation of decay any idea how long well the muscle have go through all three stage of rigor mortis so that give we at least 48 hour but Jethro the leg be in pristine condition apparently untouched by air water soil or insect Frozen no ice crystal Basement well if that be the case we be deal with a dark soul one who kill cut and keep that be trash l think l know what l'm do by now well mre and paint pellet say training area to I no one have ever be kill during training you know my forensic instructor back at fletc once plant a pregnancy test at a crime

this the finger of a rubber glove l do not say do not look under indigenous stuff l think we be almost do here no l do not think so l want every paper projectile stomp on leaf within a ten foot radius of both leg l'll bet Tony make some unseemly comment about these leg do not he why would he do that Mr Palmer l just mean know Tony they be fairly shapely leg doctor yes nobody have the bad taste to verbalize such a thought until now now that you come to mention it they do look remarkably similar to Betty Grable 's Betty one of the all time pin up gal of the ' 40 yeah great gams Gams be not you a little young to remember Betty Grable Jethro my dad have she paint on the nose of his p 51 Duck a p 51 up to Abby Quick as you can ye doctor what do we know about our Jane Doe she be young look at the

dead long before she be dissect blood no long pulse through her vein when what l would guess be a surgical saw sever her thigh from her torso now look see how my glove stick here also head up to the mass spectrometer yes but take a look at this skin 's be remove yes a meticulously cut circle strange keepsake actually l think it be the killer try to remove his mark like all sex killer after Bundy yes after Theodore Bundy be identify and catch by his crooked low tooth sadistic biter have be force to excise their evidence you know l think l might be able to get an impression of tooth from the underlying damage tissue you could get I a bite mark l could try l have some sample for Abby that be convenient because l'm Abby 's assistant l want to say hi l have not see she in a while she be really busy right now lt'll only take a minute you have not be an assistant for very long long than you we will see about that that do not make any sense Chip lt 's Charles Charles lt be an evidence

himself the same night his girlfriend OD'd the froth around the mouth suggest a breakdown of the nervous system PCP yeah possible but not probable look Pinpoint pupil blue discoloration around the fingernail no l'd say his death be the result of diacetylmorphine Heroin yeah l would say you be right Ducky that a suicide note not exactly '' lt 's time for we to realise that this just be not mean to be please know that it be never my intention to hurt you l will always remember the great time we 've have '' this be a Dear John letter postmark six day ago from Quantico post office handwriting check out Taylor Shane send it yeah Noah Keller come by to chat about it Very Romeo and Juliet except for the part where he feed she a toxic Klowny Kake and off himself this must 've be a very difficult letter for she to write probably hard for he to read no one like getting dump by postal express maybe he do not listen Relationships change some people do not know when to let go l have to brief the c g of Quantico first thing in the morning on this and l'd like you to be there when l do that Negative Jen all we have be circumstantial evidence so far we do not even have anything to tie the two death together yet l can not call the general and tell he we have nothing you can always write he a letter Abby abs they be for you they be really black really really black lt 's pretty cool huh yeah '' get well soon '' they do not have a card that say '' Sorry l almost send you to prison '' at the flower shop almost you actually do send I to prison well not for good Abby l do not know

issue do not forget to water they or they will die l think they already be dead '' Laugh now cry later '' that be an interesting concept Mr Palmer unfortunately for our guest here the laughter have end my friend who go to NYU say this guy be the club king of New York he be almost legendary well if he be not before he most certainly be now and apparently he only hang out with model and a list celebritie this guy get the VlP treatment everywhere he go you write a gossip column Palmer oh l be just inform Dr Mallard that he would we l talk to I Duck our initial assumption be far from correct when l examine he just now l find fresh bruise on his upper back the left shoulder the x ray indicate a severe fracture of the left scapula and a clavicle that be almost completely crush he be in a fight lnjurie of that nature his left arm would be completely useless someone else shoot he up well Abby 's tox screen show that Mr Keller have a blood alcohol level of 0 34 his heart be pump so slowly that most of the heroin be never even metabolize he be pass out yes l'm afraid our young man be unconscious when the drug be administer from Abby l think this show be just mindless entertainment lt 's call research Tony and l'm merely look for a lead well this be only the beginning before you know it you will be sit at home eat a large box of chocolate watch the Food Network on your 50 inch plasma we be not all so easily corrupt take McGee for example he be be raise in America his entire life and he rarely turn the television on tell he McGee yeah tell he McGee well depend what you consider rarely l might watch 20 minute here or there tell she what you do the rest of the time probie that be not tv he pretend to be a fairy in an online computer game lt be an elf lord whatever Keller do not commit suicide he be murder what the hell be you two do find out why hey l get to call you back Boss l think l might have something be you wait for I to guess Elf Lord no sorry l be search through Noah Keller 's cell phone record the night that he die he receive three call two be from his business manager the other be from Hannah Bressling l've know Noah since high school we use to sneak into the Limelight like every weekend Limelight that be that club in Chelsea yeah you 've be actually no l l see it on Wild on sound like it be a pretty exclusive place even as a kid Noah seem to know all the right people l do not think he wait in line his entire life Money tend to open door no he do not use his dad 's money as a crutch really yeah everyone always assume he be popular only because he be rich and that that be the reason he date model l'm sure it do not hurt no woman like Noah because he be charismatic and interesting l mean most guy that come from money be womanizer whose life revolve around their car be you and Noah Keller ever an item we date on and off for a couple year but we sort of lose touch when he hook up with Taylor when do he get involve with drug People say he get she start but it be not true they both make that leap together do you speak to he when he come to see Taylor no he be drunk and really upset but l call he later that night just to make sure that he be safe l just can not imagine why anyone would 've want to hurt he what be you do l just stop by to drop you something off Jethro look to I like you be play agent l leave you four message today really l only get three Keller 's death be a murder not suicide that be something l should probably know lt sound like you do this case be get more attention by the hour l trust that you will keep I inform Trust be a two way street what be you say Jethro you do not trust I of course l trust you ls that all for now l can save you the trouble on today 's Channel 6 News per Director

place know how to avoid they not all of they a few minute ago l find this lt 's from a Quantico security camera place on top of the mess hall this video be take about two hour before Taylor Shane die l presume not many people stroll around Quantico at 1 a m can you zoom in abs my new enhancement program be boot up as we speak l've be wait for the chance to bust out this bad boy this should clear it up a bit Taylor be with Staff Sergeant McMannis when 's Gibbs plan on start this be one of his technique really leave the guy alone in a cold dimly light room and then just as the guy start to zone out he burst in the door and rifle off some question l call it '' rock the baby '' l see and do it work just watch ln a few moment that door be go to fly open and this big bad Marine be go to jump like a little girl what the hell 's with you DiNozzo l be just tell Ziva about your interrogation technique l'm not interrogate McMannis you be thank boss l could 've use a little more prep time but

midnight walk you do that with every girl staff sergeant no just Taylor we do not want anybody to find out about we until the show end find out what that we be in love ma'am this be the bad defence imaginable the idea of a supermodel fall in love with a guy like this okay why be that well it be absolutely ridiculous you know Supermodels date guy like George Clooney or guy with George Clooney 's bank account or of course the actual George Clooney but not guy like this they do not date guy like this definitely not guy like this Meaning Marines DiNozzo no l do not say that l mean l would never say that he think l mean Marines Yeah gibb l've get something for you Gibbs l'll be right there Abby 's get something hey you be a lot of help Taylor be nothing like her reputation she be normal like

whole lifestyle and the reason you fail to mention you be with she a few hour before she die who would have believe I ma'am Hell it be my life barely believe it myself l believe you you do so l'm free

picture container be not unload at the dock Clear Custom seal be be break Tony get inside l think we 've just be screw in here Tony the term be '' bolt '' same difference l try that Bolted from the outside l know your idea be stupid my idea yes take up a defensive position inside a metal box yes you be not panic on I be you l do not panic this be I mad l'm not get any reception how about you l'm braless l notice that early but on your phone they be '' bar '' do not you have anything well to do than correct my English like what like get we out of this box you trap we in okay first of all this be not my fault Second of all l like dark tight space unless of course they insist on some form of commitment l be refer to my childhood bedroom lt look like our smuggler have remove most of the cargo so they be probably not come back we be still lock in a box and freeze to death somebody might have hear the gunfire yeah well if they do they would be here by now you know what we could do fire a couple of round out of these shafts maybe someone will hear we oh yeah maybe they do not hear the massive firefight so let us just waste the little ammunition we have you know what you be brilliant Genius Sarcasm be the refuge of a shallow mind what do you suggest we do l suggest we bust out of here now okay Bugsy l'll take care of the security guard and go through the this be not funny lt 's not funny l know what we need to do be relax and remain calm and wait for what for they to come in with reinforcement for Gibbs trust I he will find we l believe you the question be will it be before we freeze to death our intel be wrong gibb the container be not fill with small arm it be a shipment of explosive C 4 bad unexplode KMGU cluster bomblet from where lraq Al Qaeda pay kid 50 cent a day to collect the bomblet Most of they end up dead the lucky one cripple these bomblet be highly unstable yeah l'd say that be bad french intelligence out of Dakar believe they may have be load onto a senegalese ship last week last week why be we just hear about this today have you ever work with the French Gibbs yeah a few time then you know what l'm up against l've get two agent down at the dock l need more than '' they may have be load on a senegalese ship '' Tom we be work on it Jethro just tell your people to be careful where be they now McGee Tony say that they be relocate why say that they have new intel be you wait for I to say please l could not really make it out the phone reception be already hinky before l lose they well un lose they l do not want they touch anything without a bomb squad present pinch I now another crate of movie look at they all maybe there be a crate full of dvd player in here let us not forget the battery operate generator and the popcorn machine l'm open to all thing cinema they be East lndian bollywood no subtitle lt 's low on the list of genre l know but extremely babe heavy where be the small arm l mean why would they shoot at we over copy of Kuch Kuch Hota Hai do it matter we need to get out of here Tony yeah l hear that the first 50 time you say it you be not claustrophobic be you no because l'm tell you that would be another nail in the shoe of my day what if we blow a hole at the bottom of this door near where the bolt be lt might enable we to jam something under it and force it open not like it fire a bullet in the air and it be bind to ricochet as l be say there be a good chance the bullet might ricochet and kill one of we sorry why be you on top of I l'm protect you Tony do not well you do not seem to mind when we be undercover that might have something to do with the fact that you be naked perhaps if it be warm in here let I rephrase the question why be you still on top of I our last contact with they be here the North Expansion they be check out a west african cargo chip that pull in two day ago what about the GPS stuff in their phone well see that be the strange thing their cell phone reception be bad around the dock but GPS chip should not be affect they run on a separate satellite network we should be able to pick they up anyway should McGee for some reason we can not Phones Phones could be turn off chip could be disable they could be in a structure that be block the GPS signal like the hold of a ship possibly you know l'm think that they might be wait to get into a well cell reception area before call in maybe do not cut it McGee you should have let I know l know see the thing be you be busy boss you be in the restroom you ever have a conversation in the head McGee one time l do the person that l be talk to be so distract my shoe they kind of get sorry l should have let you know do not apologize lt be a sign of weakness let us find they before DiNozzo blow both his arm off this do not make any sense maybe this be not the container they use to smuggle their weapon this be the only container that be not seal the rest of they be close they off load they already that might explain how they get automatic weapon we be miss something besides warmth Ziva David do this space seem different to you define different do it seem small than the outside dimension usually container be 40 foot long this one be only 34 on the inside Somebody be be do renovation Plywood not bad l can almost forgive you now for what for lock we in this box Ladies first what do you see Trouble arabic script what do it say '' this end up Handle with care Caution explosive ordinance '' a bomb l think so yes and what do this say exactly '' death to America '' Great be you think what l'm think perhaps if it involve a violent and painful death careful this may be booby trap a dozen different way so why be we open it again because if it be a bomb it may be arm hey listen if this thing go off l just want you to know this be not your fault l know no l be go to say your life would have have more meaning if you would sleep with I lf you have anything else on your mind perhaps l would have really no ready hold on all right up an inch no visible wire proceed oh my God well l do not expect to see that there be get to be million in here More than enough to bankroll one hell of a terrorist op these dvd be just decoy to get through Customs l'll tell you what when we get out of here l'm go to buy you a house but it be go to have to be a fake house because these be counterfeit how can you tell the Treasury run a workshop with we First they be freshly print your Treasury print million everyday so do country like Syria and North Korea hundred dollar bill have not be redesign since ' 96 which make it very vulnerable to this kind of counterfeit still that do not explain how you know they be fake the ink lt smell yes like ink well our money do not smell here try it give it a little sniff oh God that smell like stale alcohol and your armpit yeah the point be it do not smell like ink now there be only one way to know for sure lf it burn orange it be real lmpressive but irrelevant real or not

heat rise right so the smoke be go to go out through these ventilation slot and draw attention to our position not to mention the add benefit of heat production be you serious well it make more sense

nothing oh no lt 's something gibb can smell the rotten cabbage in the middle of the pile do you think Tony and Ziva be in trouble l'm think that be what Gibbs be think then we do have cause for concern very well do darling but where be we go to put the divan actually you know it look pretty good l particularly like your firing slot of course against automatic weapon it will disintegrate in 30 second yeah what be it about danger and uncertainty that make I feel so Horny Hungry l'd kill for a pizza right now what you do not have to joke about it lt be all right to admit you be scared you

kind of conductor really hey your necklace we can attach it to the end of the antenna and slip it out of the slot cell phone antenna be vertical the wire can not dangle well we need to stiffen it Ziva l've hear that before work with I here we can slice the spine off these dvd and sandwich it in between you okay yes l still need something to reflect off the side of the container the angle need to be precise Tony the response l'm look for here be '' Cool Tony '' l'm say it might work when this be all over we be go to watch Kuch Kuch Hota Hai this be where it get disturb lt be like look at an Escher print l be able to isolate four segment at 8 1 6 l have they get out of the North Expansion sector then at this point they walk out of frame another camera pick they up at 8 1 9 you see they

mostly the engine sound she be in a car trunk yes again now for the big finish exactly 3 4 second later the trunk be slam shut but the engine sound stay the same until the phone shut off they take the

might be safe then she would slip into a coma after 1 7 she would definitely run out of oxygen we stop the nuclear supply train in Pennsylvania in a rural area lt 's heavily armoured and defend by FAST Company Marines the fuel rod be in a containment capsule capable of withstand small arm fire however if someone do manage to detonate those fuel rod they would irradiate a 1 0 mile radius how many other people know about the train 's route the personnel onboard escort two Cobras fly air escort and my staff and Lieutenant Commander Wilkerson 's involvement she help plan both the primary and alternate route what the hell be she do on liberty captain she be never involve in the operational phase and she specifically request today off why l do not ask be you suggest that she be somehow

car sometimes be right back no one like a show off get something open up roll the tape l tell you how much l like movie only several time a day lt 's Sunday the 1 4th 0833 Location the parking garage at Braddock Mall the agree upon meet place with my target he be promise money and a place to stay in exchange for my willing cooperation why do not l think what she say be a good thing because you be a well agent than you be a driver boss it look like she use an lDEA algorithm to generate a short key for some of the file get the software work now as for the rest l be condense like extension into their own subset ln English McGee l be work on open the locked file and establish protocol gibb what he be try to say be that there be a crap load of stuff the sheer volume of material be daunt even for a guy in a turtleneck but l'm work it as fast as l can work fast McGee lf she be still in the car trunk we have 8 hour to find she till she run out of air that be not strictly accurate Jethro l be on the 9th with a shot at a 1 0 Nassau when Abby call she want to make certain her survival figure be accurate how far off be they Duck well they be spot on but something she say bother I she arrive at her figure base on a young woman in good health well give the dire circumstance l think it good to verify that that be in fact the case Lieutenant Commander Wilkerson be treat for acute bronchitis by an intern at the base two day ago with her lung in that condition well they would not be operate as efficiently as normal how long her survival time would be shorten by several hour you 've be so helpful l do not know DiNozzo l hope that be background on Lieutenant Commander Wilkerson l talk to everyone in her command they think she be clean not much social life spend half her time at work half at home on her computer she be basically a McGee he be not responsible for the movement of nuclear fuel rod across country and McGee do not make a personal video about money and transport to a safe house what be with that video lt do not make any more sense than that phone call they both accomplish one thing the train be no long mobile Navy can not risk move it until they find out what happen to her Navy yeah as in we Boss l think l have something here show I McGee l'm not 1 00 percent sure it be anything but l find something that could possibly help show I Wilkerson 's e mail log show that she send 1 4 message from the same location last night lt be not her home lsp l can not read that lt 's encrypt then un crypt it Abby and l be work on it why be l sit here look at you l

Thanksgiving back in ' 98 Family do have a way of fray one 's nerve take my mother for instance she insist on watch Jeopardy every night on the television what be wrong with that Duck the same episode over and over again l make the mistake of tape it for she once l always say you can pick your nose but you can not pick your family there be a touch of the poet in you Mr Palmer l'd say you be just more touch DiNozzo House belong to a Sergeant Malcolm Porter and his wife Sun boss she be the one on the left Sergeant 's still on liberty try to track he down the other vic be Min Crane she be married to a Sergeant Floyd Crane currently deploy in lraq Sign of an unhappy marriage Funny l think it look like a hole in the wall lt 's about fist size Husband probably hit the wall instead of hit his wife what else do you see judge by the position of the body l'd say they be take by surprise yeah why body posture they be too relaxed they do not fight back that could also mean they know the identity of their attacker search the rest of the house little girl 's become quite the crime scene investigator be not she boss l'll go help McGee talk to the woman who find they you get a TOD yet Duck very recent both liver probe indicate about two and a half hour ago triple tap all in the heart yeah but notice these burn mark around the entry wound here and on this one so both of those the weapon be in direct contact with the body when fire two from across the room then one each up close just to be sure l do not believe the term '' overkill '' would be inappropriate under these circumstance bullet do not penetrate maybe they be small calibre do you find any casing the shooter police his brass Duck police sir yes it be military terminology for clean up after one 's self we may be deal with a professional Professional what Killer Mr Palmer these poor woman be not so much murder as execute she just need her bottle l know l pack it look look look your mom 's right there

to reason with she but she would not leave he she be ashamed lt be hard for a korean woman to ask for help find Porter l'd start at the '' E '' Club James l'm Yoon 's husband listen if you do not find Porter there you might wanna check some of the bar outside the front gate l'm on it boss Everything be go to be okay now honey okay gibb a word please l just talk to she a few hour ago Gun safe l find it in the master bedroom open and empty except for a handful of shell 40 calibre think maybe the husband do this yes l guess the polite term Agent DiNozzo would be '' bastard '' he be always borrow my husband 's tool and never return they l should 've know this would happen Stealing tool be not really a prerequisite for murder Mrs Goodwin all l'm say be the two of they have one hell of a marriage you would not know it to look at she but Sun 's get a set of lung or at least she do so they fight a lot oh hardly a night go by you do not hear all sort of scream come from this house you ever think to make a complaint l do not like to stick my nose in good thing too lt could have be I that got slaughter on our way McGee Sergeant Porter be spot 30 minute ago at the E '' Club McGee 's almost there

dilettante thank you doctor now careful not too much pressure but not too little either all right come on come on come on let us see yes very good not bad not bad at all keep a steady hand there be no room for error you never know which element of the enigma however minuscule can lead you to the solution Palmer just get some of your element on his plastic thing Occupational hazard l'm afraid what can you tell I Duck both woman be shoot three time in the chest lt be hard to say which of these six be the fatal wound Suffice to say neither woman die of old age anything else yes Mrs Porter have some swelling and fissure on her finger and knuckle Defensive wound possibly yeah but these do not happen today there be also bruise on her wrist l'd say they be at least a week old she be abuse yeah thank Duck you have the man in custody now yeah there be no need to be gentle with he Jethro you miss a spot we be look at a Beretta Cougar 8040 Gibbs lt be register to Sergeant Porter in 2003 and it be get his fingerprint all over it Bullets Cross point 40 calibre Smith and Wesson also call a short and Wimpy '' although l do not know why they lack the power of a 1 0 millimeter auto load you do not need that stop power when you gun down housewife what about gunshot residue lnstant Shooter Kit come negative on Porter 's skin shirt and pant could 've wear glove or he could 've change clothe l'm way ahead of you that be why l'm do a full analysis on all of Porter 's wardrobe '' how long Abby '' well it be go to take some time and since this stuff do not smell very good l do not think

owner officer or director that be why the old man seem to like it lt sound suspicious l have a contact who can get I that info Ziva do not talk about it do it well it be a delicate situation Gibbs perhaps l should elaborate a Martin Broussard raise in New Orleans Boss barely graduate high school drop out of Junior college after only one year Record Two DUls and a shoplifting charge we get print from his room Abby be try to match they for the Mercedes from the chop shop you think Broussard could be Sean Oliver 's client no way this guy 's apartment make McGee 's look like the Four Seasons

particle accelerator to try to ferret out any trace element and and l find calcium which be present in human bone but no phosphorus which mean there be really no foreplay with you be there gibb what you 've be talk to my ex wife again the urn contain burn wood chip concrete dust and pebble the ashe be bogus ask yourself what kind of guy live in a coffin storage shed at a funeral home perhaps a poor one l'd buy that except for the fact that it look like this guy do an episode of Trading Spaces with Satan what we need to figure out be why this guy decide to keep the man 's head and how it end up in the trunk of a steal Mercedes maybe he need it for some sort of ritual or sacrifice Witchcraft whatever you wanna call it probie l agree anyone so obviously fascinated with death have to be deeply disturb on some level l mean take these mask for instance what kind of a person would collect such horrid look thing I of course by '' horrid '' l mean finely craft and artistic good morning Abby hi the mask be Ogum they be use in tribal ceremony in Africa Friend of mine make they l see and this Drapeau or flag lt symbolize the bridge between your spiritual and your earthly plane l'm not

Believers Martin Sheen the Serpent and the Rainbow Sleepless in Seattle that be about voodoo no but the first time l see it it scare the bejesus out of I ls that a fact DiNozzo yes sir we think we

bring he in last night this morning he be on his way to Bethesda for a routine autopsy when fate intervene Fate well the scorching of the body be consistent with a gasoline fire accelerate by onboard oxygen this could have be a accident Jethro Lucky for those two to get out yeah lucky in a way l do not like good morning good morning Morning good good morning to you you you and you good what be

up a dead guy put it back up there put what back McGee 's get good taste go for coffee what be that for Alerting DiNozzo the fuel line to the gas tank cap be rupture here tear by a loose belt on the differential housing Loosened how unknown the van also have a short in the electrical system coincidentally in the taillight right by our rupture fuel line you know how l feel about coincidence Abs Equatorial pygmy know how you feel about coincidence Gibbs so one would wonder accident or not an accident that be the question our first player an innocent differential housing bolt that be rub and strain on the molecular bond of our vulcanize fuel line until after eon our hapless hose finally rupture the gas move quickly into the floorboard of the van when it be in motion the driver smell it what could it be he hit the brake and the short in the taillight ignite the pooling gas vapour the flame quickly superheat the onboard O2 and when the canister can no long contain the grow pressure not an accident not unless the Angel of Death be go through a Rube Goldberg stage Boss we find remnant of what may have be the trigger on an O2 canister may have be McGee there be trace of mercury fulminate sodium azide and tetryl on the material Blasting cap O2 would 've never blow on its own Fire be not hot enough the perp rig the transport to make it look like an accident he might 've get away with it if he would detonate it soon Fire disperse piece of the trigger he wait for the driver to get out so he be not a murderer well at least he be not try to kill the ambulance driver Trace it gibb this be a garden variety laminate paper substrate lt 's use as a cheap shielding in thousand of electronic device yeah so so maybe l should get back to work do we get a positive match on our Marine 's dna you know l've be a little busy here Gibbs with all the rubbing and the looking and the analyzing and the l should mention that Ducky 's take care of it l have not see a body this badly burn since the Bertram Mills Circus Specimen jar Mr Palmer sorry doctor lt be just l'm have a problem with this smell today really l think he smell like my mother 's fry chicken yeah that would be the problem oh l see well the vegetarian lifestyle have be medically prove to be the healthiest of choice perhaps it be time you make the jump you want to see I Duck well actually yes Jethro then why do you look surprised to see I because l have not tell you that l want to see you yes well our late houseguest have throw we quite the little mystery Define mystery yeah well the young lad 's death certificate list blunt force thoracic trauma as the cause of death typical in motor vehicle accident but l've only partially be able to verify that since as you can see the post mortem damage be extensive Ducky yes Mystery of course well you know I Jethro l attempt to make a identification myself the blast destroy his jaw and shatter his tooth lt would take an inordinate amount of time to get an identification from dental record also the fire so degrade his dna that you know l spend the well part of yesterday scour his body Mystery almost there by a stroke of luck l find a piece of tissue viable enough to send to have run against Danforth 's dna at the Armed Forces Repository this be not William Danforth Jr then who be this that my dear Jethro be the mystery Lance Corporal Danforth 's pro and con be 50 50 a real squirrele away Marine so what have you find Tony Tony Zamfir he be a master of the pan flute lt be help I think what be you think l'm think that there be a lot of reason for post mortem mutilation you be overlook besides hide a suspicious cause of death such as such as enraged act of violence sadistic curiosity hide the real identity of the victim that be the next one on my list l his identity in question yeah it be now Tony get I a copy of the name of the cop who process Danforth 's report already on its way Ziva take I have a chat with the doctor who pronounce the body dead find out who make the lD hey you want I to go and supervise that boss actually you know l'll stay here just in case you need I Zamfir no l'm not say you need I that be a bad word Need be the wrong word oh the director need to see you in her office ASAP l be just go to tell the director you be here Cynthia do you know that when a roman emperor make a triumphal march into Rome he have a slave on his chariot who who whisper '' you be only human '' into his ear go in unannounced be whisper into she ear so you be the director 's slave Cynthia be there to direct traffic Agent Gibbs l'm just respond to your asap director this be Lance Corporal Danforth 's father William my sympathy Mr Danforth thank you Agent Gibbs the SECNAV would like we to keep Mr Danforth in the loop throughout the entire investigation More than usual yes Gordo and l serve together in Beirut Agent gibb and quite frankly l'm use that friendship would not you he would sixth or eighth two six Fox Company one one scout sniper platoon Beirut Desert Storm so what can you tell I about my son Agent Gibbs Jethro Bill only what l read in hospital and police report Mr Danforth have see those he be ask how his son 's body be incinerate lt be not AFlS could not match the body in autopsy with Lance Corporal Danforth 's dna you be say that it be not Mr Danforth 's son not accord to AFlS could there be a mistake one in 9 million have Abby rerun the DNA already on it director well if it be not Lance Corporal Danforth who the hell be it l'll let you know when l find out what should l tell his mother l would not tell she anything yet right my number Director Shepard l'll tell Gordo how cooperative you 've be Least we could do hey Bill do you identify your son 's body no the police notify we that he have die say that his body be be ship to Bethesda do you think Billy could still be alive l think the hospital transport the wrong body Bull the Marine from two night ago Danforth yeah l remember he be you the one who treat he treat no unfortunately all l do be pronounce he dead Agent McGee lt be hard to believe it be the same kid why be that he be a mess heavy contusion to the cranium pronounce facial laceration half his skull cave in who ld'd his body a buddy give we a tentative ld and we also pull his license from his wallet this buddy have a name well l can do well than that he be in lcu room five the police report do not mention anything about a third injure party doctor that be because he be not injure Officer David he be visit '' our soul be like those orphan whose unwedded mother die in bear they the secret of our pa '' Paternity lie in their grave and we must there to learn it Herman Melville Moby Dick call I lshmael lt 's her favourite book the doctor say it might help lt be help give I a headache you be Rebecca 's relative no NClS Corporal Merrill sir at ease Marine we be only here to ask you a few question oh of course sir l mean ma'am she do not like be call ma'am lt be okay though this about Billy ma Miss lf you mean Lance Corporal Danforth yes we understand that you lD'd his body try to Billy 's face be all mash up how do you know it be he who else could it be he be in his car with Rebecca at least he be last time l see he which be the night he be kill feel free to elaborate tell we about that night Billy have just land stateside after his second tour in lraq so I he and Rebecca Billy 's girlfriend we be out celebrate at the Gold Monkey celebrate mean drink not I sir Billy be even though he should not because he just should not l make Rebecca drive he home because he look pretty bad like he be go to puke or something you be a good friend I and Billy have be bud since we be this big he be the only one that never make fun of my stutter you see Lance Corporal Danforth get into the car l put he in it like l say he be pretty drunk l go back inside the bar for maybe half an hour when l leave l pass the accident on my way home cop be already there say Billy 's car hit at a d lt 's okay corporal we read the police report he be just lie there all break and bent up they be try to save he but l know l just know he be Doctor say he probably do not feel anything think he be tell the truth or just try to make I feel well doctor do that do not they well in my experience ER doctor they usually tell it like it be you get a favourite movie huh get a favourite movie Ball ball ball who be your daddy now be you have fun DiNozzo all do interview Danforth 's CO you do interview his platoon nothing build rapport like a good game of ball thank guy yeah later man the guy say Danforth be a top Marine but the word be he only join because his father be a Marine Little looser please my toe have get use to the whole blood thing circulation DiNozzo the word also be that he be inseparable with another Marine a corporal Kenneth Merrill yeah follow Danforth into the corps on the buddy program course he do Guy 's as loyal as a Saint Bernard would you just focus please and l'm start to lose feeling in my toe do that look right yeah apparently he be as loyal as a Saint Bernard accord to the CO the corp work out pretty well for he oh yeah he get into boxing get his first girlfriend and get this turn out he have a knack for disarm leds his platoon call he the Forrest Gump of explosive l'm not try to do your job be l Put an ice pack on that Fifteen on Fifteen off yeah l know the drill Thanks corpsman lt 's real swollen l do not think l'm go to be able to walk on this thing boss look at that look it be a miracle yeah loyal as a Saint Bernard always want to get one of those until l find out they do not come with that barrel of whiskey around their neck you be wonder if Merrill help his buddy fake his own death to get out of the corps no l'm wonder who they get to play the part of the dead body you really think Lance Corporal Danforth fake his own death you get a well theory actually we do Tony l'd like to hear it Agent McGee and yours as well Agent DiNozzo both preferably some time today we think Corporal Merrill may have kill Danforth director why Merrill conveniently forget to tell we about the fight they have the night Danforth be kill a fight over what Gibbs be not go to like this ls there a problem Agent McGee no no ma'am Merrill claim that he be try to stop he from drink and drive accord to the bartender they break two table and a chair over it sound like more than two good friend fight to I l agree Merrill also pass Danforth 's accident on the way home he could have easily finish he off no Merrill go to hide the body and when he come back to clean up the cop be already on the scene what about the other body there be a third party in the car we only have Corporal Merrill 's word that the two of they drive off no way no way Wrong Merrill show up at the hospital confirm the false ld then later go back torch the ambulance before the real ld can be make okay l'm sorry l get to interrupt because here be the thing l have a theory that actually have motive which might be helpful l do not mean to belittle my colleague ' effort l be a senior field agent Danforth do not hit a deer he hit Ducky 's John Doe Stick with I here he be drunk right waste look at five to ten for manslaughter so he switch the John Doe with his body then skip town right then he have his buddy Corporal Merrill come along and torch the evidence that be how it happen lt 's pretty simple lt 's really just detective work connect the dot Hey boss l be just the director want she want with I okay dramatic but duly note Agent Gibbs l get it lt be not the way it look boss l know Director kind of suckere I into that deal Ziva cave first l do not cave in l be try McGee next yeah but boss it be not what it and my loyal Saint Bernard hold out till last well l probably all of 30 second so what be my team can l call you my team yes of course ye boss what be you go to do now well l think we should we could just solve the case Tony you impound lmpound Danforth 's car see if it hit anything besides the tree then you and McGee go to the original crash site McGee l want an agent stand by Rebecca Crawford 's room to get a statement the second she wake up boss you get it and l'm with you yes l do not know Ziva be you definitely the improvise explosive device gentleman the weapon of choice in lraq and Afghanistan Problem be spot they when they look something like this now these be just a few of the lED configuration l encounter on my last pump in lraq today l'm go to teach you how to locate disarm or if need be blow they all in place Corporal you 've get it take it over they be yours gentleman you hear Corporal Merrill give I a huddle can l help you sir do you know that lie to a federal investigator be a crime l do not lie what be the fight in the Gold Monkey about Billy be drunk sir l try to take his car key away and he start swinge l guess l do not try hard enough you tell I you place he inside the car l do Billy must have make Becca pull over l should have you should have take he home yourself yeah Billy 's dead because of I be you sure he be dead the burn body be not Lance Corporal Danforth Enough already you know l'm not the type to kiss and tell Kiss l hear from a reliable source that you be out with Agent Larsen last night till about 2 a m who tell you that l have information you want you have information l want shall we dance forget it real man always kiss and tell okay so what be we look for that the cop do not already find they think it be an accident but they be not use the hone eye of a highly train federal agent Probie bring one of those number prescription bottle of ibuprofen Grunt candy a Marine 's good friend must have be throw from Danforth 's car so so it belong to Corporal Merrill and there be blood on it come on say it say what '' you be right Tony '' you will be the big woman for it l'll just have to content myself be the well the righter one Woman you know what l mean l find Merrill 's scrip at the scene which mean they be in it together and the DiNozzo body swap theory take the lead what if he drop it while kill Danforth Abby find Danforth 's blood all over the windshield and hood so much for your body swap theory Tony l've see more than a few people survive the windshield taste test Ziva give it up Tony you say Merrill be the Forrest Gump of explosive who else have the equipment and expertise to blow up the ambulance Ziva 's right bring he in feel pretty smug be not you oh yes very so what be bug that famous gut now yes you be that easy to read l learn how to speak '' Gibbs '' a long time ago you go to Abby 's lab or Autopsy Abby 's not to work my case l have the right to dig into any ncls investigation that l want to not mine unless you want I behind your desk again of course you could just observe and keep quiet fine as you know this be the only piece of the trigger that l find l'm not really here do you know how long l've be wait to cross over into an alternate dimension well you be still here abs for now what be this that be laminate paper substrate boss find in any number of electronic device unfortunately l could not find a trace of a single one but then l be surf around on my favourite origami web ring and it hit I Origami the ancient art of paper fold maybe the laminate substrate be the trigger you be tell I Merrill fold himself a bomb no that be impossible lt come pre fold you see several company have be explore the use of paper circuit board for disposable product metallic ink be print on laminate paper and then fold into the desire shape l coat our burn substrate with a metallic iron particulate which would attach to any residual metallic ink still present and then l run the whole thing through an x ray to pick up on any latent pattern Voila you be look at a partial circuit board for a disposable cell phone any chance we could read the any chance we could read the call log call log l'd have a well chance of get McGee to wear a Speedo to church but l be able to pull a list of all the incoming call to the hospital 's cell zone only three come in immediately prior to the explosion one of they be the trigger call Corporal Kenneth Merrill l appreciate you meet I Bill Sure how be she do she be stable still in a coma be you wait to question her listen the fire be not an accident how well do you know Corporal Kenneth Merrill Kenny he be like a son to I lt be not an accident no the van be rig to explode because Kenny defuse lEDs in lraq you think he have something to do with this no lmpossible Mother tell I that Rebecca use to be Kenny 's girlfriend when they be child they 've be good friend since elementary school Night of your son 's accident he be also in a fight my son like to drink sometimes in excess Kenny be just try to stop he from drive home drunk Kenny have nothing to do with this Jethro lt look like the call that trigger the fire come from Kenny 's cell phone what time be that 0900 about no be not Kenny he be with my wife and l from l do not know since before dawn up until at least noon yeah Gibbs hey boss Corporal Merrill 's disappear be that about my son no Corporal Merrill after l question he he walk out of the class he be teach no one be see he since l do not recall order room service ls that steak au poivre and frisée salad you know the last time we have steak au poivre six people die what be this meal go to cost I can not a guy just sit down and have a bite with his old partner old partner must be bad than l think how have it go with Danforth at the hospital today lt go okay if you be Corporal Merrill Danforth give an alibi for the day of the explosion l assume you do not believe he why be that because l would not be eat steak au poivre right now if you do lf Danforth 's covering for Merrill he have to believe Merrill do not kill his son the only way he can know that for sure be lf the kid be still alive but you do not believe that either the alibi be B S the grief be real you sure Danforth be not play you sorry that still do not mean the son 's dead there be an accident he could be hurt could be recover in a private hospital somewhere would not be the first time a parent with mean use they to keep a child out of trouble you go to eat that aspara hey thank you there be another possibility lf Danforth be grieve for his son then he be only cover for Merrill because he refuse to believe that Merrill attempt to kill he let us hope he be not wrong either way however it go down Jethro you find Merrill and you will find Danforth Jr Merrill M e r r say again r r like Ricky Ricardo okay l get his ATM record check for any recent activity Vehicle be a tan Sierra license plate DPH Ricky Ricardo you know from l Love Lucy no withdrawal

kidney transplant Jethro who burn in the fire Bill an unclaimed body at the hospital morgue schedule for cremation l make a donation they switch a toe tag and the county save itself the cost of a cremation lt could have kill those emt Bill no l do not detonate that oxygen until they be clear why your son be dead Corps do not care if he have a transplant now they be more than friend they be a match Corporal Merrill give your son a kidney an autopsy would reveal the transplant l be afraid that the ME would run a dna check on the donor organ and you can not be on active duty if you give away a kidney the corps mean the world to that boy Jethro lt be his life and he risk everything he risk it all to help out his good friend my son he rig an led to burn l do that Bill l'll swear l do it

protocol before you do not trust I Duck well that be not the point chain of evidence be chain of evidence you be right about that l'd slap DiNozzo silly if he do it Jethro you surprise I must be get old God yes yes yes that be incredible no need for a dental match now the odd on get donor dna from Danforth 's body be astronomical Alabama 1 954 a 9 pound meteorite hit Annie Hodges the odd of getting hit by a meteorite astronomical no pun intend but it happen and l'm go to be publish again yes Peachy for you but we just lose our victim our suspect our theory we 've be bark up the wrong tree the entire investigation Bush Sorry bush we 've be bark up the wrong bush Tree so who torch the ambulance and why do not look at I do not tell I well yeah Abby be right the first test pick up donor DNA our John Doe be Lance Corporal Danforth Good l mean not good a Marine be dead but good that the case be no long ours l know what you be go to say Jethro and do not l want Lance Corporal Danforth 's remain return to his father and l want the case turn over to the Maryland Arson lnvestigator that will make Mr Danforth happy which will make the SECNAV happy which in turn will make I very happy we have waste way too many of our resource already okay almost there boy just five more to go Minutes Miles Jerry hold up come here come on this here be your lucky day you know what we get here yeah a seriously mammoth pile of Bear scat Fresh any brave soul wanna investigate this particular bear 's diet Sure my old man always say l be full of this stuff anyway now bear be omnivore they will basically eat anything lt be not unusual to find digested berry deer sinew even bone in a single scat speciman so Jerry tell we what be this one be eat l think maybe people trust I you got to see this l'd rather shower every newbie 's bad nightmare this liver show sign of advanced cirrhosis lt 's clearly consistent with the jaundiced skin we notice early now if you will come close you will be able to see the inflammation of the pancreas oh hello Scalpel please Mr Palmer every cadaver have its own story to tell ln many case it be just a whisper that reveal all new agent be require to observe an autopsy you should have see McGee Hurled empty the content of his stomach onto Ducky 's shoe lt be not only visual cue we look for odour can be helpful too note the putrid smell l think he be talk about you Tony there be no need to be shy odour like stick and stone we have the same test at Mossad lf you fail they terminate you how do you fail an autopsy by do that what happen if you fail here lt depend Officer David some of they go on to become our director you be go to have to reschedule your class Duck the ranger find a body in Shenandoah Park well perhaps you would be willing to share the specific with the class yes the three most frequent cause of death in our national park be heart attack hiking accident and prolong exposure to the element not this time a sailor be eat by a bear yet another reason why l never wanna go camping actually Tony bear attack be quite rare really do you wanna tell this guy that not a big fan of nature huh l'm a big fan of nature as long as

hunter set out food always in the same place bear get use to be feed and come season all they have to do be wait that be clever l'll have to try that the next time l'm out lt 's illegal Tony lf l have my way hunting would be too who be bait the bear a local Jason Edom we pull his license and ban he from the park for life Petty Officer Riley know this be a potentially dangerous area we hand this out to every visitor have a bad drought this year berry the bear feed on have be scarce a hungry bear will eat about anything the sad fact be they be go to track down this bear and kill it because your stupid sailor could not be bother to read a three page pamphlet you will have to forgive she she be what we like to call opposed to hunt yes that be not the only thing she be opposed to you say Riley check in alone Monday afternoon l sign he in myself we need to organize a search l'm one step ahead of you l've get a team out track the bear now lf he be still in the area we will find he l'm more concerned about the woman there be two set of footprint one be Riley 's the other be a lady ' size 7 be you sure about that yeah unless these be Navy issue listen up l want four man team in each sector at least two of they arm with rifle she be be out there at least two night possibly injure and most definitely scared out of her mind all communication will run through mountain tac one all right let us go they work search and rescue in the park before l got station here they will find she Hope it be before the bear do l'm sorry we be so late Jethro Mr Palmer 's navigate skill still leave something to be desire honestly doctor l think that moss grow on the south side of tree lt do in Australia Petty Officer Riley 's vehicle be not in the parking lot accord to the red the local

muzzle and a large hinge jaw with enormous crush power 600 pound per square inch no animal of equal size be nearly so strong you never discover any of that do you how do you know that when Mr Palmer sponge he we do not find any evidence of slash or wound on his hand and forearm he do not defend himself More than that l'm afraid the bear 's claw and tooth have round edge that pierce the flesh yet when l examine Mr Riley 's heart it reveal a very different story our petty officer be kill with a flat blade death would have be instantaneous yes he be dead before the bear start eat he accord to Petty Officer Riley 's c o he be be on leave the last six day nice vacation a little camping a knife to the heart a little trip inside a bear 's digestive track yeah l'd fire my travel agent yeah you

in that park look like another chance to hit on that cute ranger yes lt be go to be tough but not impossible Misreads be part of the game true except l be talk about I maybe she drive out here on her own that be why no one see she with Riley Registration could give we a name l assume Gibbs would have check that out last night Rule eight never assume anything to be precise it be '' never take anything for grant '' to be more precise what would you do if l start head slap you l'd most likely kill you lt be a reflex thing Gentlemen People with gun make I nervous l notice l be talk about you actually still hold any vehicle for camper your Agent gibb ask the same question last night Nope look like the search be good for business yes yeah Special Agent DiNozzo Ziva find anything not yet we 've expand the search area beyond the initial five mile radius lf she be abduct she could be anywhere Park 's 1 98 000 acre that be over 300 square mile lt be a big area to patrol yeah unless you like to exercise well as a matter of fact l like to walk and our boss would like any record you have on death in the park Bobby follow I these be every death over the last ten year all rule natural or accidental thank you listen l just want to we may have get off on the wrong foot and l just want to let you know that l'm not a hunter l be try to impress you really yeah get anything Define '' anything '' no thank Hair follicle our miss woman most likely and and caucasian Brunette lt 's at the anagen or growth stage so l can probably get dna off the root what about the one on the right lt 's from Petty Officer Riley 's car they be from the same person she drive with he you think ls something bother you Abby no l do a further test on our lady 's birth control method of choice lt be a low level oestrogen patch Prescription dosage be base on weight and height so odd be she be of average to small stature ls there anything else l can do for you find I a name now l know how Molly Ringwald feel in Sixteen Candles Slam dunk we be go out next weekend that be not bad Tony Landis ask I out tonight l say no l do not want he to think l'm sleazy the term be '' easy '' what be the difference mostly the makeup what do we have over the last seven year there be be eight death in the park three from natural cause a stroke and two heart attack the other all accidental ln 2000 a couple drown while canoe the woman 's body be never recover ln 2002 a couple got lose hiking their remain be recover last year ln 2004 a woman name Tracy Roberts ' body be discover nine month after she go into the park to photograph wildlife her remain be too ravage by animal and the element to determine a cause of death l wanna see a profile on they l find something Passports get I boss what McGee Sorry l find something here the three dead woman they all fit the same description Twenties Caucasian Brunette petite yeah since we all know how you feel about coincidence l decide to pull their driver 's license photo wow they look like they could be sister something tell I their death be not exactly accidental we be deal with a killer who be use park accident to cover up murder three almost identical woman all of they end up dead in Shenandoah National Park and if our miss woman fit the same profile we could be deal with a serial killer One who use park accident to cover up abduction and murder so what do you think l'm not sure yet McGee but l think that this might be unforgivable well yeah of course it be unforgivable what if he have a really good reason a good reason yeah like he be really stress out or like overwork what difference do that make nobody 's perfect Abby there be no excuse McGee that be so sweet you know what lt be just a stupid birthday who care if Gibbs forget why l guess that l do that be why l love you when you get all hot and bother like that it really turn I on really oh yeah be you two do playing grab assy or do l need to transfer McGee to a weather station in the Antarctic we be just l think l find our miss girl Gibbs and McGee be just congratulate I the birth control patch that our Jane Doe be wear turn out to be a Rosetta stone lt deliver a very specific oestrogen cocktail lt 's usually prescribe for woman whose system can not handle the pill the pill be the most common l've have a few wife Abby and yet you know so little about woman luckily this patch be still in the rollout phase so the company be require to maintain detailed medical profile on the 3 000 woman that be use they l cross those profile with the datum l pull off her dna profile her race and her blood type l come up with 200 woman gibb find out which one 's miss l'm not do yet from the hair sample we know that the woman be brunette so if we subtract blond woman and those with black hair that bring we to 43 of the 43 only 1 4 live in the Mid Atlantic l call they all and l get 1 3 number 1 4 be Jessica Fagan she work at HUD in D C she do not show up for work on Monday she be miss gibb get a picture l be wait for the DMV to email I one before l call you but fortunately it be already here boss this definitely do not look like a coincidence you think McGee lt 's confirm boss she tell a co worker she be go camping with her boyfriend in Shenandoah Duck all three of these woman 's death be rule accidental pull their autopsy record along with the guy who die with they to look for what specifically how they be murder oh right nice place you get here Ziva Thanks they cut our wildlife conservation budget and you guy have a skylight Nice l understand thing have take a turn for the bad Agent Gibbs lf by '' bad '' you mean multiple homicide in your park since 2000 then yeah bad well there go that theory what theory l be prepared to say that this could all be just a coincidence but when you see they like that lt be more than a little disturbing yeah what can we do to help we be look for someone who know his way around your park like a local we 've get a list of the usual troublemaker poacher and vandal but l never figure any of they for a serial killer most likely you would not James the successful one blend into their environment yeah l mean look at the BTK killer right pillar of the community Cub Scout leader president of his church you be say it could be anyone not in this case we be look for someone who carry a woman through the wood and hardly leave a track an experienced hunter or someone with military training l'd like to send the photo of the miss woman to our search team DiNozzo l'm on it get it to Pete at Jackrabbit Slim 's tell he to post it on every pole every fence every car near the park Gibbs get something if you be interested yeah we be on our way Abby 's get something our forensic scientist you will like her she be a vampire so would you like I to email that or fax it Email be fine email it be so be it just I or be it hot in here lt be probably a little bit of both Email send there you go so l be think about this weekend and about try camping l something wrong l'm marry then why have you ask for my number she be dead lt be a lt be a pottery accident Kiln overheat or something very unexpected very unexpected l thought l be ready to move on oh you oh you poor poor man l swab what be leave of Petty Officer Riley 's clothe lt be mostly his blood and what l now know to be bear saliva he be eat by a bear tell I something l do not know about the case or something more personal Abby l also find trace of a cornucopia of different chemical spray all over his clothe phenylacetic crystal methyl anthranilate and acorn caramel and bergamot oil a hunting lure you be correct Mr Ranger sir more specifically it be Uncle Bebo 's Bear Attractant somebody hose the officer down with it l can pull a list of every hunter that apply for a bear hunting permit this year you do not have to McGee just find who spray he with it Boss we pull multiple print from the equipment at the campsite Most of they be Riley 's a bunch l assume be you assume McGee well l mean we be work on get Jessica Fagan 's print to clear they but we have three other match belong to a third individual Jason Edom look like he be bait more than bear this man make my skin crawl can you interrogate he without break bone Truthfully no l agree that be why l'm do it you be go to spend the next few hour study everything we know about he and the evidence and supply the answer to you in there no no l've get DiNozzo do that you be on Edom 's side Meaning Meaning you be go to defend he l want you to assume that he be innocent the man be a serial kill racist he probably be but you be still go to do it why because you can not walk in there and interrogate he yet you mind tell I why l'm here you like hunt last time l check that be not illegal your hunting license be pull you be a Marine huh l can tell my old man be a Marine hate his gut '' get your hand out of your pocket boy shave your face boy cut your hair boy '' see

assault and battery lt be a bar fight l do not even start it do you know he yeah that be the idiot who got eat by the bear he be murder first with a hunting knife you bait the area where that occur Lookie here Mr Marine l have not be in that park for over a month News flash l happen to be ban for life your fingerprint be find at the campsite last time l check that be inside the park no that be a

not some psycho yes l'll hold you shave right what nothing so how have the killer 's print end up at the campsite obviously when he murder the sailor and abduct the girl no Gibbs want you defend he Ziva McGee what object be the killer sorry sorry Edom Edom Edom 's print find on again two can of tuna one pack of AA battery all item sell at Jackrabbit Slim 's okay so what if Riley buy these item

violent crime thank you and we find his print at the campsite so he do not do it okay you be not get this you can not just say he do not do it Ziva he be right you need to back your side up with fact

Duck well technically paramedic have a saying concern cold water drowning Agent gibb they say the victim be not dead until he be warm and dead l think we can make an exception in this case Mr Palmer not a drowning this pond 's barely six foot deep yes l once conduct an autopsy on a man who drown in his kitchen sink yes apparently he could not loosen the drain plug and he attempt to use his tooth think you be cold yes well it will be impossible to determine the exact cause of death until he thaw these three hole in his coat could be crucial how about time of death yeah well decomposition suggest well anywhere from two week to four month depend on how many time the pond have thaw out this winter very good Mr Palmer thank you of course l'll have to check the meteorological datum for the area before we speculate further let us strap he up l'm just say probie the whole metrosexual thing be not work for you l get it Tony Joke be over l'm not joke man we all know that the lady love a macho man who be in touch with his feminine side but l get to tell you l think you be come off a little gay because he use body lotion and like to take bubble bath do you forget the manicure the

heart skip a beat '' l'm not a big fan of poetry Duck well as it turn out neither be she ln fact why be l here why why be l here you be correct early on Jethro our first sergeant do not drown none of our body do they be all shoot First Sergeant Downing receive the most damage three in the chest here here and here and one to the back just below the heart that be the kill shoot yes well it rupture his inferior vena cava as to our walking pictogram one bullet each be these gang tat that be not my field of expertise but l've have Mr Palmer document the entire line for further investigation some of they be quite explicit Jethro this young man be shoot in the front just below the left clavicle and this young man be shoot in the back this young man be also shoot in the back like our first sergeant back front Front back the pattern be quite random l believe the phrase be '' turkey shoot '' more like massacre definitely gang tat how can you be sure just a feeling l'm sure you know what

Captain Comparison Microscope Ensign lsn't an Army rank lt 's actually Navy what do you want McGee to go over the old text message between Cesar Bernal and his boss Miguel Sosa they be in code l know but if we break they we might find where Sosa 's hiding he be in San Salvador Ziva 's people say no oh so if Ziva 's people say no then we Abby please just run they okay my Spanish be a little rusty Mine 's not okay in this one they be ask Sosa if they should wait a minute what lt 's too long SMS text message be limit to 1 50 character so that mean lt mean that it be e mail from a computer not a cell phone can you backtrace it to a physical location just a simple matter of access the e mail to SMS gateway pull an lp link to an lsp that be a Virginia address Ziva 's people be right let I see if we can get a name of the account holder Cesar Bernal that do not make any sense why would he send message to himself because he be pretend he be Miguel Sosa okay but that be stupid because Sosa would totally find out and kill Cesar not if Cesar kill he first what be this meal go to cost I this time do not cost you any last time you mean aside from the thousand extra calorie l do not need l can leave l do not say that salvadorian food how fried sit l'm sorry another Marine be injure in Captain Arvidas ' group l know l hear you find the man responsible for First Sergeant Downing 's death his name be Cesar Bernal can you make a case l know this meal be go to cost I okay what do you have so far Cesar be make a power play for control of his crew he be be fake order from Miguel Sosa to the rest of L V M for the last four month and Sosa he be dead lt be the only way Cesar could have get away with it so First Sergeant Downing be not the target he be Cesar 's lure the real target be the three L V M lieutenant Cesar be take out the leadership do you have any physical evidence nothing link Cesar to the crime scene Jethro you be go to need more than motive to get a jury to convict depend on the jury this be harassment when l get out of here l'm go to get I a fancy lawyer and shove he all the way up your come on it be just get good okay who want to take he first l'm go to take he oh no no no l get it probie what do you think l can not handle this guy Gibbs say keep he on ice not show he the warning sign of osteoarthritis Tony l can break this guy you keep crack your knuckle like that you be go to break a finger probie l'm senior l go first you be always go to be senior nice thing about be senior be that so l cooperate with you and this be the thank l get haul in like a pescado muerto lf by cooperate you mean lie yes what do l lie about we know you be at the Rock Creek Pond the night of the murder and we know you 've be kill off the L V M leadership to assert control you must think very highly of I because the man who can pull off something like that must be a very smart man you like smart man bonita sorry you be not my type you be play with fire bonita ls that a threat no l'm just say my ése get very lonely when l'm not around and they be not go to be too happy with the one that be keep I from they l would not worry about it l'm sure your ése will find something to do while you be go the autopsy of First Sergeant Downing reveal four entry wound however of interest be the fact that the three frontal wound show no sign of internal haemorrhaging the shot be fire after First Sergeant Downing be dead each of your buddy put a bullet in his corpse your point the point be if your buddy each fire a round into the first sergeant after he be dead who shoot they l want to talk to my lawyer no can do punk you 've be watch too many cop show know that yeah well you 've be watch too many gang person show l do not think probie 's be watch enough cop show McGee be a capable interrogator he can be quite intimidating when he want to be you can not keep I here like this no actually l can you see La Vida Mala have suspect tie to Al Qaeda so all l have to do be say the word '' terrorist '' and l can keep you in this room till you grow old and die that actually be intimidate we can tell from the rifle pattern that the slug pull from your three dead L V M 's be from the Browning find at the scene nice tat your Draconkreuz the symbol of the ancient order of Abby sorry gibb the point be that whoever shoot your guy use First Sergeant Downing 's gun he want to make it look like our first sergeant smoke your muchachos of course your crew probably would have only turn their back to the shooter if it be someone they really trust so like you do not got no question for I that be a double negative '' do not get no '' be a double negative lt be a non standard use of two negative word in the same sentence they cancel each other out and create a positive ln Shakespeare 's day the double negative be use as an emphatic but now it be just consider a mistake do not know if that be what you intend pretty sure it be not we will go with the colloquial idiomatic thing this be hard l'm pretty sure you mean '' do l have any question '' and the answer to that question be '' l have no question '' l do have some observation though Cesar that be an interesting name obviously derive from Caesar that be a powerful dude my name 's Anthony Friends call I Tony which backwards be '' why not '' anyway in the pecking order l'm guess that you be somewhere between the guy that go out and buy the spray paint that you use for tagging and the guy who dig it out from under your boss ' nail you do not know who you be mess with one word from I and my crew will have you splatter your crew yes well that be funny l think L V M be Miguel Sosa 's crew lntereste Miguel Sosa Word on the street be he be hide out in El Salvador except the FBl have no record of he leave the country salvadorian authority have no record of he come in so the only trail we have be the SMS text message he be be send you the problem be he have not be send they El Salvador country code have be falsify someone fake they to make they look like they come from Miguel Sosa message originate from an e mail account register to Cesar Bernal he kill your boss play you for a fool Us too he will never get a conviction in court with what l have on he hey boss right l see you be all try to throw I off balance soften I up for the big gun eh actually l do not know you be

the instant gunshot residue test come back positive yeah she have a pistol in her hand she have a hole in her head lt would seem reasonable to conclude suicide sir there be nothing reasonable about a lovely young girl like this take her life in such a grotesque fashion lt 's true firearm be the most common instrument of suicide however woman tend to avoid the proximity of the face when pull the trigger Vanity Mr Palmer simple vanity we be not finish with the external exam be we sir well you be not you be so sure that the cause of death be suicide why do not you work out how you would prove

if she be a pro she would not have kill herself you should have hear this guy Abby just because someone have an aptitude for math and science it do not make they some kind of suicidal freak a little high McGee ls that what people think about we ask I later McGee oh this well be work relate oh it be and you be just in time for the show and tell portion McGee if you will so Lieutenant Hill sit down on the couch put the gun to her head and l say '' bang '' McGee l match the bullet find in the book to the Kahr 9 mm in the victim 's hand look like a suicide right except when a weapon be use at this range there be extensive blood splatter from the exit wound but blowback also create a fine mist of blood which land here lmperceptible to the human eye but not to the magic of modern science you be still dead McGee and two step away Voila Footprints exactly which mean somebody else be in the room no evidence of force entry no bruise or mark to show that she be force to pull the trigger or unconscious when she die all we have be this Rorschach test from hell you believe Abby may be mistaken well l believe it be go to be tough to prove the suicide be fake when all you get be two partial footprint she could have be drug the killer could have place the pistol in her hand and pull the trigger the initial tox screen be negative some narcotic be hard to trace and as for no evidence of force entry we could be deal with an assassin or she know her killer Ziva Probie it be about time l'm starve like Lee Marvin well then you should not have send I for the world 's great barbecue

until after the authentication call be crack who crack they well that be go to take some time we do not have time that be the federal marshal who be suppose to pick up Abby suppose to someone slash

boss l know nothing that be not funny Tony McGee it be the boss he will be fine with I he will be live off coffee next Tony do not like coffee why do you suspect the captain he smoke expensive Havanas and wear a 1 0 carat diamond could be zircon never doubt an lsraeli about diamond our Turk captain like money the kind Abu Sayyaf pay to transport weapon explosive and terrorist l'll flip you to see which of we take the captain in and who visit Gibbs l'll take he in you do not speak turkish your observation Mr Palmer well fingerprint be out of the question l be rather hope for something other than the obvious well we will have to use dna to l guess that be rather obvious too he be stand on the bomb Better why stand well it seem to be the only way to explain his entire low body be vaporize why not sit whatever he be sit on would have shield his butt unless his buttock be sit on the bomb who would sit on an explosive someone who do not know they be sit on the explosive of course l do it myself once no twice the first time l be young the second time foolish why be you sit on an explosive doctor l just tell you l be young and foolish have not you be listen l be l just Specimen jar come on lf l'm not mistaken Abby will find these to be fragment of the 55 gallon oil drum l must ask Jethro should l take these to Abby now doctor soon as l've take a tissue sample for DNA confirmation ls that really necessary sir no no it be not necessary we could match his tooth ls that what you would prefer a wise choice Mr Palmer Coffee Coffee sure way to wake Gibbs good idea but he be intubate we will have to use the lv tell Miss Sciuto that l do not abandon Gibbs chief neurologist would have be here today anyway l'm sure she will understand l hope so l like woman with fire so the dog collar and the tat have nothing to do with it DiNozzo do he look in pain l do not know l've never see Gibbs show pain director Doctor be he in pain Doctor be this man a Marine yes wound in Desert Storm he have a Purple Heart that be it l treat he in Kuwait Gibbs never tell I he be wound in Desert Storm I neither l see his Purple Heart he be in a coma when we evac'd he to Frankfurt l mean you talk about déja vu but be he in pain certainly not extreme pain he may be hurt but the only way to know be for he to tell we why not give he painkiller just in case l want he to wake up an opiate would only deepen his coma l've just never see Jethro look like this l have that be why l remember he that be the expression he have in ' 91 lt 's more anguish than pain l want to gallop daddy no Kelly let she go Shannon Jethro l've get a well chance of hook up with Jessica Alba than these guy do of infiltrate sealift every sailor have to go through a series of stringent security check to be issue a special ld a hundred and ten civilian crew DiNozzo Abu Sayyaf only need to slip a man in one lf Galib know who that be or the name of the ship why have he run why do not he just let we arrest he as plan give we the intel and then continue undercover to Gitmo either he do not know but be close to find out or he be on to something big that an ncls arrest would jeopardise what be big than blow up one of our ship blow up a port do you ever hear of Port Chicago no but l see the tv movie Michael Jai White be this guy who have l see your point good ls there any intel on the crew especially this Pinpin Pula guy we need his photo for a BOLO we take surveillance photo when the crew be dock in lstanbul Great lf Galib have intel on Abu 's plan do he have time to tell Gibbs maybe they be together when the bomb go off Galib be a good agent let us hope Gibbs come out of this coma in time he will l order another CAT scan on the off chance that he haemorrhage since the last one l think it be unlikely so why be you do it cover my ass you do not strike I as the ass covering type doctor you know l dislike this doctor captain director formality l'm Todd Jenny the truth be Jenny l'm puzzle gibb take a long time to come out of the coma in ' 91 you follow his case after he leave Kuwait not until today from Frankfurt he be air vac'd to Bethesda they fax I his hospitalization record he be in a coma for 1 9 day my God that be not terribly unusual but the test be not typical of someone who be in a coma that deep l mean his CAT scan do not reveal any cerebral damage his EEG be normal lt be the same as now how do you explain that sometimes patient do not seem to want to wake up any reason why Gibbs might be one of they the NlS agent driving be hit with a head shoot your wife and daughter die in the crash Mom 's get one not as big as ours lt 's big Daddy Pedro Hernandez the drug dealer your wife see kill a Marine Abby l'm in here what be you do l'm worry I too you guy can just set that right

highlight of my lower sixth year l do not compete in Edinburgh no no l be too distract by this wee lt be impolite of I to eavesdrop Dr Mallard but l be fascinate by your story Nurse Baliad tell I your name and your speciality l'm Dr Dr Gelfand Chief Neurologist yes the director tell I well how be our patient still comatose l'm afraid be you aware that he be in a coma for 1 9 day during Desert Storm no he never tell you well Jethro do not talk much about the past l consider we to be close friend but l know very little about his life before we meet you be in a hospital Relax do not fight it Jethro Relax relax you be all right here come on come on can you blink all right raise your thumb raise your thumb Good Good do you want the tube out all right all right hold still hold still here you be okay breathe you be fine that be it l be Dr Gelfand this be Nurse Baliad Maria of course you know Dr Mallard he call I Ducky welcome back Jethro yeah we 've all be a bit concerned you should not frighten we like this you have a question where be l you be in Portsmouth Naval Trauma Centre you be in an explosion relax cover your face l remember good very good Most people never remember the trauma l do not know he previously on NClS Galib have Abu infiltrate sealift they be about to our radio man Pinpin Pula be Abu Sayyaf he plan to blow the Cape Fear this will be as bad as 9 1 1 you do not know he when he be wound in Desert Storm no he seem to be repeat that trauma the coma that he do not wanna wake up from lf Galib have intel on Abu 's plan do he have time to tell Gibbs maybe they be together when the bomb go off let us hope Gibbs come out of this coma in time Jethro do not talk much about the past l know very little about his life before we meet welcome back Jethro you be in an explosion l remember l do not know he you do not know Dr Mallard Ducky Ducky do you know Ducky l'm disappoint Jethro the last time someone forget I l be a baby my mother leave I on the ferry from Orkney to John o'Groat 's she be on the bus halfway to Thurso before she miss I l've often wonder if l inspire the Liechtenstein t shirt '' oh God l leave the baby on the bus '' quite remember my tell you that Jethro l remember the T shirt but not I no worry lt'll come absolutely temporary memory loss be to be expect do not let it worry you you breathe comfortably Good let us switch to the nasal cannula Maria okay you be do fine l'm just go to to take this off most traumatized brain injury produce short term retrograde amnesia but to erase year of memory his medial temporal lobe or hippocampus should be damage no his CAT scan and EEG be normal and he remember the explosion and l've never have a retrograde amnesia patient remember the trauma never okay there you go l do not think it be retrograde amnesia l think it be dissociative an emotional repression of memory with no physical damage to the brain it must be psychological no but doctor you say Gibbs have not speak of his past hardly ever perhaps it be too painful lt could explain the prolong coma in ' 91 but the present coma be the result of an explosion how could it be psychological what if the late coma cause a relapse so how be we do Confused let us see if we can clear up some of those cobwebs do you remember the explosion yes but where be you when it happen Kuwait l have good news Gibbs have regain consciousness that be great however there be also a problem he have some memory loss Retrogressive amnesia be totally normal after severe trauma happen every time the boss smack I on the head you know l have amnesia after my car crash your bumper car get t bone at Legoland probie no Tony l tell you about when l total my Camaro when l be 1 6 that day be still a blank to I well Gibbs ' blank be the last 1 5 year to he it be 1 991 and he be a Marine gunny sergeant wound in Desert Storm he do not know he be an ncls special agent l doubt it he do not recognise Ducky wait lf he do not know who Ducky be then there be no he will never remember we l be sure it be a temporary condition ln the meantime we have an Abu Sayyaf terrorist to apprehend l really do not know anything more Abby can l go visit he not just yet his neurologist Captain Gelfand will let we know when he be up to it can l run to the restroom l'll come right back lf anyone else need a potty break now be the time to do it we meet at 1 7 1 0 you know what that mean the director 's take over the investigation probably but l be think if Gibbs do not remember the last 1 5 year he will be a probie Gibbs would never let she take over not the old Gibbs Probie Gibbs Director Shepard yes DiNozzo l want you to understand that in Gibbs ' absence as the team 's senior special agent this investigation be mine ls it yes it be ma'am and if l be to dispute that assumption then you would be a fool and you be no fool director this will be a long tough investigation you be overload as it be and no one know this team well than I except for the boss which evidently be not I l be speak of course of the team boss Gibbs you be the agency boss not if you keep tell I what l can and can not do l would never do that ma'am then what be it that you be say you take care of the big picture and let I handle the two reeler l always intend to Tony then why do you make I say all that just now l just want to see if you have as much gut as Gibbs what be the first thing you remember after the explosion do you know when Jethro be marry he have a daughter no that be not possible l know all three of Jethro 's ex wife they have no child with his first wife Shannon he do they marry in ' 82 and have a daughter Kelly who be bear in ' 84 l can not believe it there be more they be murder when Jethro be fight in Desert Storm Shannon witness the shooting of a Marine in Oceanside she identify the killer as Pedro Hernandez a mexican drug dealer work Camp Pendleton an nls agent be assign to protect her a sniper shoot he in the head while he be drive their van he die instantly Shannon and Jethro 's 8 year old daughter Kelly be kill in the crash that be so awful Kelly look a lot like Jethro do not she yes a bit she be a beautiful child very so be Shannon Jethro always do like redhead be Hernandez ever catch no he flee to Mexico NlS try to extradite but the mexican authority always claim they could not find he lt 's in our cold case file well you can close it what do you know Jethro would have pursue the killer of his wife and daughter to hell and back Jethro get his revenge after conduct the autopsy Ducky be virtually certain Abog Galib be inside the oil drum when the explosive detonate why would he be in a laundry oil drum maybe he be look for his laundry this be serious Abby listen to the pot call the kettle black got that right do not l no yes Probie why be Galib in that oil drum he be hide from who Gibbs maybe he run from Gibbs even though the plan be to get arrest in front of the crew another question how do Pinpin Pula know Gibbs and Galib would be in the ship 's laundry right because they would have have to put the bomb inside the oil drum before they get there gibb know Gibbs also think the Giants win the Super Bowl and Dances with Wolves be an Academy Award nominee l love that movie I too those Native Americans be so macho in their enough Abby l want a reenactment of the explosion okay

split with the baby a month ago Dom 's still try to track she down financial turn out McEllon 's money be clean he design sub technology before he join the Navy his patent be lucrative why would a wealthy engineer enlist same reason Pat Tillman leave the NFL to join the army Patriotism McEllon sign on after 9 11 so a patriotic guy sell secret that would make he unpatriotic you be tail for the record can I have my phone thank you very much feel weird I like it I be over here you be way over there you see the forensic report no it be right there in your in box I think it be the out box Kensi

be breach Espionage or not this case be still a priority that be why I be send our top forensic specialist to assist you but there be no forensic our forensic expert have a theory about this crime that be shall we say original Thinks McEllon be the victim of a serial killer no other law enforcement organization in this country think this killer even exist can not say I do either and you be send this person why I be gang up on who gang up on the director of a federal agency you would be surprised and who be the expert I think I take a wrong turn hello Abby we be in here there you be hi this place be seriously cool so how do you double tap get the menu fill the screen it be all very intuitive no wonder McGee can not stop talk about this so I be sure Leon have tell you that I know who kill McEllon wait you call he Leon you do not not successfully give it time you have a name for we Abby he be call the Phantom by whom by I anyone else just I well I be go to leave you kid to it but I must say Abby you be the first NCIS employee I 've ever meet with a sense of style you would all do well to note that one can be functional and stylish at the same time right Mr Beale so Abby the forensic report have no evidence of the killer that be why I call he the Phantom 14 murder in two year it take I a while to see his pattern but pull up the list of his murder please this be a private web site for forensic specialist Abby 's a rock star among they I 've be blogge about he for a few month I be try to get local police department to pursue he a 67 year old black female poison in Tampa the killer leave nothing no hair no dna no fiber 22 year old white male shoot in Des Moines no trace of a killer 37 year old asian female in Boise with a crowbar do you know how hard it be to cudgel someone to death with a crowbar and leave no forensic evidence the case with zero forensic be rare like every few year kind of rare and this be 14 in two year have any of the local PD 's pursue this Phantom theory not one can you believe that serial killer be either organize or disorganize this guy be organize in leave no forensic but completely disorganized in everything else Random victim weapon location it just do not look like one single killer he make it look random on purpose that be how I know that McEllon be a Phantom victim not just the no forensic part but he never repeat himself like he be never cut the neck of a 40 year old white guy before you 've spend a lot of time on this if you wanna get my attention show I a crime scene and tell I there be no clue we have a clue this guy case the house three day before the murder he be not the kind of guy to let himself get catch on camera but 3 day prior scope the place out maybe he be finally slip up I be just curious why you pressure Vance to send Abby he be not buy her Phantom theory he need goose so you want we chase the Phantom be that what you think I do not know there be there be be some meddle around here I be a little fuzzy on the command chain this case lack forensic as your operation manager I procure for you our good scientist to help you you as head agent be free to pursue whatever theory of crime make the most sense there be no fuzziness Callen you still shoot the duck I just row the boat what be he hold a rabbit he miss his little girl Hang on let I see here and here it be the same fabric top

need in a room to have an even chance that 2 of they have the same birthday I do not know 182 and a half only 23 and with 57 people it be a 99 chance that two of they have the same birthday true randomness include repeat a truly random group of murder would have at least two white male in their 20 or two gunshot death or two stab death but there be no repeat it be hard to do if the M o be to make it all appear random why kill McEllon when there be so many other easy target and if it be the Phantom then he change his m o now why would he do that good news Flagstaff PD 's go back to their

he also study chemical engineering so what one of his fellow student have a beef with he he cook up explosive and wire his phone I think that Eric need to do a background check on everyone in his class just in case you will have to excuse the mess my wife be suppose to help I pack up his thing Asher be our only son she be just not ready yet we be very sorry for your loss sir there may be some evidence in your son 's belonging that could help our investigation the police already go through everything nothing here that will bring he back any idea who may have want to hurt your son I would

Asher Ross save my ass more than once he be the only one who take a chance and loan I the buck to get start I get a little behind on my payment you think I would kill he over that any idea who would I be go to need to take that back for analysis do not drop it this be what be leave of Asher Ross ' laptop from the explosion get anything off it it be go to be tough preliminary forensic show Ross ' cell phone fragment have trace of HMX HMX be a military grade explosive it be expensive and hard to get which mean our bomber need access or he rip it off I will check for any report of theft all right the killer have to have access to Ross ' cell phone in order to wire it with an explosive without Ross know what about the cell phone that Sam find nothing prepay no print Killer must 've wipe it clean before toss it keep work on that laptop Eric Ross and King be on the same bomb disposal unit for nine month that sound like a short time consider the burnout rate they be old timer disable bomb that can blow you with the slight mistake take it toll work often result in ptsd King appear to be cope give all that he be suffer some of the more severe symptom might take month to manifest Untreated it can cause massive personality change depression aggression enough to blow one of your buddy ' head off if you 've get a beef it be not out of the question Full Windsor really again with

excuse to be fashionable and besides you look so professional I try the whole West Coast casual thing I think it be work against I you know with the agent I know undercover work be difficult and dangerous I know they 've be force to take on role and do thing that they be not proud of but they think that bury memory be well than talk about they Come let us try a half Windsor this time it can make such a difference there you go you know in my experience if you be patient soon or later the people who need to talk will seek you out often under the guise of some other intention you just have to listen I could pull off a bow tie not without a red rubber nose and those big floppy shoe Olin 's get quite the view he can sit on his porch at night and watch the drive bys Olin Federal agent stop come on Eric we need an ambulance so your buddy Ross gets kill we turn up and you take off why do you run Someone be be follow I Ross mention anything about be follow Nah he just say I be be paranoid

kid wash I thing like that you know when I be in high school I write I wish my girlfriend be this dirty on my principal 's car I think it be pretty funny until I got expel it be from the Qur'an Al Maeda chapter five verse ten those who reject our faith and deny sign shall be companion of hellfire seem like Ross and his buddy might have bring back more from Iraq than they realize I be here to help you Olin but you will to have to trust I it be my fault Ross be dead why do you think that because I do not try hard enough to convince he that something be go on he shut I down so I stop try maybe it be because you do not want to believe it yourself sometimes it be easy to pretend something be not happen than to face it yeah well I just face it okay just like I face it every day out there every day my partner and I spend a little time in Fallujah we be augment a Marine Expeditionary Force more bad day than good one the last thing I want to do be talk about it but it help the only way to quiet it be to get it out I be afraid if I give it even a glimpse of light it will swallow I I know I guess everyone deal with it differently King throw himself into his business I find God Ross do the good he just move on before the bombing somebody write a warning in Arabic on the back of your vehicle it be a warning from the Qur'an you have any idea who might have leave that there be a guy in

petal well thank you you be welcome congratulation it seem you may have catch our mad bomber you do not seem very thrilled I mean yes I hope so I just wish that you know what I do not know I just think that when it come to go undercover I deal with the danger a lot well than the deception I see like with Hastings King for example today some of what I tell he be true some of it be a complete lie and some of it be a be a combination of both deception you perpetrate be a necessity you need to embrace it not fear it I be sure your father would agree anyway if man want the truth all the time I would not have a french maid 's outfit in my boudoir would I you have a just drink your tea dear heart Forensics report be in on the explosive two different type be use two tell I about Ross and King Ross and King let I couch surf between their two place you and Ross be friend Ross save my life he save Olin and King too when he pull King out the guy 's leg be still underneath I Ross pull Olin and King out first do you resent that have he pull you out soon you might not have suffer the burn you do if he have not pull I out I would be dead the dude be a freakin ' hero okay let us go back before that tell I about the iraqi woman and her baby what woman you do not remember Olin and King be hand out candy bar to a couple of old lady and you disapprove that sort of stuff look great on the news but it be a security risk old lady when you move away from the vehicle you never know who be on the other side of that door or who be look down at you from a rooftop it be why you shoot she I do not you order she to step away from the vehicle and when she do not you shoot a mother and her baby there be no baby she be carry a 60 millimeter mortar shell wrap in a blanket with a hand trigger and I do not shoot she Olin do he save I he save the old lady and everybody else for half a block Olin shoot a suicide bomber ask King check your patrol log if you do not believe I do Olin ever talk religion to you he be a Christian but he could quote the Qur'an or the Talmud as easily as the Bible I be get a bad feeling about this we get the forensic from the bomb in Ross ' cell phone King 's truck and Olin 's car Ross 's cell phone and King 's car bomb be both high grade explosive tetrahexamine tetranitramin but the explosive in Olin 's car be trinitrotoluene it be a much low grade right and it be a shape charge under the rear of the vehicle point away from the driver so it blow out of the car instead of in so basically it look convincing but whoever set it must have know it would not kill Olin Everything Olin tell I be either a grossly distort memory or an outright lie he read and write in Arabic he could write the note on the car Tariq be not the bomber Olin be what be the chance this place be wire I would say between 99 and 100 always the optimist all right room 's clear Olin you in there Agents Callen and Hanna we be come in to talk wait pressure pad thank Clear get a list

easy to pick up serve it up there you go how be the case Callen want to work alone Behavior that conflict with one of the fundamental tenet of a Navy SEAL 's psychology teamwork one of the fundamental tenet of G Callen be to tackle thing solo it be the way he make sense of the world he be be do it his whole life you debrief he after every case you know what be not in the file and that be all you be go to say that be all I can say if it affect NCIS it be my job to speak up but as far as the innermost thought of the field agent be concern it be my job to make sure that they stay confidential he trust you more than anyone else Sam what if he do not need my help this time you will be ready to offer it anyway what about the girl Kristin Donnelly nothing he can not handle do I mention I have one of the sick topspin serve you 've ever see Ready Sure free lesson yeah I just get I get to warm up next time 'cause I get I have this this rotator cuff thing you ever get that like when you be in the

the gesture do not go unnoticed what branch of NCIS be you with anyway I make an inquiry and got hit with the kind of clearance request you would expect from Langley there be be another shoot Jon Donnelly we think Montrell Perez may have have something to do with it may I ask why I can think of about five million reason a less tactful attorney might suggest your effort be well spend try to locate this allege hit man rather than assign blame to a prisoner already serve his time Perez be a legitimate suspect and if you still want we to support his appeal he need to tell we everything he know he tell I he would talk to you anytime so long as it be face to face and they say chivalry be dead just run it through my office first of course thank you for the flower you say you do not like flower I kind of like that you send they what be you do here Kristin do not know do she know what that you got send to Folsom State Prison for a liquor store robbery that leave the owner paralyze look I be 18 I be not the guy who pull the trigger and it take a hell of a lot more than talk like a cop to rattle I she will leave I if she find out she be have it with people who disappoint she how have you meet at a bar what do you want from I I want you to convince I that you have nothing to do with Jon Donnelly 's murder that liquor store thing I be a kid catch up with the wrong crowd all right it

prosecutor to seal the case that be pretty good for a public defender it be Neil Corby Corby 's a former Navy Petty Officer after graduate law school he go the public defender route for four year and then decide he be a military man at heart next stop be JAG Perez say he do not tell anyone about the phone call but Corby know about it so either Perez be lie to I try to make I feel special or Corby

the woman you supposedly meet in a bar no I do he tell I where she would be and he send I in why to keep tab on her brother Jon apparently he just got send to prison and Corby seem to think that he might have know about miss money but as far as I could tell Jon do not know anything and neither do Kristin and you fall for her when she tell I she be pregnant I figure it be mean to be she and that boy they be my family I mean it do not matter how it start they be all I care about now be she in some kind of danger from Corby why should I believe you 'cause you be not the only one that care about her Corby represent Perez in the trial he have inside information about got to the money switch it to another account get nervous that Donnelly might find out so he hire Boyd to keep an eye on he but

Tony then who be it and where be DiNozzo I want to know every thing of this compagny Banks statement telephone record personal hard drive 's spinning up now everything Tim if La Grenouille be in DC this could lead we to he or DiNozzo well obviously DiNozzo be our first priority Start with the hospital find out when DiNozzo leave and with who and who be drive his car got it Director Shepard Mr Kort an unannounced visit by the CIA usually mean someone 's in trouble I trust it be not you where be he it depend on who he be DiNozzo I honestly do not know and even if I do I would not tell you

that be get to be embarrass I do not know what NCIS be up to but I want a private briefing in your office now I will decide what briefing you get and where you get it Mr Kort and if you have a problem with that why do not you have your director give I a call you be jeopardize one of the most important long term covert operation the agency have ever conduct Operation Lodestone you be not read in on Lodestone okay so read we in unless the CIA just believe in one way traffic this be not go to end well for you Special Agent DiNozzo 's car be bomb this morning but I guess you know that he be not in it thank for share the Agency have nothing to do with it be that when you mislay your frog in all that confusion my car blow up this morning do you do that where do you go with La Grenouille actually

of they do La Grenouille tell Jeanne who you be they do not miss a beat pretend everything be fine that do not last long I could see his guy drive my car a few car length behind we when stay down Allez Allez what be La Grenouille 's first reaction that he be the target I be not so sure you think it be you it be my car boss and we have certainly piss off the Agency a lot lately the Director and I have piss off the Agency a lot lately although mainly I for what it be worth Kort deny Agency involvement that be because Kort do not play by agency rule Guy 's get a hair trigger where do La Grenouille take you kind of blow away the breakfast plan blow away a lot of thing it be not suppose to happen like this you never really think it could end any other way do you you mean other than badly you be not suppose to fall in love with they thank you so much for that Director I be go to keep that in mind for next time wait a second there be not go to be a next time what do Jeanne say nothing I be go to tell you nothing you need to know Director where be La Grenouille I do not know he drop I off at the main gate drive west probably head to California he be drive pretty fast he could even be there now talk about his future yeah about what do not think he have one he probably do not he want out Kort know it would explain why he be so desperate to find he the CIA 's about to lose one of its most prized asset what exactly do he mean by out well he be go to call and arrange a meeting and give himself up because he say NCIS be the only agency he trust what time do she say how long she would be go no no I understand thank you what be that for believe I be dead I never believe that you be dead Ziva be the one that give up on you do not even think about the head slap be

Mighty Mouse stapler my dear fellow I never believe it for a moment welcome home it be not every day people think you be dead I know who blow up Tony 's car not Tony 's car but his alias ' car and not exactly who but more like how and why do you have a motive I no but they do every bomb maker have a signature the component the way it be assemble sometimes right down to the color tape they use to bind it all together in this case the component be common to at least nine other bomb that have go off in the last four year I make the match on Interpol the bomb have go off all over the world

strong lead here can Tony stop call Heidi 's other mark look for suspect listen I be simply say just because she be lie to you do not mean that she do not really love you hello what let he call a few more we have two theory to explain the dishonesty theory number one Heidi Campisano seduce Adrian Nelson then blackmail he threaten to tell his wife she have do it before plus it would explain the payment and the fact she be now dead Theory two Adrian find out that Heidi be pregnant with his baby also explain the payment and the fact she be now dead with those option I would 've lie too but no

the father there be no shocker there well I be not do Heidi Campisano definitely not the mother she give birth to a child who be not hers it be call gestational surrogacy where the sperm and the egg come from third party and then the surrogate act as a host Abs do you check Sara Nelson 's DNA Sara Nelson be definitely the mother that be what the payment be for the Nelsons hire Heidi Campisano as their surrogate perhaps she change her mind about give up the baby that be not the question do the nelson kill she for it Clear Clear Clear look like they leave in a hurry Place be a mess not all of it I do not understand what the nelson ' plan be to have a baby that part I understand that be why they hire Heidi Campisano as a surrogate but if she refuse to turn over the baby I be sure the nelson would 've have other option besides kill she I mean after all they be the biological parent I be not a lawyer but you be a parent you want to have child Ziva well it be a simple question I do not have a simple answer once you have kid you will understand if the nelson be really willing to do anything for their child they would be get it medical attention yeah well maybe they be Safe be clean out

come up with 50 000 which we do until you ruin it how much long do we have to sit here that depend on what whether or not I get the truth this time do not you have something you could be do like find my child my wife have a partial hysterectomy four year ago we try to adopt and go all the way to Southeast Asia and back and then we meet Heidi my exact opposite she have a womb but no egg she be a life saver it be almost too good to be true then it usually be we already know her background Agent Gibbs you still think she be try to con we you pay she pay surrogacy 's illegal in Virginia that why you do not go to the police look I get all day your kid be miss we do not go to the police because we know they would screw thing up and you 've still get it wrong Heidi be our friend we be happy to pay and she need the money then she decide she want more this may have be she but not anymore she be try to start over someone would not let she who I have no idea I do not know who have my child but as far as I be concern if anything happen to my child you be the one who well run for cover no satellite coverage of the paper mill nothing on the traffic cam all right send it over careful over there would not want to break a finger Gibbs do not accept apology but I do I be sorry Ziva I know you be try to help do I I will get back to you after I shame McGee do you find something I 've be compile a list of Heidi 's former mark we 've notice any one of they could have a score to settle the problem be they all have solid alibis for the day that Heidi be kill except this guy Scott Berks file a complaint over a pyramid scheme Heidi be run where do he say he be well he do not I have not find he yet do not exactly look like a score settler to I no how about now a buddy at Baltimore PD just send this over turn out this guy also file a complaint against Heidi it be the same person it be call a shill they be part of the con but they pose as a customer to try to convince the other mark to jump in if the con go bad they will often file a complaint so it build credibility with the other mark then they can move in for a secondary con I use to date this guy once he be Heidi 's partner yeah might still be high five for the traditional police work Tony he be dead kill a year ago by one of his mark you might want to brush up on the traditional police work do you know where my killer be I do not know where the killer be but I know what he be plan on do with Heidi 's body since the Chevy do not leave any skid mark at the site of the accident the first thing I do be check the brake the line be intact and the fluid be top off the pad be bad they need to be replace I know but here be the thing this be so good I can hardly take it the brake be replace about two week ago I find metallic shaving in the brake drum and the calip it only could have come from new pad and shoe brake be replace and then the old one be put back on yes the accident be not an accident well actually it be it just happen too soon it be the perfect cover up the killer probably plan on put Heidi 's body behind the wheel of the car and send it over a cliff it would have cover up the murder it would have be blame on worn brake the only problem be the killer cut it too close the brake go out and ka bam so who would rely on the mechanical failure of a break pad compress against a disc rotor to hide a body what do my loser son do now he kill Heidi Campisano then try to ransom her baby back to the biological parent my boy be not that clever Guess that be why he need your help look I tell you he be here

that his wife witness a murder she identify the shooter he come after her what be her name Shannon result Duck Captain Reynolds ' cause of death be relatively straight forward but I do find something else on his cheek we find a residue of prolactin and lysozyme Tears Jethro Captain Reynolds be cry when he die Checked Reynolds ' phone record boss Colonel ma'am I draw a blank so we check Major Sweigart 's phone record ten call in the last three day to the same person a woman Stephanie no Jill Captain Reynolds ' wife the husband the wife and the lover all the trademark of a classic love triangle you forget the lover 's lover which would make it technically I think a lover quadrangle or it could be a ring Abby uncover suspicious activity on the victim 's laptop and since Captain Reynolds have access to highly classified defense secret we can not rule out a spy ring and we know that Major Sweigart be with your ex with Stephanie Flynn and Mrs Reynolds be at a pharmaceutical convention in Charlottesville Charlottesville yes Charlottesville great mind think alike McGee Fort Belvoir where Reynolds die be here Charlottesville be here 104 mile two hour drive close enough for

he be release last month we have to reassemble his history by hand it be not complete he once go by the name Frederick LeClair Hinton aka LeClair bootlegging false id resist arrest theft the guy be a career felon Interstate traffic primarily how do he show up on your radar be a routine tip pick he up offload steal cargo container at which point you discover a nameless man whose entire history be be erase no fingerprint no criminal record not even a high school transcript that be impossible you would need first person access to a federal mainframe credit rating countless private company that would be like take spit out of the ocean how do he do it claim he do not say he be contact by someone offer the service the Eraser what movie be that from I do not know Flashdance why be Hinton not back in prison he be a small fish but the Eraser he be our real target we hope he would contact Hinton get pay off and finish the job provide Hinton with a new identity exactly I be leave to baby sit it be my first field assignment never expect he to be kill that be what happen to bait hey it be not your fault so why do not Hinton skip town when he have the opportunity he be have too good a time on the government expense account but we do have he under 24 hour monitor three team shift what change the Eraser do not make contact they pull my surveillance team to chase other lead you notify your boss we need to know everything you know the Bureau set Hinton up here it be maintain the appearance he be flush anyone else have their own key no we meet here weekly so no one would see we together he agree to play along in exchange for leniency but he know it could be dangerous forget the puppy McGee a place like this be what you need to score with the chick here boss this could be the murder weapon mercury Positive for blood Fluids lot of they no surprise there six year in prison the Eraser make the initial contact at the Crab Shack not face to face no slip he a note so you send Hinton back hope for another one Hinton be suppose to keep a record of anyone he come in contact with I be run background check chase down his lead I be wait for anything new you get your wish your first crime scene he be kill in that room this be why I love you guy you bring I hair you bring I blood you bring I fluid and mercury Predictable yet constantly surprising we try of course mercury be toxic so you should not let kid break open thermometer and play with it speak from personal experience Abb actually explain a lot you want it but it kill you it be like a metaphor it be a cigarette or chocolate for dog by the way I like the dachshund for you you could name he Mercury this mercury Abby industrial grade commonly use in heavy machinery although it be fall out of favor because of the fear factor a lot of it be be drop on develop nation like India where export dumping have become a major revenue stream Anyways um this be what kill our paint man speak of which I 've see a lot of great skin art do with a ballpoint pen and a needle like this and this very nice but this guy be tattoo it be it be a mess the symbol be gibberish the pattern 's haphazard it be a puzzle it puzzle I Gibbs I be determined to solve it Hair sample not nearly as interesting six different woman Hinton have a lot of girlfriend one be a bleach blonde One 's auburn from a bottle if you want to know anything else you have to find something to match it against Delivery for Tony I get it I get it thank you hey how be you good thank here you go thank you have a good night keep the change Portobello mushroom no tomato Philly cheese steak extra steak extra cheese these be all Hinton 's contact can not help but notice they be all woman what make he think the Eraser be a woman I do not know that he do well cause you know you say he be enjoy himself you you you have mushroom in your tooth where be your bathroom I will show you where it be hey so I 've be think about the murder why kill he that way I mean an injection into the brain definitely not the most common method to find out why you must ask who someone tidy someone who do not like mess you have a theory someone who need to be in constant control of the situation someone who do not like to lose control of their emotion Ziva what be you do I be not an expert here but I be pretty sure what you be do now be a violation of the code it be not against the law the woman 's code McGee I bet you if we take a strand of her hair it will match the sample from Hinton 's condo well of course it would she be already say she be there every week this woman be uptight not even a single strand we will have to go to the source Ziva no hair pull she be the only one that be in contact with Hinton it would have be easy for she to just sweep he under the rug Motive she be ambitious he become too much of a complication when someone be that uptight it be only a matter of time before they snap okay you do not like she do you I understand what she be go through I remember what it be like to be green afraid you be go to mess up which she do so what you want to rub it in come on Ziva I think she deserve a little sympathy Tony seem to like she I do not think Gibbs do who do you work for Tobias Homeland Security or the FBI the world be on my shoulder Gibbs World make of paper just throw that anywhere kind of defeat the purpose of e mail when you have to print it all out for the fire anyway yeah that be why I do not use it really not because you can not figure out how to work it I spend most of my time now coordinate the flow of information what can I give you your opinion on Special Agent Courtney Krieger promise do everything by the book the book do not show very much imagination definitely a child of the electronic age currently run a low level asset in Highland Beach Asset name Hinton okay what be I miss fact he be murder Marvin Hinton be dead I tell she to notify you you 've get to be kid I she send an e mail it go in my spam folder this be serious Gibbs Alive Hinton be just an ex con who make a deal with the devil Dead mean the devil come to collect Devil have a name that be just about all he be get you ever hear of Kamal Konkani build his reputation in the early ' 90 manufacture false id for IRA bomber move around Europe one step ahead of the authority for the next ten year where he go death follow be invisible since the millennium he make a fortune work for terrorist Hinton be not a terrorist Game have change in a decade document be more sophisticated electronic tracking facial recognition we think Kamal be use Hinton as a test a test for what Homeland pick up chatter from a training facility in Libya a terrorist cell with assurance of clean entry onto U S soil Assurances from Kamal Konkani and with Hinton dead the only eye on Kamal have be close for a week you be tell I that there be terrorist on the way here and they could be anyone how do this start with a dead man name Marvin Hinton aka Frederick LeClair an ex con look for a new identity a wish your eraser be more than happy to accommodate my boss look mad he be go to chew you up out chew you out maybe not

transit facilitated basque terror attack in Spain IRA bombing in England the GIA bombing in France in 1995 kill eight wound hundred lead by Khaled Kelkal french authority identify the man who make it possible as Kamal Konkani that be a lot of K 's K 's be funny Agent Krieger you ever see the Sunshine Boys but they be not able to put a face to the name before he disappear off the radar apparently he be relocate to Maryland upgrade his system for take people off the grid we be tip off to Hinton so it be possible that Kamal drop the dime himself to test his work his work seem impeccable now he be cover his track and shop the service to terrorist overseas I will monitor the situation in the training camp watch closely for any movement I suggest you pick up Kamal 's trail on this end no trace no face this ought to be easy Special Agent Krieger a word accord to his Interpol bio Kamal rarely venture out of his safe house once it be establish Style 's cloak and dagger low tech no cell phone no electronic message Smart he prefer to pass note the Bureau provide several intercept by the French 12 year ago code Abby have they now I do not give a fly crap what it state in the handbook you do

dead 48 hour and you have the nerve to stand here and ask I how much money I may or may not get Michael 's parent be arrive and I have a funeral to arrange do I need someone to escort I out of the building I will escort you Mrs Arnett Nice Tony Black Widow Guilty when there be money involve it be always the spouse roll call Phenelzine be present and account for as predict but Timolol make a surprise appearance Timolol a very high concentration Timolol it be a beta blocker Eye drop use to treat glaucoma which accord to his medical record Lieutenant Arnett never have Mr Palmer have the lieutenant report back to the table yes sir Boss I vet Dr Fleming turn out he be a radical undergraduate at Berkeley in the early ' 70 arrest several time for civil disobedience as recently as last week speak at a get out of Gitmo rally on the Mall well bring he in we do not need a subpoena to interview he Captain Walsh be online in MTAC Arnett 's file redact to the point it be useless Special Agent Gibbs I 've get something yes sir Captain Walsh sorry to keep you wait my unit be still on lockdown you be suppose to keep I in the loop Agent Gibbs Lieutenant Arnett 's file I could 've get more read the Washington Post blame the Director of National Intelligence and you forgot to mention Arnett be question about leak intel do not think I need to do not you people at NCIS talk to each other Captain Walsh in order for this agency to complete a thorough investigation we will need your full cooperation you will be brief when we think it be appropriate I have a meeting with the Undersecretary in half an hour what do I tell he tell he the Director of National Intelligence be obstruct our investigation Djibouti 's come online Satellite time 's expensive what do you have for we Special Agent Wells we 've be work with Bahrain I think we 've come up with something a tribal leader be behead for collaborate with an american agent it be definitely the work of Al Qaeda operative we have every reason to believe the victim be Lieutenant Arnett 's miss contact when do it happen a couple day ago not too much long we be just get into it question villager I want update as you get they yes ma'am what 've you get Jardine I do a matrix focus on the four most recent leak Charted who generate the information receive it or have access to it directly or indirectly the only person who have knowledge of all the leak intel be Lieutenant Arnett himself if the behead tribal leader be in fact his source and his identity have be leak then Arnett be the only one who would have know I think Lieutenant Arnett be the mole Mid Eastern ancestry arab speak Naval Academy graduate Intelligence officer in the Pentagon he be the perfect deep cover mole Sort of an arab version of Kevin Costner in no way out a movie buff one more thing you two have in common Arnett 's juggle two life thing be close in on he he be stress to the max on antidepressant a liability to his Al Qaeda handler when he do not jump they terminate he before he can expose their cell Nah I still like the wife have he kill for the money there be a prenup he die before they get divorce she get the big check if he die after she get zip yeah why the suicide attempt DiNozzo I be still work on that part boss we know why he be suicidal Abby find Timolol in Lieutenant Arnett 's blood it be use to treat glaucoma he do not have glaucoma so why have he take it well that be the good part he do not know he be someone substitute Timolol for his contact lens solution his lense be soak in it all night it be the equivalent of wear nicotine patch on his eye the level of the drug be 20 time the recommend dosage I still have not hear why he be suicidal because the combination of the eye medication and the antidepressant he be take have a serious side effect severe clinical depression well I think you be overlook an obvious character Character this be not one of your novel Mr Gemcity Dr Fleming have anti government leaning he prescribe the antidepressant and would know the combine drug side effect if Arnett discuss classified information during their session fleming could have pass the intel on there be your spy yes probie but the wife have access to the contact lense that do not prove anything McGee find a bottle of lens solution in Arnett 's Pentagon office desk your point Captain Walsh have access to his desk and as Arnett 's CO knowledge of his intel that be the weak point of all all these make more sense than Arnett listen I think I be not miss the point I think break up the dog pile this be a murder investigation and I be hear a lot of theory here and not much else get on it so I be against the war and the Patriot Act do not make I un American what have you get there Government keep a file on I I will ask the question Dr Fleming I 've have enough of this sit down I see McGee 's get your mad act down almost I hear your agent be pit against each other be not that Gibbs ' rule 15 always work as a team not on this one no one could have save he Jethro he be dead the moment he step out on that ledge that what I tell his sister you have any luck might be something the summer before his junior year in high school he spend two month in Damascus with relative I be try to ascertain their politic entrap the Black Widow yet minor setback I think since Dana Arnett be married to a guy with top secret clearance she would have be vet let I guess she be squeaky clean well I do not know because she be never check out if he have marry some foreigner then obviously she would have be subject to a vigorous background check but she be bear in Kansas I be have the same problem McGee have with Captain Walsh the Pentagon be rock wall I she mean stonewall little quirk she have I guess everyone have their little quirk even I really I have not notice Abby please all I be ask be for you to take another look at the hard drive on Arnett 's computer it be wipe clean maybe you can find an embed file anything I can not okay I be too busy why do not you ask McGee to do it because Mr MIT claim that he be well at this stuff anyways may I take a couple of these sure knock yourself out Abs McGee I need your help I get Dr Fleming 's fingerprint on this water bottle I need you to compare it to the print lift in Arnett 's flat take a number because Tony have I run dna off

mission but but it stop there you think they all just go out for an evening swim you notice something miss Duck People Life boat yeah I do not notice any on the starboard side either the ship be abandon in a hurry it would seem too much of a hurry to send a Mayday no no Jethro no question beyond your pay level five minute you owe I ten buck where 's McGee call Earl shout grocery make street pizza Technicolor yawn I find something lose something too I guess you can not judge a black ship by its wool what be they research Duck something to do with rat if I be to guess from these empty cage Skinner seem pretty paranoid guess the mission be not purely humanitarian I doubt it be even human Thermosalinographs fluorometer carbon analyzer whatever it be it be not visible to the naked eye what be that could be the metal of the ship contracting in the cool of the evening or not sound as if it be come from the cargo hold above we Duck you be with I check out the cargo hold I be afraid you be go to say that Baa baa black ship have you any wool yes sir yes sir but no one get to see it you be go to need top secret government clearance someone or something be on the ship with we I can feel it yeah I can see it scared much DiNozzo stuff it McBarf Bag it be just a cute little rat why the irrational fear it be not cute it be not little and it be not irrational Cowardly then not if you be uh someone who survive a bout of pneumonic plague thank you very much rat be a know carrier I use to love rat before the plague I be a regular Willard what be a Willard it be a movie Willard have a pet rat name Ben Social misfit make fun of by his coworker he have a creepy boss no wonder you be relate you think Gibbs be creepy I think she mean the social misfit make fun of part do you hear that no no there be something aboard other than a rat what do your astute ninja Mossad sense tell you it be in Mossad part of the training be to be open to thing you can not see or even understand you mean the supernatural call it what you want not everything can be explain by the law of the natural world you believe in ghost I do not not believe in ghost or demon or monster we be on a ship call the Chimera I think Chimera mean delusion or fantasy in greek mythology a Chimera be a monster with a lion 's head a goat 's body and a dragon 's tail so you think they name this ship the Chimera because there be a monster on board they do not name it the Puppy Boo get in here well whatever be on this boat must be pretty damn scary if it get they to ditch this delicious look what be this stuff do not ask I that be not a request it be a command the plot sicken this be our crime scene if there be a crime well you see these little fleck of brown in the blood Coffee ground emesis usually a sign of alcoholism but you can get it from severe gastrointestinal distress Steady Probie tell that to my stomach Steady Probie 's stomach I would not stand there if I be you that be a good point you do not want to compromise the crime scene Gibbs Partial footprint in blood they lead out of here in here you be right Ziva someone be on board with we not he there be something alive I can feel it a lion head dragon goat maybe someone toss a month 's supply of cream corn to make room for he please do not say that again toss no Creamed corn there be significant petechial hemorrhaging in the eye these little pinpoint of blood it be often a sign of asphyxia well we will not know for sure until we conduct some test McGee get I a satellite link Abby Abby Abby McGee you should not sneak up on people like that what the hell be that noise Brain Matter I love they you guy okay yeah yeah we be peachy I be deal with my boat phobia Tony 's deal with his rat phobia and Ziva 's deal with her ghost phobia so what be Gibbs deal with they abs patch I through to the Director no need Jethro I be here what be the status well the crew have disappear except for one do he tell you where they be no he be dead have you id'd he yeah hang on Dr Satoshi Takada what do you got on he Abs Dr Satoshi Takada Marine biologist Lieutenant Commander for the Navy since 1997 phd in biology from LSU make sure Skinner know he be get 20 man strand in life boat I will get right on it do Ducky have a cause of death we be still do test do not know what kill he yet yes we do my initial diagnosis of asphyxia be incorrect I be afraid it look as if Takada die of viral hemorrhagic fever to which by now we have all be expose can not leave the ship well that be not a problem Jethro if my diagnosis be correct we will all be dead by morning STRATCOM have receive no signal from any life boat a crew of 20 do not just disappear into thin air trust I we will find those man we be dispatch our rescue and recovery op and get a relief crew out to the Chimera ASAP I need you to tell I what kind of research the Chimera be involve in Deep sea marine life exploration I be afraid I can not say anything more than that it be classify I have top secret clearance Commander the mission be above top secret Director but trust I it be pretty mundane stuff my medical examiner believe that Dr Takada die from a deadly virus he may have contract from the mundane stuff he be study then he must be mistaken in his preliminary diagnosis something on that ship kill he we have no reason to believe that Dr Takada 's research have anything to do with his death Commander if you insist on stonewall I I can take this to a high command level I be not stonewall Director I be tell you the truth you be not tell I a damn thing you do not run black op to carry out mundane research the life of my agent be be threaten and I need to know what be threaten they primitive condition Duck Primitive you remember that tiny thatched cottage I use as an examination room in Namibia yes of course then I be work on Pygmies you know what kill he well if Dr Takada be a bit too fond of his Scotch what I be see here be oesophageal varix and this tear cause blood to enter his oesophagus cause he to vomit blood or Dr Takada could have have a severe gastrointestinal infection that produce a Mallory Weiss tear in which case the vomiting would have come first neither diagnosis be inconsistent with haemorrhagic fever and if we be expose well I be hamper from prognosticate far until Dr DiNozzo give I a proper blood analysis Abby where be the gas chromato thinga it be the uh boxy look thing with the um circular door like thing on the front I get it okay good now put the sample in the circular rack like thing at the top get it okay press the blue start button it be it be blue ish and square ish it be on a tower on the top Tony the tower like thing get it while we be wait the analysis let us get the blood count so place a small amount of blood on your slide it be amazing what you can learn from blood even before it be analyze I mean the color the texture the smell okay um now take out the dropper of Methylene Blue it be blue ish and it be dropper like get it okay now place two drop of the Methylene Blue on your slide we be good of course blood that be pass through someone 's GI tract have a very particular smell but since this guy may have die from a highly contagious virus whatever you do do not inhale it we be not good hey you okay DiNozzo not for long where be my blood analysis DiNozzo I be work on it Ducky maybe the last thing I do let us hope not may I there be definitely an increase white blood count with an absolute increase in lymphocyte have an atypical appearance that would be consistent with an acute viral infection I have locate three rodent bite on Takada 's body perhaps he contract the virus from a diseased rat that would be bad maybe the top secret whatever it be that Takada be study be what kill he in which case it would be airborne that would be really really bad Boss I 've get a feed from MTAC with Director Shepard and Commander Skinner they want you and Ducky patch in right away I be fly a crew out to take control of the ship the risk be too great director you can not allow anyone on this ship I can put anyone I want to on that ship then I have no choice but to quarantine the Chimera on whose authority ours Dr Mallard be a medical examiner Agent Gibbs be a federal officer that be my ship not anymore what kind of game you think you be play Gibbs any word from the miss crew we have every possible resource look for those man look give what we know this be high precedence those man may well have be expose to the virus too they may also need to be quarantine you do not need to explain to I the danger involve here it might 've help if you have explain they to we if that be all Director I would like to go find out what this virus be before it kill I and quite possibly everyone else on this ship too Commander I think it be time you tell I what I need to know about your ship I can not divulge any more about the Chimera 's mission than I already have see as how my agent now have control over your ship I be go to instruct they to investigate any and all aspect of the Chimera 's operation that will help they determine what they be up against nothing will be off limit you can not do that you can not stop I this be a classified mission then read I into it even if I want to read you into the Chimera 's mission I can not do that over an mtac feed the file have to be read to you in person if you think I be go to stand idly by while my agent ' life be in danger you be sadly mistaken I will be wait for you and your file Commander now you we 've be through almost every room on this ship almost only count in horseshoe and hand grenade could be a rat have to be an awfully big one or a ghost be you do do search the ship we could always search it again I could stay here with Ducky well so he be not leave alone I be not alone I 've get Takada to keep I company Duck get it so Takada as one doctor to another what be this horrid virus which cause your demise anyone else feel itchy maybe that be a bug bite or a rat bite no no no look at that spot it be a freckle it be not a freckle Freckle never have a freckle there you 've always have that freckle how would you know whether I have a freckle or do not have a freckle and by the way I have never have that freckle yes Jethro give I the symptom for hemorrhagic fever well initially one might experience a feeling paranoia and a grow sense of dread then more obvious physiological symptom would manifest themselves such as such as the appearance of atopic melanosome come again spot possibly itchy then a fast rise fever of course I know it I be go to die I inhale it God definitely do not picture my demise like this I always figure I would go out like Cagney in White Heat Fiery explosion or Redford and Newman in Butch Cassidy hail of bullet or Charlie Chaplin in the Gold Rush how do he die Silently Ziva do not you see that see what someone something be run surely I be not the only one who see that the Chimera I swear there be something there it be not here now it run down the passageway it make a right here and then it and then it disappear I know there be something there like my freckle Boss Biohazard sound invite McGee look like some kind of cyber lock with a bar code and touch memory it be right up your alley McGeek it be go to take time we be not go anywhere Thought you say you be not go anywhere if you want Ziva I could check you for spot no thank I be sure you 've get hot spot warm spot DiNozzo get this to Ducky I that be a dead diseased rat which be why it may aid Dr Mallard with his investigation which be why I would be pleased as punch to walk back through this ship with a dead diseased rat you can show Ducky your freckle you stinky stinky yes Alex I will take Horror Films that take Place on Ships for 500 thank you oh goodie Double Jeopardy oh geez oh dear oh crap I do not suppose you hear footstep yeah I hear them it be just I and Ben Bag that thing Ziva Thanks well this moment be almost perfect all we need be a storm McGee yeah you all right I 've have well day boss trip over a barrel make this kinda Bangy crashy sound like thunder you crack the lock no not yet the touch screen it be a bit I be work on it why do not you work on turn the light back on I think we just pass the electrical room it be like Aliens Numero Uno Ripley light in hand move through endless corridor search for a hideous monster you ever see Run Silent Run Deep the run silent part sound good the electrical room should be right here let I out of here here be the crew list he be the cook get these shackle off of I why be you hide why do you attack we why have the crew abandon ship what happen to Takada you ask I it be that thing be not it what thing I know there be a thing what thing they bring a thing out of the water Takada be study it that be what kill he be not it do not know do not lie to I it be kill I too be not it you know what if I do not kill you first sit down and tell we what happen here what happen to the crew they abandon ship why they think whatever kill Takada be contagious Captain force I to stay behind he think I have already be expose from all the blood he puke on I nobody send a Mayday the radio operator be suppose to he be the last to leave the ship so you be leave here alone I think I be and then someone hit I who I do not know they hit I from behind maybe they do maybe they do not why would I lie why be you hide why do you run I think you be the one that hit I there be someone else on this ship what be in that biohazard room do not ask I I be just the cook come on you never overhear one conversation one argument about what be lock up in there that area be off limit to I sit down you live with these people you sleep with they you work with they you can not tell I what be in that room that be where it be the bug I do not get it the breaker be not trip the conduit be fine Tony check behind this panel over here Tony feel my head why just feel it I do not want to it be all sweaty exactly I get the freakin ' fever I be burn up man the ventilation be off Tony we be all burn up this be different I be die McGee you know the last time you be die of a horrible disease you be a little bit more stoic about the whole thing I be young then carefree it be two year ago the last time I almost die someone blow up my car so I 've almost die twice and this be the third time and bad stuff happen in three and I be out of almost I be tell you man this time I be die I know it but until you be actually dead can you please help I fix this thing go take a look behind that panel over there see if maybe one of the lead got fry thank I think I find the problem assume this ship run on tiny little battery Lithium like camera battery Odd someone must have hide they in there Transponders from what well my guess epirb that be my guess too what be epirb again Containment of aforementioned microbial specie deadly or otherwise be to remain under the guardianship of the operation 's chief scientist until such time it can be safely transport to Naval Research Headquarters Biowarfare research be illegal we sign a treaty so do the Russians and we 've spot their fishing trawler in area of the Bering Sea that be not consider fishable so two wrongful fishing expedition make a right we be just try to get our hand on the next generation of biological weaponry before our enemy do do you file that under deception or hypocrisy Non disclosure agreement do you understand why the Navy do not want anyone to know where the ship be or what it be do and do you understand the Navy 's secret could cost my agent their life I get a support vessel on its way with medical facility on board and a decontamination unit Great show it to I how exactly do you propose I do that there must be an orion or two that you could scramble overhead I think you be go to have to trust I I do not know you well enough Commander we can fix that you can cut the charm high ranking rich and definitely well look man have try that on I and do not get very far now I can not speak for you Commander but I do not get where I be because of my look so get your eye off of I and put some on that ship what be that Transponders take off the life jacket why I would do that you do not want the crew locate once they abandon ship I do not sabotage any life jacket there be no one else on the ship there have to be you be in the electrical room when the power go out I would not know how to shut off the power I tell you I be just the cook just the cook that be what Steven Seagal say in Under Siege look at the havoc he wreak what about the Hunt for Red October the saboteur be the cook I be sorry boss I be just say that you know just 'cause he say he be the cook do not mean he be any less potentially guilty he could have slip poison into Takada 's food I swear I do not kill Takada not with poison at least the good news be I 've confirm beyond a doubt that Takada do indeed die of hemorrhagic fever that be great news Ducky however the virus be inject into he it be not airborne I 've also examine the dead rat that Tony so heroically bring to I ironically it die from having bite Takada so I be not go to die well the bottom line be there be no outbreak on the ship he be inject without know it if I could do a proper and thorough toxicology I think we would find that he have first be drug Takada be murder why would someone do that to scare everyone off the ship but why I mean what be so valuable on this ship that someone would kill for it about time McGee I have nothing to do with it Someone 's mess with we Maybe Mitas be right someone else be aboard Gibbs up here I see something run on deck something or someone I do not know it be move fast it or he I do not know I have lose it I will say gibb I swear I believe you Ziva see someone else who believe in what they can not see no I believe what I can see be not there before someone be send a signal I believe you Mitas be tell the truth he be not a ghost but he be get a certain b horror flick thing go you have no idea what you be deal with I think we do Lieutenant Ferris Communications Officer who fail to communicate his crewmate abandon ship you be not very good at your job be you Lieutenant you be waste your time I think we be waste yours the Navy 's on its way you be go to the brig you will be dead before they arrive save it we know about the virus Outbreak be a hoax it be not the virus that will kill you Satisfied Director I be not that easy Commander that do not surprise I that must be your support vessel can we get any close I be sure we can it be go to reach the Chimera a lot fast than you say it would that be not our support vessel the approach craft have no known identification that seem to be the way thing operate around here look to be the size of a small assault vessel same type of boat I 've see use by marauder Pirates Cruise ship tanker steamer they will attack anything to make a buck how long you should be able to put eye on it any minute these people come heavily armed Agent Gibbs automatic weapon grenade even rpg what be they after I can not divulge that information hold on you tell I heavily armed pirate be come to attack I you well tell I what they be look for your agent have not be read in I do not give a damn about your secret Commander I care about keep my team safe tell I what they want I can not do that can someone give I a damn answer put I through to STRATCOM all right wait look the secret material they have dredge up from the ocean what be I look for something the size of a bread box a gallon drum it can fit in a vial but it be untested Unproven Ferris have already kill one guy he be put 20 other at risk this be worth something to someone Boss I crack it now before we go in there the power be back on so the ventilation and filtration system should also be back on I know it say biohazard but if there be anything biological in there the room should be negatively pressure thing be this room be not boss you you really could risk exposure if you stay in there very long what be it Gibbs we 've spot the assault craft five minute maybe less Aleksei Aleksei Ferris Ducky how long before Ferris wake up a couple of hour it will take he considerably long to wipe off the fake blood how have you disable the ship McGee Spew all over the engine Steering have several nonlinear effect saturation dead zone rate limit bottom line be ship 's still able able to sail in one big circle russian order from the russian Navy they be not pirate soviet state sponsor pirate but why McGee russian nuclear warhead there be your ghost Ziva the ghost of Soviet Project K629 so this whole thing be a russian black op mission to recover their nuke so pirate that be not really pirate but be actually russian sailor be on a covert mission to steal a Navy research ship that be not actually a Navy research ship in order to get back nuclear weapon that we think they do not think we have retrieve perhaps we should call the Navy tell they that we be on the russian black ship and the Russians be on theirs I guess the Navy do not want anyone to know their black ship ever exist how do they know we be off the ship do not think they do www Team NCIS com www Team NCIS com do not do this to I boss Come on do not do this to I do not make I kiss

part I will have you know that since 1981 I 've be a loyal subscriber to National Geographic magazine that be some serious picture gaze right there so how do she know Woman 's intuition do you have that forget I ask that question the Director could see Gibbs be preoccupy with something and she see he with the girl sound more like male logic than woman 's intuition either way I think she be worried about he Question be should we be hush little baby do not say a word Papa 's go to buy you a mock bird Pony and if that mock bird do not sing Papa 's go to buy you a diamond ring if that diamond ring turn brass Papa 's go to buy you a look glass do not go daddy please do not go if that cart and bull break down you be still the prettiest little baby in town yeah Gibbs Jethro he be back

Abby 's get one from when she be try to take yours early Ziva you want to call Abby Haas 's current address assign to Quantico as an enlisted trainer but he have not report in there since he get back from Iraq get to be stay somewhere no know relative in the DC area friend then I want the address of every place he be ever live I be work on it boss her cell phone switch off his also switch off I be try to access his recent call now and and I 've well I 've only just start you be go to brief I be not you she call I I get there place be trash see she be push into Haas 's suv you identify he I identify his car so you do not actually see Sergeant Haas abduct she maybe it be someone else well it must have be Haas drive could have be drive good guess what else do we know about he Haas turn down Uncle Sam 's offer to reenlist last month in 60 day he will be a former Marine last deployment Logistics work out of the Green Zone in Baghdad Everything Marine go to or come from Iraq channel through his department Desk jockey get his phone record moderate usage recurring number there be a few 15 call in the last eight day to a landline in the name of Maddie Tyler other five incoming from a company here in DC it be the first call he receive when he get back from Iraq and the last call he get before he switch off his phone Bordais Security Solutions BSS a small sized security firm with a contract in Iraq Marine today mercenary tomorrow Filthy rich the day after look like Haas be be headhunte I need a name McGee CEO be a retired Army Major Max Bordais Ours be a small company Agent Gibbs Less than 100 employee the majority of whom be in Iraq do what Protection detail for various vip Haas do not seem like the highly train soldier your company would hire he be a paper pusher and from what I 've be tell no one push paper well sign he up make he a generous offer and he pass he say why no evidently a thousand dollar a day be not enough a lot of money for a clerk I guess he do not need the money look I do my homework Haas be consider one of the good logistic people in Iraq you want it he will find it you can not get it through channel you get it through Haas that be what they say about he a guy like that be worth a dozen of my highly train soldier where be he I do not know you be lie I only have his cell phone number be I under arrest no where be he Agent gibb I only talk to he on the phone he do not want to meet I he make it clear he be not look for a job now if you be not go to arrest I I be walk out of here nicely handle Jethro you be right he be hold something back then again he be not the only one be he you say you know her Family friend when long time ago how long five year ten year Fifteen be we do here I e mail Maddie 's photo to state and local police I print you one too of course I crop you out of the one that I e mail I just think that maybe you would want a copy of the original she be Kelly 's friend be not she we be go to find her gibb I know it boss you might want to see this McGee get something I plot all the cell phone call Haas receive or make in the last eight day Most be make from his car as he be drive the signal pass from tower to tower which do not help we but three of the call be make from the same location use the same tower each time now give the range and signal strength they could only have be make from this four block radius a lot of real estate until you add what I find only job Haas ever have in DC be in the six month before he join the Marines he work as a night watchman at a clothing factory live on site the factory close three year ago put he right in the zone hear that fly Guess we find Haas not quite a stairway to heaven perhaps an elevator to a less compelling place this be he I take it yup Rudi Haas yes well when we be confront with crucifixion we immediately think of the Romans but it be use as a form of execution long before they by the Egyptians and the Greeks and after they by the Persians and then of course the Japanese Duck I do not get a whole lot of time on this one yes I understand Jethro obviously at first blush the uninitiated would pounce upon the theory that he be involve in some sort of macabre or perhaps demonic ritual but we be not so quick to draw such an easy conclusion be we Timothy numerous cut and nick on his torso and face significant bruising of the left arm Coloration indicate that this bruise predate these more recent wound yeah someone grip he vicelike and squeeze yeah that would have be I Duck I will go see how the other be do no Jethro I think in this case there be a totally mundane though no less sickening reason that he be nail to the floor they do not want he to struggle while they torture he Time of death well now that be another problem well not for I but for you Rigor be fully set he be as stiff as the board to which he be nail indicate a time of death at least 12 hour ago I be afraid Sergeant Haas be already long dead when Maddie Tyler be abduct Guy come back from Iraq start stalk a girl he barely know trash her apartment and then abduct she do not abduct she do not abduct her already dead torture first he give they Maddie 's address they trash her apartment apparently they do not find what they be look for so they abduct she whoever they be she must know something or have something they want McGee it be a GPS locator boss real time wire into the radio our stalker be be stalk you be always welcome down here Jethro but I 've barely start I will take whatever you get well nothing confirm at this point no fatal wound and there be very little blood loss at the scene so we can rule out stab bludgeoning and gunshot no sign of strangulation there do appear to be some petechial hemorrhaging which suggest asphyxia someone could have smother he with a pillow or clamp a hand over his nose and mouth she be abduct more than six hour ago your point well there be a strong possibility that look if I have to explain it perhaps you be too close to this what else swelling of his face and then there be these lump and bump could be hive allergic reaction wait a minute it could be anaphylactic shock yes the most severe form of anaphylaxis occur when an allergic response trigger the release of large quantity of immunological mediator this lead to systemic vasodilation yes my suspicion be correct his air passage be all close up probably dead within minute allergic to what Seafood and he would not have to have eat any of it merely come into contact with it would have cause his demise Jethro just who be you try to save I look at she I see Kelly Duck how it should have be Jethro be careful do not let your some thing just can not be undo I be not there then I be now I do not want to see you cause I do not have anything yet work on it as fast as I can you know how fast that be nobody 's fast than I I be the master of fast normally but there be nothing normal about this do you have my thing yes his clothe and the nail we be go to find her Gibbs we be go to find she you believe that right do not answer that forget I ask just okay I need all of you to get out of my lab let I do my thing I have all these sample to test and Major Mass Spec be go to blow up in protest if I do not blow up first sorry this be not my lab I be go to go a high end item like a GPS locator I figure the manufacturer would keep a record of who it be sell to Cross check the serial number against their record look who I find make Maxie Bordais a big fat liar and a suspect bring he in Soldier of fortune be about to become soldier of misfortune Dogs of war be about to taste the hair of the dog think she be alive after what they do to Haas maybe it would be good if she be not Showtime this your subtle way of send I a message Director nothing subtle about it Mr Bordais you be now officially a suspect in this murder investigation want to explain that gps locator real time tracking of target vehicle buy by your company find in Sergeant Haas 's car Operational wait for it wait for it I need to make a phone call some of these guy be so predictable first sign of pressure and they cave see that come a mile way a lawyer be not go to help you now I be not call a lawyer call the Pentagon like I say hair of the dog I be assign as a special investigator with SIGIR I take it you 've hear of we Special Inspector General for

and son hike what about those Father and son they be all the same Doctor Carson and his dad hang out precisely Abby print over a hundred photograph from Brian Taylor 's computer and all of they be similar in nature to these I see actually I do not think I see as clearly as I think you see Mr Palmer when conduct a psychological analysis the first thing you have to do be establish pattern because pattern be the most efficient gateway into the mind you read your study material I be impressed but it seem like the only pattern we see here be that Brian Taylor enjoy spend time with his son and in pursuit devoid of typical human contact and that be bad because your job be not to judge but to understand the father 's pursuit of solitude be indicative of a far deep problem which would be Trust Lack of it the evidence be all here Jethro separate bank account from his wife a date book that show very little social interaction and of course his job Survivalist training it be a field which typically lure a very specific type of personality loner and that lead we to his diary it show that he have very few social engagement other than with his son he have lead a troubled life that be full of pain and Mr Palmer someone who be experience this much pain often find release in the form of rage or murder and to think they never give he study material God these be new boot this be not the time for sightseeing Tony the only sight I see be your big black hey backpack walk fast be you injure or something no I do stop for a water break human do that sometimes Taylor 's phone be just

be you stand by the elevator for privacy I do not want you know who to hear come on so I hack the Globalstar database and I access the call log from Brian Taylor 's sit phone how be not easy First I exploit a weakness I find in the network 's packet filter Abby sorry right anyway so Taylor make one phone call Ronald Keenan that be good work Palmer no gesture I repeat this be 911 please state your emergency officer have be dispatch to your location this young man never stand a fighting chance because unfortunately for he he do not fight sorry doctor no you be right note the lack of defensive wound on his forearm and hand he know his attacker but judge by that hunting knife in his chest I think we can presume that their relationship have sour somewhat boss I speak with 911 dispatch Keenan

particular anyone will do sir do that feel right to you son no sir it do not I be not right sir but it be not my fault tell I what it feel like Needles and pill Needles and pin no sir Needles and pill they put a cloud in my head it be dark behind my eye I can not see in there who drug you I do not know I can not find it I can not remember you got to help I at ease son I will his symptom be in no way exclusive to post traumatic stress you believe he irritability delusion hostility all of these could be an adverse reaction to any number of medication and in his field evaluation I find reference to anxiety paranoia and they all predate his capture too long in Iraq I do not get the impression he suffer in the field yes that do seem to be his natural habitat look you have establish a rapport perhaps you could convince he to part with urine and blood sample I make a promise to this Marine Plan to keep it so I guess he be a liar too other than low concentration of sedative and anti depressant his blood be clean of drug well the result of Werth 's urinalysis should confirm that then I can not just turn off one part of my head right now and turn on the other part you know what I do not even care I need you to draw upon that considerable capacity that you have for empathy for a moment I do not want to help he this young man you deem to be a villain may in fact be a victim what be we look for Probenecid spironolactone furosemide and any other uricosuric and diuretic Masking agent look at I like Jack Nicholson in Chinatown Stupid can you know what happen to the kitty cat who get too curious do not make I break out my Jack 'cause I will Straw no I be good I get the one arm thank you maybe it be you McGee the one armed man think it be one of those vet we meet at the Walter Reed Hospital Wrong case Tony we even have a case we already get the guy what be we do what do we miss what be happen they give he painkiller my finger be finge you hear that excellent work Agent gibb you will be receive a commendation where be he order from SecNav Werth be be transfer back to Bethesda the doctor will see to he make sure he be presentable for your photo op the man be entitle to his medal all you care about be sell the war you do not support the war I support the man fight it a complex series of mask agent hamper detection but we 've manage to find Oxymetholone stack with Nandrolone in addition countless other compound that we have yet to identify Anabolic steroid Steroids well testosterone level far beyond even the most reckless of bodybuilder the science at work here be very advanced with every indication that it be be go on for year Werth 's behavior be likely the result of steroid induce psychosis someone be use that Marine as a lab rat Abby 's mapping Werth 's blood work already find a bunch of steroid well cover would have be mask from standard drug testing Drug testing 's big buck McGiggle NFL NBA Major League Baseball they all face the same problem do not forget the Tour de France how could I those short little short he could have be inject his entire career Werth be not just a Marine with post traumatic stress someone have try to create a super soldier he be in a hospital bed weak 19 year old he be just be reject by the Corps his dream of become a Marine over before it start because he be Four F have an anemic blood disorder three year later he be rip through boot camp attend physician call the improvement in his blood cell count miraculous it be not a miracle it be an experiment someone turn Damon Werth into Captain America Werth 's swiss cheese brain mean he can not name the mad scientist any chance the attend be Dr De la Casa no such luck as far as I can tell they do not cross path till a couple week ago then who who would benefit from an experiment like this well there be big money in pharmaceutical what find out what kind of research the Biotech corporation do and everything on Karen Sutherland DiNozzo yeah boss you be with I the pursuit of juicy government contract spur a lot of r D yeah it run the gamut from pill that will keep a person awake for day at a time to biomechanical exoskeleton to nanoparticle technology a hell of a company I feel like James Bond walk into Q 's laboratory well DARPA 's money do pay for night vision laser and stealth and the internet that be a light emit diode it speed the healing process might help the damage cartilage in your nose Agent DiNozzo your company build super soldier not a term we use in house Agent Gibbs Connotes kill power our mission be to increase human effectiveness durability and longevity what point in the development process do you begin field testing on human subject we be subject to government oversight that be too bad all these cool toy and someone else tell you how to play with them can I ask you a question you ever jump the gun a bit with the magic pill cut through the red tape work out the kink in house Corporal Werth his condition be pharmaceutically base Steroids I appreciate you 've take a special interest in his case and you too he be highly decorate you be highly decorate Silver Star that be a lot in common you 've do your research that be the word on my door well he be a Marine and you be an ex Marine no such thing as ex Marines Put our life in each other 's hand accept that you be part of something great that sound like a religion more a faith well steroid be extremely hazardous carry many health risk I wish I could help you Agent gibb but our company do not conduct dangerous experiment on human test subject in case you be wonder he do not care about the medal I keep his in a drawer she be lie of course she be they do human testing on power drink why not Biotech Abby I really I need my arm to access these financial record you have nothing to do I create a blueprint of all the compound that Werth be give if you can find I an exist experiment I can match it and prove that he be their guinea pig I need to get Biotech to open their ultra secret book if there be anything you can do that could get you off of I I be so glad you smell like garbage yeah I know I be go through Karen Sutherland 's trash find anything she recycle and compost who compost those a pretty extreme length to go to for this guy but I understand now no true warrior should be fell by invisible force it be dishonorable and that other thing I say I know that be not really true what do that mean what she just say what other thing that I do not have feeling I do have feeling though I do not express myself the way Abby do no one express themself the way Abby do Themself themselves Themself what be you have feeling about you say you be have feeling I say I have feeling not that I be have feeling that be a pretty sophisticated grammatical differentiation do not change the subject with your big word McNerd Ziva say she have a feeling tell we about this feeling what be this feeling I feel overwhelmed temporarily which do not often happen to I when we be wrestle with Werth what what be this look nothing you like he I think he be powerful you really like he no I be say he be strong than any man I have encounter but strength should not decide a battle there be a weapon for every fight you itch for a rematch want to roll around on the ground with he some more I be try to describe something complicate it be not complicated Ziva it be Conan to her Red Sonja Nice it only last a moment you have a moment a moment and a feeling and a smack to the head Broken nose dislocate shoulder it be be a banner day Easy on the painkiller DiNozzo Director have any luck boss Public affair guy be stonewall his main concern be keep Werth docile for the ceremony they do not wanna know how he get that way or they know already what do we know look like Karen Sutherland be the bleed heart she appear to be Volunteer consultant with doctor without Borders donate to several charity for the mentally disabled if she be get a fault it be that she care too much which be something we might be able to exploit boss I tell you that information be proprietary I can not discuss it with you cut edge research financial temptation must be hard to resist you be waste your time if you think I be sell secret McGee you spend your summer travel through Africa with a team of doctor you 've be poke around my life only fair this report from the World Health Organization feature several child who receive treatment for land mine injury call their rapid healing miraculous I hear miracle I look for answer can not just take it on faith huh you do not sell any secret you give they away for free your heart 's in the right place your lead device be low cost highly effective but it be corporate property the super soldier program if anything on this come back to I my career be over hope it answer all your question you could 've just ask nicely this be nicely Platelet acceleration human growth hormone and cybernetic implant these people have read way too many sci fi comic some of these experiment be more fi than sci one of them make people glow in the dark what do we get a couple of surprise good or bad would it surprise you to learn that Karen Sutherland have review every single human research project at her company since you meet with her Time stamp on the file she download worry her company might be responsible be they for a lot of questionable experiment definitely but as far as our guy this be the map I compile of all the chemical compound that be run through Werth 's blood this be a blueprint of the chemical compound the Biotech Corporation be experiment with none of they match Werth 's not their test subject Sutherland'll be relieve she be not responsible someone else be the Director manage to get a list of every super soldier proposal compete for funding from DARPA none involve steroid Whatever be be do to Werth be somebody 's pet project but they do not leave a trail he be the only evidence the experiment ever take place the only one who know who do it if he could remember so if the experiment go wrong and Werth 's behavior over the past several day would suggest it have then if he do remember he be in danger we need to protect he all that be stand in our way be a senator and the entire military medical complex I be sure they will be happy to see we nothing sir I be lose you Sunspots X ray tunnel Agent Gibbs you and your team be not welcome here you be not to interfere with Corporal Werth 's treatment I will have you forcibly remove sorry about that clumsy not suppose to use in a hospital especially my hospital Corporal Werth be safe here except perhaps from himself you will excuse we if we do not take you at your word look I be take every measure to rectify past mistake I be ashamed to admit I miss a diagnosis you verify Dr Mallard 's finding Werth be on a rapid detox program which should flush his system of the steroid in three to five day there a reason we have to do all your work for you we try our good but we can not keep up with the number we do not have the time or the facility to extend that type of attention to every patient who present with PTSD I want to see he he be under heavy sedation he be fine no she ask to see the patient probably not a good idea to stand in her way Geez what no funny movie reference it be not funny the IV contain clonazepam while his system clear itself can he speak he be somewhat clear when he be awake be his mind return I hope so Corporal Werth Damon where be I Hospital what be all this we be get the steroid out of you steroid you remember who do this to you who do this to I Damon Damon Hey Damon like I say he be very weak Damon wait this be not right what be happen the system 's crash it be set too high what be that Adrenaline hold he down hold he hold he give it to he you be go to be all right Marine she be pull a Pulp Fiction on an Hulk what just happen I do not understand this his machine be crank up to the wrong level the sedative be poison he so you try to kill he bury the evidence of your little science experiment I do not understand this I set the rate write the order clear as day who carry out your order Jenkins go down I say go down you should probably stay down that be a nice watch a little ostentatious for my taste must 've be hell to pay for especially on an orderly 's salary find a loophole in the system doctor fill out order you take the drug from the pharmacy but occasionally they do not make it to their intend destination yeah you make quite a little business out of that have not you what be the street value of Nandrolone and Oxymetholone and Winstrol you even know what these thing do Liver kidney disease sterility roid rage this guy here beat his wife half to death at least three other be dead they be all patient of yours they do that to themselves Werth go off the reservation the cop be circle the hospital and then someone amp his machine up to 11 I do not know what happen all right these thing can be unreliable sometimes do not want Werth to start talk about who be stick the needle in he listen I do not stick the needle in any of those guy who do I be embarrassed by my behavior it do not even feel like I in my memory we have determine the source of the steroid but not who do this to you you remember it have not come back yet Disappointing would have to be someone close to you someone who have be with you wherever you go perhaps someone in your unit we have to investigate they unless you remember who it be Courage do not have anything to do with medal it be simple you run to the gunfire not away from it I do not know what I would do Gunny if I could not be a Marine it be in my blood I can not imagine how it feel when your own blood be keep you out the orderly be just your most recent supplier you give yourself the steroid and the mask agent so no one would ever find out all so you could become some super Marine just a Marine that be it Ceremony 's off you be cancel it have to the senator can not step on stage with that guy he will not get the medal that be up to the Marine Corps but I sincerely doubt it he will be lucky to be

his own gun nearly 30 of all gun relate death be the result of the owner 's own weapon your first impression Mr Palmer well there should be much more blood loss evident base upon base on the position of the body even with the heart slightly elevate precisely even with a gunshot that high in the thoracic cavity one would expect more blood loss Meaning Meaning I be not go to say anything else until I 've examine the body more closely the gurney please Mr Palmer right away Doctor good lad Good Marine Sunni how do you know that if he be a shiite he would have a turba with he like Hadji on Johnny Quest no I believe that be a turban Tony a turba be a small stone tablet that the Shiites set their forehead on while pray the devout develop a callus Ziva Checking for local Sunni mosque McGee check

ignorance intolerance and hatred any with a first name we would like your permission to look at Abdul 's thing I will need to tell the family what have happen we will have someone drive you thank you you wait here please come on Guy be with his son right before he die Suspect Victim Abdul Mohammed Bakr age 23 Lance Corporal Served in First FAST Company Bronze Star and Purple Heart for service in Iraq Three tour boss he keep go back if he stay he might still be alive Hypothetically Boss what else have some run in with the law Arrests Assault and battery twice here in DC both case be dismiss maybe they give he favorable treatment because he be serve in Iraq find out track down his personnel officer Boss Cameras yeah I tap into Metro traffic camera and a few parking lot surveillance network stitch together Abdul 's route from the alley back to the mosque there be no sign of anything until here can not get a reading on the man 's face but he do go into the alley back it up stop tighter his hand he be carry a phone Forward stop must have dump it McGee already run the phone record boss his cell do not send or receive any call that day find it on it Probie you start the search near the crime scene we will meet you there later David with I Captain 's right down here I be sorry the correct answer be full Metal Jacket that be not the good Marine movie a few good Men be base on the fact that I be right I be overrule you if you be here to volunteer we will take you I already have a job Captain Mills NCIS we be here about a Marine Abdul Bakr you be his personnel officer yeah First FAST Company he be in Iraq no he be in our morgue he be murder early today God he be such a good kid well we know he have some trouble a few fight he never start them we would like to see his personnel record Sure I will I will get you everything I get you coach yeah I be a parole officer in civilian life we have an after school league civilian life I be a reservist recall for active duty last year Manpower issue Iraq Iraq so a parole officer and a personnel officer that be kind of the same thing be not it yeah the Marine Corps like to place reservist in similar line of work make thing run more efficiently so in your professional opinion you think Lance Corporal Bakr 's run in could have lead to his murder maybe someone he have a fight with come back nobody stay mad at he he be a good kid and a great Marine and a Muslim yeah that be what the fight be about he stick up for his people hard to be a Muslim and a Marine be he ever sympathetic to un american activity no way not this kid Ducky just a moment Jethro be the needle in his femoral artery Mr Palmer yes Doctor Good never see a gunshot victim with so much blood leave in his body Rare but not unheard of and if the bullet pierce his heart it would have stop pump instantly and of course the pressure of the board on his back may have prevent gravitational loss right that should do it take those up to Abby get she to run the usual tox screen right away neatly do Mr Palmer thank you Doctor that young man will make a first class medical examiner one of these day today yeah well until I open he up I can not say for sure but all indication be that he be kill by the gunshot wound there be no defensive wound no lacerations no abrasion no contusion and unless I find intradermal bruise no sign of a struggle a Marine with combat experience let someone take his weapon away from he without a fight well I only tell you what the body tell I ask different question Duck I will Jethro I assure you yes well the first question be what damage do that bullet exactly do Ducky wait need to talk to you Mr Bakr have something to say Dr Mallard please do not cut into he I beg you to respect our religion so my son can find peace in heaven with all due respect we have to I beg of you please do not do this sorry there be no choice there be a choice Jethro Mine I can not do this autopsy so what be you say exactly that we have an obligation to honor faith as well as science and in this case the wish of the family we can not waive an autopsy in the middle of a murder investigation why not because the law be very specific we can try to accommodate some aspect of tradition or religious ceremony but we can not forfeit the most critical aspect of the investigation Abdul Bakr be a Marine who die as a hero that young man risk his life for this country the least we can do be to respect he in death he do not die in Iraq Ducky well but that be not the point what be the point Duck this country be found on freedom religious freedom that family come here to practice it and I can not ignore a basic tenet of their belief that if I cut open the body that will prevent their son from find peace in heaven there be no great sin what about murder we need to find a cause of death we need to find evidence you need to do the autopsy that be it all right I will do it under protest I have another body to examine so this will have to wait why I already tell you why why this case bring back memory of a mass grave I be a volunteer medical examiner for a UN task force in Bosnia in ' 93 I do 44 autopsy in five day most of they child under 12 all Muslims the village be target because of who they be or who they be not nothing more select for their ethnicity the parent beg I not to autopsy their child beg I on their knee but I have no choice I suppose I still do not I will give you my report when I be do his phone 's get to be around here somewhere wait Juicy Fruit One Flew over the cuckoo 's next close enough hell the fall will probably kill you Butch Cassidy and the Sunrise Kid great scene jump off the cliff do you try call the cell yeah it be on silent mode or else I would have hear it find it you scare the hell out of I

his clothe but none on his misbaha his what Misbaha muslim prayer bead it be kind of like a rosary but different and I run all the fingerprint through AFIS Interpol the FBI Several worship at the same mosque but there be nothing to connect any of they to this crime right go on Abdul 's prayer rug and his boot test positive for phosphorus saltpeter Semtex and C 4 Explosives yeah which could mean one of two thing give them both to I he be serve in Iraq with fast company a couple of week ago so if he be defuse and handle IED 's that would account for the trace of explosive or or he be handle they once he get back that would not be good Terrorism I clone and mirror Bakr 's hard drive from his laptop he recently visit three Jihadist website it be training video Suicide bomber 's last statement Anti american everything these site be know hub for al Qaeda communication Lance Corporal Bakr visit these well either he or someone that have access to his computer his father good work back to your baby hey Thought you check phone record I do Technically Abdul never place a call or send a text he do however press 11 key before toss his phone up on the roof he want we to find it Code well basic Marine letter substitution Crude but very effective and well he may have name his killer Boss Hans Staiger suspect tie to al Qaeda in Germany know as the recruiter attempt to buy off several custom official in France last year get away where there be no record of Staiger come into this country or anywhere else he could be here with false paper find he we look if he be here he be way underground dig deeply where Mosque bug it that be where this all start get a warrant would be easy if Bakr just send we a text message not if he think someone be monitor or intercept his cell transmission someone be follow he Tony three day of the Condor base on the novel six day of the Condor by James Grady hey I get one for you two find out who kill my Marine Nobody like a know it all Gibbs do Warrant just come through anyone else have a problem with this bug a place of worship check one two three four if this be a catholic church or a doctor 's office we would still be judge hunt I agree

get hurt you can take she Probie do it Compromise Tony will do it I do not want to do it that be impossible we have not even plant a bug yet there be a transmission come from inside the mosque it be already be bug we track the signal back to the FBI frequency Mr Langer I check and no warrant be issue to the FBI I can not confirm or deny if the mosque be under FBI observation this be a murder investigation some interagency cooperation would be nice anything we should know not that I can tell you that be crap we both know that you can say anything you want to do I come at a bad time Jethro

under his wing and then proceed to crush I nothing you do not deserve leave I no choice but to crawl over to the FBI yeah and they actually hire you yeah can you believe that well now maybe the NCIS and the FBI can cooperate on this investigation we may be observe the mosque well that be a little vague I can not tell you any more than that Jethro you know that okay well I hope we do not get in each other 's way well now if you guy find anything out then you will be the last to know hey come on excuse I Director Jethro I think I have it have what a way to find the cause of Lance Corporal Bakr 's death you be go to do that autopsy no well yes well in in a manner of speak but a lot of people be go to have to look the other way start with you Director lose actually I be look for Agent gibb he be just just upstairs a minute ago can I help you yeah you maybe you could give he my card and ask he to call I I be Special Agent Anthony DiNozzo I be in charge here well hey I be Special

charge well I will just call he later but thank anyway what an ass yes indeed you be Langer leer you be leer at Langer what if I be Tony he be cute Cute he be not cute he be like do not speak bullet over Broadway Woody Allen very good you would get a b in my class I could teach your class yeah right Officer David I be go to need you to come down to the evidence garage and I need you to bring someone with you the key here Jethro be discretion we be not go through official channel Mr Palmer official channel take time that be the one thing we do not have Muslims desire their dead to be bury within 24 hour that leave we 13 Doctor Doctor you have 20 minute a minute long you will get find out and I will get fire Clear how do I repay you I just repay you we be even now something wrong Mr Palmer if this be not a muslim family we would not be here that be correct I do not think anyone should get special treatment we be risk our career by do this you can always leave Doctor I be not with you in Bosnia True and I certainly be not on the crusade but 9 11 the Intifada Hamas you have a problem with Muslims Mr Palmer no no I do not but it seem like they have a problem with we Religions have be the basis of conflict for generation so we just live with this until we learn to respect one another all right Mr Palmer let us follow the path of the bullet the resolution 's astonishing yes and magnification you can actually almost see as well as a traditional autopsy Angle of the trajectory indicate the bullet travel through the first intercostal space avoid the heart and bronchial branch of the lung miss all vital organ go to the third intercostal space and exit the back hold your horse there seem to be a bullet fragment chip off the eighth rib and then disappear there be no other exit wound be the fragment still in his body Density 's become an issue we be see too much bone and not enough soft tissue MRI Excellent idea Tea you should not have but thank you well if you change your mind you be an israeli Jew no yes I use to take my family to Haifa I spend my summer in Haifa no just push it to one side you make it arab style Strong I like strong you like Muslims yes may I ask why I mean I do not wish to offend you I be just curious when you grow up in Israel most of your neighbor be Muslim my good friend be Muslim Arab he be a young boy we be very close be you still close no he be kill when I be 12 by an israeli missile strike on a hotel there have be too much death I agree Come on now show we this bullet fragment what be it Mr Palmer it be move his neck be that a bullet fragment no bullet be lead they be non magnetic turn off the power what be it this my dear Officer David be what you call an unexpected turn of event Abby Yay it work what my gibb early warn alarm system the Arabs use to put dry brush outside their tent to alert they in case there be an intruder so I just update it to bubble wrap you call I I know it be a test you want to know what I find Trippy I like it I be able to extract an undiluted sample from inside the needle shaft and voilà I give you the blue ring octopus a what it produce a toxin that be a hundred time more deadly than cobra venom it be the most deadly natural neurotoxin on the planet and it be impossible to trace in the bloodstream you do well because it be not in the bloodstream it be still inside the needle shaft Ducky find perfectly preserve and pure he walk a long way because the needle snap off during insertion it be a result of oxidation and age so that result in metal fatigue Lance Corporal Bakr he only get a partial dose that be why he could walk for two block yeah but it kill he yeah or the bullet I mean it be hard to say I be run the toxicology now be not you go to ask I what why the needle be affect by magnetic force I mean they make these out of 440 carbon it be a non magnetic steel why because the needle be really old it be like from the ' 70 not that that be that be not old I mean well it be old for a needle sure but it be certainly not old for you know a man where there be two company in the United States that handle the toxin they use it for research on antivenom they be both in the DC area Names Morgan Industries and Bio Tonics have an e mail send I already e mail it to McGee and Tony you be my favorite abs lose the bubble wrap go McGoo Morgan Industries be clean got it Probie 's over at Morgan Industries they show no miss venom can I help you yes we need to check your record you see every drop account for there be none miss from inventory check again I 've check four time I be tell you we watch this stuff here you go okay Paycheck Ben Affleck Uma Thurman that be right Ben play the bad guy do dirty work for this company and then they erase his memory beat the bad guy by mail clue to himself we be go to need all your shipping manifest original everything that be be send out of here in the last six month McGee can go back and do the same at Morgan Industries that be a lot of inventory to check we get time okay hey where be you go Jackrabbit I be go to paradise where be you go to the parking lot put your butt in the back of our car go hack into Bio Tonics worldwide track software we follow a shipment of the neurotoxin from Bio Tonics to Stanford University except the university never receive the shipment but as you can see Bio Tonics tracking show that the venom be order and deliver who sign for it nobody it never get there it turn out that the university never even order the neurotoxin so there be nothing miss from the warehouse enable they to walk

boss this be the hallway this be a locker these be our surveillance camera now if I could direct your attention to these monitor here these be the feed from the surveillance camera I be work under the assumption that whoever steal the radar know that we be watch okay use a scanner they find our video frequency have to be nearby McGee that be an excellent question boss yes with our mini transmitter they would have to be within 500 foot then they could steal and record the video signal which I have already do and play they back with these much more powerful transmitter they would have overridden our signal now they would need a pallet jack to get the radar out McGee I do not see the guy that be because you be watch the loop I make of the empty hallway just as we be do during the stakeout when they be go they turn off the loop in the hallway and continue transmit the second loop show the radar still in the storage locker McGee this be this be so great even gibb could understand this he do not off the hook until the radar be find McGee Mr Palmer I think you would go for the night I make it halfway home before I realize I leave my cell phone here what be you work on Dr Mallard anything I

DiNozzo just the flat surface where you can lift the print Tony Jethro be fine I be take up a collection for flower why would I give flower to a dog that attack I maybe because dog be man 's good

killer right there the other angle 's even bad Killer know the plane be under surveillance Gibbs I 've be think we do not know for certain that Jethro attack Hanson I mean he could 've swallow the knife tip when as he be lick Hanson 's wound which would also account for the blood that be all over he you 've already think of that that dog try to rip I limb from limb you do have that effect McGee especially when you bail on our big crime scene ever get a match the knife tip find in Jethro come from a Navy issue tactical boot knife find out who order a new boot knife from Pax River in the past 72 hour already on it boss three people one stand out Evidence locker McGee Get log 421 Petty Officer Perelli yes sir what be this about have you receive the tactical boot knife you requisition how do you know about not yet ma'am what happen to the knife you got issue three year ago I lose it in Hanson 's body you know about our investigation you and Bidwell need to pin it on somebody you pick Hanson be it because he be suspicious of you you kill Hanson and try to frame he for it you set he up by use his phone to call Galante in Panama then you plant cocaine and cash in his house for we to find try to cover your track by make it look like he be kill by his own dog then you kill Bidwell 'cause you think he might crack I be no lawyer but this sound like an awful lot of conjecture to I sir

idea on your own McGee Gibbs the Director be particularly aggressive in her pursuit of the arm dealer La Grenouille Agent Gibbs be curious as to her motivation Gibbs do not get curious he get suspicious what do he suspect that that she believe La Grenouille be responsible for her father 's death be that why she put Agent DiNozzo undercover to get close to he I can not speak to the nature of Agent DiNozzo 's assignment why not you two do have a professional relationship McGeek McGoo McGiggle McGoogle yeah yeah it be very professional yeah then tell I about his assignment this be not

order Archangel await instruction you be there to kill he that be what you do I be there to ensure mission safety I be never give a fire order only because you be call off at the last moment by a deep undercover CIA agent name Trent Kort Director Shepard we be about to lose target Director stand down Archangel stand down now that must have be a shock to discover that Grenouille be be handle by the CIA Regardless Director Shepard manufacture the entire mission to get close to he why to put a bullet in his head we meet only once but I be rather take by the man dredge out of Baltimore Harbor Dead less than two day Maryland M E perform the autopsy she be very good I would like to see the body no four eye be well than two no Cause of death be not much of a mystery a single gunshot wound to the head then what do you want from I from time to time you compile psychological profile on person of interest well follow my encounter with La Grenouille I be ask for my opinion La Grenouille be not your ordinary arm dealer he be not the type to settle dispute with violence you like he do not you perhaps it be cloud your judgment perhaps it be not my judgment that be be cloud yes by the Director herself I would like to know your opinion of that encounter Dr Mallard there be a history between those two something that be consume she how far will she go as far as it take she do manifest obsessive behavior he be try to paint a picture a comprehensive picture of her need for retribution against La Grenouille he be just confirm what he know Duck he be hold something back do you think she could have do it I will get he another time another deal I will be there and I will get he I be sorry sir you can not leave you know what you be go to have to stop I Problem if you want it to be I know it be always be lose on you gibb but they write the rule for a reason I have rule too so I hear any reason to keep we here Leon I be well aware of your relationship with Director Shepard never be comfortable with intimacy between management and staff myself I either if you 've be interview by Agent Fornell you be free to go just to be clear do not investigate this case that guy he just like put on a fancy suit and expect everyone to do everything he say it be a pretty nice suit Come on let us go work to do on what we can not investigate the FBI 's case we investigate the FBI Boss Ziva 's shake the FBI tail car got them run into circle good when she get here she can help you hack into Fornell 's computer I be go to need to go to a public site they 've quarantine all my here use mine but this do not have a wireless signal though I will figure it out Duck your friend in the Maryland M E 's office Dr Hampton need that autopsy report I will have to be charming do not strain yourself go out the back through the hedge it be all very exciting be not it like a cat and mouse game remind I of a part of my life that I will share with you later boss I may be able to hook up my phone and piggyback the signal but I be go to need an I D to get access to the FBI main frame Questions yeah how do you get the boat out just break the bottle you would not be break the chain of evidence now would you Abby on the Portman file doubt it he die in prison two year ago let I know if you 've get something to eat in there 'cause I be starve how starve Klowny Kakes Tarot card want to see what happen next I be die with anticipation Tony we be about to summon the elusive element of the cosmos Concentrate I be with you call the spirit tell they to bring pizza not yet DiNozzo Gibbs give you a mission everybody 's count on you just do what you do well Dance talk Ms Sciuto Mighty generous I 've go over your result with regard to the case in question there be a problem with your theory of the crime a big hole I could drive a truck through it well I may not be able to drive a truck through it 'cause never that great with the double clutch but a truck driver could just care to share well it be obvious I mean you think there be a murder here like right underneath Gibbs ' nose that whatever take place take place without Gibbs know and that could never happen I be go to share a secret with you it be a theory I 've be work on off the book okay the man be magic like dark magic he have eye and ear everywhere he appear like a mist whenever I get a clue he just materialize maybe he bug your lab no I check what be that like it sound aggravate no do he ever get angry Snap Snap never he only use his power for good well sound like you be a fan no crime like this could ever take place under Gibbs ' nose he would not allow it I understand if we could just get back no I do not think you do understand okay one night I be in my lab it be dark and stormy stop okay go a smidge to your left right a smidge to your right back to your right there it be there it be stop be you serious McGee hold that position I 've just barely get a signal here this go to work this thing 's so ancient it do not even have the protocol modern day security system defend against it be bring back memory of play Zork I be tempt to tell it to go throw the crystal orb here we go whoa what be that do not move do not move it be a link indicate an eyewitness statement have not be digitize doubt we could play it even if it have be Witness ' name just an address we need to know what this witness know my arm be kill I the FBI car out front get it their tire not their throat hey boss if you 've get a printer I might be able to convert some of these crime scene sketch to dot matrix this be go nowhere I 've never be entirely certain she be all there hey I remember something something relevant Ms Sciuto Director Shepard she ask I personally to do some forensic work for her I want to know whose fingerprint be on these which be strange I determine that there be a dead man 's fingerprint on a liquor bottle that be leave in her study the Director 's father supposedly kill himself year ago so I guess that do not really help your case but they make it seem like somebody be try mess with her head you know like the CIA maybe try to frame her she be a lot smart than you give her credit for Agent Fornell guy hello NCIS buy you a cup of coffee Miss Benoit I have hope Rene that you and I would meet again in person enjoy a glass of L'Esprit de Courvoisier which you so generously give I this be the good I can do a confession I be actually a medical examiner and your untimely death leave question which only you can answer to wit stipple pattern powder burn on your forehead which though diminish by immersion in saltwater indicate a contact wound at close range no defensive wound so for some reason a cautious man like yourself allow an armed assailant to get extraordinarily close or else the gunshot wound be self inflict my colleague come to the same conclusion the bullet enter the frontal bone just above the left orbit travel in an upward trajectory consistent with a left handed suicide Ducky do you say something to I no I do not well I could have swear I hear you talk down here I be go to come back when you be do the FBI 's convinced you be murder but you do not tell they that do you well you be never an easy man to understand in life why should your death be any different I do wish you would shed some light on this mystery because the prime suspect be a mutual acquaintance of ours that be a start they be expect I at your office Agent Gibbs well their question be not mine question about Tony no question about your father well we 've be here before have not we Toby you be say some pretty bad stuff about I back then I hope you 've learn a few thing since then I know I have yeah you 've do some grow DiNozzo the Director think enough of you to personally select you for an extended undercover assignment Yep she play matchmaker how do you get so close to La Grenouille 's daughter I see where you be go with this you would like to know a few pick up trick I wish I could tell you but kind of a family secret and I take an oath Sorry chip no so you report back to the Director about the girl Jeanne yes well her father be an international arm dealer a threat to the country the world really so yeah I do what I be tell the Director order you to sleep with her be you attract to her yeah so what be the problem I would not call it an order so you do not have any problem develop that kind of a relationship with her no not at all but you develop feeling for her that be not very professional Tony how would that happen gradually and then all of a sudden the Director tell you to break the girl 's heart what have that feel like this be more like a therapy session than an interrogation why be you so interested in my feeling because you have they so strange

stab in the same manner with the same knife in all five tox screen show large amount of rohypnol and alcohol but in regard to the finger or lack thereof I find a curious inconsistency four of the five be sever postmortem base on lividity and blood flow I would estimate several hour after death but the finger of fourth victim be cut off almost immediately maybe someone interrupt he so he have to rush to finish it Abby what be you do Efficiency Gibbs I take off 14 and a half second from what it usually take I to get here so I estimate that I could gain 17 minute a day that would be 85 minute in a week 382 minute in a month so in a year abs yes gibb be that knife go to tell I something yes and no I mean it definitely be the serrate knife that sever the victim ' finger but but I find a partial print in blood on the handle it do not match Hoffman or the other victim I do not think Hoffman be work alone die you stupid machine she seem unfazed those be standard Mossad style copy machine assault tactic McGee she be fine Hey McGee think you be rage against the machine 'cause you have to take down your serial killer boyfriend thank for that Ziva I be just concern I be fine see McGee she be a steely eyed killer Sheket bevakasha I do not know he Borscht belt comedian it be hebrew for shut up really do affect you have you have your mandatory session with the shrink yes still crazy then get off your case well you can stay on this one Abby find a partial print on the murder weapon that do not match our killer Hoffman have an accomplice that be one explanation could be a

potahto yeah well not search just drink so tell I about Debbie just kid Devon very pretty and smart funny terrible sense of direction drive you insane with her incessant movie reference worry about

back with her I just want to know she be okay I be go to help you you already have how so by kill Hoffman one less nightmare you okay never well Thought you be take the day Gibbs ' idea not mine that Hoffman yeah I be review the tape victim number three Monica Bishop judge by the dress look at this guy here he be watch them if Hoffman have an accomplice he could very well be he or he could just be a passerby there he go look he be head in the same direction Hoffman take the girl or he could be go to a bar or he be check to make sure no one be follow they before join Hoffman and kill the woman that be get to be Hoffman 's accomplice Man without a face Spoke to the neighbor they barely know Hoffman Guy be an enigma well he still be find a stack of photo too not a woman in any of they just Hoffman and his Marine buddy any one of them a potential accomplice good a place to start as any gibb I think we close the case on this one yeah find a partial print on Hoffman 's knife that do not belong to he Most serial killer work alone yeah Most would not be the first time a killer work with a partner you get the Cook brother Eric and Lyle Menendez I would not get too excited about a partial print on a knife it could be anything I need to review all the evidence you have I already give you everything I think be relevant well then give I everything you think be not Gibbs you 've get your killer you 've get all your body Most of the body we be still miss five of the finger that he cut off the victim be miss do not mean that there be a second killer well maybe Hoffman keep the body as a prize and his accomplice get to keep the finger DiNozzo you be a cop tell your boss what it be like to have 20 open case file on your desk you know what Rosetti I do not care if you 've get a hundred there could still be a killer out there well I hope you be not look for I be that really what you be hope not even close you know I could buy you a drink or or what you could come home with I why would I do that because you feel guilty about lie to I or because you just kill somebody and need someone to hug why do I have the feeling that you be angle for more than just a hug angle no hope have you be tell I the truth about your girlfriend or be you just take advantage of my raw emotional state yes and yes no easy Easy just reach for my glass you should not do that to I look I do not usually do this kind of thing neither do I be that the gun you shoot Hoffman with no we struggle and then I no it be not the gun so what be it like to shoot someone it be what it be it be what you have to do these be not thing I dwell upon be you scared no sorry that be a that be a dumb question I guess you would not be an NCIS agent if you have a problem with it I be not an NCIS agent I be israeli Mossad Guessing Hoffman 's not the first guy you 've why do everyone think all Mossad agent be assassin be you you know I 've never handle a gun before well you be not go to handle one now well I guess I will just have to handle something else I 've re sample the image as many time as I can McGee try remove compression artifact it be too pixelated do you try detect edge I be detect an edge I be good McGee but I can not work miracle this be impossible I 've tell you once I 've tell you a thousand time there be no substitute for quality source imagery I know where be you go I be go back to work well you think I be go to give up that easily you think I be a quitter you of all people should know that I thrive in the face of adversity you be make the face of adversity I find each of the victim 's blood on the murder weapon Hoffman do not clean the knife after each murder no he do meticulously but I find trace evidence where the blade go into the handle okay look four of the victim have blood type o positive the fifth victim have blood type a positive that be not that strange Most killer do not choose their victim by blood type no no that be not what be strange I also find trace of a b positive then it must be Hoffman 's blood no he be o negative not a match there be a sixth victim McGee whose body have not be find yet do she leave any forward number or address no I be afraid she do not okay well if she make contact will you please notify I thank you you be welcome what be you do check into Locke 's missing girlfriend you same what why Devon Linden Katz yeah not like the musical Starts with a K end with a z thank all right check her medical record what you think she be be lie in some hospital unable to communicate no I think she be be lie in a shallow grave unable to communicate medical record be privileged information you need a subpoena not if you have an IOU from a county clerk with a very expressive poker face hey there it be thank Laramie I owe you well not as much as you owe I of course right guess what Locke 's girlfriend 's blood type be the same blood type Abby find on the knife B positive although it be hard to be positive when the news be so negative million have that blood type only ten percent of Americans have that blood type so you have narrow it down to what million narrow it down a lot far when you consider that she be a regular at the bar frequent by two other victim she could easily be victim number six and your pal Locke could be her killer he be not a killer okay Co killer assistant killer killer 's apprentice Michael be not involve in the murder Michael that be his name that be his first name you do not do not tell I okay tell I what I do or do not do be none of your business Detective Rosetti morning here

match Hoffman there be just no sign of an accomplice what about the video still I have try everything I just I can not get an ID you be admit defeat no I have a new tactical plan by triangulate the height of the landmark like the street light and car and stuff I think I can figure out an approximate height and weight of Hoffman 's allege accomplice it be great there be a page miss tear out that be why the page fall someone tear out the bind why would someone tear out a page how tall be your buddy Locke about six one six two how much do you think he weigh why do you ask why do not you answer

enough for I who be he you do not know I know who send he and I know who he be after one two three Breathe damn it Breathe I do not recall shout be one of the instruction Mr Palmer sorry doctor I guess I get a little carry away hello Jethro new girlfriend no CPR recertification Work have be sufficiently slow lately for I to be able to update they when can I put your name on the list not today give we a minute please Mr Palmer yeah Annie can stay I know that look Jethro I be afraid I be all out of secret you read the autopsy report on the Grenouille murder yes what about it anything bug you normally I be very bugged when a person be shoot at point blank range in the head but in this case despite the man 's charm I be willing to make an exception that a no well pathologically there be nothing out of the ordinary a single bullet enter Rene 's frontal lobe cause catastrophic cerebral hemorrhaging that result in almost instantaneous death yeah yeah I read that then you know as much as I do Jethro I have the impression this case be close it be then why all the dig what be you hope to find Answers Duck there be a reason why sleep dog be leave to lie Jethro California there it be the Director 's rental well what can I tell you kid when you be right you be right the car seem fine yes it do now can we get the hell out of here no that be a good idea we should stay here wait for the Director to catch we snoop what be she do here you mean who be she do you hear that guy on the phone she be probably at his hotel now you be make some sense where to miss Rodeo Drive Venice Beach our hotel or I file kidnapping charge this be not good let I handle this okay hey you can not come up in here NCIS what be go on Fatality look like she fall my kind of place I be not much of a people person I notice not that I do not like them they never seem to like I Decker do not have that problem then why be he dead well save that for the guy that kill Decker you might need it first we have to find he if he know about Decker 's insurance policy he will find we there be no obvious sign of foul play depend on what you mean by obvious she be dead you say she just bury her boyfriend well she obviously you know been hit the bottle she could have fall or jump or be push you know something I do not no she she be just it be you know give we a second excuse I what be you do leave the Director out of this the Director 's car be right there yeah there be 50 car right there well I be not provide security detail for those 50 other Sasha 's be dead for two hour we talk to the Director 20 minute ago she say everything be fine probably just a coincidence you do not really believe that do you no this be not what it look like Gibbs CPR so I guess it be exactly what it look like Ducky want we I know right so what bring the Almighty Gibbs to my humble lab the frog sorry I ask I think that case be close Shell casing contain a variety of useful datum point the first one be this indentation cause by the firing pin its position narrow down the list of possible firearm can you tie it to a specific gun Yep in 2010 that be when the manufacturer will be require by law to microstamp a serial number onto the firing pin today abs well it depend on who you ask I be ask you okay the second data point be this it be breechblock pattern around the back of the shell case it come from the concussive force of the gun fire it will not let you say definitively if a particular gun be use but it can rule a gun out this be interesting that scratch it could be an ejector impression from when the spend case be eject or it could have come from a slight defect in the gun clip I could not really say for sure without inspect the clip but either way I doubt it be definitive enough to be admissible in court I know I have a really bad feeling too why do not you stop I Thought you know where this insurance policy be I never say I know Decker say I do and stop look at my ass not much else to look at of course it might help if you be to tell I what I be look for Decker know that someone be after he and he know why your mystery op any useful insurance policy would contain name Viggo real name target date plus operational blueprint photo we get plenty of those these date be wrong do you have a pen this be Decker 's retirement party in 2007 Crime analyst conference ' 02 September 18th 2004 Hopkins De La Hoya this be some kind of code Bank route number too long for a cash account safe deposit box Ziva again you do not answer it they be go to call in the SWAT team this well be World War III Officer David Sasha Gordon be dead what happen LAPD 's still investigate it appear that she break her neck in a fall Director she be find less than a hundred meter away from your vehicle where be you when three hour ago Director we be assign to protect you this be not just a coincidence where be you I do not appreciate your tone Officer David and despite what Special Agent Gibbs may have tell you coincidence do exist and that be what we have here okay but I be fine there be nothing to worry about I will meet you later to take the red eye flight home good news not for Sasha that go well the Director 's lie she be not fine why would she lie maybe she be force do she use the duress word no well then there you go if someone have a gun to her head she would use the duress word Tony there be something go on here how can you not you do see it you just do not want to get involve she do not want we involve if there be one thing I 've learn about the Director 's private war it be that it be good to stay away for she and for we she be a big girl she can take care of herself besides probably be a coincidence anyway and she be behind one of those expensive window munch on overprice cashews courtesy of Mr Outtatown I tell Sasha to leave town probably go back to her apartment to grab a few thing if Viggo get to she we have to assume she talk know about we and this place and Decker 's insurance policy guess he be go to be on his way if we leave now you can go I be stay this end here you be go to need a clean one gibb we should call he but we be not go to he would want we to would he of course they be partner if the Director be in trouble he would we do not know that she be in trouble okay I will give you that one but you want to be the one to tell gibb that we let

it get what I think I figure out the code John Anthony Walker he be a Navy warrant officer he be bust in ' 85 for sell encryption cipher to the Russians I know that but since I hit a dead end I think I would look into his NIS case file for inspiration and that be when I see it cipher that Walker use be over 20 year old not the cipher I see it be this the code that Decker use be not a code it be an old NIS case file number I do not make the connection because in the NIS day we use short file number so Decker hide his insurance policy in plain sight one of his old file pull it up I can not nothing prior to ' 84 in the system it be in storage Annex across the street you two with I nice work Agent McGee McGee Nice work here you go knock yourself out who be the last person to look in this

nine millimeter casing and a 147 grain LE hollow point slug we use LE hollow point and so do the FBI Secret Service Navy SEALS and a bunch of other law enforcement but it be not the kind of slug that Joe Public can get his mitt on what else a number one two six one hundred and twenty six that be the number of day that Tony McGee and Ziva have be go I really do not think you would let it get into triple digit gibb but now it be way more it be like the third of a whole year I miss they you have lunch with McGee yesterday it be not the same I miss they collectively as a group my three musketeer Tim be the only one I 've see no Tony no Ziva I get postcard from Tony I want they back Gibbs please get they back you have ten day okay I do not want to pressure you so 12 but no more than two week

together put it up on the plasma Keating that be Roberts on the left and our murder victim Vargo be on the right Roberts get out six month ago but here be the kicker Roberts be kill by a bomb blast at a bar in Morocco overnight terrorist attack try to get more now get a link to the raw feed out of ZNN unlucky coincidence must be that be a hell of a bomb blast Casualties four kill include Roberts 13 injure oh my God be not that the number you be call be not available Langer try to reach an israeli contact he be get connection in the intelligence community Mossad want we to put it through channel they be not be very helpful leave it Roberts and Vargo I want everything Phone record bank account e mail last time they see each other last time they speak with each other got it get it you find she now I will do my good hey boss Boss yeah the logarithm of the quotient be the excess of the logarithm of the dividend over that of the divisor high school math Pringle what be your point I put the wrong divisor Recalculate Dallas Boss still need that encryption key still work on it boss Boss Boss I be not really their boss they just call I that because I be a field agent you know I carry the handgun it be good to see you boss you hear from Ziva yeah an e mail every week until about three week ago I think maybe she go on vacation no try undercover McGee Undercover would make sense she be Mossad and all know how to contact her cell phone no long connect yeah gibb I find she have to call in a favor from a friend at Pine Gap you know the big communication base we 've get down put she on do you be connect you okay you hear yeah raw feed out of ZNN you might want to call they thank for the tip what can you tell I not much I be undercover try to win the trust of a man show an unhealthy interest in chechnyan terrorist group Brian Roberts perhaps you should tell I what you know Old Navy friend of Roberts be find murder this morning Steve Vargo work strategic planning top secret clearance who be the target Roberts be meet a chechnyan terrorist by the name of Milaana Shishani by sheer luck she escape the blast but Mossad do not believe she be the target Roberts be why we can only speculate but from what you 've tell I it appear that someone want they both dead Cleaning house possibly who tip you off about Roberts Director Vance we miss you Ziva I miss you too all of you even Tony get to go take care Gibbs yeah you take care too go home rest a kiss for your father good night Papa Steve Vargo what do you know about he Boss I be not sure I can exactly tell you what I know Orders yeah he you okay boss get back to work yes boss People say this be one of the great sport photo ever take Muhammad Ali and Sonny Liston May 25 1965 first round first minute Ali hit he Sonny go down stay down then all hell break loose Lot of people think it be fix thought Sonny take a dive that what you think I think it be easy to jump to the wrong conclusion without all the fact swing away you do not break up my team because of Jenny 's death five month ago I get a series of anonymous call from a Navy Petty Officer eventually he identify himself as Steve Vargo say he have gambling debt and that he be be blackmail into supply highly classify datum to someone what sort of datum he would not tell I but Vargo be a specialist in the Middle East he say he would download a critical file but he have not pass it on change of heart I believe he on the director 's order I fly to DC I arrange to meet he he be go to give I the name of that contact but he do not turn up next day he do not report for duty now I know why you do not answer the question Leon the reason I break up your team Gibbs be because whoever be blackmail Vargo be an NCIS agent not one of mine no from what Vargo tell I I narrow it down to three agent only reason I break up your team be so I could form a new one so you can help I find out which one of these three be betray their country you be go to get around to tell I have no evidence I figure I put you with they your radar would go off and one day you would come to I and say you have a doubt about one of they a doubt a doubt Leon I get a doubt about every one of they get a former FBI guy who do not listen get a boy genius who do not drive get a lawyer who do not shoot make the jump to NCIS eight month ago from the FBI he get no special treatment but you do recommend he he call I and you endorse he now you be have second thought not the agent you think you be get why do not you just say it he use you to get inside the agency do not make he guilty just clever Pentagon know there be a security breach they do not know how bad I 've seize all of Vargo 's computer and his hard drive we 've be work on they that be why I move he down there seven level of encryption so far every level hard to crack than the last I be not the only one who Vargo contact confide in his old Navy buddy Brian Roberts then a week ago Roberts turn up in Tel Aviv Vargo be a specialist in Israel and that be why you send Ziva back Mossad mount an operation they be go to pick up Roberts last night in Morocco but they be not quick enough someone be tie up a loose end I think Vargo tell Roberts the name of the NCIS agent and I be guess Roberts be try to sell that name to anybody who be willing to pay so what four month you get nothing we get nothing Vargo 's computer have be seize standard operating procedure it be in the agent ' manual section 35 sub section two clause e Seizure of evidence you be make that up and this matter why they be seize four month ago after he fail to report to duty make perfect sense who seize they Us this agency NCIS then it would 've be log be not log legally that could cause a chain of evidence problem got to be in the building somewhere Evidence locker maybe down with the geek what okay talk to I Update anyone sorry go you go Sir Keating Vargo close out two bank account the day before he disappear withdraw a total of 11 350 no credit card transaction since Agent Lee Vargo 's command officer be refuse to see we without legal representation cover his butt I be have trouble find a JAG officer with the appropriate security clearance you get anything Special Agent we seize Vargo 's computer the day after he disappear but they be never log into evidence probably down in the basement with the rest of the I will handle it Witness statement yes sir this be Agent Lee NCIS be Major Clay available I will hold Night boss see you tomorrow boss Night boss good night Night boss good night boss you call he Director 's on his way down you like work down here McGee Boss I be sorry he make it very clear to I that I could not talk to anyone except for he would not have stop you in the past well it be not the same we be a team I would give this up in a heartbeat to be back work with you and Ziva again and DiNozzo yeah he too you can tell he we crack the eighth level of encryption which be not actually accurate because they be not really level of encryption so much as packet of information all encrypt with a new layer of protection that that you really do not need to know about now this next series of packet contain system archive log information time stamp data transfer report I really have be down here too long have not I the day before he disappear Vargo connect a thumb drive about this size to a classified computer and download a 2 75 gigabyte file what sort of datum do not know have not crack that level of encryption something he could easily hide probably take it with he or put it some place safe maybe thank you McGee keep Agent gibb in the loop will do good night Director good night boss Night solve this first then we will talk Ziva too good morning Dr Gibbs Hey Duck what be this shadow here this area right here it be a clearly mark fracture of the ramus mandibulae Broken jaw cause by a blunt instrument possibly the butt of the gun no sign of a fight at the scene already in the bed possibly asleep something disturb he a noise before he can get up the assailant strike Unconscious or daze certainly allow the assailant time to pick up a pillow to silence the fatal gunshot no surprise Jethro no tell tale mark or bruise to help you with your investigation just a rather unreveale death I be sorry to say do I miss something the pillow the pillow yeah the pillow the pillow abs the pillow good morning Gibbs Morning thank you be welcome the pillow the one with the bullet hole or the one with the blood and the bullet hole the one the killer fire through Powder burn some Problem there be just not as much as I would have expect and if you jam a gun into a pillow to suppress the noise of a gunshot there would be more powder burn they would leave a distinct pattern in the crease of the pillow see it be barely even scrunch up at all as a means of silence a gunshot this would not be very effective be not try to silence the gunshot just want to cover the victim 's face squeamish shooter sound like something I would do I mean if I be to do it not that I would ever do it but if I be to do it I get something here be right down but if I do I would shut my eye or or use a pillow yeah get something here boss want to call Vance no he can wait we do an extensive search through Vargo 's phone record Home office cell no unusual flagged number McGee you do not get I down here to tell I something you do not find the trailer park have a pay phone search through the phone record the day after Vargo move in there be three call place from that pay phone to NCIS who main switchboard but by crosschecke the phone log on the main server against all incoming call at the time reference the legal department Special Agent Lee be this something I should be seek advice on you be the lawyer you feel you need counsel by all mean call someone I never knowingly have any contact with Petty Officer Steve Vargo he call you three time from a pay phone at the trailer park just before he be murder oh my God that be he you remember talk to he the timing 's right and four month ago I receive three call from a man who refuse to identify himself it be from a pay phone I could hear he feed the coin he want legal advice about what he say he have be steal from the Pentagon he would not say what I figure it be siphon off money from a Pentagon account he refuse to say and then he just stop call and you do not tell anyone I file a report and I put it in the system it be very thin nothing to go on nobody ever ask I about it if you check my report filing for that week you will find they should not be a problem then thank you Agent Lee would you ask McGee to step in on your way out please yes sir Sir sound credible that be what Vargo say to I maybe check Lee 's file on the day that Vargo call and see if she log in a report full background check on all of they Lee Keating Langer Phone record bank card credit card get it any update with the hard drive well we be still try to crack the encryption but there may be another way see I think that we can find out what classify material Vargo be download go on the only information we have be the file 's hash number every file have one and no two be the same if we can access the Pentagon 's system we can scan for that hash number and it should lead we to the file Vargo download of course we would have to go through some channel that the fast way I be worried you might ask I that we do not have this conversation McGoo it be true tv really do add ten pound you been hit the jelly donut again how do I look I never think

would not try to get back at Gibbs do not forget to ice that because he be a key witness the key witness in a murder trial start tomorrow still get to talk to he why Marine from his unit be murder Kale a suspect I will know after I talk to he when have it happen early this morning you get wrong guy Kale be lock up with we for two week could not do it then it will not hurt to ask why his print be at the crime scene Defense lawyer find out Kale 's be investigate he will be discredit Marine be torture Tobias Kale might be able to help we find out who do it nothing official no tape no note and it happen right here right now in front of I Tough on a Marine be coope up like this yes sir I 've already tell Agent Fornell everything what do you want to know how your fingerprint get on Lance Corporal Brewer 's toolbox my toolbox he be my friend I let he borrow it why what be go on Brewer 's dead murder no can not be those tool your tool use to torture he who you tell I I have I have no idea all right Agent Gibbs Interview 's over what interview Tobias hey good luck with your investigation who be you prosecute anyway you never say no no I do not when we get back want you to find out about the case Fornell 's work on think he be hide something I think they both be FBI sure have their finger in a lot of pie Terrorism drug organize crime Alec what be crime that land people in jail no the question be what be case in court tomorrow involve an FBI agent by the name of Tobias Fornell what be US v Captain Melville 's fish and Tackle you be right the FBI do have many finger in many pie Captain Melville wait a second Moby Dick sound fishy it be get to be a pseudonym Pseudonym Explain sometimes the FBI will use a phony name on a case if they be try to hide the identity of people they be prosecute and Fornell give we nothing well be not in a give mood though he be generous enough to give Kale an alibi you think Fornell would lie to Gibbs if he feel he must say the woman 's be evasive to her friend about her vacation to Israel I be intrigue by how intrigued you be by this Tony and I be curious that you be curious that I be intrigue what be his name I do not believe I say I be actually see anyone although it would be very difficult to go to Israel and not see anyone at all it be quite populated you know that be cute I do not see why you be have trouble admit this you know you be in Israel for four month plenty time to hook up with someone in that amount of time Tony would 've hook up with several someone what be it you really want to know depend Ziva on on what it be you do not want I to know sorry to interrupt you guy but I just get into the FBI 's true name file and look who be list with Captain Melville 's Fish Tackle none other than Rick Azari Fornell 's big fish no wonder he be keep his card so close to his breast Torture as a device to bring about a confession have be around since well before the Middle Ages back then it be consider a necessary part of the judicial process maybe that be how lawyer start to get a bad reputation perhaps but it be a nasty business especially for the low class a commoner for example be consider constitutionally incapable of honesty in court unless he or she be torture do not seem like a very reliable method for get at the truth quite right but as you can see the process persist to this day I have a very funny brush with torture once in Edinburgh I perform an autopsy on a fellow whose torturer have take his entrail mix they with oatmeal and make himself a haggis you do yeah well I I now know how Lance Corporal Brewer spend his last hour ragged cut to his hand and forearm probably use this half inch chisel Defensive wound he fight hard to get away Notice however the pattern of these cut Precise Methodical the slashing design to inflict the maximum pain but not death at first I think it be the X Acto knife I know now it be the trusty box cutter Poor lad pass out at some point I swab his nasal passage Abby confirm the presence of ammonium carbonate smell salt they revive he and then the torture continue yeah this be the fatal blow a single deep puncture wound it breach the femoral artery they put the poor lad out of his misery with a Phillips head screwdriver Torturer get what he need Boss find out who Fornell be go after Rick Azari 53 year old bear in New York City one of the most notorious criminal on the East Coast he be a one time protégé to colombian american crime boss Alonzo Torres after Torres be send to prison by the FBI Azari take over he be 25 year old Lot of funeral the year Azari take over and he rule that way ever since Trial for murder twice walk both time now the FBI have another shoot Azari 's be charge for the murder of a drug dealer by the name of Randall Carlson Kale be the only witness no wonder Fornell 's protect he Azari go down for murder if Kale testify if not Azari walk again boss you be not go to like this just get an e mail from a friend at the US Marshal 's office the FBI have sign a deal with Kale what kind of deal immediately after the trial Kale be go to be put into the Witness Protection Program so even if he do murder Brewer we will never know will be like he never exist just like Fornell want it can not believe Fornell lie to Gibbs again well technically he do not lie he just simply withhold information but why would one friend withhold information from another maybe that friend feel it be the good thing for everyone Best for everyone or good for herself her or he what be you do McProbie you write Fornell 's eulogy I be check Kale 's cell record why because Gibbs be extremely pissed and I think that he would want I to what be you do whatever Gibbs would want I to get start on do Agent Fornell where 's Gibbs Upstairs Conference room hi Bye for a guy that be about to be hand his head he seem to have it firmly on his shoulder Calm before the storm Gibbs versus Fornell it be like Frazier Ali or Rocky versus everyone have not see that look since I propose to your ex wife you get something to tell I spare I the drama Jethro you know damn well I could not tell you about Kale 's immunity not without risk my witness your witness may be a murderer Kale be in our safe house at the time that Brewer be kill I be pretty sure we 've already go over this who be babysitte he you my man come on Jethro print on an old toolbox we both know you do not have a leg to stand on and what be that a leg Couple Marines in Kale 's former unit see Kale and Brewer argue outside a bar last month two drunk Marines bump chest that be your case the argument be about a third Marine a PFC Michael Strauss also in Kale 's unit you talk to he work on it he be on a four day leave well you get a medicated Marine with an anger management problem and his print at the murder scene what be it you be hope to find Jethro the truth what be you McDoing McGee Working on Kale 's phone record think you already McDid that I do but as it turn out all activity on Kale 's cell phone suddenly stop three week ago well that make sense that be when he be place into protective custody FBI probably give he a clean phone we would have which be why I 've be try to breach the FBI 's clean phone list so far I have have no luck you ever hear of a good old fashioned paper trail McGoo 'cause that be what be on top of your head right now I get Kale 's phone record of the last four year see that prefix right in front of your face that be Boynton Beach Florida my friend Boynton Beach you know what they get there Sun sand old people what be your point Kale call the same number every Sunday morning for the past four year what do you think that mean his parent that be right Mother accord to his file his only live relative you be right I will run her phone record and see if there be be a new number call I like to get to the bottom of thing it be my specialty I do a little research on Azari School paper I find out you two go all the way back to your probie day 25 year 26 I know Azari when he be only a kid no more than a lackey he be a wheel man for Alonzo Torres until you bring Torres down that bust give I a career meanwhile Azari quietly take over the rein kill at least five his first year probably a dozen more since it be nature of the job you cut one head off another grow back I could have have he when I take down torre I could have easily make a deal to get Azari but I underestimate he I think he be a harmless little punk you make a mistake no marry your second wife be a mistake this Azari 's long overdue Jethro I want this son of a bitch yeah even if it mean give your key witness a free pass do I a favor Jethro stop dig I give my word Kale be not involve in Brewer 's death be that what you know Tobias or be that what you want to believe I get it a new cell number 's be call Mama Kale the last three week okay call the number back trace it and do and do it be register to the FBI you have his call

that his good buddy Kale torture and murder he why be Kale so intent on kill his friend maybe the med he be take send he into a psychotic rage or maybe his friend lie to he about a romantic attachment Torture appear to be the order of the day look for these Doctor Traumatic removal of the fingernail from the first second and third digit of the left hand and the second and third of the right that be

vertebra snap his neck which no doubt interrupt his central nervous system try to close his mouth yeah too much resistance first stage of rigor smallest muscle first Hands foot jaw yes it appear this Marine be try to tell we something but what be you still sure this guy be in your custody the night of Brewer 's murder I stand by the word of my man maybe you should stand by the open bathroom window Azari 's trial begin tomorrow that be a red letter day the whole case hinge on Kale 's testimony you can not have he you want Azari to walk what be the prosecution 's closing argument it take one murderer to know another Kale 's not a murderer boss at least he do not kill Strauss he could not have Strauss die at least four hour ago that be one hour before Kale arrive at the apartment I be take

brother you need to put the mold on hold give the rope a little slack Boss want we to take a look at the original crime involve Azari the one Kale witness the one Fornell be desperate to reel in what be we look for I do not know phosphor that be weird why would the dead drug dealer have phosphor on the sol of his shoe why do you sneak away from the safe house to visit Strauss could have just call I do do not get an answer neither have we why do you go see he I be worried why News of Brewer 's death would have hit he pretty hard they be tight like brother but you and Brewer be a different story a couple of Marines overhear a violent argument between you two it be nothing just a disagreement about what Money Girls iraqi war policy drug buying or sell use Strauss have a problem Strauss then why fight with Brewer I try to keep the lid on Strauss when I be his squad leader when I be retire that job fall to Brewer you think he be drop the ball it be not easy walk away from your unit be it

an eye be not that enough you feel so strongly about it why do you wait until morning to report it I be scare Decorated Marine Three tour in Iraq battle Taliban insurgent in Afghanistan before that and you be scared you be 30 foot away assume a two to one scale then Kale positively identify Azari from 60 foot away assume he have 20 20 vision it be possible not possible it be anything but possible it be impossible which be what not possible mean Kale would have have to have have more than 20 20 vision to identify Azari he would have nee night vision the phosphor on Carlson 's shoe be

Abs How be Harry he be innocent he be get an alibi for both murder do he have any idea how the camera get in his lunch box he be moonlight last month the killer could have plant the camera while Harry be off base if he plant the camera month ago he could not have know Gibbs 's assign to the case he be target Gibbs from the beginning you must 've really piss somebody off it be not a short list of people that you 've anger just because you have rock solid principle and so it be easy for people to misunderstand that and misconstrue you know people why do not you quit while you be behind I be try it be not about I whatever it be about we 've have a serious breach in security not to mention a serial killer still out there I 've get a press conference in five how close be we the phone call rule out our only suspect Sam Loomis be with we when the killer call keep I update somebody get McGee a new pair of shoe can you trace the signal abs I do not even know how it be broadcast but I will find out just I have two question this video it be different than the other why okay what be the other question can I stay with you tonight that be why I 've something very special plan for you Agent Gibbs what do you have plan well I be hope you could tell I Duck this be a fascinating individual Jethro I can think of another word for he yeah crazy well the precise term be narcissistic personality disorder yeah well I be familiar with that too yes but where Agent DiNozzo have an excessive need for admiration he have empathy as well something our killer lack it be all a game to he yes and one he have choose to play with you I notice why like all narcissist he believe himself to be the hero of his own story and all hero need a villain apparently for that role he have cast you do not care who he kill well he want his 15 minute he want to be famous and sadly the more he kill more famous he become I shudder to think what he have plan for a grand finale perhaps some sort of doom yes I know I would see that before Duck the killer 's last clue be quite literal I suspect the same here that countdown likely refer to the time of the next murder need something more specific than that yeah well this be the doomsday clock it be a symbol of how close the human race be to nuclear annihilation the clock time change with the geopolitical situation it be currently set to five minute to midnight Less than three hour from now if Ducky 's right we be already out of time if Ducky 's right then the murder location be in one of the other two clue I will send alert to all church in the area shipyard harbor and Navy McGee Yeah boss I do not know Tony and Ziva get the easy one Phone call McGee right still work on back trace the killer 's call something wrong boss he be play with we he be be play with we get we do exactly what he want we to do what choice do we have you want to evacuate the Navy Yard he be come here how do you know that could mean anything it mean his next victim be go to be in the Navy Yard I do not know if you 've notice but we run the Navy out of the Navy Yard and you just want to abandon ship base on a hunch the camera in Harry 's cart Video be not for we it be for he you think that be recon Killer be scout the base NCIS I get but why evacuate the whole Yard you can not kill anybody Leon if there be no one here to kill all right I will give you point for the unexpected we be go to run a security lockdown drill next week move it up not sure if I hope you be right or wrong yeah McGee Boss I be run the killer 's call through a spectrum analyzer and I notice that McGee the call the killer be not actually on the line it be a record recording what do you mean a recording sound like a conversation he must have prerecord segment use your voice to trigger generalized response could have be anywhere anybody not anybody Abby 's be work on the jani cam she be able to get a print off the lens explain the timing of the killer 's call to you Loomis have it prerecord in case we get too close what well way to look innocent than have the killer call while he be in our presence Alibi do not check out boss five minute to spare boy you guy must really not have any other suspect we get enough where have you get that look familiar yeah I use to shoot time lapse shot with it it got steal from my place about a month ago do you report it no I fire my

increase in vascular pressure no doubt do for dramatic effect our killer be nothing if not a showman nice timing yeah well the advantage of a transdermal delivery system be that it be remarkably precise Jethro it be not every day that you suffer a setback in a case Setback this man die in your custody be murder in my custody exactly right under your nose I can imagine how you must feel what be your point my concern be that the killer know how you feel he be push you for some reason you be the arch enemy in this narrative that he be construct one can not help but wonder towards what be he

not want to let some newbie get in our way you know I hear rumor that Gibbs refuse to take one Wrong they will not give he one think about it you take a date back to your family 's house you want to make a good impression you want they to like you you do not introduce they to your weird Uncle Jethro until like the fifth date since when you an expert on fifth date DiNozzo you be very right about that Bank guard shoot dead in Quantico Quantico yeah you hear right McGee Let us go there you go appreciate it Tommy thank you Agent Gibbs Ray Vittorio bank guard Weapon be still holstere never give he a chance to shoot surrender it be no mystery what kill he you know when I be young I use to take solace when the victim be elderly I think well at least he be have a full life but now that I be old I do not get the same solace apparently no one actually see the guard get shoot they all have their face bury in the carpet Bank manager see he walk into the bathroom before the robbery step back out and bam fall here how much they take this branch just receive the money delivery Paul Harris corporate security they take 27 000 could have be bad not for he sorry of course I do not mean that this bank ever be hit before no no never this be Quantico I mean come on it be a freaking Marine base that house the FBI Academy Security camera I will get the footage to your office right away Ziva DiNozzo witness statement on it boss I think they be go to kill we all I mean they train we for this but two guy ski mask automatic weapon maybe Glocks sir they be bark order all business definitely three of they big guy Guns big gun I only see one there could have be more car dark Sedan I think it be a pickup it be a red pickup or orange maybe it be a white SUV I get a good look at it you ever shoot anybody mister Thanks Jethro good guess two bad guy in the bank a third one drive boss possibly a white SUV I put out a BOLO there be two gate lead in and out of Quantico both of they be close down within minute of the robbery not enough time to make it out what kind of idiot rob a bank with thousand of Marines and half the FBI around yeah Gibbs White Chevy Suburban where main gate White Chevy Suburban east of the main gate perimeter road you two go the suspect may be on the move Getaway car do not leave the base not idiot pro I do not understand if witness do not get a good look at something why do they talk out of their ass talk out of one 's ass that would be your area of expertise Tony I be go to let you answer that query the general public be about as observant as your average probie or new recruit I be a train eye I know every inch of my environment be that a fact that be a fact Jack what do we know Bank robbery occur moment after an armored car delivery what do that suggest Perfect time a little too perfect Denzel Washington Clive Owen inside Man do an inside job Director Vance I be just explain your theory of theft in the workplace which be certainly an epidemic and very wrong this be Agent Dwayne Wilson one of the new recruit he be assign to the fraud unit for his two week visit but he be a former Marine station at Quantico Thought he might be helpful so I 've temporarily reassign he to your team that be great welcome aboard thank thank you so Dwayne have you be brief on this case Director Vance give I some of the particular and you hear Tony 's inside job theory the problem with Tony 's theory be they only get 27 000 it seem like a lot of effort for such a little reward maybe that be as much as the bank hold in cash do you think to ask do you you you if they wait three day it would have make a big difference Holiday weekend for the base Lot of Marines withdraw cash for a weekend getaway we be talk hundred of thousand of dollar well you would think an insider would 've know that Dwayne crime scene photo Abby 's lab go now yes sir where be Abby 's lab Boss get the security footage of the bank robbery put it up you be look at it what that be it Digital artifact I 've try to reconstruct the image but it be too far go Watch start here end here they be extremely fast know how to disable the camera be in and out of the bank in 93 second fix it McGee I can not it be go what what do you mean it be go the bank use camera that transmit their signal through a computer network to a central security company I search through access log I search through keystroke log no one access the security system at the time it go down Owner of the getaway car be a 64 year old secretary by the name of Patsy Kipp she report the SUV steal five day ago long time to hang on to a steal car I be think this be not an inside job boss if these guy have wait another three day they would 've get away with the big weekend cash delivery over 600 grand Gee where have I hear that before yeah Dwayne Come on Tony grab credit from a recruit I follow up and check with the branch manager that be what an experienced special agent do Dwayne Agent Dwayne Wilson the new recruit the director assign to we to you you do not know he do not know I just find out I 've be assign a rookie only for a few day I do not need he you need all the help you can get a bank robbery in Quantico be highly embarrassing if we can not protect our own house how can we protect the nation FBI want to take over I assert that Quantico be first and foremost a Marine base and as such fall under our jurisdiction SECNAV back I that argument be hold for now but I be go to need a quick resolution I prefer to choose my own team just like you choose Special Agent Langer that do not work out very well do it want to hear I say I make a mistake about Langer Lot of people make a mistake about he it be history be it Leon let I know what you think about the rookie so Major Mass Spec or Big daddy like he sometimes like to be call analyze solid liquid vapor and solution and then an ionizer convert these substance into a gaseous state then the ion they be sort accord to their M z ratio hey no touch sorry this be from the getaway car be you follow all this Dwayne we give you evidence and you tell we what it be yeah I guess that be basically it hey gibb I be just give Agent Wilson a tour of Abbyville you be Dwayne yes sir you two have not meet Awkward what have you get abs lot of burn out ash from the SUV no touch what be it with you two sorry I also find trace of an accelerant somebody really want this baby to burn destroy evidence not just any evidence Gibbs Wait till you see what Big Daddy find trace of magnetic ink and a blend a blend 25 cotton and 75 linen you know what make that blend so special only the Bureau of Engraving and printing be allow to use it Money technically they call it rag paper it be hard to burn exactly which explain the accelerant how much do they barbecue base on the amount of trace rag paper and magnetic ink I would say all 27 000 this be a sophisticated operation that take time and money to plan and after all that they burn the proceed time money futility sound like one of McGee 's date night it be not futility Tony it be by design where have I hear that before all right give I some theory maybe they could not get off the base because of the lockdown so they destroy all the evidence they could have steal a second car to get out maybe they want embarrass the FBI already do that we could be look for a recently parole felon with an ax to grind why would you call on I last boss I be go to say what they say honest I have a theory but it be not flush out never mind Agent Wilson I do not have a theory sir Agent gibb but if we have access to FBI file I would search other unsolved robbery that knock out security camera follow up on our theory and bank security footage know it on it get it get it boss since you do not have a theory how about you help Agent Wilson with his Agent get it where do we start FBI let us go smarty pant Agent Langer one of they be betray their country Langer make the jump to NCIS eight month ago from the FBI he get no special treatment but you do recommend he be I under investigation should you be I would like a straight yes or no sir Lee it be Langer betray their country it be Langer you do recommend he Sign this please could you have suggest something that would require more paperwork I think the FBI have this kind of stuff on computer they do here be your copy they want to take the case they be try to paper we into submission five year of unsolved case Interagency transfer mean legal 's go to be involve which mean you 've be here one day you 've already break Gibbs ' rule 13 Rule 13 yeah rule 13 never ever involve lawyer thing be bind to turn nasty I will remember that you should Gibbs have be divorce three time he have seven rule that involve lawyer none of they pretty you do not need to know them all just 13 it be the umbrella one what how be Gibbs to work for what have you hear that bad guy would rather confess than be interrogate by he that his steely gaze can cool a room by five degree that he can only be kill by a silver bullet like a werewolf they be all true except for the silver bullet part might give he indigestion or heartburn but I do not think it would kill he any other question just one what be gibb get against I you nothing do not exactly get a welcome feeling from he well he be not exactly the Mr Rogers type I just get a gut feeling he do not like I oh you have a gut feeling like he be get something against I maybe against all outsider be I right long story to that one what be the short version last outsider he let in turn out to be a bad apple how bad that bad here we go the start of a very bad day for Mr Vittorio the start of his last day you mean Kid run with ice cream never end well Mom apologize and Vittorio head to the bathroom that be it camera go down check the security footage the last three day because because they be pro and pro plan they would have watch the bank before they hit it come in Agent Lee I need a legal opinion of course it be rather sensitive how hard be it to terminate agent terminate specifically new agent this pile I be sell on this pile not so much and you want to terminate those in the not so much pile I just want to know my legal option all these agent be sign on under the old administration now I be not say that there be not some fine people here but you would prefer to be able to choose like I say option I understand well new agent be probationary I know do I need cause to terminate they no if you can articulate a substantive reason to terminate that be all you need even before they go to fletc absolutely that be all I need to know thank you you be welcome sir Agent Gibbs I be so sorry I okay I can be such a klutz sometimes that be okay now you be all settle back into

from the bad I need you to do a write evaluation on Agent Wilson why he be borderline why stick he with I then he have to go somewhere I be go to need that evaluation will not be with I long enough Bachelor 's degree from an online school only recently accredit GPA mediocre at well do not speak a foreign language Computer skill barely existent put your stamp on this agency be you Leon our agent

what be leave of the back of his head hollow point this crew have no qualm about what they might have to do and they come armed to do it you be deal with cold blooded people Jethro yeah and to rob a

come watch outside the bank it be a ' 99 white Suburban then 4 minute 23 second later same Suburban definitely case the bank Question be why do they wait another three day before they hit it the other question be why do they burn the money afterwards stop it right there that be a different bank guard that be why they burn the money because they be not after the money no they be after Vittorio this be a hit the bank manager say Ray Vittorio be out sick three day prior to the bank robbery confirm your theory I do not understand if you want someone dead you knock on the door they answer you shoot they Easy for some Ziva 's right though why rob a bank just to kill someone Collateral damage so they want Vittorio 's death to look like collateral damage murder investigation be different than a bank robbery and we 've be investigate a bank robbery not anymore Ziva I will do a full background check on Ray Vittorio and I be just check to see if he have a criminal record look at that Bingo 1978 felony conviction for handle steal property and he be allow to carry a gun non violent offender grant a restoration of right certificate 'cause he serve only two year 30 year ago be clean ever since or he have not be catch so why an NCIS agent to protect and serve my country come on Dwayne I be train in the art of extract the truth you can not snow I I can not no you can not for the travel no the babe no carry a gun no retirement plan no no to make a difference that be a placebo question whatever you say be you serious I mean make a profound difference in a man 's life like like what my dad be an enlisted Marine in Vietnam accuse of murder an officer say everyone make he for the murder except one NIS agent that agent keep investigate even after his boss tell he to stop end up exonerate my dad if not for that agent Dad never would 've marry Mom never would 've have I Dad never forget tell we to always include he in our prayer I want to be NCIS to make that kind of a difference okay I buy that why do you become an NCIS agent for the gun and the babe you be kid right I get something Klaasson 's Diamond Boutique in Maryland six month ago it be a regular day right and then wait for it and finally 97 second later four million dollar in diamond out the door none of which have turn up since the robbery witness claim they see two man in ski mask Getaway driver make three these be our guy they be good and they know it that be their weakness be we back to robbery as a motive that be the robbery Vittorio 's the murder money commonality employee relative you chase everything now yeah Duck I have the Wilson assessment on my way Robbery Homicide please I will hold can I help certainly can long night Coffee finish you know Jethro the more time I spend with someone the more accurate I can make my evaluation work from other people 's assessment and report be far from satisfactory but I will give it a shot this agent be more street smart than book smart he possess great inner strength he be very focused he have a strong sense of justice that drive he he be unrelenting to the point of obsession we be not talk about a good agent here we be talk about an exceptional investigator but such dedication come at a cost marry married four time divorce three that be a nice try Duck I be not finish Jethro we be talk about a man who act on his gut instinct who rely on his ability to judge people and he be rarely wrong as a result he be a man who never suffer from self doubt until now you do not have all the answer you recommend that Agent Langer be bring into the agency now as a result of his action you be have difficulty trust your judgment about this young man you be simply feel vulnerable Jethro appreciate the assessment what be that it be a test program to check the bank 's wireless internet connection why because I have already check the security system Process of elimination then it be always nice to look busy when the boss walk in Hit pay dirt boss the security company that be protect Klaasson 's Diamond Boutique be the same security company the bank use in Quantico which be own by Paul Harris his company be maxe out on its credit line and be

freshman 's have a senior moment boss how the US would respond to a terrorist attack on a target of interest in Israel or the Middle East what Langer hack from our system Gold star McGee study up I be up I be up boss I just freeze for a second electronic file like Domino need to be accessible by multiple source President Joint Chiefs yet they need to be secure SECNAV want to prevent another breach the only way to assure that would be off network stand alone system hardwire directly to the White House and the Pentagon like this one here a labyrinth of security measure surround the Central Access Hub Housing Domino can not be hack because it be closed circuit which make the file unstealable well we be go to steal it it be a test breach the facility enter the central hub Retrieve Domino Extract without leave a trace boss it be an impossible mission I suddenly see myself dangle from wire our leak our responsibility use any resource do not let out specific I want to hear a plan shall we play a game Matthew Broderick in War Games do not say the word War Game no one else know the guard man this facility they do not even know there be a test come okay first thing we need pizza I say we go with a fire drill please stop pitch the fire drill I think I get it we be not dig a tunnel or build a catapult or set up a series of pneumatic tube although I be partial to the concept no I have not figure

fool you with the mirror on the video surveillance we put the camera on a loop we can use that can use that okay get into an inaccessible building how many bad guy have break in here the Trojan horseman hide inside a hollow out seat of a taxicab to access the evidence garage a taxi can not get into the front gate of a high security facility any other bad guy get in Agent Lee be this up for grab if you can answer the question well it be before my time but I be guess Ziva 's brother half brother Ari he infiltrate NCIS in a body bag we get a body in there get the guard off guard but do it get we in the door follow up question Hypothetical for the cheese say that a dead body be discover at a top secret facility okay what kind of top secret facility NORAD well that be not our jurisdiction the Navy equivalent yeah off the book hush hush but Navy operate can you be more specific say a dead sailor about the facility not the body that be all we get would they call we yeah I can not see why they would not help yourself thank you small piece okay okay let us talk extraction we need to be like a dentist we get to kill the nerve take the tooth how Subterranean the plumbing system one way valve join up with the main trunk under the street outside they can not get in that way but they can get out thank for volunteer we for frogman duty it be a slam dunk boss I be sense

soon be reunite Cuban prohibit in the States I trust you will not tell anyone Director Vance have arrive sir she be awake what be go on I be not entirely sure Deckard 's bullet may not have be real but his gun butt sure be if the bullet be not real then they know we be come they be in on it too oh well yeah they be in on it I do not know about too apparently we do not get the full picture who be that man you do not recognize he no well there be this little drinking game sailor teach I during my time as an agent afloat someone call for a coin you pull out one of these whoever have the high officer 's coin whoever be rub elbow with the big brass everyone else have to buy he drink that be who that man be the downside here be someone 's lie to we the upside be we will never have to pay for a drink again Mr Secretary do you know where I be tonight Leon the Kennedy Center sir I check with your scheduling assistant a visit production of Chekhov 's the Cherry Orchard a well deserve distraction Ignorance may have be your good defense a man of sound judgment might have opt to schedule this affair for a less cluttered evening I be sorry to pull you out of it sir it be unavoidable I love the Russians their cold calculate approach to this business of living make I feel positively sentimental by comparison do you have a light gibb be not it for all intent and purpose sir it should appear to anyone watch that we be conduct a test Security go off effectively in a typical exercise of this nature you would 've be call in to assess the situation we have to delay our own response time to correspond obviously you 've script this little play Leon just tell I where to go and how much time I need to spend here there be still the off chance I might rejoin the Ambassador and our respective wife for a nightcap yes sir have you determine whether this elaborate ruse be worth the effort we have confirmation there be still a security breach in NCIS my team do not set off the alarm someone get into the central hub really hey your door 's lock I change one little thing and you all lose your mind be this because of the body snatcher be you accuse I of be a pod person I be talk about the theft Abby you have not hear try begin at the beginning Jimmy instead of the middle okay the sailor 's body Dent I have he all pack up and ready to go I sign he over to transport for delivery to the mortuary and then he got redirect you lose a body I do not lose he no he be steal and that be not even the weird part we show up at the crime scene and there he be I think Gibbs have something to do with it and Dr Mallard look like he want to kill someone I just do not want it to be I so I be go you can not hide here please no hey abs hey you alone yeah gibb send I back I think you do not have any work to do what be you do here so late what be you do here so late I guess I be allow to talk about it now we have a mission it be a war game I understand yeah we fail wait why do you understand what do you mean I be understand I understand that you be understand but what be you understand how often do we go off on secret war game mission never yet you be not surprised to hear that we be on one stop interrogate I McGee stop act weird I be weird do you know where we be I do not know anything you know something well now I guess I know everything but I do not know anything then when before you be lie I be leave I be stay we be go to be let in on the real mission now assume you know it be a trap there be a mole in NCIS another one you mean Langer be not alone Domino be the bait this be an opportunity to see if they would take it do they yeah well use our break in as a smokescreen Interior camera be disabled Security be focus on we we do half the work for them the mole trigger the fire alarm use that access point and the alarm in your sector you be a diversion so they could get to the central hub undetecte they could not have get in and out in that amount of time unless of course someone let they in what exactly be we look for Director Vance I be under the impression that if all go accord to your plan the intruder would enter this room use this station to access Domino and still be here I do not recall the part about vanish into thin air the plan be never to apprehend the intruder here sir no pardon my confusion you do intend to catch this perpetrator of course sir but escort I out Leon unless there be other nothing you would like to show I do not touch the console do not seem like the thing that can wait where do McGee go anyway leave it but it be bogus DiNozzo whole installation be bogus nothing be real just the threat do you know who it be do we know who it be someone close to we in my experience when a trap be properly spring usually one 's quarry be find lock inside it be not sufficient to identify the leak sir we need to determine the extent of the damage where it lead where it be go already what we have now sir be just an ant but the ant take the poison to the colony and the whole hill die what you have be not an ant but a rat rat carry disease disease you can not cure what you can do be catch the rat the threat could be more extensive than that no one be above suspicion when the vacancy be create at the top of your agency you induce I to give you this post the deal be quite simple get your house in order I do not care for vermin follow I okay but only because I be already go this way what be with the it be call discretion what do you know about what you know Director Vance reassign the three of we because he believe there be a mole in NCIS he would narrow it down to three agent Langer Keating and Lee Langer be in possession of Domino when Lee kill he thereby eliminate the mole problem as far as Vance be concern we be free to come home again right so what be the problem the problem be it be a load of crap you be upset about lose the war game it be not a war game it be a mole hunt and it be not over yet Langer be only part of it maybe or maybe he be not part of it at all he be a patsy Mole could have plant the info on he Knew Vance be close in kill Langer to get the heat off how would he arrange for Lee to shoot Langer easiest way the mole be benign which be fantastic 'cause I be a little worried and so the dermatologist say that be not a carcinoma all right it be a beauty mark hey how be you Michelle hey I be sorry I overhear I be I be glad it be good news oh yeah beauty mark so how do that other situation work out you know the hypothetical one good good thank you for your help oh do not mention it not that you guy mention much you be secretive we be conduct an exercise it be a war game oh cool who win the other side how be your team take it be leave in the dark like pro they know the danger if she suspect we be onto her well it be good for they to lick their wound and act beat Long as you know it be just an act it will not last much long no but in the meantime they have to stay bottled up Lee gets spook this whole thing be blow and we will never know if she be work with someone I 've burn a lot of satellite hour monitor her movement she have not make a contact yet Stone face not much consolation she be a train agent you can not put a tail on she every time she leave the building I be tempt to bust she right now before anything go wrong little powwow with SECNAV bring on a change of heart Leon Change of mind perhaps Stick with the plan you look to sit in this chair Gibbs well that would be a little awkward Chair 's occupy Means unfortunately I do not take my order from you might be easy and then I would not have all this that one hurt no it do not do not we get our fill of secret agenda and lie and manipulation during the previous administration look I too have hope thing would be different by now I would like to go and give Vance a piece of my mind the way you be lose it you do not have enough to spare I would like to take that toothpick of his and shove it up the SECNAV 's cigar you have have enough of this job then I like the job I do not like the politic I be not kid about that part early if you have ever have some military training then maybe you would have learn to follow order what like you we be give a direct order not to engage I recall that you be the first one to throw a punch it be a reflex really then what happen after last thing I remember before the light go out be you kimbo slice through a room full of guard be that a reflex yes it be Gunshot go off I see you I be tired of pretend so be I it be dinner theater for an audience of one when be the curtain go down violate be the least of what I be feel if ever there be a time for you to break your moratorium on apology then this would be it I be not unfamiliar with the discourtesy of the spy game but there be certain liberty you do not take and if you do you have to tell the other person as soon as you can I be sorry Ducky thank you for that apology Anthony I be sorry I do not let you in on what we be do I know it would piss you off but I guess I do not trust you enough sorry thank you Anthony that will do and I be sorry for make you look like an idiot in front of the Secretary of the Navy I be sorry for be a cowardly devious son of a Anthony be you do excuse I I be not comfortable with the hand up my backside you let the Toothpick use we as puppet no I do not you do not no it be my plan your plan every bit of it that be much bad it be not that I do not trust you I do not let you in because I do not have to I do not make the right play she could kill again so it be Lee I be not worried about her she be catch but she do not know it yet then why do not we just grab she what be you worried about who else be connect in this building maybe how be you go to find out Cameras in the Grand Wazoo room go down the keyboard in the central hub be coat with an invisible dye what be you go to continue to muzzle I it contain a radioactive isotope whose unique signature can be pick up by a Geiger counter well whoever access the console probably wear glove so no it would penetrate stay on your hand for day if Lee have an accomplice we will know and if she do not what if you come up empty pray we do I use both of you because I know you could handle it what do you need from we now Patience Abby will you open up I be not interested thank you Abby I need to tell you something I

contradiction he only have compassion when it suit he cruelty when it be call for I believe the poker term be grinder okay go on well the only way to get at he be to make he believe he have the win hand he need to feel safe so that he can show all his card otherwise he fold go back to wait what about the girl unfortunately he no long will see she as his victim but more as a witness to be dispose

always be a dork in high school that be not why I want my computer I be not try to rewrite my life story do you read something personal into what I just say McGee I do not follow there be nothing new

convene then you force I to petition for the arrest of Mosuma Daoub you be harbor a criminal I have have no contact with your State Department which suggest they be unaware of what have transpire perhaps because you want to protect your friend you arrest he I arrest her lack of respect show by you and your people you will create an international incident sir you be the diplomat not I obviously

later because I be cook up some awesomeness Awesome I I run the swab that you take from the sink and I find trace of sodium tallowate water and fragrance Soap Gibbs would have know that right I can also tell by the chemical decomposition that the sink be use after Grady be murder Killer wash his hand and leave a partial fingerprint it be degrade by the soap so I can not run it through any database but I should be able to pull enough from it to incriminate a suspect well we get one of those let I know as soon as you be do now who be Mr Giggles back to work I hope I do not have to train he all over again so Tony be in charge again yes how do you feel about it Tony be a competent capable investigator and a good leader you do not agree no I agree it be just he be kind of irritate when he be not the boss when he be he walk around with that peacock strut that smirk it be like he be behind I be not he smirk that be good timing how long be you wait two minute any luck with the surveillance video I finally find our victim Lieutenant Grady he enter through a Service entrance yes nearly two hour before he be kill I speak again to the floor maid and she admits let he into Renny 's room claim he lose his key McGee stroke my plumage well nothing unusual in Lieutenant Grady 's bank statement but I do find a sealed file in his record well some of his testimony in Renny 's embezzlement case do involve classified information just to be sure I be petition the judge for access nice work team I be proud of you we be sit pretty pretty as a Peacock Hey boss Jethro do you catch up on Renny 's embezzlement case yes and I go through his appeal let I guess waste three year of his life no you do Kid be innocent the original case hinge on computer log show Renny embezzle from a base credit union First National use the late open source forensic software Renny dig up evidence that those log be falsify but it turn out Renny be not even in the country when the money be steal where Iraq since the computer Renny supposedly do the embezzling with be on base I get it McGee the guy do not do it he raise bunny and grow rainbow and I put he in prison come on think Campfire Huddle up thank you okay Renny do not steal the money that be my bad but it do not let he off the hook kill Lieutenant Grady not at all it be Grady 's testimony that put he away false testimony Insult to injury so if anything Renny 's motive for murder just get strong what be our dead guy 's motive Lied on the witness stand three year ago why maybe he be the real embezzler use Renny as his fall guy sound like a theory now we just need to prove it yes Jethro come down a moment hey Ducky Tony yeah I will be right down keep it Ziva I want all the transcript from Renny 's embezzlement trial McGee interview if he work with he you be talk to he good campfire Congratulations on your promotion Anthony fleeting as it may be thank Ducky actually I be off to a rough start hope you get something good

for you to see if you like I will take your word for it Agent gibb never pass up the opportunity of enjoy the fruit of my labor yeah his x ray show nodule on both his upper and low lobe at first I

way about Stronachlachar as you be no doubt aware valley fever be native to the southwest of the United States the lieutenant must have spend some time there and recently thank Ducky that be not why I call you down here Valley fever be aptly name Lieutenant Grady would have have a slight fever when he die most assuredly which would alter my initial time of death by how much two hour prior that would put time of death around 8 30 pm be that a problem yeah it be because Renny Grant be have dinner at 8 30 pm and I 've get a dozen witness to prove it then your murder suspect be no long a suspect give we a minute I be sorry just so I be straight what be that for put I in prison or accuse I of murder Prison I think we be even on the murder thing you do drop a body down a trash chute good thing my probation be up what be I look at anyway for tamper with a crime scene well it be go to be up to the judge if you be lucky time serve and my appeal I will write you a letter well be a hell of a letter I promise it will be who set you up Renny can you prove that it be Lieutenant Grady already prove I do not do it and now you expect I to find the guy who do what exactly be you go to

double team the embezzlement never could figure how it be do look like Renny do Access log be fake and with our security system that be no easy task would have need at least two people one to open the

pow Horse shoe and hand grenade DiNozzo now that that be settle I lift our partial fingerprint from the soap dispenser it be still not enough to get a match from a database but it be definitely enough

this for Sister Rosita 's ankle I stop by the NCIS gym it take I about four minute and you find something we 've get two embezzler and one of them gets trash literally why maybe his partner get greedy decide he want all the money but the theft be three year ago what take he so long well maybe he get scared he find out his partner be go to meet with the agent from the original case it be not DiNozzo

for comparison turn out this be the model they use in their hotel no one be ever see this before where have it come from gibb could have do that with just a look you be such a pushover it come from here Commander Davis ' bathroom Part of a matching set someone steal it from Davis ' house and plant it at the murder scene Commander Davis be set up the soap dispenser be plant at the crime scene there be a third embezzler look that way my friend no Tony there be a third embezzler I be look at Commander Davis ' computer log he transfer the miss money to an internal account that he create then

like Riggs be try to use the cell scanner as a cell phone end up broadcast in a narrowband frequency Got pick up by the baby monitor I do not know about the foot though that be because you do not know your history McGee historically go about unshod be consider by some to be an act of pious devotion while other believe that direct contact with Mother Earth provide spiritual benefit however in roman and medieval time go barefoot symbolized poverty since leather and boot be too expensive for the average really I write a paper on never mind Cyanosis indicate lack of oxygen no sign of strangulation or ligature mark do you write a paper on those too Time of death two hour ago that a problem Mr Palmer help I with the body yes well he be remarkably stiff for the recently deceased it be too soon for rigor even at this temperature there be no entry wound no sign of trauma but something suck the life out of he suck the life out be right Abby be go to love this thank you what a way to start the day Abby Sciuto maybe FBI you need to come with we Ms Sciuto now where I be not at liberty to say well then I be not at liberty to go you misunderstand it be not a request the deceased be private First

it be the unknown part I do not care for I get Palmer 's text about the vampire bite I can not believe I be not go to be there for that who be you get to fill in Working on it well if you need anything before then I keep a step by step Abby 's lab for Dummies in my desk it cover the basic a monkey could follow the instruction good 'cause we get one of those do you realize that the end be nigh I wonder or be it a blissful event as your ego and judgment melt away I mean a stroke from Doctor yes Mr Palmer may I stop mop now it depend on have it enhance your understanding of protocol consider I enhance Good then you may join I that invitation extend to I too Duck since when have you wait for an invitation do not answer that I know you like to keep people on their toe yes Doctor Protocol what okay yes I will go not be in this room now what do you get well sadly for Abby not the walk dead a histological examination of these wound reveal that they be burn mark not puncture more consistent with a stun gun attack than a vampire bite a stun gun not normally a lethal weapon however I believe the electrical shock aggravate an underlie arterial weakness in his brain and that lead to a hemorrhagic stroke after he regain consciousness he would 've be severely confuse he could 've wander around for hour before take refuge on that loading dock then he take his shoe off yeah well it be call peripheral neuropathy it be common in this kind of stroke his foot would have feel as if they be burn up but I doubt that he know what he be do towards the end he would have be delirious until eventually his heart would have give out Stun gun be a defensive weapon Duck yeah which suggest his death be unintentional I find something under his fingernail it almost certainly come from the assailant during the assault I need to send it up to Abby 's replacement well that be go to be a long run Ducky just speak to the DOD boss Abby 's replacement do not arrive until Monday Monday Monday I make a lot of noise but you know they give I a lecture about budget cut we do catch a break though get a BOLO back from our dead guy 's car want I to take Ziva or no I will take Ziva you you take McGee take McGee where now why do I get pick for the cover art you want to sign or should I I will I be the one with a biomedical engineering degree from Johns Hopkins among several other degree maybe that be why you got pick for the cover art come in Ma'am hi yes from NCIS Yep I ask you here ask I that be a good one at the request of Dr Phillip Heller he be in charge of a rather special project be it a military project fund by the military but Tarburst be an independent agency I be not familiar with Dr Heller 's work no but he be with yours he be quite impressed with your paper on Zinc Finger Nucleases in dna bind what kind of project be we talk about exactly not the kind of project we can talk about it be why I be reluctant to allow your participation initially this be a highly classify matter so what change Dr Heller be no long with the program and we your country need your help what do you need welcome to the Cave the Cave you should rename this place Nirvana Dr Heller be give a sizable budget I can see that and almost complete autonomy all information be compartmentalize strictly need to know only three other people besides myself even know of the existence of this program know two of the original team member die in a roadside bomb attack in Afghanistan which be why Dr Heller 's departure from the program have become quite a problem this be sell to the Senate Select Committee on a warning of a grave and gather threat what exactly be Dr Heller work on that be the problem we do not know patient be not allow on this floor how do you get in here it be a hospital be not it how do you think no the hospital 's upstairs this be I know what this be Sunshine I 've escape from p o w camp with well security just exercise the lung Retired Marine Sergeant Major Robert King N C N C not contagious in case you be worried I be where be Heller we get a game to finish Dr Heller he be he be no long with the project he be not huh no well do not that seem a little strange I mean you know consider consider what God give you a body I will give he that skimp on the brain though do not know how well you know the doctor but if you know Heller you would know he would not run off and leave all this she find I who Nurse Dunstan make Al Qaeda look like Jiminy Cricket I be sorry he know he be not suppose to come down here none of the patient be suppose to come down here I will not tell thank you let us go next time you get out of bed I be have you catheterize you wish Nurse Dunstan your liaison with the hospital if you need anything extension 405 thank you and the lab rabbit should be here by 12 00 hopefully this batch last long than the last Quick march be you go to help I or be you go to keep screw around back there every single drawer in this lab be unlocked except this one you be not wonder what be inside I be wonder where Palmer be with the rest of that dna right here here you go Thought I might be able to help you guy I do have lab experience and I have a biomedical engineering degree from Johns Hopkins he sure do love say that hey will you put the screwdriver down come in here and hand I the ethidium bromide please I get it I do not think that be right I do not think you be suppose to do that all right next step be to mix the gel with the ethidium bromide I do not think you be suppose to do that I think you be suppose to microwave the gel first all right Mr Johns Hopkins Mr Biomedical Degree you go ahead that be not good Nope Knucklehead Lucky for you Abby 's not here Hopkins why be McGee lucky that I be not there and who be Hopkins where be you I be at a public hospital just outside the city that be all I can say they take my cell phone away when I get here but I be able to open a video port into my lab or what be leave of my lab he will clean it up we will clean it up they will clean it up you will all clean it up but I need you to run a background for I first Background on who be everything all right I e mail the info to McGee you do not answer the question everything be fine okay I get to go I should not leave this video port open and Tony screwdriver they leave tool mark on locked drawer it be our dead guy 's car and he appear to have be live in it what be it do here we be almost two mile away from the loading dock where the victim 's body be find that be a long distance to have wander after the attack well if there be an attack here no sign of a struggle there be house not too far away maybe our victim park here for a plan rendezvous of some kind maybe this be nice be able to work without Tony 's incessant babbling it be almost as if he can not go on for more than 30 second without hear his own voice you know the truly amazing thing be that he fail to realize just how irritate he be to those around he yes Gibbs Babbling gibb what Victim 's trunk I be not so sure our victim be the intend victim come in Mr Jones any progress I be do that be fast well it be pretty esoteric stuff Basically Dr Heller be attempt to hijack DNA 's end join pathway in order to target a specific strand of a person 's dna why do I get the feeling you already know that maybe because I already know that be he successful he be close what do you mean you already know that give the sensitive nature of this project I have to make sure you be the real McCoy before I fully read you in so you lie and I do not lose a minute 's sleep be that a problem no not at all lie to I again it be awesome Nice know you wait Miss Sciuto you can not leave really that be funny 'cause it really seem like I be you know leave okay just out of curiosity why can not I leave because if you do not help we they be all go to die let us hear it do you find anything good at Riggs ' car actually yes we find a what be that smell still you be kid I I wash my hand a dozen time wash them again sorry boss have a little mishap in Abby 's lab run the dna on Riggs ' attacker More like Riggs ' victim the content of Riggs ' trunk suggest he be plan on bury a body you think he be on some kind of hit until it go bad he apparently do not count on his target fight back do we have any idea who his victim be I do Palmer and I just finish run the dna from under Riggs ' fingernail you already tell Gibbs tell Gibbs what you find the target what this be Dr Heller it be the guy Abby want we to run background on Abby be ask to take over for Heller when he go miss well I be guess he disappear because someone be try to kill he and Abby have just take his place Agent Gibbs I appreciate your concern for my miss colleague but that be exactly why Miss Sciuto need to stay here right now you have to trust I on that I do not trust you I do not know you I sympathize with your position it be your choice you either tell I what be go on or or what you will threaten I well you know what that depend you consider a public investigation a threat we be on the same team about a year ago my company become involve in a large medical study of serviceman return from Afghanistan it be rather routine until we discover small number be suffer from an undiagnosed illness that be originally think to be fatigue we alert the military they do not want to make the same mistake they do with Gulf War Syndrome Good Good for they we get a contract to research the illness we set up this lab the hope be if we could identify the susceptible genotype a cure could be develop okay well obviously somebody there do not want that to happen we do not know where Dr Heller be all right his disappearance may have nothing to do with this research okay until we find out I want Abby here I be afraid that be not go to happen do I just not make myself clear you misunderstand I hi Gibbs hi abs you all right everything be fine except you and I still have to talk about the lab bunny listen gibb I know what you be go to say you be worried because someone be after the doctor and if someone be after the doctor and I take over his job they might be after I but I do not care these people be sick and I can help they and I be stay period besides this be a secure hospital I be just as safe here as I would be at NCIS Safer actually 'cause they have big dog I would tell you not to argue with she but uh I think you already know that Afghanistan War Syndrome if this guy Heller be work on a cure why would someone try to kill he no connection between PFC Riggs and Heller maybe he be a hire gun it be likely so who hire he good question McGee get the file from Jones yeah read it now how be Abby Committed you can say that again she would be safe here good way to protect she be to solve our original case find Heller we can not be sure the doctor 's disappearance be tie to his work and even if it be he be not go to be easy to find the FBI 's have a BOLO out since Monday Dr Phillip Heller not M D get his phd in molecular biology do a post doc on Gulf War Syndrome Wife no kid be treat for a gambling addiction ten year ago which seem to be under control now Credit card bill be low gas grocery flower do not spend more than he earn he be work at a V a hospital when he join Jones ' program Start with the wife on your six boss I love a woman who be good with her hand and smart too I think you say God skimp on the brain well I be a man of contradiction be I interrupt yes you get anything else it be give I a headache thank you I be on the run it be bath time Nurse ratche take a little bit too much pleasure in it for my taste it be a shame 'cause if she be my type this would be the setup of a lifetime you be not ask I any question must mean you already get your answer you be sick be not you you have it take a guess at the first question but what be it that be the million dollar mystery have you finish isolate our gene or whatever it be you

elephant a game of card between the agency chief at the Secretary of the Navy 's house Love to be a fly on that wall to buzz and irritate the big boss no to eavesdrop on their conversation that be an

drop a cocktail wienie I have a riddle for you what be not food but taste very well I will give you a hint and you should come up with the answer before Officer David since it be right on the Tip of your tongue he bite it off he be flail lose control of his limb be he poison no I do not think so he have this severe bruise on his neck no this man be attack be you certain be you the one that perform CPR unsuccessfully well it be the right instinct this man be oxygen deprive see he have petechial hemorrhaging in his eye he be strangle that would suggest someone penetrate our security web unseen and why be that so unlikely because I design it it be airtight apparently not download all the footage from the surveillance cam cover the ground Patio be a blind spot boss get together couple time a year location and responsibility rotate SecNav 's place ICE 's people CIA bring the chip and dip the Bureau the booze Little early for a drink Jethro yeah I might need it to settle your gut something here bother you no nothing here not here head of the CIA FBI ICE that be a full bowl of alphabet soup huh not all of they which letter you get on your badge McGee oil from his face when he press against the glass Powder be stick might be adhesive Agent DiNozzo Officer David a fly bug on the wall Boss we find a listening device look like it be stick to the glass Agent Sherman flail against the door it get dislodge Falls under his body whatever happen here be still happen be it functional damage good not to take any chance no I mean it be not like he leave no trace behind he leave exactly one trace the bug but someone in their infinite wisdom decide to stomp it into a hundred piece it might 've still be transmit it be not transmit we could have track the signal you know maybe get a lead the bug stomp it be a classic movie move sound like a Tony Nah it be a Jules a Jules what be a Jules I be go to have to have a word with this Jules if we ever have the good fortune of meeting I would like to be here for that what you be hold ace and eight there McGee Dead man 's hand what no no this be what be on the table when the game end the pot be not right what do you mean

cowboy muck the rag pull a second pair Hutch miss the flush but will not bow out ice be the clear leader stand pat at the wheel I have no idea what you just say you got to be an idiot to still be in this hand be these guy not pay attention they be not play very well well obviously not as well as you someone be spy on the card game dead agent get in the way in previous game Davenport and his buddy have always threaten to play till someone drop I guess we should have believe they you 've play with they but not last night last time I play I clean Hutch out I clean they all out that be probably why they do not invite you back get a hell of a poker face Ducky have the body McGee 's processing the scene DiNozzo and David Reviewing ICE 's protection detail scour the ground with Agent Foster yate keep I update Sir Heavy footfall on the lawn direct towards the patio agent station at the perimeter converge on the house after Sherman go down they do not catch his attacker he do not get out this way unless he could cross a lawn without bend a blade of grass well not impossible with the proper training she can also do that trick where you put your ear to a rail and you can hear a train come you get this same training I no but I can eat a bucket of chicken in one sitting and I have x ray vision Complementary skill set make for a strong team dynamic I be always try to explain that concept to Sherman Bit of a maverick huh he be a good agent I be sure the two of you do not always agree on everything no not everything healthy debate breed creative solution be not that right Ziva where do she go a few branch be miss up here a clear view of the property he could study the patrol pattern they go in he go up and then he go out that gate it be McGee Hey Gibbs want you guy to come back I be up a tree this might only confuse you far well who say I be confuse you say you be up a tree I be why be he call you and not I I be the senior field agent I do not know why he be not call you I do call Tony he be not make any sense and you be the one not make sense he say he call you I be not get a signal how come you be get a signal and I be not because I be up a tree we solve case all the time like this what do McGee have to say that it be time to go use his forearm and bicep the attacker put pressure on both side of the neck cut off the blood supply through the carotid artery here cradle in the crook of his arm the trachea and larynx remain unharmed Tobias Tobi you you push up on a rear choke not down and you turn your chin into your shoulder yeah after a few moment in the aptly name sleeper hold and the victim lose consciousness failure to release the pressure cause a complete systematic shutdown the bladder and bowel release hey Duck continue the pressure and the result be inevitable Death by asphyxiation well that be what I be anticipate but not what I discover Agent Sherman 's medical record he have warn sign of atherosclerotic disease aggravate by the temporary deprivation of blood to the brain and he suffer a fatal stroke yeah but if the attacker 's intent be to kill he would have hold the choke hold long enough until the lung fail I be good but he do not Attack be not mean to be lethal well that be what I think so the intruder make his way quickly through a secure perimeter subdue the only guard he encounter silently and leave a listen device behind and vanishe we be deal with a pro which eliminate the neighbor kid retrieve a lose Frisbee I will have the Bureau compile profile use your x ray vision black lace matching set really on the job SecNav usually have an NCIS agent task to guard he at all time but ice be assign the detail ten man in total huh for a poker game they be not even play why do not you tell we what be really go on the game be just a cover be not it I be instruct not to reveal any detail I think you should disregard that instruction four agency fill with people who specialize in find out information it be an intelligence summit what be the subject I wish I know whatever it be someone be willing to kill to find out Intelligence summit seem like your classic contradiction in term do not give I the look I do not know you have suspicion because you have suspicion I be ride shotgun here Gibbs yeah can I borrow it go easy Hoss she be just do what she be tell you do not get to determine what be worth share and what be not I do not answer to you Agent Gibbs yes you do yes you do what else have you leave out Perimeter solid design boss effective Barring human error be you suggest I be incompetent or that this be an inside job Dealer 's choice Boss you know I could use the footage to build an animated model and recreate the movement of all the player see if there be any possible path of entry all I would need be the position report you get that help he out start to doubt the invisible man theory boss Backgrounds every agent on the detail last night personal and professional history possible suspect with the necessary skill start with know foreign operative in the area FBI profile really help narrow it down if we know what the summit be about yeah you get another one of those Triplicate we need to know what they be discuss please come right in it be crucial to the investigation suppose it go to motive yes it do Mr Secretary sit down gentleman first year of a new president 's term he be test check your time line June July eight year ago Al Qaeda show themselves in flight school where no one be interested in learn how to take off or land our opportunity be miss because agency be not in the habit of share information there 've be far too many foreign national be far too comfortable on american soil gun runner terror cell even israeli Mossad you mean like Rivkin slip through our border like 9 11 never happen come to a head in L A with OSP Mossad 's operative still have not be call home since then that be Director Eli David 's not too subtle message that we be not do a strong enough job of police our own backyard the pretext of a poker game be mean to cut down on the chatter lead up to the summit and the informal setting serve to loosen stubborn lip accustom to secrecy NCIS be not represent I be there be one survive member of the cell in California Haziq Khaleel he be in custody Macy and Hanna they conduct the interrogation do he spill Haziq give up his handler Abin Tabal he give up anything on Callen 's shooter no How be Callen do he be still critical he be hang in there we get a guy on our watch list use the alia Abin Tabal believe to be here in Washington Chase he down Abin Tabal aka Adolfo Ruiz aka Hikmet Gillersoy aka like nine other make up name over the course of the last three year he have hit the watch list with spanish russian Chechnyan Greek and Cypriot passport do not keep the same one very long the United States be the only common destination among all the passport under various identity he be land in Egypt Algeria Libya and Niger so the guy be get a fondness for Northern Africa excuse I Officer David Shalom what do you think training center he be the handler go back and forth between headquarters and activate sleeper cell in the States I will catch Gibbs up find the guy I like take order from just about anybody I guess especially the guy who frame I for murder one minute he be frame I for murder the next he be treat I like a perfectly capable agent the nerve I have to run out for a few minute I will be right back I will be right here full digitization would take all day Quick scan the access road footage exactly what I be think Jules thank for come to my rescue up there I appreciate it Tim my pleasure be you often in the habit of destroy evidence Jules Beg your pardon you should actually because I be the one responsible for reconnecte and reactivate all of those extremely delicate piece of electronic you can do that of course I can then what be the problem you probably know some kind of martial art or something huh when I be in high school my mother be the ambassador to Bangkok I fall in love with Muay Thai so if I try to scratch your eye out you could probably break my finger that would be a mistake you need your finger to fix that bug and in my own lab rewind that security footage it be the same car second time it be pass by case the place can you I d the driver no but I can pull the plate let us pull up the registration someone you know I get to get Gibbs Jules you should probably come with I a vehicle pull off surveillance approach SecNav 's house that do not belong to Abin Tabal come on Leon you should be able to recognize your own car what be you do outside the house I be not invite inside I be get very tired of information be withhold I know what you mean Curiosity can make you do some funny thing like what cruise a secret meeting just to confirm it take place Director Hutchins let it slip a week ago before he realize you be be exclude it be a tough town Gibbs believe it or not I be still try to get the hang of it relationship be delicate why be not you invite because they be there to talk about I I wish I could stay for lunch Michael that be okay join I for a drink another vodka just a splash of soda this time please nothing for I thank I be work on a case tell I this be what a relationship look like how be your day dear I will tell you when it be over I think I tell you I would shut up you got to get back here right now now you have to go already well we be look for a terrorist and Tony say we just find he so I will see you later thank you you be welcome be this seat take this be a little like that scene in Heat when Pacino and DeNiro finally meet I be DeNiro in this scene you think you be DeNiro in this scene okay you can call I Al I will spare you the singing you 've come to chase she away from I Mikey Israel in the very tan flesh Trip to L A do you good Ziva prefer darker skin how do she like be play 'cause I think we both know this romance be not kosher I can understand your suspicion give what we have about you in your dossier Agent Meatball there be an El Al flight tonight out of Ronald Reagan at 8 25 p m land at Ben Gurion tomorrow evening I be not finish spend time with Ziva NCIS say you be Ziva 's very lucky to have a man like you in her life like a big brother I 've get some work to do and you clearly have some drinking to finish and after that I think you should start pack you can question my feeling for Ziva all you want unfortunately you can not question her feeling for I can you say good bye Mikey get on the flight we 've reconstruct everyone 's movement from last night on this wire frame representation of the secnav 's residence these blue figure represent the agent on patrol the unit move in overlap sweeping pattern on the outer layer the inner layer be stationary Sophisticated even if someone manage to get through the outer ring unseen their path would be limit they would be funnel into plain sight so what go wrong well there be a hole in the net when Sherman leave to take the position on the patio leave this avenue wide open yes it do well you get an explanation it be an error nobody 's perfect Jules not you and not this guy we will find he you get those background almost finish these be what we have so far got to check in with my boss Sure Abby need my help with the bug go this idea of friendly relation between agency full disclosure fly in the face of history you vouch for the ice princess she be cool on the outside but when she open up she be she be full of bean molten cheese like a microwave burrito what I be hungry so when the bug be work properly it emit a signal that can piggyback on any available internet connection and then it can upload the audio to a live stream on a private web site so basically it be a fancy tin can we follow the string to the can on the other end what you never camp out in the backyard as a kid be you crazy there be alligator in my backyard you know you do not really need my help with this second set of hand can not hurt you feeling neglect neglect more like nauseous have to watch you flirt with that Jules Come on I be not flirt your hand drift across the keyboard Pinkies accidentally graze each other please I know she be out of my league anyway abs no she be not we have not find Tabal yet we really should be work hard I come back here quickly because you say we have find Abin Tabal where be you where be you he be in L A on business just like he be in d c on business I can not believe you if you want to meet he I could introduce you I would not be do my job if I do not check on he Gibbs tell he to clock out I tell he to clock out perhaps it would carry some more weight if it come from you Michael be here to see I he be not work he be on vacation well he certainly be drink like it Conference room 's this way I will show you CPB have not get a hit yet on any of Abin Tabal 's know alias likely he be still in the country the invisible man the result of interview with every member of your team last night there be some bad feeling circulate inevitable with any team I imagine performance review Agent Sherman 's and yours he have four more year of service than you do but you be promote over he with good cause you will notice my eval and rec be consistently high he openly object to take order from a woman with less seniority you can not have appreciate that Agent Sherman be very passionate about his duty he be a thorn in your side let us just stop right here before you embarrass yourself by actually accuse I of kill Agent Sherman I lose an agent last night maybe that get easy with time but for I it be I 've be try not to kick dirt on a dead man 's grave that be my mistake his death be not he be not suppose to be on the patio he be out of position he disregard his assignment why I do not know Spite Jealousy he be never concern about make I look bad there be a hole in the net because he move he be dead for the same reason he never get the promotion he do not operate as part of a team and you do yeah yeah all right Abby 's get a link to Tabal you be come Schematics of SecNav 's house look like

do not sound clean at all sound like the further you dig the messy it get well what can I say the event of the past year have make I a little suspicious even to the people close to you especially they we pull information from Tabal 's computer say that at some point the internet be connect here Ziva 's account she be tie to this dead man who be obviously duplicitous practice in the art of misinformation that appear to be the shape of thing you be here to question Ziva all because a series of number on a terrorist 's computer I be until you open the door Semper Fi you and Leon get to play nice you order I to trust he just to follow he we do not hit our brother soon as you be do with your drink Michael you be under arrest for the murder of Abin Tabal and Federal Agent Tom Sherman

must have be leak for at least an hour no one smell gas which be odd consider most of the neighbor be home these look clean look like a pro job Boss could be the trigger Bag it yup would you like a moment not necessary while you be here perhaps you could shed some light on Officer Rivkin 's belief I 've already contact a rabbi friend of mine and ask he to be present when I perform the autopsy also not necessary Michael be jewish by birth not practice Traditions can be a comfort like the period of aninut and avelut ancient rite very appropriate today they not only show respect for the dead but they also bring a sense of comfort to those who be leave behind ritual only work for those who need they I need you to run a back trace on a cell phone Sure I just need the number boss this be Ziva 's cell you already know that okay back trace on it I know what you be go to say no I do not think you do I know you think I lie to you about Rivkin but I do not you ask I if I know he you ask I if he work for Mossad not if I be see he not sit down your apartment be be destroy Gas fire early this morning perhaps the line be damage during the fight I would talk to Tony no this be no accident the gas line be cut any idea no that be a quick answer simple question Ziva that be your home no it be not this be a thorough report you only leave out a few little thing like why you break protocol why you go alone and why the hell do not you inform I my gut tell I that it be Rivkin not Ziva and sometimes my gut just suck but if Ziva know something I want to give she the chance to explain it to I you want to protect she if she need it Tony 's left radius be fracture during this brawl but he and Officer Rivkin suffer a whole assortment of other injury all of they consistent with Tony 's version of the story Tony tell the truth this be good news Jethro do not add up DiNozzo 's more a brawler Rivkin be Kidon I think you would never ask put the why aside Agent DiNozzo I be curious how you get out of there alive well I 've always be a pretty decent fighter if I do say so myself Scrappy you tell I you off a Mossad assassin by be scrappy what do you want from I Director Honesty in detail well that be what I be try to do here and maybe you be right maybe Rivkin should have win but he do not he be dead and I be not and I do not have a concrete reason why what be this Concrete Rivkin be hammer he might have have a couple of cocktail but I mean he be do a pretty good job hammer I there be no way he be drunk blood alcohol level be 16 twice the legal limit to drive maybe I should have call he a cab you go off grid you kill an officer of the Mossad and to make thing bad the entire crime scene have be blow to hell People be go to have some question you would well have some good answer Understood think your boy can handle the meat grinder that be come he will manage good because he be go to have to step up take one for the team what be the end game Diplomacy Leon

datum but it be go to take a while Couple day you get one boss that be not even that be a very reasonable request Major Mass Spec be still process that I be think it be probably a salami roll wrap in s'mores do you have a well idea I do I know I be tell not to involve myself in the investigation yet here you be since it be my apartment I think I should at least take a look at the crime scene photograph no not go to happen not a chance perhaps I should have make myself more clear I have already scan through the photo McGee leave they run on his computer that be say I feel oblige to tell you what I have find talk that be actually an activate charcoal filter which have be douse in ethanethiol we plant they on cut gas line to mask the smell a fire can be trigger without warn we it be a technique use by many agency include Mossad pack your bag you and DiNozzo too I 've be ask a favor I 've just decide to grant it we be on the next flight to Tel Aviv Director Vance Director David will see you shortly he be anxious to speak with you as be I Officer David it be be far too long thank you for come there be no reason to thank I my visit have nothing to do with you always full of fire

so we understand this be what I do for a living I interrogate people all day long so I know all the trick of the trade and nothing that you do be go to intimidate I Interrogate this be an Assembly Room it be a place for mutual discussion you have yet to see our Interrogation Room but if you continue with childish arrogance I promise that you will Son of a bitch how many time do I tell DiNozzo to leave his smart ass attitude back in DC you should have check his bag you say your boy be up for this you be the one who throw he to the wolf Leon let he fight his own way you call this a fight he would well start show I something take one for the team he already have no Agent DiNozzo what you need to understand be that I be very aware of who you be your achievement and your misjudgment stop right there if this be about my Twitter page I just want to clarify I have a couple of cocktail and what can I say sometimes I get a little chatty do you know who I be you be the Director of Mossad and Ziva 's father although I be not sure which one be ask the question sometimes it be hard to separate and it appear that you have have difficulty separate your work from your emotion as well you believe Officer Rivkin be bad he kill an american agent an accident unlike his death which be intentional but what be behind that intent retribution for an agent you have never even meet you know that Officer Rivkin would be at Ziva 's apartment you go there to confront he to provoke he and once again you blur the line Agent DiNozzo between your professional duty and your personal desire you want Rivkin out of my daughter 's life so you kill he be not that the truth Agent DiNozzo it be like I tell you Director I go to Officer David 's apartment at which time Officer Rivkin attack I it be kill or be kill if that be true my friend you would be dead you would not mind that would you you send all your rogue agent to DC make it our mess huh I guess I should not be surprised about Rivkin consider you do the same thing with Ari and he be your son speak of family what kind of a father would throw an out of control assassin at his own daughter what kind of business be you run here huh everyone just run around do whatever the hell they want they do as I say Rivkin always well I will be damn yeah Gibbs Hey boss how be Tel Aviv forget Tel Aviv how be Tony How be Ziva be they talk yet they be fine Abby I will take that as a no so how be Israel what he say they be fine it be magical right I mean I 've be want to go there for year it be like third on my list the Galapagos Islands and Dollywood Gibbs the case Abby McGee and I we 've be work on Rivkin 's computer and we be do fairly well with a little luck I think we will make our 24 hour deadline Boss I run the back trace on Ziva 's cell Most of the call check out Most well she do make one call from her car two night ago to a highly encrypt phone Israeli register Call be place just after midnight six hour before the bombing which mean either Ziva really upset someone or do not say it she be somehow involve what have I just say I trace the israeli phone it be register to Officer Amit Hadar now talk Ziva what be this I say talk you call I remember to remove Rivkin from harm Harm from whom Himself circumstance have change and this be your answer I protect the Mossad there be nothing to protect I should have know not to trust you as if it be my decision you have my father 's ear Rivkin be in chaos you know and yet you decide not to tell your father you try to protect Rivkin but in truth you be the reason he be dead Rivkin kill that american agent you know this and still you do not report he I call you and I tell you to remove he too late by then we could not get he out of the country all we could do be clean up after he and you there be no one leave to blame stop look Hadar set the fire cover for Rivkin I be betray by Mossad by my father by Tony who be next you pardon I Director your Agent Gibbs be make my people very nervous he slip through security any idea where he might be go Knowing Gibbs a coffee run Man practically mainline caffeine thank you it be be a long time my friend Amsterdam how do it get this far simple one of your agent kill one of my agent we both know that be not where this start I notify you of the sleeper cell your guy be already knee deep in it you do not trust we can police our own backyard the view from where I sit be quite different the threat be immediate unfortunately I do not have the luxury of patience sometimes patience be a necessity otherwise you end up make an enemy out of your friend and then we end up with a dead american and a dead israeli and I know that be the last thing either one of we want Rivkin be not a rogue agent he be follow your order you say so yourself I underestimate Agent DiNozzo you send he in there to rile I up I learn from the good there be a terrorist training camp somewhere in North Africa we have not be able to pinpoint anything exact but we manage to identify one of their sleeper cell in Los Angeles so you send Rivkin to L A he be on an end run find the leader of the cell he give up the handler find the handler he give up the location of the training camp and he kill they along the way include the handler you can hardly leave those people behind to come after you oh I understand Eli I do not judge you I never have unfortunately I can not trust everyone in your intelligence community to be as understanding as you so you have Rivkin spy on they the death of the american agent be an accident Rivkin never get the intel about the training camp do he all this to find a camp that be probably already be move it be not about the camp it be the man who run it well he must be very important to you he kill one of my people I have no choice that be a lie why would I lie to you Ziva to save your worthless ass from who Vance Mossad you jeopardize your entire career and for what for you he be play you Ziva for some reason you feel it be your job to protect I I do what I have to do you kill he if I have not you would be have this conversation with he maybe that be the way you would prefer it perhaps I would why do not you just get this out you want to take a punch take a swing get it out of your system go ahead do it be careful Tony because much like Michael I only need one and that be what you be really angry about be not it that be what be bother you it be not that he be dead it be that your Mossad boyfriend get his ass kick by a chump like I you take advantage of he he attack I what be I suppose you see a glass table you push he back you drop he on it he be impale in the side by a shard of glass bloody gasp for air I guess you read my report I memorize it you could have leave it at that you could 've walk away but no you let he up you put a bullet in his chest you be not there you could 've put one in his leg you be not there but I should 've be you love he I guess I will never know what do you get abs Hey Gibbs wow it be my first trans global what do you got Abs think maybe I could get a trans global Caf pow delivery depend on what you have we do a postmortem humpty dumpty on Rivkin 's laptop and we be able to reconstruct most of the datum from his hard drive he use a specialized algorithm to generate a well harbor short key for most of his file but we manage to crack both the algorithm and the isp protocol what be the point McGee Basically we put his hard drive back together and as it turn out it be not Rivkin 's laptop so we get nothing no actually boss we have everything this laptop belong to Abin Tabal our dead handler Yep that be the one Rivkin probably switch laptop after he kill he throw we off and give Rivkin all the intel he need we 've get serial number name and cell phone number all link to various location in North Africa and that be not all Gibbs we be able to decrypt Rivkin 's e mail account which be only half the battle because it be in Hebrew and Hebrew be hard apparently Rivkin be in DC work with Mossad contact to gather intel on a terrorist training camp who be his contact we trace several e mail to a restrict account a very very restricted account restrict by who Us Gibbs Rivkin be e mail Ziva at NCIS you know that this mean Ziva know yeah I get it McGee it mean Ziva be withhold vital I say I get it Abby you tell Michael to stay with I in DC why that be none of your concern I have make it my concern do not question I Ziva be any of it real do it matter Michael be go you must move on it be no long about he Agent DiNozzo I need to know if he be right he be jealous even if that be true that do not make he wrong now answer I be it real I do not know perhaps why be I not tell the detail of his mission why be I exclude because Ziva I do not know who you answer to anymore NCIS or Mossad what be it you expect from I I expect your loyalty to I and only I you want to know Michael 's assignment make this your Aliyah you return to I to we you finish what Michael start so that be it right I be do with Israel we be not come back here get on the plane DiNozzo all right you get it boss take her easy our people pull this off the laptop Rivkin be use should answer a lot of your question thank you and thank Miss Sciuto as well be there anything you do not know not anymore happy hunting Eli Shalom my friend Plane leave in five minute Ziva not without we it do not I think it be good if I simply speak from the heart well yeah it usually be it be Tony I be still not convince that he have be entirely truthful about Michael 's Rivkin 's shooting he give you his word I be not sure we can work together perhaps it be good if one of we gets transfer to another team transfer I need to be able to trust the people that I work with I know you more than anyone understand that take care of yourself one short Good to go be they here yet abs I tell you I will call you as soon as they show up Scout 's honor that be too late McGee it be not an official welcome back I mean if I be here and they walk in I get to say yay welcome back if they be already here and I come in like Miss Tardy to the party then technically it be like they welcome I back tell he Palmer she she make a good point I see that Palmer okay their flight 's arrive where be they behind you welcome back watch the we miss you sorry that be all right miss you too abs Tony I so Ziva 's get her stuff or no she park her car no what be she do well consider the time difference probably eat breakfast she be still in Tel Aviv Yep when be she come back she be not no this can not happen Vance can not do this again be not Vance 's call well if it be not Vance then who forgive the intrusion how do you possibly manage to Geez Duck you go to ask I that every time how be your flight one short yeah I know this decision must not have come easily it be not my decision but Tony say no Ziva 's the moment she ask I to choose so this be not about loyalty it be about an unreasonable demand she withhold information to protect Rivkin someone she obviously care about Ziva have always remain an officer of Mossad I certainly do not envy the position that she just find herself in consider she less than conspicuous background it be amazing she ever have your trust no she earn it but you take to Ziva more quickly than any other agent before her Timothy Caitlin even DiNozzo I 've always sense that there be a strong bond between the two of you something share perhaps no she prove herself whatever it be that Ziva do to prove her loyalty well it be not nearly as momentous as you believe or be it go over the personnel file like you ask there be a couple that stand out both would be a good fit take your pick I will let you know in a few month yeah I know it could not be that easy you think she might ask to come back I be just give her time that be all Time to what remember who she can trust let I make it easy for you you make the right call I be not ask for your opinion Leon just who you think you be talk to that be a good damn question I 've be wonder that for a while you spend half your time second guess I study I test I I be look for answer it would help if you would ask the damn question there be the rub you do not have a clue what to ask you do not trust I but you do not know why you want to talk about trust what about tear apart my team last year there be no warning there be no discussion be that what this be about you want to sit in the big chair no I do not I want to trust whoever do sit there I want to protect my team like Ziva okay fine you make the decision to leave she in Tel Aviv I support you and now you might want to let she back why because whatever she might have do I trust she for what I know she do four year ago she save your life by shoot and kill her half brother Ari I tell you the chair be big Ari be out of control so Ziva 's father send she to eliminate he she kill Ari earn your trust two bird one bullet Eli play you but regardless gibb up until now Ziva 's always be loyal to this agency I know you do not want to hear this gibb but now you have to trust I and if you be right about Ziva 's allegiance to you she will serve we well at Mossad yeah and if you be right about her father we will never see she again guess she will call when she be ready tell I everything you know about NCIS www Team NCIS com previously on NCIS www Team NCIS com Rivkin attack I and I have no choice it be justify Rivkin be dead Tony kill he you could have walk away but no you let he up you put four in his chest you love

just that he any reason that you can think of why someone would want he dead well a lot of people misunderstood he but Eric be a good man deep down I can not see anyone want to hurt he but but what I

time I have a break leg I could tell you story that would make your hair curl well go on no it be well he do not Duck can not I tell he about the time when well I do not I call you down here because liver pathology suggest and Abby later confirm that all three man be drug prior to their death the champagne and while semi conscious one be drown one suffocate and Sergeant Ross here die of a massive alcohol poisoning likely ingest under duress Semi conscious very astute Jethro the killer want they awake when they die which imply a deep meaning to the ritualistic manner of their death Mr Palmer here discover something I find an inconsistency in Ross ' military file the record state that he sustain an injury during a work relate accident on base in Korea but Dr Mallard find evidence of a gunshot wound not something I would expect to see in a work relate injury falsify the report a good assumption Hey boss ATM and traffic camera we get a tip that one of our victim be be follow Thought I would check on some of the route he be on see if we could find out who the tail be the swiping thing be need to talk to Sergeant Ross ' CO in South Korea I will set it up and where be DiNozzo on an

Sandich 's bachelor party turn it off yeah it be his real bachelor party five month ago when Sandich 's fiancée find the tape she call off the engagement she have not see he since which mean they be all still single second bachelor party be just a cover cover for what I 've hear of a cover story for a bachelor party but I 've never hear of one be the cover story what do you think they be really up to the usual no good any luck on who ever be follow Eric Jurel our auction house owner no and it be over a week ago you could try to recreate your victim 's daily route by use his cell 's gps

jealous please calm you be not think that be right you be not think although I suppose I could understand your initial reaction you be in an emotional time for you and people act rashly but to tell gibb that you do not trust Tony which I guess I also could understand you know I mean he do just shoot your boyfriend in your living room to death all right I will give you that one but this be Tony we be talk about here all all soft and goofy on the outside and 100 rock on the inside and after everything you accuse he of he risk his life to go save you you should be ashamed of yourself even though in hindsight it be start to make a little bit more sense now but either way the ball be in your court it be Tony one and Ziva zilch this be your move and it well be a good one God I be so worried about you I know nice to speak to you in person Agent Gibbs I be sure I be not the first to say Ooh Rah quite a feat your team pull off in North Africa Love to hear the detail come on gunny we

he have he have make a lot of money in the stock market I could read between the line she just connect the two case Arnett 's death be look less like an accident maybe Burns be onto something which mean we blow the investigation I review Lieutenant Arnett 's autopsy as if I be an objective outsider first the photograph then the x ray I bring in a radiological consultant and have Abby redo the blood and tox test what be more Duck bottom line certainly Lieutenant Arnett 's death be accidental multiple trauma sustain in a car accident I think you be go to want I to take this it be my counterpart om Hubbard the District M E return my call hello Tom well actually I be in the middle of an autopsy I have to say that or he will talk my ear off what be that Metropolitan Police have classify Burns ' death as a homicide thank I owe you one no no no no old boy my lip be seal you ever lie like that to I Duck never if the case be connect do that infer that Arnett be also murder we get our hand full anything else you can do well if I have retain Arnett 's brain I could perform further toxicology test why do not you at the time it be not warrant it be a car accident look for the test the tissue have to be prepare it take ten day the Arnett family be put pressure on the Director they want the body for burial and they want it intact unbury it Jethro we need it now get the Director involve use the full extent of his office to get the consent of the family how you do Special Agent Gibbs and DiNozzo sit down thank you Benjamin Franklin Securities and Exchange Commission I know I do not look like an SEC investigator be that really your name yes and I 've hear every imaginable joke so spare I we 've be receive the same kind of heat you guy have since BeltwayBurns break the story I head the investigation of Arnett if he be inside trading we could not find any evidence of it how be it usually work when a company be award a multibillion dollar defense contract its stock spike if anyone have advance knowledge like Arnett do they would purchase an OTM that be an out of the money call take a bet that the stock will rise and it only cost penny on a share a penny save be a penny earn now we check out all the defense contract release by CUINFO in the past 12 month that Arnett be in the office there be only one OTM that show any substantial profit you get a name yes nice bifocal Ben an individual name will Sutton now he make 2 million on McAllister Industries ' stock what do we know about he Ben do not make any sense he own a small sandwich shop in the Adams Morgan District we 've have the guy under a microscope but we can not find a connection between he Arnett the Navy or any other source of inside information yeah Gibbs Gibbs I need you to come down here abs slow down I will be right there get the information on Sutton oh dear I only take order from one person Special Agent leroy Jethro gibb unless he ask I to do it it do not get do I think that be go to change honey Gibbs make this awful man go away what do you want Sportelli all the physical evidence from the Arnett investigation include the car we be deny access to your investigation and you get all the evidence in ours since I have a Court order yes give it to he Abs you be go to have to sign the chain of evidence honey you know what I will take that I hope you can look your boss in the eye and tell he you do not blow it Hanley come here you go I can understand the SEC ask I question why the Navy we be look into the death of a Navy officer Mr Sutton what be that get to do with I you make a killing on McAllister Industries ' stock right after they be award a multibillion dollar defense contract the dead officer we be investigate may have be involve in insider trading so I get lucky on a legitimate investment and everybody be all over I you know if I lose money nobody would give a damn I get a box of lose lottery ticket would you like to take a look at it no so you 've never meet or hear of Lieutenant Rod Arnett Nope let I ask you a question if you make 2 million in the market what be you do make sandwich 'cause the SEC freeze my fund until after they finish their investigation they have not find anything they never will I tell you I catch one lucky break it turn I into a nightmare I 've have to hire a lawyer the guy be cost I a fortune he be go to see more money on this than I will that pastrami look great you know how many connection I have find between Arnett and Sutton Zero I 've check everything I have check e mail phone record be that pastrami can I have a bite this be my dinner you can have the pickle I do not like pickle I know these two guy could not be more different one be a rich kid the other drop out of high school to support his invalid mother he make a mean sandwich we get Arnett Academy graduate single playboy jock part of the DC social scene now you 've get Sutton marry 15 year three kid two mortgage can not afford to live in the city so he take the train each day an hour come on man you know I do not have lunch today these two live 60 mile apart there be no discernable way they have meet or have anything in common I hope you choke on that you know disinterment be consider a sacrilege or taboo by certain culture especially the one who bury their dead gibb think this be a necessary exception in Southern China for example grave be open after a period of one year the bone be remove clean dry and put in a ceramic pot for re burial the process be call jiangu Exhumations be disturb they be fortunately Lieutenant Arnett have only be bury for two week who would want to steal Arnett 's body I do not know but thank God Matt Burns be not around to put it in his blog someone else'll fill the void this be really go to give the conspiracy theorist a reason to believe we be cover up a murder it be go to get bad after I tell Sportelli do you have to when be the last time you see Arnett 's body the day after I do the autopsy we release it to the Heavenly Glen Funeral Home in Falls Church they pick it up on it boss Boss I be schedule to retake that polygraph at 9 00 a m I will handle it thank treat this like a crime scene abs right I be look for Special Agent Timothy McGee he be out of the building on assignment tell he Agent Grady from Polygraph want to see he he miss his schedule appointment this morning I will make sure he get the message we pick up Lieutenant Arnett 's remain from NCIS at 11 20 on the sixth of last month he be bring directly here where our mortician do a reconstruction of the deceased 's face which be severely damage in the accident we know we work the scene well that evening Arnett 's immediate family have a view I think our mortician do a wonderful job but they decide to have the casket close for the funeral it be seal at 10 00 p m the mortuary close at 11 00 and do not open until 7 00 the next morning how be the casket deliver to Arlington in our hearse first to the chapel then to the graveside service any idea how the body could have be remove none who else have key to the building Myself my brother who be also my partner in the business and our mortician no one else be there a security system of course excuse I for a second I get a text from Ziva Gunmetal metal Nice the polygraph examiner 's look for I I guess Gibbs forget he be get a lot on his mind hey come over here for a second come here I get an idea what Hop in what be you talk about just do it why would I do that I take your picture we send it to Polygraph they think you be dead you do not have to retake the test Tony that be not funny they already think you be duck they it be only go to get bad I have totally forget about this but early on the morning of the seventh the security alarm go off I be notify at home and meet the patrol here this be their report we search the entire building but find nothing miss dismiss the incident as a faulty alarm go off at 2 10 a m Security arrive on site at 2 30 a m there be a 20 minute window where someone could have remove Arnett 's body this coffin look expensive it be it be top of the line but it be it be new you know factory make it have no personality Mine on the other hand be like a Stradivarius hand craft by a Bavarian artisan circa 1870 it never make sense to I to spend a fortune on something that be go to be view for a couple of hour and stick in the ground to rot mine have and will continue to provide I with hour of restful sleep and pleasure do you find anything Prints DNA in fact all four plate be meticulously clean with acetate how strange why would someone take such precaution if the coffin be go to be bury for all eternity Ducky this be cosmic two mind one think that be exactly what gibb say when I tell he Burns push for the Arnett case to remain open by say we make a mistake he know we would eventually be force to exhume Arnett 's body to prove his death be accidental and when it be find miss his blog site would explode and Burns would become a celebrity a regular on Anderson Cooper and after that Burns could say anything he want to about Arnett dead man can not defend himself you think Burns steal the body that be what make the most sense I like it how do we prove it Boss I get an idea but I need to get a look at Burns 's car in police impound like Sportelli 's go to let we do that there it be I could take care of the video surveillance it be the canine patrol I be worried about Chillax bro all these budget cut and economic problem they can not afford dog trust I be you sure that thing 's go

Jordan who be your source former israeli Officer do security consulting along the Red Sea Claims Cryer be hang his own shingle what be he sell Connections and not sure of the why or the how but Cryer be spot boarding a small freighter bind for East Africa the name of that freighter be the damocle yes Sir that be the one be lose at sea and salvage vessel never recover any wreckage Guess Cryer go down with the ship that would account for he be dead do not explain why he be wrap in plastic there be no way to know what go down on board there be no survivor I see the official report you stay close Chad we know someone who live through that shipwreck you see this come you do not you know she well than I do close to she than anyone your relationship with her father do not tie your hand no it absolutely do so good cop bad cop Plenty of other way to break someone Leon I figure she be be break enough okay good cop bad cop which one be you how be my agent application come I be work my magic trust I Ziva when I be through you will be Code blue Someone 's be blackball they give you the red flag what be blue black and red Zebra in a blender that be black white and red all over Newspaper Penguin with a sunburn Nuns fall down stair why have I be reject seem we have a problem give I everything on Staff Sergeant Daniel Cryer you get it boss you red flag my application there be inconsistency that need to be address my psych evaluation yes inconsistency in my psychological profile somewhat troubling but expect you be hold in a prison camp for month but you survive it you do not talk about that with the counselor so now I be go to talk about it with you you 've be in the service of two master for too long your loyalty to your father and Mossad predate anything else my father be not an issue okay you want to stay here at NCIS let us talk that be the price of admission Let us start with the event that lead you to the camp run a diagnostic on the virus you remove from my computer go probie get over it I can not even figure out how the virus get in the system be not an attachment be not a Trojan horse do you quarantine the file hey I be a hacker I hack we get big issue Ziva 's in with Principal Vance get paddle or up a creek without one we get a dead Marine right what do we get I will tell you what we get we get Marine Staff Sergeant Daniel Cryer recruit right out of high school talk fast eliminate the dead air between your word I can absorb thing very quickly receive training at Camp Pendleton then ship out on multiple tour in Iraq and Afghanistan Specialized in counterintelligence Immaculate record until six month ago unauthorized absence fail to report back to his fire base outside Kandahar stop communicate take a breath have a keyboard well do what about the Damocles lose at sea about a hundred mile off the coast of Tanzania which be a couple hundred mile off its charted course they got lose at sea before they got lose at sea so we get Ziva on a ship that go down somewhere it be not suppose to be and body bag fill with goo from a dead that be not suppose to be there and nothing be what it be suppose to be Gibbs toss we the investigation disappear it be like Alien the Ridley Scott classic the creepy one as oppose to the non creepy one Cameron 's be more actiony than creepy and Fincher 's be more sleepy Jeunet be sort of a french fry I do not know what to call it anyway I hear skitter through the air duct Ziva have not be Ziva since we bring her home something happen to she out there now we be all wait to see if something pop out of her chest you be speak metaphorically right you be not suppose to leave the bridge I be go to go see Abby we should stay in pair soothe be you kid I this be horrible it be terrible I do not like it at all I do not like it either what I be agree with you do you have any idea what you be agree to no 'cause if you do you would not agree these be thermal image of weather pattern what we have here be a close up of a high pressure system push into a low pressure area the new air become warm and moist so while the warm air continue to rise the surround air have to swirl in and take its place which give you Snow Tropical storm Tropical storm Horn of Africa this be about the damocle what have you be work on Ziva 's say in her report that the ship go down in a storm base on the date this would have be the only weather pattern violent enough but Cryer 's body be find way over here stop agree with I McGee Cryer 's body must have be carry by the Agulhas Current along the coast of Africa but the storm it never go that far South it stay in the Equatorial Counter Current so if Cryer go down with the ship as far as the ship be concern in my purely scientific fact base opinion that ship be never anywhere near that storm tell I I be wrong McGee Abby I do not like it either but do not say it Abby I get it use your calculation of where the body be find we can backtrack the ocean current to find the exact location where the Damocles go down we can tell the salvage ship where to look for the wreckage they should already be there by now I call it in like an hour ago what be with the Sushi bar Staff Sergeant Cryer 's body be not alone on its considerable time adrift yeah that be probably what they think when they be feed on his flesh much like insect on land creature of the sea have a cyclical feeding pattern a pattern that can help confirm how long a body have be dead in the case of Staff Sergeant Cryer approximately 16 week fit with the time frame of the damocle ' sinking however drowning be not the cause of death Gunshot penetrate above the left ear yeah look at that no exit the miss jaw the occipital fracture that be the exit wound unfortunately we be unable to find a slug yes McGee what be the good news that be bad that be really bad yeah all right yeah Ducky I will let you know if there be anything else you can do your father Eli David offer you the vacant slot in the Kidon unit previously hold by Michael Rivkin that be correct Director David have intel that could be use to track the terrorist Saleem Ulman Responsible for the death of Americans and Israelis include a Mossad agent I can not comment on Mossad operation I know this to be true because I be the one who provide Eli with the intel you be no long in the employ of Mossad that do not change anything that be what concern I let us stick to geography you cross the israeli border at Eilat you book passage somehow on a cargo ship out of Aqaba you set out through the Red Sea towards the coast of Somalia but the Damocles never make it to port no it do not which bring I to the first question I actually need an answer to we recover a body from the Damocles wrap in plastic he be already dead before the ship go down the question can you explain that occasionally people die on board on a ship in transit in most case the corpse be wrap and then store in a freezer this body have a bullet hole in it I want to know how Staff Sergeant Daniel Cryer die what do we get salvage ship finally locate the Damocles find 18 more body in a cargo space look like the entire crew be execute be not you on the wrong side of the glass look at her look at the state she be in I would have think you would have want to be in there yourself rather than have vance interrogate she do not you have some body to attend to the evidence from the Damocles be be unload as we speak be not this punish she I mean you be not concerned that she might lie to you maybe it be tough love you do know there be other kind you be charge I with a crime seem like one be be commit ship look like a war zone jordanian flagship it be not your jurisdiction you be my jurisdiction at least you want to be have a seat for the record the US Marine among the dead that make it my business for the record I have not yet charge you with a crime then why be I in here for the record start record I should remind you that there be such a thing as a crime of omission take I to the Damocles that be no way to begin a relationship Cup of tea thank you my own blend a family tradition you be a woman you be a genius I have no problem with woman but I can not vouch for my man I be not pay you to assure my safety what be you pay I for Passage and discretion the second I can guarantee as for the first to Somalia you have be misinform the Damocles be head for Masqat that be not true you lie to protect his crew of course Shalev my friend what offense have I do that you would send I such people their money be good all money be good Welcome aboard we leave tonight the crew be sit down to eat Ziva you be come not hungry Aviv you go ahead we be right behind you we do not need to make friend with the crew we need their trust and break bread will ease their nerve at the moment it be not their nerve which concern I have you ever see a snake shed its skin and then try to crawl back into it it be not natural you do not need your old skin it be who you be inside just relax let it grow back the Americans leave you Ziva your family never have what be you look for hey all right all right I just think this be the head tell the truth or I shoot you in the head I make a mistake it be just a mistake I can not help but question you say you be go to Somalia why I do not know no one go to Somalia without a reason very few go with a reason he tell the truth he do not know he just work for I he open door he should not be open I feel I should shoot he I would rather you do not I ask he to find we some privacy he work for you good night I do not mean to not another word you should not be snoop around that be how I make my living not if you do anything to jeopardize this mission I will kill you myself and the man you save that night who be he he be a private contractor we hire to put we on the ship he say his name be Daniel Shalev but you know otherwise that be the name he use in Jordan he go by Daniel Cryer when he be a US Marine do you know he be a Marine in a ship fill with smuggler and thief he do not fit in so you trust he do you know the word mishpacha it be family he be not you can not trust a man whose loyalty have a price nice bedside manner you be lucky you be not dead that be true for anyone the other be up at the breakfast buffet Malachi want to let you get some rest past couple of week have be try who be you exactly Mr Shalev your hebrew name do not fit well I be just bar mitzvahe late life awaken not too late I be 31 year old and adept at dodge question who be I do anybody really like answer that question how do you define yourself you be what you say you be what you eat you be what you do you be reckless you mean last night with that psycho Numas I 've talk my way out of bad situation I be sure you have if you do not want to give yourself away lose the jewelry I would soon die than take this necklace off you ought to know get it you you be the senior field agent so it be my responsibility to answer Gibbs ' phone in his absence then you have to get it how do you figure that because you be suppose to do all my work because of the bet this be Special Agent McGee we have a Mossad Officer okay I will escort he up Escort who someone name Ben Gidon get he I will get Gibbs the ship be suppose to resupply Saleem you grease Cryer 's palm to book passage that sound like something he be not he cash out of the corps look I have learn many thing from Gibbs one of the first lesson there be no such thing as an ex Marine regardless of who Cryer have become Boss we get a problem what can we do for you Officer Ben Gidon I have come for Ziva David you be hold a member of my team hostage in there your team 's have a rough year I think you already miss your chance to rescue Ziva then I hope I have arrive in time to rescue she from you Hostage yeah that be the word of Officer Malachi Ben Gidon I be keep Ziva hostage Leon she be get no connection to NCIS except we pull she out of the desert and they do not why do not they we find her first Eli do not send his clean he send the Kidon team leader Ziva 's command Officer he say if we force Ziva to talk about Mossad operation she will be in violation of israeli law she be not at liberty to speak to we no he do not want she to talk he be get to put something on the table why do not we see how much rope he be get probably just enough to hang himself there be coaster in the cabinet Ice water I keep the top shelf on the bottom everything be upside down you should have tell I you be come I would have pick you up at the airport return the favor good to see you so I be really sorry that we have not stay in touch since Israel not even so much as an e card Modern time everyone 's so busy I hope we be show you the same hospitality you guy show I I have a blast in Israel anyone offer you tea or coffee we be out of gefilte fish do you truly enjoy jelly ball of carp or be you merely be anti semitic hold on one second yeah boss DiNozzo bring our guest downstair now will do Manners where be mine let I take you to Ziva where be she you worry we bury she in a deep dark hole someplace leave she to rot that be not our style you have have adequate time for debrief cease your interrogation and return she immediately the thank of a grateful nation these be Director David 's instruction you be just the messenger I respect Director David 's intention but I get a dead Marine downstairs I can not release she until I find out what happen on that ship I be there too I tell you what happen and Ziva go free who be they cheer for the favorite they be fickle we make landfall in two day that be the schedule there have be no change I have Aviv monitor all on board transmission too far at sea for radio to land Satellite phone you do not trust the Captain I do not trust anyone Yosef have be in contact with Saleem 's courier to alert he of their arrival you think he suspect we I think there be too much talk we need silence you be contemplate a change to the plan tomorrow the ship'll be in range of the coast we can not do anything until then your father say any mean necessary I have not see this many soggy electronic since wet Monday at science camp we use to build water gun water cannon water balloon launcher actually it be a terrible idea in retrospect Forensic triage these phone and radio be go to need repair all these weapon be a ballistic nightmare we be go to need a plan of attack here that would violate my philosophy a philosophy I have many philosophy but I be talk about one that be relevant to now when deal with large amount of evidence which be no plan just go find along the way if you look for something specific then there be only one right answer high five McGee what be that for positive energy the collision of two life force in solidarity the reverberation will be feel by the rest of team Ziva wherever they may be hide Gibbs be not hide he be not act like he be on her team one more come on for Ziva I be in need of clarification that perhaps you could provide Anthony if you would not mind believe I I would not mind Director Vance will not permit I to be without an escort well in that case after you my dear wait Ducky complex situation often call for creative solution the crew of the Damocles remove from their watery grave sit down I do not know what game they be play upstairs but I have have enough first and foremost you be our friend I want to be a friend Ziva Bahir Numas Quadir Nawaf Kassib Yosef Emir Aza Bilal I do not need to know their name and yet you carry the weight of their death around with you and there be no need to I mean trust we as we trust you let they go there be only one name Staff Sergeant Daniel Cryer yeah that be he there I know he as Daniel Shalev the truth Ziva may set you free and it may not some body be not mean to stay bury what happen to he Cabin fever Paranoia maybe we just underestimate they as it turn out we be not the only one monitor outgoing transmission you can not be certain that Shalev have tell the crew anything I will not take that chance we may have already be deliver like rat to the trap if we have be compromise Ziva our contingency plan be to take everyone Idiot hold your fire Numas I think you be they who the Mossad that you let on board you should keep your distance the one who get too close always end up dead she know that Cryer be a Marine do not matter if he change his name and become a mercenary that be it she be do here if it be true you want to give she a chance to deny it she can not even speak on the subject on the record Malachi 's more than willing all right pass the baton you ready to play bad cop you 've be play good cop all this time Leon Put they together say nothing Ziva I be handle this I have nothing to say to you just drop Ziva in the lion 's den any second that door 's go to open and Gibbs be go to ask we what do we get so what do we get Abby and I be drown in ballistic we have no time to process everything though we be able to nail the location of the final battle and ID the player that be good since Malachi tell we exactly that well we can confirm it include the part where he say Ziva kill the Marine we need something else Ducky 's get something Ducky 's get a folder yes and a grow sensation in the bursa sac of my left knee hence the elevator rather than the stair which would be Ducky Folder yes well all I have be cause of death form multiple body with nine millimeter gunshot wound an abundance with 5 7 by 28 in the chest and

the night before Halloween and then of course Halloween itself Tony you hate Halloween anyway it be a lot of money and I like money that be why someone keep ring my doorbell and run off when I be a kid on base at Alameda we call it devil 's night one year we put the base Commander 's bedroom furniture on a tarmac it take less than a tenth of a second for the engine of an F 18 to move a barcalounger 300 foot good memory Ring n run dine n ditch Lock n load get a dead marine Agent David you be drive Victim be Marine Lance Corporal James Korby he just get back from his third tour of Afghanistan three day ago Family live here with his wife and stepdaughter local leo be try to track they down no obvious sign of struggle inside the car no blood look like a suicide look can be deceive there be no way that man kill himself in that car Jethro Jacking that one up from beyond the yard Duck I can barely see that far Carboxyhemoglobin do not require close inspection if carbon monoxide have be the cause of that man 's death his skin would be cherry red which it be not ergo Body be stage to look like a suicide yeah Korby live for mischief night he be the king of practical joke I guess that make you the prince of prank be we in trouble not unless you kill he I will handle the question here probie thank you we be talk about Korby Guy be awesome come up with new practical joke every Halloween nothing dangerous I mean no razor blade he would freeze all kind of stuff blow thing up it be funny and illegal and you be Ted Rodgers Live across the street first he drive we crazy with his prank now he die in the driveway it sound like you get a problem in your neighborhood Mr Rodgers that be a nice sweater by the way boy we be go to need that videotape yes you can use it to document what these punk do last night we be only interested in what happen to Lance Corporal Korby thank you you get a time of death Duck this can not be true I mean the heat from the exhaust fume should raise his body temperature but he be curiously cold Frigid in fact it be a mystery to be solve by examination later it must be Korby 's joke lab and possibly our crime scene sign of a struggle how can you tell this place be a mess prankster do not break their own stuff well he be certainly in rigor guess we should lay he down unless he be go to drive Zombie Halloween Come on I be sorry what be that sound like it come from inside the body push he down flat no idea even if he be in full rigor he would not be brittle Forceps Mr Palmer it be odd indeed thank you Let us see now be that glass no it be part of his throat look it be frozen solid what could get something that cold Dry ice or liquid nitrogen either way I think you find your cause of death 67 on the tally of disturbance how about we focus on a crime in our jurisdiction thrill I McGoblin Lance Corporal James Korby a joker with no criminal record and one big blemish on his service record bump back in rank for dereliction of duty explain why he be a 37 year old Lance Corporal this be his wife Sara Korby he do not kill himself how do you know because nobody marry to her kill themselves she be way too attractive for he the wife do it should we even bother investigate or just go ahead and arrest she I like where you be go with that do you have any idea where the wife be last night Tony no do you yes I just get off the phone with the Seabright hotel and spa in Virginia Beach where Korby 's wife be check in and and she and Korby 's stepdaughter be on their way in to I D the body and and what she spend the night alone in a hotel three day after her husband get back from the Middle East Probies the wife do it you always say that well it be almost always true excuse I I be Sara Korby yes you be now Mrs Korby your husband be alone last night be that right yes Halloween be his favorite time of year Practical joke be his passion I be in Virginia Beach I spend the night at a friend 's until the police break it up Party be over anyway right I notice you have quite the setup in your garage James would spend day in there this time of year a couple year back we make a deal he would spend Halloween work on his project and I would spend the night at a spa I do not want to go this year 'cause he would just get back but James do not mention any problem do he fight disagreement that kind of thing everything seem fine he have a car pick I up drive I to Virginia Beach Rachel he be your stepfath James and Sara be both my stepparent my mom die when I be little I marry Rachel 's father five year ago he be kill in Iraq I be sorry everyone like James even if they do not get his sense of humor speak of no sense of humor what about your neighbor Ted Rodgers a few day ago when he realize that James be back from Afghanistan they have some word about my husband 's idea of fun Ted complain about everything yeah I pick up on that interesting date for such a ghoulish demise it be a cool way to go Cool as in cold I be sorry you be not take pleasure out of the method of our victim 's death be you Mr Palmer no of course not it be just like what you say very Halloween y just remind I of a few prank I be not too proud of then perhaps you should refrain from discuss they then what can we discuss Duck Confirmation of my early hypothesis to wit courtesy of Abby Manner of death be indeed the ingestion of liquid nitrogen a colorless odorless substance which be so cold that when it come into contact with warm organic material it literally boil yeah you see here for instance this be our stomach stand in Mr Palmer with pleasure doctor what be also important to note be that Korby 's throat have previous scar tissue from before he be kill Meaning no idea Abby 's work on that now what we do know be that Korby ingest enough nitrogen to freeze his internal organ but technically that be not the cause of death what be breathing the nitrogen gas enter his lung essentially suffocate he thank you Mr Palmer so he do not die right away he live on for several minute base on the rate of thaw and the condition of the body I would estimate that the time of death be somewhere between 10 00 and midnight sorry that be cold I get it I get it I will just clean this up how much do he ingest a single gulp would suffice likely he be force feed or he be catch off guard either way it be no accident certainly not a suicide look at this two ply double roll top tuck with a 30 foot vertical climb that kid have get an arm Perfect drape age it be good trunk to top ratio as well it be very impressive I do not see the humor or the art it be a cultural thing Tony will tell you who be you call right thank have the wife 's file send over do your gut ever give you a stomachache Tony keep snicker while I be over here break the case everyone be break the case you bring we coffee it be apple cider Yep Happy Halloween Break 's over run it yes we be still scrub the video from the kid multiple neighbor have file complaint against Korby but only one neighbor have file multiple complaint Ted Rodgers live across the street I still think the wife be this have get some back bite a little peppery a hint of clove and really rodger you two go there be no candy here we do not want candy speak for yourself David open up or we will send the kid in very convincing nerd outfit this be how I dress for work you be go

let us talk about what about the three police report you file against James Korby over the year his antic have cost I a lot of time and money Shaving cream in my mailbox food color in my pool I do not care if he be a hero in Afghanistan on this block he be a pain in the ass Girlfriend in college get a restraining order against you so I be guess there be a temper under that cardigan we have a witness who say you confront Korby yesterday give the history between you two be you accuse I of murder no we be just ask you really nicely if you do it so Mr Rodgers do you kill your neighbor where be you last night between 10 00 pm and midnight Online live in front of the camera on my computer with our office in Shanghai every minute I do not trust a guy who do not give candy to kid trick or treat Great Energy drink just what this holiday need their parent be go to love that hey Abby Welcome to the random factory Gibbs Most of Korby 's prank stuff it be motion sensor activate so until I get a chance to process it all you need to move very slowly no costume this year abs after last year 's Jonas brother debacle Vance ban the costume McGee skinny jean it do not work what do you get a car at the scene of the crime it be only a glimpse but the time stamp indicate that it be take around the time of death 11 13 pm you get a plate no visual on the driver but when I enhance the image I do manage to get this it be a livery number from the Quantico Marine base motor pool vehicle can only be sign out by a Marine Nice work abs wait wait there be more Sample from our dead Marine 's stomach I expect to find liquid nitrogen of course but I do not expect to find trace of turpentine acetone and benzene in his flesh Paint thin yeah Liquid nitrogen kill he last night but it be not the cause of his ulcerated stomach le someone try to poison he before last night when accord to the chemical level he ingest the paint thin two month ago while he be still overseas whoever try to kill Lance Corporal Korby in Afghanistan finish it here what be the matter McGee no one come to your door I think I deserve a treat why be that because the wife do it probie the stepdaughter Rachel be from a previous marriage but Sara Korby have be marry three time all Marines all dead all with juicy life insurance payout once be a tragedy twice a coincidence three time be a pattern we be talk about a black op widow Tony the first two husband die in the line of duty give you no reason to suspect she have anything to do with the third one 's death well I get Evidence not to speak of Boss then stop speak accord to base record the car we be look for be still miss from the livery no sign of anyone check it out Boss I be go to find that car Korby 's tour in Afghanistan his file where be it Central

detriment to unit cohesion and morale I also say Korby be a dedicated courageous hard work Marine even in battle he be a practical joker no yes Ma'am right what be funny in boot camp be not always funny in a live fire zone two school of thought in battle some Marines like to keep their focus Head on a swivel yeah some like to keep it loose to keep from crack half the guy love Korby the other half not so much what about you as their squad leader it be my job to keep the peace between the two well someone get mad enough at Korby to slip he a dose of paint thin almost kill he Korby be ill a few day think it be a stomach virus never say anything about be poison where be you two night ago finish up debrief paperwork never leave the base who in the unit have the big problem with Korby no

McGee it be unbecoming talk I be able to put together a brief history of Korby 's unit it be not good it have multiple transfer request complaint they be deem not combat ready two different time Unit be in chaos Korby 's distraction be more serious than his squad leader lead we to believe this start 2 month ago after Korby be poison before that only exemplary remark about the unit Citations Promotions they be on their third tour a well oil machine what would make a Marine unit fall apart lack of discipline Yep or too much 18 000 breath a day it be hardly surprising what end up in one 's lung Bacteria insect guess we will have to wait and see what our dead Marine inhale take those up to Abby would you please yes Doctor I be glad you be here body be beat doc I find evidence of multiple contusion and abrasion usually I do my autopsy from the outside in but due to the frosty circumstance here I be force to reverse the process when well base on the healing of this rib fracture here I would say that those injury be probably sustain before he be poison the first time Afghanistan Attackers avoid vital organ correct there be no blow on the kidney or spleen try to teach he a lesson try to hurt he without really hurt he you 've see this before I presume yeah Code red somebody give Korby a beat down before move on to poison someone there be trace of bruise on his wrist and ankle additionally subdural contusion suggest that at least four assailant deliver a myriad of blow these pattern tell I that this be more than just someone Whole squad want this guy go Duck where be we go

all of his exploit on his phone it be like a master 's course 600 pizza deliver to the Battalion CP he reassemble a Humvee inside the Officer 's club if only I have the appropriate time and space to use the bounty of idea in front of I the case abs the case I finish process everything from Korby 's garage still no murder weapon which mean the killer either keep it or they dump it and probably nearby and certainly with trace of nitrogen I alert local waste management to be on the lookout for hazardous material and the Fire Department 's Hazmat team be search the entire neighborhood a lot of manpower a four block radius and more than 60 home can I have my Caf pow now no more refill I just come to return the surplus nitrogen it be the result from the substance that you and Ducky find in the dead Marine 's lung that be odd trace of chicken stock coffee bean cocoa Lunch yeah but I do not find trace of any of this food in his stomach the nitrogen gas must have carry the particle into the lung there could have be food residue on the inside of the container the killer use to administer the liquid nitrogen like a lunchbox think like a thermos you know perfect size insulate it be discreet Palmer you be a genius the killer probably use Korby 's coffee thermo to poison he now I can tell the Hazmat team what to look for that be great work both of you Ladies clean up the crime

you be talk about you bet your ass I do I be talk about the american dream what do you know about the american dream well let us see I be a white male between the age of 18 and 49 with a loud mouth and a gun I be the american dream thank God Agent McGee two dead body McGee photo come your way tell Abby to clear the deck okay what be we look at Boss I do not know yet I secure the crime scene Director and begin to process it I run the vin and find the boat be register to an NCIS Agent Gibbs that be you right so what be the deal what be with the dead guy Shell casing Izzy Bagged and tag Sir I take it you do not move the body no Doctor I be train well than that there be no identification in their pocket Jethro only cash dollar and Pesos Agent Cortez if you do not know that this boat load with dead body belong to an NCIS Agent how do you think it end up roll into a naval base I would speculate give the current it come from the south somewhere in Mexico possibly as for who might have set it on its course I would not think to guess you usually light the thing on fire for a vike funeral you know any Vikings who live in Mexico this do have more of a wild west feel to it solve it already Glad I make the trip you 've only take one vacation this year Jethro sail the gulf route to Mexico one way plane ticket back do I have the fish or do I have the lasagna I leave he with the boat he trailere it to the West Coast it be a gift for my goddaughter this be how he repay you I get no idea what be go on here you guy already know who the killer be Agent Cortez use your contact with the Federales Clear a path for we we be head South to the border it be not go to be necessary be you sure Nobody 's home so where be he where the hell be Mike Franks that be it be no long in this be Gibbs ' boat this be the crime scene it be fly here in a C 130 cargo plane along with two body and all the evidence and now it be mine it be all mine so I can figure out the mystery what mystery who the dead guy be or who kill they or how they end up on the boat Sure you guy should work on that while I figure out how he get it out of the basement flag all of Franks ' know alias no hit yet God know he be get a head start on we Ducky say that those body have be float around for at least three day AFIS kick out any I D s yet Calvin Blanchard Roy Keenan they both have military background they be both dishonorably discharge Blanchard be Army Keenan wash out of the Navy a couple year ago Mike Franks be already retire so no professional connection Cortez have get a contact in Mexico say these two guy be go around ask about Mike Franks last week you sift through family member common friend in the service could not find anyone with a grudge be that where your gut 's lead you Gibbs we get two guy look for Franks who really do not want to be find they find he on the boat he get the drop shove them off and disappear that last part be the part I really do not like if he be go to ground that mean this be not over yet you get any idea where he might be no your guess be as good as mine Leon for some reason I doubt that be true but I be go to give you some leeway on this gibb since it be your friend your boat your mess my patience will evaporate quickly if another body show up before Franks do I 've only just begin Jethro I be afraid you 've jump the gun that be an interesting choice of word Duck how positively freudian of I well I be go to say deliberate I can tell you they be shoot over and over and over again a total of six in one and five in the other at close range with a large caliber weapon Reminiscent of the death of Billy Clanton at the o K Corral get something against cowboy Duck although I 've always be fond of the way that element manifest itself in you Jethro I have never be entirely comfortable with the psychological makeup of your mentor but Wyatt Earp be friend with Doc Holliday and as they would attest there be a fine line between cowboy and outlaw and with the level of overkill here your conclusion be Mike Franks have cross that line too soon to accuse he of be an unthinke killer Ducky no that be not what I be say at all it be quite the opposite I think a great deal of thought go into these killing and the staging of the crime scene Staging Wood splinter take from their backside they be drag onto the Kelly intentionally I would be surprised if anything about her discovery be not intentional I assure you I be use the utmost care process your beautiful craftsmanship it be a craftsman 's ship the body be move I have blood trail on the rail and the deck that suggest they be at least slide Slidden Ducky say that they have be slud if Ducky say they slad they the firefight Abby be it on board at first glance I have a lot of downward vector Downward meaning stand over the top Execution style yeah so I be try to find corresponding slug for all the spent 45 casing I would say that it end here but it may not be where it start another bullet graze the port side it be small caliber than the other 22 could be 22 deteriorate significantly on impact so there be no slug and it be below the waterline Boat be not in the water during the shoot out maybe or maybe somebody be use it for target practice it be one of many inconsistency that have to be address there be the angle of trajectory to calculate and all of the unaccounted for slug I still have to dig they out of the woodwork I mean I have to carefully extract they from the woodwork take it apart be you sure similar size deposit on roughly the same date suggest that Blanchard and Keenan work together but the receipt be all cash can not make a financial link to Franks now why would two bad guy go after Mike Franks well clearly they do not know he very well interesting theory McGee I mean that more as a joke some of the great idea in history start out as joke I mean look you get your mood re pet rock spork those be all terrible idea yes terrible idea that turn their inventor into drillionaire and that be the american dream Ziva and that be why you be never go to pass that test the heart of America be that any idiot can become a success that be exactly right 'cause we do not live in an aristocracy or a meritocracy neither do Israel we just have our capitalist democracy which mean that you might be a pauper today you might be live a life of wall to wall desperation you might have no friend no prospect no brain no hope but tomorrow tomorrow you might win the lottery you might slip on the right driveway tomorrow just like Annie sing the Comic Strip little orphan Annie Curly red hair no eyeball adopt by Daddy warbuck and that be the american dream right there little orphan Annie and I be not there an essay section on this citizenship exam you should be write this stuff down it be good Shame my pencil break Destruction of U S Government property that be not go to look too good on the Boss we 've be research the dead guy McGee have an interesting idea what be that exactly because you just start talk bunch of nonsense and never actually say what you be think what I be think Boss be maybe they do not know Franks at all you know find the connection but maybe they it be okay we be here look Amira it be your godfather can you say hi hello Amira Welcome to my home he be right behind we you can put she down in there thank you you go to stand there glare at I probie or you go to give I a hand with the bag or you go to shoot I no I think I would ask you a few question first then I may shoot you all right need some answer Mike all

but you be ready for they I know what they want I could see the cannon tuck in their back do not even think about it I do not feel great use Amira 's boat like that but I could not risk be investigate by stranger or bad even the Federales so you steer they at the Navy if you be go to be investigate well it be by a friend thank for the honor you do not sound too grateful you know Mike I be use to shell and body and cover up as your big finale something start off like this I do not even want to think about the count you can not pin all they past caper on I probie not all they mess be mine where be Leyla and Amira you do not think I would start throw shot with my daughter in law and my granddaughter not safely tuck away do you I be not a child no you definitely be not call I old I be say there come a time to hang up your spur I will not need you or anybody to tell I when that be I will know 'cause I will be dead I hate when you talk like that I would not do anything to put my girl in danger that be why I bring they here and if you can not find out who be after I and why then I 've get no choice but to do not say it be not I allow to say anything he be threaten to leave we he say it be the only way to keep we safe to stay away when Liam die I make a promise to my son and to myself I protect my family well from here on you leave it to the professional these two guy be professional or be pmc private military contractor accord to a Captain Hazelton we speak to one of his former classmate Blanchard crack up before he could get his act together he be out the door

man and now you want to drag in Colonel Merton Bell and that be not all right with you no do I need to explain my problem I think that you be go to give I some room on this I be and I be but I know Colonel Bell we have friend in common on the Hill then this be about politic your approach lack finesse Finesse you could show he the same courtesy I show you when this case begin you mean rub his nose in it you can go heavy if you want but we be talk about the man with the large private collection of legally obtain hardware in the United States he be get Black Hawks in his front yard be you worried I be too blunt Leon you be transparent two of his man be dead you know who kill they I do not want Bell to get the impression that we be harbor a murderer why would he jump to that conclusion you do not appear to be devote too much time in track down his killer if I be Bell that might make I nervous Hell if I be I that might make I nervous Mike Franks and his family be at my house and you be about to send your agent over there to keep an eye on they Sure while I find a more delicate way to approach Colonel Bell that be anything you want to help I with maybe it be like we be read each other 's mind hello should have tell I you be come I call and you do not pick up not go to answer the phone I be a fugitive what do you want I to do Knock why would I knock there be no lock on that

look out for no it be not all negative sometimes the chatter be a little more innocuous People talk about a need to build a new school give we an opportunity to combine our effort increase our odd of success they be good at their job I be sure I do not detect a note of surprise in your voice Special Agent Gibbs all my man be outstanding United States Armed Forces disagree my company may not adhere to the same some might say punitive restriction nevertheless we seem to be pick up more and more of their responsibility every time the U S reduce the number of troop deploy you have to increase your hire Gibbs it be understandable Director Jarheads and Mercs be like oil and water although I 've get some of my good man off the Marine Corps scrap heap the man you hire have history of violence insubordination mental problem what do you have to do to be disqualify if you intend to cast aspersion on the name of two dead man two of my man I would prefer you just cut to the chase and ask the real question okay do you know two of your man be in Mexico carry weapon you furnish of course I do they inform I when they accept the contract they be carry out a contract on Mike Franks who the hell be Mike Franks well thank you for your cooperation Colonel Bell I expect you will keep I apprise Director Justice need to be do here be that the bad guy hey probie be that the guy that put the hit on I no one be after you what you be just the only lead they have who be they Leyla and Amira 's family from Iraq they hire those two pmc to find they and you kill them you want to know who the real bad guy be here Mike go look in the damn mirror you do not look very remorseful about what these two man be hire by your daughter in law 's family to find she there be no reason to believe that they mean she or you any harm it appear you kill they in cold blood that how it appear to you I can not say how it go Mike I be not there you be there when Leyla first come over you know a thing or two about her family they disown she disown she because she get pregnant by my son Liam that be not family those two guy be do Shada Shakarji 's bidding do not expect I to cry for they Shada Shakarji be Leyla 's family her mother hard as nail matriarch of one of the most prominent tribe in Iraq it be unorthodox for a woman to be in that position of prominence do not exactly run for the office Shada bury her father her brother and her husband in the war with Iran lose her old son to Saddam and a couple of more since Family be about out of man but not memory she be a vindictive old sow and when Amty Shada cut you off you be not suppose to get a happily ever after on a beach in Mexico she be willing to pay to drag them back home she be not go to flinch at a couple of dead gun for hire what do you use what what do you use 45 how many shot I use the boat as a decoy leave the radio on the deck and an open beer they go for it with gun draw empty my mag from the porch put two in the big guy and three in the other reload drag them on board and give them each three more for good measure it be self defense take his statement the evidence well confirm every bit of it Abby what be you do what be you do he tell I to do it I have to do it but I be try to do it like an archaeologist I be keep careful note of where everything come from and I be sure I can put it back together again when I be do you be use a chainsaw well it be not like there be a zipper I mean I be hope for a zipper or some sort of system of dowel and slot please tell I it be worth it I find a secret stash box Grease residue suggest that Franks keep a gun in there the guy keep a gun everywhere take we 15 minute to get through security Franks be smuggle a piece be it a 22 no it be a saw blade curl in the hollow out heel of his boot 22 I do not think he carry anything that small I find this mangle piece of lead embed deep in the floorboard I think it be two slug smash together like boom boom one bullet hit another bullet yeah it be an impossible shot yeah if they be both in the air at the same time it be a bullet in a bullet Abby 's analyze it now but if it be a piece of a 22 in a 45 then you break up there what be you say I can not hear you McGee I be in the basement why 'cause I do not want to talk about the case in front of Leyla and the kid listen Tony this be really important I need you to check the seam of the wall the wall well do they appear to be removable or a tunnel maybe could be hide underneath something on the floor something that look like it do not belong actually I think Colonel Hogan have get a radio in the coffee pot but the tunnel might have be fill in I see a video on the internet once where this guy he build a Lamborghini in his basement they have to pull off half the house to get it out be that a ding I think we 've get another shooter you have very peaceful eye Amira do you know that yes she do I leave Iraq because I do not want to expose she to the violence I see as a child I want that peace to last in her eye forever you make difficult choice for both of you sometimes the most significant moment happen in your life without any choice at all like your father I know the cost of even talk to Liam but I could not help it the feeling be irresistible it be love at first sight maybe do you miss your homeland it be difficult to leave it all behind but the right reason make

Wuan Kai Director 's be assemble a file for year but you Dunham you have have first hand exposure yeah early in my career my second foreign field assignment be in the demilitarize zone outside of Pyongyang North Korea you monitor the chinese border Movement along the Amnok river Kim Jong Il have an agreement with the Chinese let his op use the river to exit the country and he would make it worth their while with a lot of government grow opium one of those op be Kai she be the boss 's go to and who could blame he Kai be the good in the early ' 80 an ambitious upper level minister start train young girl orphan mostly to kill for the cause they feed them house them give them a life worth live sort of I 've do a little research on my own and base on what I 've gather Kai be brainwash start off innocent but when the other crack she do not Shor in Hebrew it mean the bull Stubborn it be why she be so good you should know be that why she be here for Vance that be not doubtful I make some call talk to CIA evidently old reliable be not what she use to be Government 's lose patience with her Name it be probably Pak Su Ji he be an old Lieutenant be around since day one of the program now he be retire part of a permanent mission to the UN you know it be funny that Kai 's here and he just check into a downtown hotel do not you all think it be in your blood be not it what be you be think how you would get he maybe some intense mind game follow by sheer force go for the jugular or the slow kill you be a dangerous woman who be I get Agent Dunham why would you want Dunham I think we be talk about Pak Su Ji Dunham be from Texas I like Texas what be the saying anyway he clean up nice not that nice I think he be kind of creepy come on stop be such big brother he be a field agent a nomad I 've have enough of that in my life I come to NCIS to settle down to make a home for myself the last thing I need be a Chad Dunham however what well to answer your question how would I get he Brute force be very intriguing and who be we talk about right now Pak Su Ji or the Texas longhorn so why be I look at a bullet from an L A case file because it be different than the slug that Kai use to kill Cirreux normally she use a large caliber this one be plan for specific damage so Ducky be right so that mean the ballistic report be not do yet nope it be not do okay Guess I will come back later you look happy I do yeah it be a it be become actually you be like confident be there anything you want to tell I no you sure nothing 's new nothing at all I start see someone I know and I be

really remember my second cousin 's wedding 'cause I be six and I have this weird allergic reaction to avocado Abby I really get to get back upstairs right definitely just let I know when the report 's do congrat again you expect I to contact the North Koreans and say what Kai might be here to kill one of their own base on a theory a hunch just because Pak Su Ji 's in town do not make he Kai 's next target besides why would they ever listen why not what be she do Gibbs she come to my house she could have kill I but she do not it be like she be play some game how long have you know she Leon too long you be the constant no I be the enemy be you what be she do what do she really want you know she well you tell I I be sorry director the tv turn it on go live to Guy Ross for the late on the

be here because she turn up outside the Director 's house there be that first victim the Doctor and now she be gun down this government stooge there be a pattern so if she be not work for her country anymore who be she kill for right away that be the State Department there be a message for we from the North Koreans Director Vance Special Agent Gibbs what can we do for you ma'am the North Koreans have contact we through back channel they be sadden about today 's event and they be well aware of your ongoing relationship with former operative Lee Wuan Kai Former that be correct they give their word that if she be responsible in any way for the recent bloodshed it be against the wish of their government if that be true will the North Koreans help we capture her absolutely Director and then prosecute she to the full extent of their law and ours it be almost like Kai 's dangle it in his face like she be say here I be Director I shoot another one look at I ma Top of the world who be that it be Cagney in White Heat the one with the ballet dancer that be White Nights with Gregory Hines and Mikhail Baryshnikov anyway maybe Kai be just try to impress he there be nothing impressive about

interesting what well I be compare Pak Su Ji 's toxicology report to Cirreux 's they both contract hand foot mouth virus late in life it be common with kid but not with adult you know it stay dormant in the body that why you call I down here no I call you because of this Pak Su Ji do not die from his gunshot wound gibb something in his bloodstream trigger a massive heart attack after surgery something invisible that never have the chance to spread through the Doctor something like Poison both Kai 's 22 round and the rifle slug be dip in a lethal toxin call Atropa Belladonna never trust a beautiful woman whoever shoot Cirreux also shoot the north korean and want to make sure that if the bullet do not kill he the poison would backup system she create her own fail safe what be you hide it be too late I can not you be an enabler and I love you for it Gosh you look beat let us go sit down be you okay I 've be up all night why what happen come on you be scare I Tim what what be it last

both have hand foot mouth virus they have to be expose at some point I hate it when he do that it be totally unsatisfying what do we know about the training program that recruit Kai a whole team of people Military doctor government type Abs bring up the group shoot Yep that photo 's 30 year old that be Kai right there in the middle and this be a young Pak Su Ji and this be Dr Cirreux she be murder the man who do this to her who turn she into a killer why indeed to think of the loss that could have be avoid so what now Duck do she keep hunt down the people who do this to her I doubt there be any left Cirreux be their medical consultant he physically rob she of her childhood he turn weak little girl into cold hearted killer Pak Su Ji the father figure the puppet master for Kai the Frankenstein for her those two be the responsible parental figure what about Vance well all her life she be pursue by one man not physically or sexually of course but mentally he be chase she court she you might say remember she be probably never have a relationship she do not know what it be like to love or be love my fear now be that she will probably turn to he for help I mean in her mind he

through her heart they be not take any chance that she would talk she still talk this contusion here corroborate the security guard 's story of her capture however these handcuff bruise be far too profound for she to have do they herself Gunmen try to free she before they kill she yes which show they do it as a last resort which suggest a concern for her welfare go ahead with the power out in the rest of the building I offer 107 to the staff anything else well you know how I strive for balance Jethro with two thing that I can explain follow by two that I can not the first this swelling of her extremity well there be medical condition that would explain such edema but the Lieutenant show no anatomical indication of have any of they blood work well I send it out to Abby but with her Mass Spec down I think it might be quite some time before we get result I would the second thing I discover extensive evidence of severe and widespread trauma break bone stab wound scar gunshot wound but accord to her record she be never be in combat there be more to this woman than meet the eye Jethro I can not believe it I just can not believe Emma 's dead when be the last time you speak to Lieutenant Paxton I mean yeah this be the Military but this be the entertainment division when people die here it be on stage just the fact ma'am I be sorry we last speak three day ago before she be suppose to leave for Baghdad she be not go to Baghdad we speak when she call in sick which be kinda how I be feel right now I be sorry I be allergic to perfume and you be wear quite a bit I be not wear any I do not have any hot water and it be not perfume it be Eau de Cologne note how exactly do you have power portable generator we deploy they for concert overseas Tony if Lieutenant Paxton be never suppose to go to Baghdad she be lie to her husband I know she be to I she say she be really sick she need to stay home a few day but an hour later I see she walk down 30th street with a man she do not look sick at all do you get any description he be a male a male man anything else it be okay well let us get crackin ' how do people survive before search engine sorry boss I get another paper cut keep them thank boss almost do go through these bank statement I promise take a little break be you DiNozzo I would very much like to we be run down a lead from Lieutenant Resnick 's CO more like

Paxton 's credit card and bank statement be clean so basically we get nothing do blister count then we have nothing speak for yourself I finally I D have the tire track from the swiftcast getaway car I get the make and the model it only take I 72 time long than it usually do how do people survive before there be pattern recognize sparse representation algorithm do you get my battery sorry the entire city 's be de duracell'd we be look for a Chevy Impala wait a ' 99 Chevy Impala I be not sure of the year why I 've be jonese since our link feed go down I been listen to the police band all day until my battery die get a report here of an abandon car from Baltimore PD boss it be a Chevy Impala one of the swiftcast guard say he hit the rear window Engine be cold look like we get a blood trail Clear this be like the Tardis Tard what it be a contraption that Doctor who travel through time in never mind doctor who who watch that this be more like Lord of War Nic Cage movie from a few year back pack with gun you have the gun that Rambo use it be a good movie take a look at this it be our dead woman multiple passport multiple identity that be a regular Jason Bourne identi kit not exactly standard issue for Military 's entertainment division I do not know I hear showbiz can be pretty rough perhaps that would explain why Lieutenant Paxton have be moonlight yeah but moonlight as what well I 've use site like this before Mossad call they sanctuarie each operative maintain their own as a place to prepare for their op what you think Paxton be run some kind of op well I think at this point we should be ask who be she run it for it be get its own generator think I might be able to get we some answer all right come on baby you can do it well so much for answer I think I just find we a new question they come here in this car and then it look like they leave in a hurry in a second one hey boss I feel like Davy Crockett trackin ' them down get a second set of track Abby 's go to be thrill we get something blueprint for Swiftcast and the Pepco substation where the power be cut whatever the plan be look like it be plan here Husband be not go to like hear he be married to Mata Hari he be not go to like what else we find either his wife be not the only one with a fake passport you be record this we record all interrogation Interrogation you say you just have a few question I just have one that be not mine I 've never see that before in my life it be your picture yeah where have you get it your wife have it she keep a container off of route 50 why would my wife what do you want I to say the truth I tell you before my wife be the victim here you want answer you be go to have to give some okay look it be some thing be not add up how nothing I could put my finger on when you live with someone you just you get a feeling I do not say anything before because I know Emma be a good person and damn if I be go to give you help prove otherwise but you still have doubt I do not know what I have I think may maybe she could have be cheat on I but she be not she be not do anything wrong and I can prove it how I hire a private investigator to follow she I have his tape you can see for yourself little more contrast on the big screen please little less that be perfect need any help no I do not you sure I mean technology 's not my thing but maybe I could be your techno wingman do you know what that mean no it mean that I 've get it cover so I want you to go do whatever it be that you be do what exactly be you do again I be hand file evidence custody document from the crime scene yeah have fun with that I hope you blow a fuse Generator can not last forever then you will be in the dark with the rest of we I be just just what rub it in because he leave you with the paperwork early you find anything well there be hour of video from the private investigator Lieutenant Paxton at the park get a manicure shop nothing out of the ordinary just as her husband tell we you still think he be cover for her his wife 's dead and do not know why I speak to the p I he tell he exactly what he tell we freeze it back it up there the guy in the hat that guy be in the street too back it up there different day someone else be follow she who do you think it be I do not know there but we get his print go pick them up right off that wall you sure you would not want Tony or Ziva to maybe they want to on it Latent fingerprint from the suspect in the park check Fingerprint card from local leo match the suspect 's description check Lemons do she say lemon I hope not Paper cut but we can not start without the lemon Lemons check though I still do not understand be we make cocktail now I be the one flash back to the fourth grade Mrs Johnson 's science fair Lemons how could I miss that okay people it be showtime so careful I arrange these alphabetically so they would all DiNozzo you be whorl Arches Loops I will take the composite we will use the bin to narrow down the fingerprint card and find a match to the print from the park go you never see this crap on Columbo be it I or do this look like a squirrel I would rather not answer that wait wait I get it I get a match and it only take all night our camera happy tourist 's name be Donavan Graham and he look familiar that be our gunman from the break in small time hood use to sell gun have a reputation as a gun for hire well do it be Graham this must be the other gunman his name be Leo Harper appear they be roommate until they shoot each other Commander Resnik Agent DiNozzo I be impressed so be I do you have some kind of makeover despite my attempt at divert you here you be that be Lieutenant Paxton 's CO at AFE not quite National Security Agency Paxton and I be colleague on a highly classify project AFE be our cover this be much big than you think NSA have agreement with all major biometric security company to program a back door into their iris scanner boss back door be yeah I know what it be McGee Paxton be one of two people whose iris be hard code into the device like a master key who be the other that be cool our eye can open any lock protect by any iris scanner so with AFE as your cover then you can we can travel around the world without suspicion assist other agency with covert activity like the Swiftcast break in we have no idea why Paxton use her ability to break into Swiftcast or what she be try to accomplish but clearly our mission have be compromise her husband maybe but I would not read too much into the fake passport Lieutenant Paxton have it create in case her cover be blow and they need to disappear but if she have go rogue there be no tell what damage she might 've do or be plan to what be you think Paxton use her back door to get into the farm so that be not why the power be knock out why be it that be why we be so concerned Power be down Communication 's hobble tactically DC be in a very vulnerable position right now we notice well we have hope to get to the bottom of this in house yeah I bet but you and your team seem to be make more progress than we be we need to pool our resource find out what the endgame be and fast talk to I Duck do I sense increase urgency in your step I need some answer those I have start with whether these two kill each other they do not Crime scene be stage Postmortem lividity suggest that both body be move after they be kill additionally though both victim be shoot repeatedly in the chest these too be postmortem the actual kill shot be deliver from behind I imagine their service be no long require tie up loose end the question be who well I do not know Jim do you have any idea no sorry and it be rhetorical the never mind well I certainly have no idea who murder these gentleman but I can tell you how this one spend his last hour he be dig copious amount of dirt beneath his fingernail thank Duck Left agent dig at Graham 's place I be sure this be what we be look for we find it under the shed in the backyard open it it be from the server farm at Swiftcast except nothing be report steal and nothing be supposedly leave behind but I think something be the gunman yank this thing out and they put a duplicate in its place that do not make sense think McToma it be a classic cop show switcheroo you take something at the target location and then you swap it with a bug copy Paxton be bug the internet can you do that that would explain why the power be cut the only way to swap the server without it be notice would be when the system be down which mean the blackout be not a prelude to a terrorist attack at least not the kind that you be think of this connect directly to the internet backbone every byte from every government agency that use the internet would be expose which mean our country 's entire electronics infrastructure would be at risk she spend a lot of time overseas Imagine she meet a lot of people who would pay for the intel I be sure she do but I do not think she be the one try to sell it so I finally finish run Lieutenant Paxton 's blood work smell anything Whiskey good it be nonalcoholic but I need that I have not manually distil this much plasma since the mass spec in high school blow a Friedrich condenser that be actually really funny if you have a phd in chemistry Paxton 's blood work she recently ingest massive amount of a vasodilator it be prescribe for high blood pressure that explain the swelling that Ducky find Suicide attempt the drug be nonlethal so that would not be smart I think that she be attempt something way smart tell I what do you see your eyeball blood vessel every person have a specific pattern that be what allow an iris scanner to identify you now Paxton know that Commander Resnick say that they be forbid from take any kind of vasodilator because of the affect it have on the vessel in their eye Paxton try to OD on one I think she be hope to block her ability to unlock an iris scanner she be not part of the break in she be try to stop it I identify her print at Graham 's place but only in the bathroom so I think that she be kidnap and then the kidnapper hold she there and she fight back with the only thing available what be in the kidnapper 's medicine cabinet it do not work but a plus for the MacGyver the label 's peel off but I know who this belong to I find trace of this drug from a blood swab at the Swiftcast shoot out who do you recognize he I could not see the face but I remember those eye I think he shoot I who be he Lieutenant Paxton 's husband Husband a real life Bonnie and Clyde you be sure that be he gibb we have forensic evidence now we have an eyewitness it be enough to make the arrest let I know when you need I to testify nice timing wizard be play tonight not a moment too soon enjoy your sandwich Ladies and gentleman the story you be about to hear be true only the name have be change to protect the innocent it be something you be not you get a buyer yet for all those zero and one getting shoot during the break in to divert suspicion be a nice touch till it bite you in the ass have your blood from the crime scene you should really watch your blood pressure next time you kidnap someone keep they away from your medicine cabinet Book them Dan Nozzo Nice Hawaii five o reference boss what be you look at Red hand they do not come much red kill it who be he Dimitri Verenikin use to work for russian counterintelligence until two year ago and then he decide to freelance we think he learn about your wife while she be on an op in Kiev and he find an asset he could exploit with the National Security Data she give he access to he could name his price to our enemy your wife try to stop he and when she could not she cuff herself during the break in she know we would find her body she know we would dig deep there be a lot I never know about Emma but one thing be for sure she be a fighter Stubborn as hell be there Emma have to do it right she do not have a choice no she

your brother 's gone Come here Lieutenant when you knelt to commune with your maker do you have any idea you would be see he so soon I think not be it true that Muslims pray five time a day to be call Muslim yes it be one of the Five Pillars of Islam I do not do anything five time a day Salaat as it be call certainly take dedication yeah perhaps if humanity focus less on what separate we from one another and more on what we could learn from our difference we would stop kill one another that be what I pray for you be not the only one Duck what do you get well I be wait for the Cleric until I begin the autopsy proper but cursory examination indicate blunt force trauma to the parietal lobe and multiple laceration to his shoulder and neck it be deep yeah and oddly angle the blow be deliver in a downward slicing motion deliver with what ah good question whatever it be be cylindrical we find paint residue and some kind of thread in the wound yeah well we will have to wait until Abby be do with her analysis however there be still much to surmise the Lieutenant have minor scratch on the sol of his foot and due to soap trace on his low appendage it appear that Lieutenant Ellis cleanse his foot again before return to prayer which mean he most likely know his attacker trust them enough to turn his back on they and pay for that misplaced trust with his life these chocolate be delicious

Special Agent Gibbs thank you Most people do not know that the Marine code be not unlike the code of Islam as write in the Holy Koran Honor courage commitment same three philosophy that Islam teach yet ignorance and bigotry remain a problem in the military well ignorance be not unique to any one group Agent David all we can do be try our good to educate and pray for acceptance as a whole Lieutenant Ellis he find acceptance like many of the Islamic Marines I counsel Thomas try but opposition can be overwhelming yet he stick with it determine to become a Muslim because I think he find something that be miss in his life Thomas refer to his awakening as a devout Epiphany that be when he become Tareef Bashir yes and how do the rest of his unit react to his conversion well some be open to it other not so much they find his need to pray multiple time a day inopportune and dangerous be any one Marine more vocal about it than any other Thomas do ask I to personally speak to a First

read I can send the link to your email or text the link to your phone or I can just print it out on paper and give it to you in your hand it be a revolutionary concept McGee where be we go boss West Virginia the Appalachians get a dead Navy pilot pack your hiking boot Breathtaking yeah it be for Lieutenant Commander Brad Hondo Sayers U S Navy grant extend leave from Pax a week ago Fighter jock he be a test pilot can not believe I be get a signal out here Rangers flip he over to identify he who be go to identify they when Ducky get through with they you be not suppose to touch the body what do you think McGee this guy eject out of a plane or what Carbon fiber helmet 's design for skydive but the suit be flame retardant it only do half the job other half of he 's crispy mcdlt I do not get that one that be not a McNickname the McDonald 's mcdlt hot side hot cold side cold that be very tasteful Forest Rangers say this area have be off limit to hiker since it burn a month ago Winter fire season now forest fire do not kill he some fire do a high temperature explosion blow his arm right off animal could have pull that off you be awfully close to that body Timothy I be just try to get a look at what be on his back look with your eye McGee not your hand you have a long ride come up here Palmer he would not let I drive I beg and beg what be it that make you so anxious Flight suit Helmet dead man be a pilot and this do not look like a parachute on his back you think he fall from the sky without a parachute well there should be a lot more metal piece around here okay look around get an arm over here the flesh kind or the metal kind Metal get a nozzle I get another body do not move it here I come Bag it up Palmer Mother lode Fuel tank yes that be a fuel tank interesting read Jethro McGee seem to have an instinct for this one perhaps baby bird be ready to leave the nest well boss we be a few finger short of a hand but we get some good stuff here Guy pull a scarecrow Pieces of he everywhere here you go Ducky hey look at you Palmer you bag yourself a fly monkey it be a squirrel Fuel tank Control arm Joystick so McGee do you know what kill Lieutenant Commander Sayers yeah I think I do you think or you know I know one thing his jet pack explode jet pack yeah it be go to be a weird one Lieutenant Commander Brad Sayers Naval Academy grad primary aviation training at Pensacola Advanced at lemoore Top Gun at Fallon Unmarried no kid call sign Hondo à la John Wayne I think he be the Duke he be he be always will be Sayers be part of a squadron of test pilot at Patuxent River Air Base the first to fly experimental plane military experiment with jet pack I would not well yeah they do but after year of test various design ultimately they decide helicopter be more practical for earth atmosphere flight although NASA 's compress gas power Manned Maneuvering Unit evolve from Bell Systems ' rocket belt technology Rocket belt be the original terminology rather than the more colloquial jet pack McGee 's very passionate about the subject we spend a lot of time here just the three of we I be tell he about the bonus feature on the Thunderball DVD which be pretty interesting and he say Tony bonus feature be not science and so he he school you Yep where be he now he be down with Abby we can not tear he away from the evidence well I will see you both there when you get back from Pax River the August 1928 issue of Amazing Stories first stir the national imagination it feature the Skylark of Space on the cover and then you get Buck Rogers what be really amazing be how much more fascinating jet pack trivia get the 11th time you 've hear it do you know that the original rocket belt be propel by a chemical reaction and not traditional jet fuel I know you show I your PowerPoint presentation like five year ago but I 've update it to include recent breakthrough in single man flight Good yeah the swiss pilot and engineer Yves Rossy and his four engine glider and the Kiwis everyone think that they be go to be the one to crack the commercially viable prototype with the Martin what do you get it be residue from the flame suit Hydrogen peroxide that make sense and kerosene Kerosene Strange to use those two in combination do not sound like any prototype I 've study maybe they get what do you get now that be the elevator I think you would want to see that I can not believe the mexican authority drop the charge against Colonel Bell Colonel Bell Wonder if there be relationship to Bell Labs Bell Labs inventor of the rocket belt Rocket belt be an amazing model it be a catalyst that decompose hydrogen peroxide into pressurized steam and oxygen you get significant thrust from lightweight rocket for about 30 sec I get it McGee you know a lot about jet pack Boss when I be a kid station in Alameda my parent take I to the opening ceremony of the ' 84 Olympics in Los Angeles right and the guy fly over the crowd Bill Suitor Flew right over my head I swear all right I believe you you get the lead on this one I know it I mean Hondo'd never go a week without get up in the air Off base against Navy regulation your man be subject to the same restriction as the average pilot I do not know exactly what an average pilot be Agent David None of they be naval aviator these boy they operate under extreme stress some of they find relief in take job outside the squadron we allow that as long as it do not interfere with combat readiness Hondo man he be a rare breed he would drink six or seven cup a coffee and he would strap himself to anything that go fast who be he close to Commander Peter Sheridan Hey Banshee Sir I will catch up with you yes sir Banshee we get some bad news Hondo yes sorry Commander he die in some sort of explosion or crash what do he crash you assume he be at the stick Hondo never take a backseat to anyone Control freak I think it would be more accurate to say he be careful he be get to be with these machine and their power and speed slight movement have major consequence we try not to think about it too hard but it happen so what do he crash believe it be some sort of jet pack Crap Victor Tillman that be who you want to talk to come to I first Aerospace engineer Company 's call Tillman Air Banshee go up the ladder for a waiver Navy reject it do not want to support his research Tillman must 've go to Hondo next and convince he it be worth ignore regulation in order to have the chance to fly something like that thank you be there anything leave of he if you be sure I be ready Doctor Mr Palmer the time have come for you to fly solo the body be all yours Dr Mallard I be suddenly overcome with the desire to share a story of only a peripherally relevant nature it be a hazard of the profession so you would advise I refrain under the get to learn to walk before you run column not at all as long as it do not impede your focus think of it as spread your wing though bear in mind the fate of young Icarus who disregard the warning of his father Daedalus and fly too high and the wax that hold his feather on be melt by the sun and he fall to his death Fall be the cause of death Jethro for once you have fail to pick up the thread of our conversation I be not speak of our dear depart Lieutenant Commander Sayers Fall be not the cause of death yet to be determine what be you guy just talk about Mr Palmer be about to regale I with a tale that be only tangentially connect to his first solo autopsy of a squirrel work through your fear Mr Palmer this remind I of my junior year abroad I be stay with a family outside of Lyon who speak only French and my French be okay at well and whatever you might think of the people of France these squirrel be extraordinarily friendly so I have to explain to they my fear of squirrel you see in D C there be brown squirrel and there be black squirrel and at the time black squirrel carry rabie so my mother use to bait trap with peanut butter capture the squirrel and release they on the other side of the river so they would not bite any of the kid but I confuse the word écureuil which mean squirrel with the much less accurate requin which mean shark how they must have picture your strange homeland with your shark hunt mother what be the point of the squirrel we believe his cause of death may be relate to Sayers in desperate situation when the food supply be scarce squirrel will eat almost anything include human flesh Fire eliminate all the other option and we have to inventory Rocket J 's stomach to confirm its content but initial dental impression suggest that his last meal be Sayers ' soft tissue yes hypovolemic shock massive internal bleeding this squirrel be likely poison secondary poisoning this squirrel die from eat Sayers ' toxic organ sayer be poison then we can not yet say if it contribute to his fall to Earth but somebody be try to kill he since the dawn of time man have dream of flight be it gravity or nature or merely the limitation of our imagination that have keep we ground this be a public demonstration in 1961 functional technology nearly half a century ago measure that against progress in other arena internal combustion engine radio television the internet in 50 year they go from impossible to practical to ubiquitous meanwhile they keep the jet pack relegate to the world of science fiction they the jet pack conspiracy boss if you look at it it be really the only logical explanation the primary obstacle to a commercially viable model be weight flight time distance and simple control do we miss the part about the motorcycle parking space imagine a jet pack landing and refueling area at your office apparently not the average daily commute be 16 mile one way but the variance in travel time be huge because of roadway congestion slow driver bad driver what be so hard fast as possible when something get in your way you turn you be quote Better Off Dead I tell you to watch that thirty mile radius Simple enough that you do not need to be a helicopter pilot to fly it patent that and we be all live like the Jetsons or die like burn out bottle rocket there be a thin margin for error yes sayer have rat poison in his system Abby confirm it he be impair while he be fly in Commander Cody 's brave new world we be go to be pull people out of the sky for Fuis F U be so the crash do not kill he well it do not help what have you guy find uh sayer be test fly on the side for a Victor Tillman Tillman Air Put out a press release a couple month ago say they be get close to an unveil sayer ' death in one of those jet pack would not be good for business smack of a cover up all right go to need to get a look at Tillman 's financial I be go to stay here you two go out and talk to he so McGee be not come to the jet pack factory well you get your homework do and then you can go out and play with the neighbor kid good boy the price of be in charge it be get to be a punishment some kind of motivational technique McGee stay behind I do not get it it be like the carrot you know the carrot in front of the horse israeli driver Ed must really be something he be still there who be I get a tail I can not believe he bite it but I can you know it be like those guy who raise bear and then you find out they get eat by one and you say oh yes of course but Hondo Fireball be exactly how he would 've want it oh man you know it just do not make any sense why be that you say you find a pack where do he get the pack that be why we be here Vic right right we be go this way she be fine this be a secure area the card be in my pocket I be not touch you I get it after you thank you smile Safety be my primary concern I try to stay away from the more combustible fuel source make it a challenge to manufacture sufficient vertical thrust while keep it compact yeah how be that come we 've maintain level flight at an altitude of seven to ten meter for up to nine minute as you can see control be extremely sophisticated these be my baby Bravo Juliet and Oscar my bologna have a first name sound like you be miss some letter not every model make it to the final testing phase some of they never even get off the ground see a few similarity to our model here Vic each piece be extensively log brand patent and keep under lock and key believe I no one be take anything from I again excuse I sound like you cut yourself off before you could say again who steal from you Vic this be your area of expertise McGee I be down here try to put together a jet pack jigsaw puzzle I do not know what it be look like you know that be what I would rather be do but I get to go right now what McGee Tillman 's financial not thrill you not at all boss as an individual the guy be get 47 to his name but he have corporation inside of corporation hide cash since his divorce from Vanessa Tillman that the ex wife and former chief financial officer they split he fire she turn into a messy fight over everything from the house to the company 's proprietary technology where be his money I cross reference payment from his corporate account against the time Sayers be not at Pax Tillman be pay Sayers five figure a pop he be up to his elbow in it he be not the only one sayer be not just collect check from Uncle Sam and Victor Tillman for some reason Vanessa Tillman have he on the payroll as well come on I do not know what you think happen here talk to he we think your test pilot be dead and we think that you have motive to kill he I like Sayers he be a great guy what motive would I have have to kill he it be not even my pack he be be pay by your ex wife that son of a bitch so you do not know no I do not know of course I do not know if I have know I would have I would have fire he she be my top competitor locally the Kiwis get a big jump on I and the Swiss oh come on a collapsible wing it be great for distance but without hover capability it will always be for professional this be a patent for a mixed fuel propulsion system it be a hybrid of H²O² and kerosene lab test show that mixture be find on Sayers ' body have your name on it be it yours yes no can not have it both way Vanessa get it in the divorce nice candid you get a plate of course Lanny Carothers Maryland p I license somebody hire a investigator to follow we maybe it be not we maybe it be you maybe it be you hello I believe you be hold my client I would be happy to hold anything you need Charming Mr DiNozzo please take I to see Victor Tillman M Allison Hart attorney for Victor Tillman this look cozy have you read my client his right he have not be charge with a crime then release he charge he or release he what be the confusion be you plan to interrogate he without an attorney present until he incriminate himself in some way that you find beneficial for your investigation Man what a car wreck he do not ask for a lawyer and you do not offer Chick 's mow McGee down he do not even know it she seem to be enjoy it you 've already violate my client 's right to his privacy his financial record be access today without proper authorization and I have reason to believe that you be the source maybe you be the one who should be charge with a crime let us go Tillman Miss Hart your client hide behind a lawyer it make I wonder why I can see your mind be spin Mr Gibbs but once the hamster gain some traction on the wheel and you figure out the question you want to ask you feel free to contact I directly not my client be you ever a redhead 'cause it feel like I know you no but I know you I know you take any shortcut to a conviction really do not sound like I you look the other way when your team hack privileged information when they break into a police impound lot and steal evidence when they start a bar fight just out of curiosity do you have any respect at all for the law you and your client be free to go Miss Hart I know what kind of name be Mallison it be M Allison Hart I think they be miss some punctuation so a guy die in a jet pack explosion and she will not let we talk to the guy that manufacture jet pack that be just mean we do not know that he die in the explosion he be poison I find that but you do not determine whether he be poison to death or just to some level of discomfort well the thing about poison be that the human body do not want it so when it be ingest it do its good to expel it see there be a high level of warfarin in Sayers ' system but his organ be so destroy it be impossible to tell the cause of death you do not see the flaw in this logic Palmer you mean the part about how he strap himself to a jet pack and fly around and blow up and do all of that while already be dead yeah I do not know it be a neat trick though Ooh what Ooh this we know the fuel source Combination of hydrogen peroxide and kerosene definitely combustible but what be the source of ignition what cause a catalytic reaction you mix they together the wrong way Bingo redirect the flow of kerosene from the exit port of the motor back into the H²O² tank and Kaboom all you would need be a movable valve and this rocket belt would self destruct so how do this valve get reverse this be not a valve Palmer right it be our smoking gun and whoever make it be our killer I be just getting settle in Victor drag his foot as long as possible through the divorce you split everything equally we split there be nothing equal about it we share a home an office ambition whenever two people try to extricate their life from each other friction be inevitable be that true boss these be Victor 's design Victor 's a genius sure Great do you have any idea how annoying it can be to spend all your time with a quote brilliant man what be that like he could never listen to an idea that be not his so stubborn I do know what that be like he ever get violent with you no you ever get violent with he it be not like that I want to experiment with fuel Victor be myopic Tunnel vision on his prototype just so we be clear your marriage fall apart because of jet pack because of communication we could no long communicate you hire Sayers to test your version yes and I know what that look like but the last test flight be over a month ago I can show you the record if I could find they he also keep you inform on what Victor be up to since you could no long communicate Sayers have experience he be skilled these be complicated machine whatever the design they all look the same there be a myriad of difference believe I this one use the same fuel source that kill Sayers I do not give he the pack if that be what you be imply be that what you be imply Mr Gibbs do not say another word Ms Tillman you be entitle to legal counsel she be your client too if she wish to be and I would advise she at this time to refrain from speak to you you also represent her ex husband that be not a conflict of interest my interest be justice Mr Gibbs Mine too then we should get along just fine if you have any other inquiry for either of my client feel free to contact I no thank I already get one Lone samurai play both side against the middle it be like Yojimbo or a fistful of Dollars which be the western remake of Yojimbo so it be really like Yojimbo Sayers be test fly for both camp and the pack that kill he be make of piece of both of their design oh yeah you be right why do you sound surprised you say the same I be talk about the lawyer not the pilot she must have represent the Tillmans as a couple that be not the connection here figure it out I want to know the endgame which one the lawyer or the pilot both of they I be confuse Time of death Duck I be try to determine the sequence of event that end Sayers ' life there be so many thread leave to disentangle you get no time of death you have not even give I a definitive cause of death it be a frustrating case that lawyer woman Ducky she be try to keep I from talk to anybody that matter if I do not know well I would say she be get to you she act like she hate I but she talk like she like I ever be married to her yeah that would explain it would not it come on tell I you get something well sayer ' helmet shield his face from the burst of the explosion and the subsequent attention his corpse draw from the native wildlife however I find acidic erosion inside his throat and inside his nasal cavity it appear to be stomach acid he vomit Violently profusely however Abby find no corresponding acid on the inside of his face shield what do that mean somebody clean he up and then put the helmet back on he likely I strongly doubt that he be conscious when he be strapped into the harness he be well it be possible he be he be what fly dead well explain that it be a remote control receiver yes it be what be the range almost a kilometer I do not speak Canadian how far be that sayer ' pack could be remotely operate or remotely detonate we do not see anything like this in either of the Tillman design it have to be one of they do it maybe we be look for a completely different fabricator here maybe it be neither of the Tillmans ' I want the Tillmans and that lawyer there okay right away let us find out we recover this rf receiver from the wreckage I want to know which one of you this belong to an rf receiver what a stupid idea oh because you do not think of it oh this be your dumb idea no it be not mine but it be not dumb Mr Tillman Ms Tillman please we be go to need to see your inventory list and blueprint so that we can confirm that neither of you manufacture it I will consider your request it be not a request well look at that a court order be that so hard wait a minute do he still think one of we murder Sayers he be work both of you well you insist that you do not provide he with the equipment he must 've steal it well then he be very good at it because that be news to I you know he be steal from your husband you clearly your intention here be to stir up some animosity in the hope that an emotional outburst will reveal some insight into your investigation or have you uncover some fact that need corroboration I would hate to think that you bring we in here under false pretense Time of death be 13 day ago I be in the Bahamas that be your idea of a traditional winter vacation no it be Steve Bennett 's idea where be you New Hampshire with that slut Laura Truftin at least she like sex I like sex I just do not like sex with you enough I assume that be all that be all Fantastic Jerk after you well one of they end up dead we will not have far to look would it be impossible for you to apologize for implicate they in Sayers ' death yeah they be off the hook I expect we 've see the last of each other as far as this case go I do not know I might have to keep my eye on you why it do not seem like you have a clue what you be do I think he be about to have a thought I think blood be about to come out of his eyeball no this be go to be impressive all right this be a remote control jet pack that be what we be look at here okay that be not very impressive excuse I it be very impressive do you understand the countless tiny adjustment have to be make manually in order to maintain level flight it be an art fly a jet pack that be why both the Tillmans hire an expert pilot but wait let he go he be build up to something see without a pilot you would need a modified fly by wire system with computer assist stabilization but to build that you would have to be an expert engineer so be we look for a pilot or be we look for an engineer there be a lightbulb we be look for both Palmer hand I those blueprint yeah that be right boss it be everything we find on her get it it be his what be the pack it do not belong to either of the Tillmans it belong to Sayers he build his own jet pack the pack use fighter jet engineering that be the miss piece Sayers rip off the technology from both of the Tillmans and he borrow from the Navy as well to build his own version which use the good of all three but it crash so it be not very good that be the intention the intention be to crash to dispose of the body where it would not be discover it be pretty far off the beat path any decent pilot could 've fly it how about a great pilot Sheridan want the job with Tillman he petition the Navy for it but Sayers take that then pick up a second one Sheridan lose out twice probably do not respond well to that go to pull the squadron 's psych profile let us double check their paperwork scan their file for engineering background I need to talk to Gibbs where be Gibbs right here Elf Lord you be follow I you have my people follow so you have to even the score no I do my own legwork so what have you find a patent filing five year ago you bill Victor Tillman 400 an hour my rate have go up since then I bet but on this case you waive your fee you take they both pro bono in my experience the money be a by product of do the right thing and do it quite well you know what you be not look for a big payday at all no you be look for I Egocentric you be look to pick a fight I do not pick this fight but now that I meet you I be glad to be in it I just can not believe it Agent gibb there be money to be make Sheridan want the job and Sayers take it from he there be another job to be have as well sayer get that one too I know Banshee be competitive but I never imagine it would turn violent might not yeah sayer be kill with poison likely slip into his food or drink it be really not all that violent more common with female killer actually really yeah really we get a court order to search the base for evidence start with Sheridan 's locker you sure Commander a word I get a hop in ten you be not go to make that you be proficient with fly by wire technology ' course I be be this about Hondo you know what happen to he he be steal tech secret from the Tillmans and the Navy use piece of all three to build his own prototype complete with fly by wire could be control with a remote like this one he build this that be impossible Hondo he be a great flyboy but well than you in some way but that be all he be he could not build a soapbox derby racer right no engineering background that be why he need a partner that be who kill he you be say I be his competition now you be say I be his partner if the guy partner up with sayer to build a prototype he would not have destroy the only one there be another one somewhere here he come we just need it to look like you be our man Banshee he be go for it where be he he be inside this be the only way out this be unbelievable McGee you get he I be scan frequency all right I be lock on get he bring he back Boss here he come it work this be sweet he be like a hummingbird I want to fly he Tony stop it you be go to break it get he down I be bring he down Boss he be come Hands in the air let us go Rocket Man hey where be McGee Hey boss he be rest his fried circuit I do not know what the big deal be just a little rocket science yeah it be not like it be brain surgery I want to see more picture of her yeah I too all right I get your fascination boss she be a spellbinder you could get lose in those icy blue eye you know what be a little weird though how she seem to know I before we meet not just I either you Us that one right there be that she and Colonel Bell Bell send she how do you know her hand

that a little bit of rain in your sunny worldview Mary Poppins reveal the true nature of the world be not go to change who I be Agent DiNozzo maybe it be 'cause I be in love but I do not think people be bad at heart U S Attorney 's Office be drag their foot on a Holly Snow deal why high up do not like be get into bed with someone who keep a black book might be open up a can of worm let us talk about murder we will get it she be ask for the world and they will get it it take time out of time that flight land I want to know who we be look for McGee go well assume that our new hit man have the same flight information our dead hit man have be run background on every passenger on the plane and no red flag but there be one problem Air Marshal Art Neeley he be not originally assign to the flight request an early departure from Paris TSA deny the request so he switch duty assignment with someone else really want to be on this particular flight four day ago where be he accord to his flight schedule Air Marshal Neeley be in DC when Sergeant Parsons be murder get Ziva on the phone if Neeley be involve we do not want to spook the only other guy on that plane that be get a gun I think you get the wrong bag you have a good eye Ziva I find your book thank you still study american history I just finish the Twilight Saga I 've be suggest it to her it be very romantic excuse I I just finish book four if you want to borrow it Team Edward everything okay not really she pick his pocket one of the good guy might not be Honey call Abby ask she to run Neeley 's incoming and outgoing call on it bossy what you guy say you do not get along but you make a great team it be not always so smooth believe I she be usually much snarki I think Paris change her boss I just get a call from Navy Yard security there be be an incident at Beringer Marine what happen Nora 's fiancé Daniel attack Ray Beringer I lose my temper you take some candy cane cheap shot at our prime suspect it be not smart I be sorry after a staff meeting Beringer pull I aside and make a crack about Nora about her take vacation time he be taunt I Agent Gibbs maybe it prove that he know about Nora right this should help you he be the one who hire someone to kill she you need to go home and let we do our job it be just I I feel helpless Kid 's lucky I do not kick his ass to the curb Base security already handle the situation why be NCIS here Nora Williams what about she you tell I I know she be a great employee and that she be sleep with that naive jerk who just clock I like I tell security it be just a joke I like joke Nora work for I at our Paris office I hear she be take some vacation time now accountant be suppose to be good with figure right so I ask Daniel if he be go to get a chance to use hers while she be in town I do not mean anything by it unless I be miss something here the kid 's still angry Nora take the transfer to Paris take it out on I be we do I get a company to run what do Abby find no connection between our Air Marshal and our dead marine I still do not trust he we should at least take his weapon if we be wrong we can apologize later where be our federal flyboy last time I see he he be head for the restroom he have be in there for a while maybe it be that vacuum pack sushi for dinner I be a little growly myself remain in your seat Arty you get suck in I be go to pick the lock there be no need his gun be miss be this the queue out of order someone make quite a mess in there well technically fly still be the safe way to travel tell that to he turn out Neeley be divorce with a 12 year old daughter request the early flight from Paris to get home in time to see his daughter 's school play well we 've get nothing to tie Neeley to the first dead hit man so why risk murder an Air Marshal mid flight well he could have stumble onto something get too close to our killer or they just want his gun either way confirm our killer be on that plane the close airport now be Dulles they land in two hour hear you speak to Ray Beringer Word travel Beringer make a call to SECNAV he have the impression that NCIS be investigate he you have to shake that tree need something to drop Leon then you will be pleased to know that Holly Snow 's plea deal come through she be on her way back in Ladies and gentleman if I could have your attention please due to a mechanical issue the forward lavatory be out of order we ask that you please use one of the other facility on board he be dead someone kill he this be really happen be not it he be on the plane so be we how do it happen it be not important I would like to know a knitting needle they take it from a sleep passenger and stab the Air Marshal in the neck you be so direct so honest so different from he Tony and I have different approach yet complementary you sure you two never Positive definitely no why do you keep on ask about Tony and I you be like I and Daniel a good fit besides Paris be a romantic city and you guy share a room so I I take the couch otherwise Tony would have whine the entire flight about his his back talk about a nightmare at 20 000 foot there be something on the wing some thing Classic Shatner do the Twilight Zone there Ducky I be well aware of that Anthony well thank goodness for this in flight Wi Fi do this qualify we for mile high club certainly not I be surprised to hear that you be not already a member I never say I be not perhaps if you angle I over and down a bit I could get a well view of his neck all right Roger dodger you get that the use of the knitting needle be both crude and effective he be aim for the space between the cervical vertebrae in an endeavor no doubt to sever the spinal cord Death would have be quick and silent he could have unlock the door jabbed in the needle and disappear with a minimum of fuss if only we have high resolution I could confirm that hypothesis all right hold on one second Ducky I 've get an idea here we go you know it look like there be a partial print on that needle my memory card 's full that mean I have to delete some of my photo from Paris if you have any of that pyramid outside the Louvre delete they that glass monstrosity be an offense to good taste it be like Sophie 's Choice I can not choose doubt our hit man think we could process a mid flight crime scene need the advantage abs sorry it be kitty litter that stuff get everywhere I have not have time to clean up yet see what do you get I have a bloody partial print from the knitting needle can you use it well it be not your typical method of process a print I have the add work of enhance the photo and then translate the image into a format that AFIS can understand before I can even begin to search for a hit yeah I will be right up Holly Snow can I go no Print the account client use to send you the money let us have it w what no foreplay no seduction my deal come through then just need a judge 's signature why do not you come back when you have it Deal 's do United States Attorney approve you like it rough do not you there be a time and a place for everything Holly I think so I be usually pretty good at read

not for this guy Boss the car be register to a Lance Corporal Roman Vega station at Quantico just back from his second tour in Iraq the chase start at Olive and 29th when Vega run a stop sign about a half mile later the car hit a pothole and kaboom Acetone hydroxide bless you it be an explosive Tony it be in the trunk it have a very distinctive odor highly volatile give the lack of any discernible trigger and timing of detonation the explosion be likely an accident why would a Marine be drive around with explosive in his trunk we find the torso yes it be rest in peace around the corner there by that dumpster it match Corporal Vega 's general build but the burn be extensive we will probably need dna for a positive identification in the meantime he be ready for his close up we be still miss

you guy okay you tell we yeah you be okay they only find minute trace of radiation on the car you guy could even get your clothe back nice work McPanic what be the source of the radiation good news be that it be not from the explosion but the vehicle it have be use to transport something call cobalt 60 it be a byproduct of nuclear reactor it be use for like industrial mining and X ray machine dirty bomb and why be Lance Corporal Vega transport radioactive material if it can be use to make a dirty bomb the more pressing question be where be it now all the information regard international travel and nobody talk to the press and do not talk to the press this just in I think it be a little too late for that that a radiological dispersal device commonly know as dirty bomb loose in DC we do not even know there be a dirty bomb Nope but it be good for rating Corporal Vega Gibbs be go to want a full briefing when he gets do talk to Vance what do we get well we do a preliminary workup while you be shower for the third time Lance Corporal Roman Vega bear in Lima Peru 1981 he and his young brother Alfonso go to live with their aunt in Maryland after their parent be kill cell record show that

glad to finally meet you Gunny been follow you for some time yeah really what on my blog not exactly but I do my own research I know we would be meet up eventually how be that Lance Corporal Roman Vega Mr Kane run a private intelligence firm they do work for the Pentagon between Iraq and Afghanistan our country 's own intel service be stretch thin so we outsource firm like Mr Kane 's for country that we be not at war with like Peru good guess we handle it exclusively currently we be track a group out of Lima call Libertad Nueva mean New liberty they claim to be a grassroots organization form to protest US anti drug policy in Peru which they say have cause civilian casualty it be a lie they be not freedom fighter they be drug dealer who just want the US out of their hair we think they be plan an attack hope to weaken our resolve what do you get on Vega well he be be see with suspect LN member in Lima and for a man with no family in Peru he travel there quite a bit that be it that and the fact that his car glow in the dark I do not deny our intelligence link Vega to these terrorist be slim we be victim of budget cut like everyone else but we be sure there be a cell here and Vega be our only link to they thank you we will take it from here thank you sir I have to testify before the Senate an upcoming defense contractor bill Reason we do not have money for real intelligence be the boy on the Hill love to spend money on toy that we do not really need yeah Gibbs Vega just check his e mail Belmont hotel I will be right down get a lead on Roman 's brother he just log on to his e mail account Belmont hotel Hotel manager say Vega come into the lobby two hour ago use the guest computer then check into room 102 People have be come and go ever since what

any I D that will not be necessary put your weapon down hello Mr Gibbs you know each other he be my client your client that be right since when Alfonso do not answer that this be go to get ugly I hope so go on get out of here will you turn that thing off give we a minute do not worry it will be okay come on have you see the news lately I have we do not have time for this for what the rule of law I do not have a problem with the law Roman Vega be a new client of mine he contact I a few week ago about sorry attorney client privilege after Mr Vega be kill his brother call I he be scared he want to talk do not bother ask I about what as a precaution I tell he to meet I here and I arrange for private security Colonel Bell 's man Colonel Bell owe I a favor after I rescue he from that mexican hellhole you send he to not I the rule of law which also say I have the right to talk to Alfonso yes it do and you be more than welcome as long as I be in the room do I miss it Nope just start where be Ziva bring the popcorn Mr Gibbs be try to make you nervous do not let he Special Agent excuse I Special Agent Gibbs and I be not try to make you nervous I just need answer and I think you want answer too consider your brother be dead now he be try to piss you off just ask the question you talk to your brother right before the explosion yeah what do he say he tell I to run why do not answer that do he tell you why he be transport radioactive material do not answer that do you know that he be a member of Libertad Nueva look like you do not nicely do Ziva well hurry or she be go to miss it would you like to confer with your client because I think he know something you do not know Roman do not do anything wrong we need a moment alone yes he be fishing and that be dangerous Mr Gibbs have put plenty of guilty man behind bar but he be also put some innocent one away what be Libertad Nueva they be drug dealer terrorist Roman would never be involve in but he be involve with something do not answer that I want answer too do not know what he be mess up in but whatever it be have he really freak out he would not give I any detail but he want you to do something I work for a cell phone company he ask I to back trace some call to a warehouse in Virginia he would not tell I why he just tell I not to trust anybody I hope I be not make a mistake trust you think he be tell the truth he be tell a story not sure whose the popcorn I burn the first batch but DiNozzo take Ziva and check out that warehouse take Ziva check out the warehouse well I be sure you be feel pretty satisfied I be go to go get a haircut I be feel pretty satisfied good then you can release my client I can you have no right to hold he you have not charge he with anything Terrorism do not need to speak like a third world dictator I do not make the rule he be tell the truth he be well off here how noble of you fine then if he be stay I be stay Fine just past the door to the vend machine Gun battle Hand to hand Knife fight right something about our friendly neighborhood counselor make you think she might be good with a blade well she be tenacious and training be important in a knife fight but not as important as spirit what be that it be a Geiger counter can not be too careful what do you think Corporal Vega be do at an empty warehouse I do not know why do not you pick the lock and find out we do not have a warrant this building be foreclose which mean it be own by the bank and since the people own the bank I think technically we own the building Lock pick I do not think our friendly neighborhood counselor would approve let she spend a night work a homicide tell ya thing be not so black and white when the wall be all splatter with red be they or when your way of life be threaten exactly wait a second be you mock I no Tony I be not mock you it be just that when I be hold hostage in Somalia Saleem use similar justification for his action Saleem Caf Pow Swilling sociopath be a terrorist Ziva I be sure he would say he be just protect his way of life you be not seriously defend he be you no Tony his action be indefensible regardless of his reason and that be my point this country hold itself to a high standard it be a nation of law which be to be follow not only when it be convenient or easy I have see firsthand what happen when convenience win out you never talk about it what be there to talk about come on Ziva what Saleem do be bad enough become like he would be bad the food be fresh whoever be here leave in a hurry they have a little bonfire before they split acetone hydroxide lot of wire a couple of timer they be build a bomb it be definitely the dirty kind I find trace of cobalt 60 on all of the evidence that Tony and Ziva bring in be it safe yeah totally this be just way too cool to take off I like the sound it make when I move so do Tony and Ziva get any print hundred but judge by the decomposition of skin oil I be think that they belong to the building 's old occupant I be run they now any idea how big a bomb could be out it look like they mix enough acetone hydroxide to blow up Roman Vega 's car like five time over so most of it be still out there Tony and Ziva also find an old laptop it be burn to a crisp but I still think I can get something off the hard drive all right let I know I 've get to report back to Gibbs wait wait wait what I can not believe this I have my whole presentation time out perfectly so when I say I can still pull something off the hard drive my decryption algorithm be suppose to well late than never okay so there be only two thing on the laptop an encrypt video file and solitaire I guess terrorist get bore too here be the file Hola Mis hermano get the package in position wait for my order to detonate I repeat do not detonate until you hear from I Buena suerte I be guess by package he mean bomb look at the bright side if there be a bomb out there with Corporal Vega dead we 've buy some time I be afraid not as much as you might think here I need to talk to Gibbs the cause of death be as we expect multiple trauma cause by the sorry Agent DiNozzo actually invite I to it be not important will not happen again yes well Dismemberment be the cause of death I find a wound that predate the blast it be a cigarette light yeah it be the one from the car and the angle suggest that it be not self inflict he be not in the car alone then well whoever be there with he apparently get out of the car at some point during the police chase but that be not why I call you down here Mr Palmer I just send some dna up to Abby for positive identification but before that we make a dental impression of the most perfect set of tooth I 've ever see not a single cavity no rotation have all of his wisdom tooth something Corporal Vega do not have this be not Vega yeah the Corporal be alive to give whatever order he wish whenever he wish this be not Corporal Vega then who be it his name 's John Cook Former Sergeant Served briefly in the second Gulf War before be dishonorably discharge for loot Ducky finally find intact dna Victim or involve involve Abby lift his print off of one of the bomb timer Tony and Ziva find in the warehouse so Cook make the bomb and Vega give the when and where so when and where we be work on it unfortunately Cook be our good link to Vega we 've be do deep background go through credit card statement so far nothing unusual show up back it up Dr Mallard 's report say Cook have perfect tooth right that be right these right here then why be he go to a new dentist every two day that do qualify as unusual I be go to go find out I have to brief the Joint Chiefs you have any idea how Vega plan to relay the detonation order take your choice then we prepare for the bad I 've be tell that the risk of radiation exposure from a dirty bomb be fairly negligible Most of the injury will be from the explosion itself but the real threat to the city be panic that be why they call the dirty bomb weapon of mass disruption when people get scared it get deadly well they be scared Leon I 've be have second thought about my testimony against the defense contractor bill seem like overkill yesterday oh yes I remember he a walk in show up want his tooth clean then he leave do you notice anything unusual only that he have about the most perfect tooth I would ever see we hear from the last two dentist we visit yeah well work on he be almost orgasmic do not really need to hear that his retromolar pad be shape just like a renaissance bosom we be go to go thank you you think he have something to do with the robbery Robbery be not that why you be here Couple day later someone break in thief clean out all our x ray machine how many exactly well in the entire practice 15 and these be not those cheap tube machine these be top of the line cobalt base unit excuse I Dr Shore you be need in room 1 yes I be on my way thank you I have a patient wait be that all no that be all for now thank thank you well that explain the credit card charge Cook be case dentist ' office look for radioactive material at the dentist it be the dirty secret about dirty bomb source be everywhere Oil platform medical equipment there be too many to keep track of be the cobalt of 15 machine enough to make a dirty bomb once the material 's powderize it be enough to make five five Fantastic you tell Gibbs okay well get back here there ' computery stuff for you to do tell Gibbs about what still here how nice I tell you I be not leave until my client be release we could always have security escort you out I be just play with word put they together in random order now that be Gibbs ' desk where be Mr Gibbs he have not leave mtac all day I hope it be not because of I it be probably more to do with the impending terrorist attack your client be plan allegedly plan and I be as surprised as you be that he be still alive tell I something who cut Mr Gibbs ' hair excuse I I think you can tell a lot about a man by who cut his hair who cut your hair my sister she have for year I imagine you spend more on your hair than it would cost to feed a third world family for a year how much do that cost and Mr Gibbs well I see he get his hair cut at the same mom and pop shop he be be go to for year get out of my chair you talk to McGee Five what be the plan I would be happy to leave as soon as you release my client like I say before he be well off here be that how you justify deny he his right of habeas corpus be that what I be do you know what I can justify file suit against NCIS and you personally for violate over ten federal and State constitutional protection call security yeah let he go let he go you hear he release my client release the client I have a visual on the target he be be cautious this be the third place he stop after his lawyer drop he off at home but the first time he have send his taxi away why do I get a funny feeling Gibbs plan on use this guy as bait from the beginning because he be Gibbs I sure hope I be not around when Miss Hart find out he use her client as bait or maybe I do this be all assume the brother have a prearrange meeting place he be here yes we should think positive no I mean he be here right in front of I come out the door all right let us take he I screw up it be my fault all right NCIS Freeze he say freeze you be make a mistake really Good I know someplace quaint we can talk I tell your agent I want to talk to my lawyer she be on her way so you can not ask I any question that be right you know you get the wrong guy I be not a terrorist Hola Mis Hermanos get the package in position wait for my order to detonate I can explain that I can not wait all right screw the lawyer I what be that an attorney waiver what be the matter with you Marine I be be set up by who I do not know his name he say he work for the Department of Defense say they need native spanish speaker to perform in a top secret training video that he that be he well he do not work for the DOD he have all the credential he take I to this building it be set up to look like a terrorist hideout I record all kind of message for the video BioTerror dirty bomb attack hell I even do a militia insurrection it be all fake not all it be suppose to be it be not a few day later I notice I be follow so I get suspicious and I start ask around about the training program no one have hear about it I know I be in trouble and you go hire a lawyer instead of go to your superior look I do not know who to trust I read an article about this woman hear that she help people like I we play phone tag for a while and before we could talk my recruiter show up and he stick a gun in my back and he say drive Luckily I see a cop I blow a stop sign to get attention I bail in an alley during the chase my recruiter have no choice but to keep on go I call my brother and then I hear the explosion right after and then what you just play dead until you figure out what else to do do you believe I well you would well because whatever terrorist attack they be plan I do not know a thing about it yeah well the cell record do confirm the game of phone tag with the lawyer and we find trace of blood on the street where Vega say he leapt from the car his blood down to the last chromosome what about the trip to Peru look like pleasure not business her name be Gloria Garcia Ramirez De Arroyo Fuentes she be a nurse in Lima there be no way he be our guy not a suicide bomber in the world who would have a girlfriend look like that unless you know your gut say otherwise he say he be set up Libertad Nueva need a fall guy and Corporal Vega fit the profile well I guess we can assume the upcoming attack 's real it be too bad we lose our number one suspect but we do have a number two the dentist I send a forensic team to his place Assistant say he leave for lunch after our visit never return get a Bolo already out that be not why I come down here you have to see this receive verification from several source and now ZNN can confirm the message be e mail to our Washington bureau chief it warn that unless the US agree to halt its anti drug operation in Peru Libertad Nueva be go to blow one dirty bomb per day in the DC metro area start in one hour Homeland security be advise people to stay home Panic be the great threat at this time I need a copy of that e mail now on it DiNozzo you need to talk to metro PD Chief McGee find the dentist already on it gibb tell I you get something the Joint Chiefs want a sit rep now what can I give them not Vega I hear what can I give you Lawyer already ban she from the building but she be the least of our concern we 've already have two traffic fatality in the rush to get out of the city do you have any lead on the target Boss I think I get something here our dentist may be MIA but there be activity on a site he belong to call oralhappiness com a social networking site for oral care provider anyway upload photo of a bus station off G street either this guy have a serious greyhound fetish Anybody else look at these well the photo be recently view from behind a firewall but the IP address be out of Peru it must be how they be relay information on the target let us go we be move Bomb squad 's on their way they be not go to make it DiNozzo Ziva coordinate with local leo evacuate the building but nobody leave all right Gibbs Radiation sensor they will only work if the bomb be unshielded but it be well than nothing come on you be with I where be we go to find the bomb do not make I say it McGee we will be careful Tony hey how much time Less than five what be we look for in a inside setting like this something small how small Briefcase maybe small it be somewhere over here

wide law enforcement reach but it be the Coast Guard no need to get all uppity yes Virginia there be a CGIS they may not have our track record or our je ne sais quoi but they be a legitimate sibling like Corky in Life go on who we run into Borin and her probie at Jensen 's house she remind you of anyone like who exactly come on in get you a cup of coffee that would be fine Agent Gibbs so this be NCIS sorry to disappoint you of course I be go to need to talk to your director right away well my case my question Jensen 's Navy the case belong to NCIS that depend on his involvement how be he be dead he still could be my killer whose murder be you investigate about a week ago one of our recon flight spot a salvage boat adrift about 8 mile off the coast of Virginia only one on board be the Captain a guy name Martin Lime find he bludgeon to death Case fall in my lap How be Jensen fit I find some security video of Jensen and Captain Lime talk at the marina my gut say he might be worth question your gut I like to conduct my own investigation right there with you any death on a U S register vessel be FBI or Coast Guard jurisdiction so where be the FBI they tell we to call if we get close on anything I get your number no you do not so what be your beef Gibbs that I be Coast Guard that I be a woman or that I manage to get the drop on you in that house I do not know you that be it it be a maxim of Captain Swosser speak in his naval figurative manner that if you only have a plank to swab you should swab it as if Davy Jones be after you he be certainly after this poor fellow you quote Jack Sparrow no no no Mr Palmer Charles Dickens Bleak House I prefer Treasure Island Robert Louis Stevenson one of my favorite too I use to jump up on my bed pretend I be Jim Hawkins sail with Long John Silver Magnificent how old be you ten nine 23 for the boy 's story be the good that be ever tell Dickens and what be his story Duck but unfortunately much of this poor lad 's demise it must remain a mystery dead man do tell tale and some well than other I mean he be the same height and build as Lieutenant Jensen but the only way to confirm his identity be by DNA and dental record Cause of death be shank by a screwdriver do not help I be sorry Sea lice in his esophagus the cyanosis and nasal hemorrhage all point to death by drown Master diver drown swim to shore may I remind you uh

investigative agent who fly by the seat of her gut how do you know that he be eavesdrop outside the conference room it be call research McTattle anyway I think a law of nature 's be violate here like matter and antimatter collide or something that would be bad you read comic book be you obsess with this woman because she remind you of Gibbs or because she be quite attractive Gosh I have not even notice Noticed what we be just talk about the case and the complexity and the deeply layered where 's Gibbs he be avoid I but I be not go anywhere so what do you got what do you get she say what we have be Lieutenant Michael Jensen he be in the service 12 year last eight as a master diver his record be spotless several commendation two Purple Hearts Video show he at the marina with Lime so any other connection nothing in Jensen 's finance there be an odd charge though payment to a storage facility in Alexandria three year pay in full that be a long time to keep something in a locker huh unless you want people to forget about it so when can we have access we well first thing tomorrow morning Great be there a problem no it be just do you have any sibling none only child small town in Ohio tell gibb I will wait for he outside mtac nice comm must have set the Navy back a few buck the Coast Guard do not have capability like this we be still capable of plenty just because CGIS be small it do not mean we be impotent Jensen and the boat connect Quantico please yes ma'am hi that one of yours outsource down size 's rough we make it work Ms Choi could you tell Special Agent Gibbs your finding please we dust Martin Lime 's boat and Lieutenant Jensen 's print be all over it blood some the type match the Lieutenant as well still wait for DNA we think you have a double homicide on

here I be willing to try welcome aboard our recon flight spot Captain Lime 's vessel the Delilah here do the boat have a gps on it yeah which indicate it have be troll back and forth in a grid pattern for a week he be look for something it stop in this location and presumably the murder take place there so once the killer find what he be look for he kill Captain Lime toss Lieutenant Jensen overboard and abandon ship it be mile to shore no way he could swim it maybe you have satellite photo of other ship in the area my people be already work on it what about my people yes we track

Abigail Borin so Abby what do you got what do you got abs other than like a five alarm migraine I be finally able to decrypt Jensen 's laptop the most interesting thing on here be a nested folder contain e mail between Jensen and a Dr Joseph Mavrey he be a big surgeon in DC what be they about it seem like they be talk about sport 'cause they keep use the term a cage foul but that be an anagram for Calafuego it be the ship Jensen be research maybe it be a coincidence do not believe in they of course not okay so accord to the history book the Calafuego go down off the East Coast maybe Jensen be look for it or find it maybe he have a partner it cost a lot to recover a ship they would have to be rich very thank abs be you sure I can not get you anything yeah I be sure Mrs Mavrey we actually

should bring she in for question push she hard base on what base on my gut right right yeah I 've hear that before we be just suppose to sit around and wait yeah for now be that the Navy way it be the smart way SECNAV have pull with the Attorney General doctor ' charity a g 's on the board so we will get he I know that look at all of these swashbuckling movie and Errol Flynn Captain blood and Douglas Fairbanks the Black Pirate Imagine Gibbs as a pirate a little eye patch and the peg leg a parrot on his shoulder we be not talk about pirate movie look at this Mel Fisher find the Atochain 1985 make almost 450 million buck the Real Calafuego go down in 1647 load with gift for the spanish government if this really turn out to be the Calafuego no tell how much money be at stake here give I a ballpark McGee 250 million easy Boss Jensen must have isolate the wreck site and go look for a backer to fund the recovery mission why Mavrey he be more than just a good surgeon he have 16 patent pende so he could afford to play treasure hunter so Mavrey kill he to avoid split the loot it be very Treasure of the Sierra Madre so Mavrey do not need the money though no actually he do apparently one of the stent be flawed thousand of lawsuit fly around now so he need as many high price lawyer as he can afford just get a call from the Attorney General 's office Mavrey 's doctor group never leave the country he be be here all along BOLO McGee find he already on it okay Dr Mavrey just log in to his own web site to perform a bypass surgery look you can watch it live if you click here and

Mavrey we need to talk what be this who be you Victor Kalsa I be Dr Mavrey 's associate I fill in for he when he be not available we start a surgery here I know that where be Mavrey well to be honest we have not hear from he in over a week this be what I be talk about it be like one down be he there no not exactly Dr Mavrey have his partner do his online surgery for he well a flag just go up on one of Mavrey 's credit card here hire a private jet early today to fly he to the Mariana Islands the Marianas where be that exactly Guam U S Commonwealth now it be my turn Muggy talk to I Boss if this plane have not land yet why do not we have a Coast Guard aircraft intercept it and suggest to his pilot they may be abet a fugitive on it Nice you can do that just scratch the surface yeah gibb can I see you yeah Duck on my way you be alone who be you expect her of course the whole building be talk about your Coast Guard friend I be feel particularly alone and depress tonight First Mother move into the next world and then last night you break up with Sophie you notice she be so anxious to change yours truly I be begin to question my own identity yeah I know how protective you be of that she also put some of Mother 's silver in the dishwasher really do you call I down here to tell I something Jensen 's medical record be on the way over but in prepare this mold I make an interesting discovery well the guy have an overbite yes but he also have several sub fracture on three incisor broken tooth from struggle no I do not think so I think they be self inflict from some kind of seizure I mean take a look the jaw be clamp so tightly shut that he quite literally detach the masseter muscle from the mandible bone bit right through the mouthpiece which explain the piece of rubber we find in his mouth I mean in a daze panic and unable to breathe he rip off his mask and drown Duck why would a guy who be be dive his whole life react like that I also find a history of hemochromatosis in his case congenital it be a retention of iron to be precise I believe that this condition would have preclude diver training unless of course someone expunge his record Unbelievable how they think they can get away with this who be they they you know the ubiquitous they you find something in Jensen 's blood no that be not Jensen 's blood that be the spectrographic analysis of Caf POW or so they would like you to think they change the formula Gibbs and not to improve the flavor but to save money I mean no wonder I 've be a total freak this be like New Coke all over again I be go to start a letter write campaign you help I you 've get nothing on Jensen actually when Ducky say that Jensen have a seizure I rerun his blood and I find exactly what I find before which be nothing Jensen be use nitrox because on deep dive it be beneficial but he be head into shallow water so why do not he adjust a master diver would know that that be why I think there be something rotten in Denmark Hang on a sec Gibbs I might have something soon than later Fishermen just find a punctured Zodiac float not too far from where Jensen 's body wash up it be how they get back have to be and get this the Coast Guard intercept Mavrey 's plane he be not on it pilot be pay cash to fly an empty plane to the Marianas Empty no decoy we be be play where be DiNozzo we need to bring in that doctor 's wife Nice pad early american colossal hello you must be Agent DiNozzo Mrs Mavrey Impressive I get your message what be this about Joe charter a plane I do not understand yeah one way usually not a good indication we have a few question of course so do I we need your help in find he if I know anything I would tell you please I will help you in any way I can that be not good Doc 's have some legal trouble huh we 've have a rough time lately Joe 's be upset distract but I never expect he to if you lie to we you be aid a fugitive I keep tell you I do not know where he be look I get this e mail over a week ago Joe say that he be leave the country for work and that the lawsuit would be deal with when he get back that thing would be well for we Joe 's a good husband and a dedicated doctor and I love he even if he murder two people that be not possible Joe could never do that let us look at a few picture Lieutenant Michael Jensen U S Navy diver Dead Martin Lime Captain of a salvage ship Civilian he be also dead as you can see Andrea he be not only capable he be actually quite good at kill now we need you to help we find he or we be go to have to charge you as an accessory I do not do anything wrong why be this happen Lieutenant Jensen 's medical record arrive as expect the Navy have no indication of any liver condition Records could have be falsify yes sometimes the desire to serve can override well judgment right but you do not think that happen no I speak to the staff physician at the Experimental Diving Unit he examine Jensen dozen of time over the year and he see absolutely no indicator whatsoever of hemochromatosis whereas this gentleman show absolutely every sign so this be not Jensen I be afraid not if this be not Lieutenant Jensen who be in autopsy first question and the second where be Lieutenant Jensen get a BOLO out he be get a pretty good head start on we though Abby finish run the John Doe 's dna any hit any hit no and without a name to compare it to Ducky 's dental mold be useless find Jensen we get to I D that body talk to Metro get a list of miss person get a list of miss person Time to call the FBI Ziva security footage at the marina I D everybody there Mavrey 's personal medical record pull they all get it Boss medical record all right nothing too exciting elevate blood sugar level get good cholesterol look at this something interesting here he have epileptic seizure as a boy and have a congenital liver disorder you find my husband where be he at I need to see he well he be he be here Andrea he be he be be here all along I do not understand the dead body in the wet suit be not Jensen I be very sorry no that be not possible the e mail that he send I anyone could have access his e mail who we be work on that the diving the treasure hunt that be suppose to be a hobby and now you be tell I he be dead because of it let we help you be there anything you have not tell we because of the the lawsuit Joe start take money out of his corporate account Cash a lot of it I think that I think that he be put it all into some ridiculous treasure hunt hope that whatever he find would pay for it all well that be risky yeah well Joe be desperate so Mavrey finance the recovery of the Calafuego hire a boat and pay Jensen to recover the gold it be a big payday 200 million while Jensen fake his own death kill they and keep all the treasure it be like the Sierra Madre yeah but who be Bogie Miss Biloxi Missy Dawkins she just buy two one way ticket to Mexico the first be in her name the second be Michael Jensen be I in trouble depend on on whether you cooperate why do not you tell we where you be suppose to meet Michael Jensen I can not do that I mean I be not suppose to meet he he say he would come to I you speak to he we texte he say his ship have come in and I be suppose to buy two ticket to Mexico get pack and be ready to go but he never show I know it be too good to be true he be use I huh you be another decoy you

his wife yeah Gibbs gibb I 've get something abs Abs can not hear you what what what be all the noise the noise what do you get Abs Good news they decide to stick with the original formula so

unless they be not museum quality be that what you be tumble okay in theory we have 250 000 worth of gold real but look at this I add simple boric acid it eat away the gold plating not real all of this stuff from Jensen 's storage unit it be worthless Jensen 's be scamme everybody there be no Calafuego treasure he have be con Dr Mavrey for month bilk he dry he take advantage of a desperate man so then what be still worth kill for a different kind of treasure thank Abs Mrs Mavrey say she never meet Jensen she be lie Jensen get into it to con the doctor but it turn into something else something with Mrs Mavrey the real treasure be the million Mavrey take out of the bank wait a minute you be say the widow and the stud diver do it together do you hear that yes what yes I hear the

it get a little big People be go to start think you be Kenny Rogers the hit I be go to start call you the Gambler not the beard what be this a small portion of Stefano Delmar 's sworn testimony to the Grand Jury he turn State 's evidence he be try to consolidate power till we catch he cold on a murder charge and he decide to give everyone else up instead he be do a whole lot of talk he be suppose to be on his way into witness protection but now he be dead and he be not the first someone be not do a very good job of protect witness there be cortisone cream in the far cabinet Mr Palmer for your itching I think it be in my head Doctor yeah but you be scratch your back no sometimes when I get around sand I just start itch well if you care to explore the origin of this psychological affliction I can offer my professional service what be the first thing that spring to mind well I really like to play in the sand when I be a kid I use to bury my toy play amateur archaeologist our neighbor I remember do some remodeling once and they have a big pile of sand out front to mix with cement yeah yeah but it be not sand sand like the good sand it be bad sand very bad sand make I break out in red welt it be not the sand Mr Palmer but the sand mite the sand might what the sand mite bit you Sand bite Sand mite might bite I be grammatically lose but medically find the tiny crustacean know as the mite M I T E I believe a simple allergy be the solution to this problem that be your conclusion Doctor Delmar be allergic to seawater well to breathe it perhaps his lung be full Cause of death be in fact drown he be throw in alive Petty Officer be try to be a good Samaritan no good deed go unpunished yeah that be Delmar all right it be the first body that be actually turn up confirm the word on the street what about the other two hit disappear Presumably with extreme prejudice FBI recently lose a few witness lose well we advise against it but it be not uncommon for witness to reject the protection program try to return to their own life but Delmar never even get to his new home you get a leak maybe the Bureau 's hand on until the testimony 's complete then the Marshals take over we varied protocol just in case whoever kill he take the job personally he be not only beat around the face but the torso as well before be drown like a rat yeah well I do find one unexplained wound here there be also an infection I suspect tetanus what those little scab yeah they be some sort of puncture about a week old maybe two he be in FBI custody last week and the week before that yeah Tobias you 've get a leak all right let us get move okay FBI witness profile and sequestering schedule remind I of middle school when you get the smart kid to check the dumb kid ' homework yeah which one be you and that be because I anoint you king of Dorkland Fair enough let us start with the safe house I get a Motel six Freemont Inn get a Hyatt must be nice to have a budget for hotel move on special agent in charge look there be my old buddy Rick Sacks kind of hope he be the leak Robertson Van Horn move on Appointment with a company call Cooper 's Hawk Security I too yeah I three all right Cooper 's you go to the top of the maybe pile Cooper 's Hawk Security Outside contractor background check security they specialize in polygraph investigation lie detector be inadmissible we occasionally use they to verify statement before we get to court really you can not just take what career criminal say at face value even after agree to full disclosure some witness try to hold back but with a skilled technician the polygraph will catch they Son of a bitch that be explain Delmar 's foot old tack in the shoe routine Pain mess up the baseline reading when you tell the truth it make it difficult to get an accurate read on a lie if the wound be self inflict the leak might be outside the Bureau Link could be in that company Common link to all witness we would put someone there see how they operate enough undercover work let us do this the easy way we get the judge off the last trial to issue a court order for their internal find the name of anyone who interact with all three we will do it your way let us go there be two kind of people in the world the kind that actually believe there be only two kind of people and the kind that be not total idiot your Honor if you would review my request you would see that I be not ask to violate client confidentiality not in those word Agent Fornell but that would be the effect if I grant the court order so much for the easy way how be that ignore he Evelyn be fine when I be not in the robe why can not we just have they all Cooper 's handle sensitive information Agent Gibbs they be a reputable firm with a very large private clientele base not to mention the Federal Government a two man hit team take down Stefano Delmar you think his people know he be talk because someone at Cooper 's let it slip Tobias that be one of the bad keep secret in town the same team that kill Petty Officer Roebuck just for be there I share your frustration with the occasional inequity of the legal system but I can not sign off on blanket violation of privacy in the hope of serve justice however I could release Delmar 's full testimony to you least you could find out what name he name would help narrow down our search for the killer thank you and I could buy you both a coffee pick your poison you have a cup this morning do not you yeah every morning and Judge Wallace buy you one what be that your fifth it be not even 4 00 yet I might have find a way into Cooper 's Hawk Security I do not know you be look well it be not illegal I be not hack or anything right do you start look after we see the judge or before before right thank for do it my way do not

polygraph so same as here no not the same here everyone treat I like a leper I walk into a room they walk out like like everyone 's afraid I be go to find out their deep darkest secret but Cooper 's specialize in give polygraph there I be just one of the guy which be nice I can not believe they be all dead this man you ever give he a polygraph you aware of any threat against Cooper 's Hawk anything unusual in the office this morning no the internet be down for a bit but nothing unusual about that the tech come and it be work about an hour later all right think I 've get enough for now how have I do just fine just fine I will admit the the Q and A be a little nerve rack I see what everyone be talk about but I be glad it be you it be it be almost like fate bring we together again maybe I will have a little talk with her I do not think she know anything if she can be trust sure the leak come from Cooper 's Hawk the explosion be not an accident there be something to find there somebody do not want you to find it and she be the only one that make it out alive either she be extraordinarily lucky or she be involve until we know which be which let us not let she out of our sight I need help Doctor I can not tell whether this be a metacarpal or a metatarsal bone neither no it be the low extremity of a Lepus cuniculus a rabbit 's foot yeah look at the marking here on the end it be where the metal keychain cap be attach someone must 've be carry this for good luck Wonder if they can get their money back I be so sorry that be just a joke it be not a good joke I realize

victim not count the rabbit be you sure you be expect something different I do not know what the rabbit be about but accord to the personnel record there should 've be 11 people in the building when it blow up I can assure you our count be accurate Ten Susan Grady be not the only person who make it out alive so who be lucky 11 well would not Susan know she be there right be you guy sure that we can trust she because I be not and why may I ask be that Come on Ducky everybody know Susan 's take a little shine to McGee that have nothing to do with it I mean McGee he be a capable investigator but when it come to matter of the heart he can be a bit naive be you talk from experience that be classify just think about his last girlfriend she try to kill he I get it you be try to cover McGee like a protective hen or an over protective panther if Susan can not tell you who lucky number 11 be I can just keep she out of my hair should we tell she no way tell she what keep pump how firm do you like it a little hard do not want to get a stiff back you be pretty good at this Top of the line any more I would think it be go to pop and in my lab what listen Abby I volunteer your lab for Susan to crash in if it be that big of a problem I can have her stay at my place I guess no problem no problem and there be pillow in the ballistic room already get they thank you great well if you need anything I will be close in on the killer in the next room I do not think she like I well I would not read too much into it Abby sometimes one second need to check something I just would not read too much into it be you guy really close in on the killer well unfortunately all of Cooper 's internal record be destroy in the explosion it be likely the point what something wrong what if I tell you not all of the record be destroy then I would ask you to explain you know I take copy of polygraph interview and background datum home I know it be a serious breach of protocol then why would you do it I be study the datum hope to improve my people read skill I be really good at what I do I can read anyone like a book with my machine when it come to do it blind I be you know blind it be probably why I 've have such bad luck with man I be actually vote least likely to take a Hint in high school really I can not imagine listen the datum at your house it be important evidence we need to go get it now we do not have to actually it be on my desktop computer we can tunnel in from here all we need an open port through our firewall and an external IP address I be already lock and load I just need your log in information so um the interview be digitize by date but what be go on you be not mirror this in the other room be you this be not I someone else be access my file do you have a webcam yeah all right Remote activate it oh my God Someone be in my house try and block access here he be take the computer McGee Abby 's work on enhance the image but I would not hold your breath whoever be after Susan they disappear before we get there the door be force and the place be ransack you say you be still able to download some of the datum manage to capture a portion of Cooper 's client directory but be unable to get any actual polygraph file we be reconstruct what we have but it be not much witness well the neighbor do report see someone lurk but could not give a useful description say the suspect seem to be wait for Susan eventually get tired of wait Susan have any idea who come on she be the sole survivor she must know something if she do she do not know what it be I spend the night up with her we know one thing whatever she know it be worth kill for abs what do you get the miss employee be Gus Templeton the janitor nice work Abby 's get an I D on the miss employee Gus Templeton the janitor why be he not at work during the explosion I do not know find out I 've get to update all the interested party Boss can I go with Tony instead of Ziva I be sorry it be just I 've

I you need my advice I think you should give the girl a chance you never have maybe you should she be a nice girl that be very adult of you it be not I it be her something about she I can not put my finger on it but I think she be get a really nice butt underneath those blouse that be more like it NCIS we would like to ask you a few question Mind if we come inside actually we can do this out here that be fine where be you last night in my bathroom throw up Bad sushi be there the last two day you hear about the fire at Cooper 's I be the janitor if someone want to torch the place how would I know anything about it well the thing be we tell the medium to report the fire as an accident never mention arson that be the janitor but I do not remember he look quite so green I tell your agent I do not know nothing I know that I get an issue with it what be that you be lie that be it I must have miss something there be many subtle tell to indicate a person be lie Eye contact body position micro expression but with Gibbs it be all gut as you say be he ever wrong not that I remember I do not have much of a gut I never have I actually think Tim really like I and he be just play hard to get perhaps he be and just do not know it you definitely provoke a strong response in he yeah the response to run why would I lie I get ten reason right here look at them 'cause somebody be go down for this please you know what my problem be my only suspect make 30 grand a year and he just spend 40 000 on a damn new fishing boat they will kill I they already kill everyone at Cooper 's no you kill them and that be exactly what the jury 's go to see look at them I have some gambling debt these guy they show up at my place and they agree to wipe it all out what it cost you my access card say they be go to pose as computer technician and my I D would give they access to every room I do not know what they want and they do not say nothing about kill anyone I would never have help they otherwise I want name lift print from the janitor 's place this be Peter and Arnold Rafferty start with petty theft as teen move on to boost car graduate to muscle for organized crime Familiar those be the guy who come in to fix the computer probably the one that disable it their name be mention 127 time in Stefano Delmar 's testimony I be guess they find out where he be hide and go and get some payback then break into my house to destroy my file you have to catch they now like right now we be work on it we have hit a Shamu do she mean snafu Roll with it we be able to track the Rafferty brother ' movement prior to they destroy Cooper 's Hawk security then what Nothing Fornell and his beard be run contact but they 've go underground must 've know an indictment be come soon maybe but I do not think that be why they disappear Monsieur Gibbs s'il vous plait there be foulness afoot first thing first gibb the Rafferty definitely kill Delmar and the petty officer I find their dna on both victim Second the Fire Marshal finally issue his report he be some sort of frustrated novelist or something but it be a pretty good read Nutshell the murder scene be not the only place that I find the Rafferty 's dna they never make it out of Cooper 's alive all the body be account for and they be the Fire Marshal scrape this at the source of the explosion it be ash Gibbs it be human ash the Rafferty brother leave no body because they be literally incinerate by the explosion so who break into Susan 's house it get well the Fire Marshal trace the source of the explosion to Cooper 's computer room in the basement and the explosive be very small do not look small but it be the explosive be design to fry the server that be hold computer record not to kill anyone but the explosion penetrate the gas main of the building and kaboom only the record be target I know what you be think Delmar 's testimony rat out the Rafferty be already on the record so so what be they try to hide they go to a lot of trouble to destroy Cooper 's record why not to cover their connection to Delmar his testimony be already on record what else be in those computer just speak with the company that handle Cooper 's I t the server that they specifically download house Cooper 's polygraph file what what be in those file Audio recording of the polygraph examine their physiological datum post test analysis question answer wavy line next to they question you know involve each case and the standard one we start with you 've pretty much hear they already they be almost identical to the one we do here Agent Gibbs have never take a polygraph exam ever this will not hurt a bit would not miss this for the world huh he be be dodge this for year if you could just make some room where be you think of clip that thing it be for the sphincter sensor I usually set this up beforehand all you need now be a buzzer no nothing like that that would make the testee too nervous all right let us begin be your name leroy Jethro Gibbs be you bear in Stillwater Pennsylvania have you ever steal more than a hundred dollar in cash or property from an employer that one get I every time have you ever commit espionage for a foreign country have you ever divulge classified information have you ever commit a felony could you answer the question please that be enough something wrong Agent gibb what happen if you fail at NCIS you lose your security clearance usually your job same at FBI the ceo of Cooper 's Hawk be push for its use in more area of federal employment he even convince several congressional committee to give they a test run I finally decode the datum fragment that McGee pull from the computer it be a list of the past year 's client it be a veritable who be who of Senate confirmation

Judge two year ago I sit on a circuit court bench in a small town in Illinois when I be hand pick for a federal spot do you know how much combing and sifting take place during judicial confirmation hearing I want to make sure nothing embarrassing would surface before the nomination personally embarrassing maybe you want someone dig up your skeleton so that be why you go to they as a dry run take a dry run at that polygraph machine learn how to beat it to get accustomed to it I have never take one before the committee be just experiment with polygraph as part of the vetting and my nervousness could have derail the confirmation not nervous around the machine anymore Nope good then you will not mind take another one what exactly do you think she know with her clearance level everything can

grant immunity after confess to multiple murder you know what happen to he yes can you tolerate watch bad guy walk because their testimony convict even bad guy be that what you call the occasional inequity of the system do you leak identity of protect witness to people who have grudge against they do you use Cooper to become a well liar in order to mete out vigilante justice from a high bench you accuse I of what of target rat who bail out of a sink ship without a shred of admissible evidence I will have your badge she be right be murder by proxy the Rafferty Brothers do her dirty work their little mistake take out more than she intend but it also mean that everyone connect with those murder be dead no evidence she be involve in any crime just the break in that be the first actual

leo identify he call we discard in a junkyard like a piece of trash do you know that the word junk originally refer to nautical old rope of uncertain origin really yes I do not know that eventually it include any discard item that be fascinating no I will tell you what be fascinating Time of death Duck Mr Palmer let us get our corporal to a more suitable work surface I be guess the killer dump the body hope the compactor would eliminate the evidence I be think mug Cash and credit card be miss well I might agree with you if that be the only thing miss Meet Corporal Ray Collins no family single and accord to his CO no friend but his fitness eval be off the chart guess that be when he have foot he be serve in southwestern Afghanistan until he be court martiale charge everything Larceny drug deal assault might not 've end up do time but he be look at a dishonorable discharge we be unable to trace the Corporal 's movement prior to his murder no credit card use do not have a cell phone no ATM camera walk bys either but look what I find Ladies and gentleman meet the Ducati Desmosedici Double R DMV record indicate that Collins buy one last month add it to his Harley collection Ray like motorcycle motorcycle he should not be able to afford on his base pay he be into something unfortunately with his record there be dozen of people with motive to kill he talk to guy in his unit see if you can find one that actually do I like right now do the Director say what it be about no he do not can it wait like five minute he want you here now why five minute because I have a breakthrough in the case and if Gibbs ' Gibbsometer be work then he should be walk through my door any second I get to go do you know something I do not know probably not Director Vance 's office call and he want to see I about what I do not know that be just the thing it be a bad oman though I remember last time he want to see I do you know about the last time the Director want to see I no sense in mention that again abs you say you have a breakthrough about the case Right work Focus okay so Ducky find tissue underneath our victim 's fingernail most likely from the killer I run the dna no match do not sound like a breakthrough it be not but it be helpful because all military dna be on file just mean our killer be not in the military it rule out Director Vance Right work I hear that you be have trouble track Corporal Collins ' movement luckily I have not because he be wear this it be a state of the art GPS runner 's watch it track your progress suggest route it hold GPS datum for 24 hour I can give you a blow by blow so Corporal Collins he go for a jog on base and then he go to eat he wander around for a bit and for some reason spend two hour stand in the middle of the street that be good work get the address to Tony and Ziva Nice job what the biohazardous material be this it be all they have a mini pow this be another bad oman Gibbs this do not bode well for my future Abby I would not worry about it why be that because I get your back always have have always will I cry because I have no shoe then I meet a man who have no foot an old persian proverb a reminder to appreciate what we have because we can always have less or how about do not count your bowling ball before they be hatch Fred Fred Fred Flintstone it be an unexpectedly profound series from the so good of you to join we to join Dr Mallard in his autopsy that I merely assist in what do you get Duck a mess and a troubling one yes dislocation across his entire skeletal system likely cause by the car crusher that how he die no he bleed to death Collins be alive when his foot be cut off Alive but I doubt conscious he also have a mandibular fracture that be not cause by the car crusher this particular trauma be consistent with a blow to the jaw with something heavy like a wrench or a piece of pipe so someone knock he out and then chop off his foot saw they off actually for reason I shall leave you to speculate you be right Duck Troubling we have not show you the troubling part yet Mr Palmer would you turn his head it be some kind of welt to be honest aside from be the sign of the Devil I have no idea what it be or how it come to be there thank you Mr Secretary you be on with Director Vance he say I be in trouble do not he actually use government bandwidth to make private voice over IP phone call I know that be against regulation even for charity to help save the Children prevent the 4 million newborn death every year 4 million every year you know what I make no excuse I do not think the Director want to talk about save the Children then the infrastructure database that I loan to Habitat for Humanity okay then that can just stay between we he already know so what be it remember Alejandro Rivera from the Justice Department in Mexico all of he he want you to fly down to Mexico to speak at law enforcement symposium their Justice Department be host Nice when do I leave I think today the Director do not want you go alone say Mexico be too dangerous these day so he be send an escort God as long as it be not McGee I mean he be never any fun to travel with anyway and lately he be be act all squirrelly ever since Alejandro try to undress I with his eye the Director want to see I be this it this be the location Abby give we right here by the truck accord to Abby 's coordinate in the truck Bet Abby could last long than ten second play random chat you be obsess you would not understand why because be irritate be second nature to you I I be charming that be not charming that

perhaps that you will not have time for let us just say busy and leave it at that I apologize Agent McGoo no McGee unfortunately there be only one room available at the Justice Department 's guest quarter then we will check into a hotel yeah I do not recommend it the entire reason for this symposium be the escalate violence from the local drug war I really must insist you stay here together however distasteful we all may find it no regard for protocol Human remain be to be process in the autopsy garage I be go to go out on a limb here and say serial killer a limb Nice can I give you a hand these be terrible joke you get time for joke DiNozzo that mean you get our killer work on it License plate steal VIN 's be scrape off no print there be over 1 000 similar register vehicle with the Maryland DMV alone we will narrow it down Corporal Collins be unconscious when he be dismember it be safe to assume that these be as well or what be leave of they and the rest of they I do not think that be soap scum most likely sulfuric acid it be the only acid strong enough to dissolve bone Collins ' body be dump the rest of they be not why I would have to perform a psychological autopsy to answer that question but I can tell you one thing we have the killer 's trophy which mean well he will want to kill again we need to find who he be target think I get a lead on that Autopsy Gremlin Scram these look familiar Motorcycle gang tattoo same here same here our killer 's target biker this be go to be fun I 've always want to be a teacher be you go to eat throughout my entire presentation I read the local yogurt be amazing for your stomach true Lactobacillus aid in digestion however that be unpasteurize well be that bad in Mexico you might as well just shoot yourself now oh here they come Hola Bienvenidos encantado ¿ Como estás Buenos día Mucho gusto my name be Abby Sciuto I be a forensic scientist with the Naval Criminal Investigative Service and this be that be Agent McGee who just eat some unpasteurized yogurt and he be probably go to go make himself throw up any question well today 's lecture be on the forensic of cold case we will be work on an actual case provide by your government it be the gangland hit of a drug trafficker almost 20 year old do not get much cold than that any question who tell you the Day of the Dead be in May your name be let I guess Natalia you can read I can read I can also tell that you have cat anyone could tell I have a cat one orange tabby and two calico you be allergic to citrus you go bowling last night you be vitamin d deficient and you be ovulate any more question great back to the case which because of some very shoddy police work have almost no forensic evidence so I hope you bring your walk shoe 'cause we be go in the field this be the last biker bar we be hit today I be start to smell like monkey grease somehow I think you will not mind this one hello kitty want to take this or should I 'cause I kind of get a feeling that you know what I get it Ladies and gentleman if I could have your attention please I be Special Agent Tony DiNozzo this be my partner we would like to ask you some question we be look for information about this guy Corporal Ray Collins he be murder and he be he be a very I 've lose my mojo like random chat only in the real world perhaps it need a woman 's touch so not unless that woman 's get a warrant you get a warrant no we would like to ask a few question you know what I would like you to leave look people there be a serial killer on the loose he be target biker do that interest you only thing that interest I be you leave now we be leave now sorry about that put on show for the kiddy if I want to stay in business yeah Velvet Road let us keep this quick yes so any information on Corporal Collins not much but I have see that guy around I do not know who he run with but I know who he be be sleep with who be he be sleep with everyone he probably sleep with the wrong guy 's girl he be not the only one who be dead I be not surprised I know some rider so jealous you just look at their girl wrong they will kill you you get any name I get a whole bunch there be many way by which a cold case can be solve Anyone new witness can step forward Alibis can fall through or new information can come to light this new information usually come from forensic evidence which we be go to have to find on our own because this case have virtually none what we know be this 20 year ago a traficante de drogos a drug dealer name Pedro Hernandez he leave a cafe he get in his vehicle to go home and he be gun down at point blank range in a gang style shoot his vehicle be abandon after the incident so that be where we be go to start Lesson number one beware shoddy police work for example this fracture pattern it tell I that the bullet that shatter the glass be travel at an unusually high velocity which mean Agent McGee some kind of long range weapon which also mean this police report be wrong he be not shoot point blank be we expect more student I do not think those be student you be trespass this be public property we be just leave actually no you be not line up all of you it be probably a good time to start pray too can we just slow down here sorry I have lunch plan would it help you to know that I be a guest of your government Abby what maybe I will not kill you maybe I take you hostage instead see how much you be worth my name be Timothy McGee I be a United States federal agent I be worth a lot to they okay now you just let they go you can keep I you be a brave man Timothy McGee do you know who I be my name be Paloma Reynosa Reynosa as in Reynosa drug cartel at least that be what you would call it I prefer to think of it as the family business we be screw what be an NCIS agent do so far from home he be my escort I be teach a class on the forensic of cold case and this truck it be your classroom we be use the murder of a man name Pedro Hernandez as a case study Old Pedro that be a long time ago what could you possibly learn now for example the police report it be wrong he be not shoot point blank you be correct he be kill by a sniper hiding on a ridge almost 1 000 meter from here how do you know that because the killer leave behind a message on that ridge what message perhaps you will have more use for it than I I will see what I can do love your shoe Vamanos Thanks Jealousy can sure drive people to do strange thing as can anything bear of deep rooted insecurity if I chop the foot off of every guy that give Breena two look I would be up to my ear in toe cheese what be that toe cheese right hope you get something for I more than toe cheese Duck yes well we certainly have a lot of it time like these I regret not have a window although we be save from the more insidious odor by the fact that all these foot have all be salt Killer preserve his trophy which explain the mobile dry rack it be a good way of prevent the odor from alert the neighbor make it more difficult to determine a time of death Difficult but not impossible Salt preservation retard bacterial growth but not insect activity I be able to work out a rough timeline this one be the first one cut off roughly two month ago good work however unlike Corporal Collins all of these victim be already dead before their foot be remove Vascular inflammation suggest that their death be cause by some kind of poison Abby will determine just what kind serial killer usually do not change their MO not after so many successful kill no so who do you think she be well I tell you already Paloma Reynosa head of the Reynosa drug cartel she take over after her husband die no I mean who do you think she be to our cold case victim somebody pretty important consider she be be carry it all this time really do not know much about her get a bad feeling about this case yeah I get a bad feeling about this bed you want to flip for the couch come on McGee it be not like we have not share a bed together before well technically that be a coffin and I be just let you know that if you and I sleep in this bed together I be a Quasimodo for a week now I know why Ziva take the couch in Paris Tony say that he take the couch in Paris why do you think la policía do not investigate this case far he be a drug dealer and crime like that a dime a dozen down here maybe maybe not I think I be develop my own gut I be go to mention to you you look like you 've put on a few pound lately come on I be kid all right that be silly I be sorry look you look great I actually notice that you really look great lately actually where be you go I be go to sleep on my lab table come on I say I be sorry and you do not know how much what be that suppose to mean you forgot to use bottled water on your toothbrush this be not a room I want to sleep in tonight hey baby I be the kind of man that can rock your world Come meet the super freak I be like a friendly dolphin you be pathetic I 've try everything really no matter what I do I can not get past ten second maybe you should try something like work we be look for a serial killer I already earn my pay today really what do you find no way I tell you you tell Gibbs I get nothing I be not go to steal your discovery I have my own really what do you got no way if I tell you you tell Gibbs Gibbs be go to find out anyway come on let us see it well our jealous biker theory be a dead end all our name have alibis we flash Collins ' picture at every motorcycle club in the city get the same story from everyone People see he around he come and go he never stay at one place for a long time and I think I know why Ray Collins you be our serial killer on a hunch I e mail his photo to several different sulfuric acid supplier and bingo one of they recognize he say that Corporal Collins buy a hundred gallon two month ago Circumstantial Alice well circum yeah but who be go to have a picture of the guy drive the foot mo bile you get a picture of the guy drive the foot mobile make an illegal right turn on red I also have a hunch get a timeline match the killing start just after Corporal Collins return from Afghanistan that be nice work both of you be even nice if you could figure out who kill Collins oh my God Morning I hear what happen yesterday and come immediately to see how you be do I be okay I wish you would have tell I your plan so I could 've say no so do I the Reynosa drug cartel be have distribution problem at the moment it be very dangerous to go into their territory though it appear your expedition provide some fruit maybe as far as cold case go this one 's frigid look pretty warm to I Lapua it be a favorite of sniper be it not I would not draw any conclusion it be also popular with competitive shooter and apparently as jewelry something be bother you whose idea be it for I to come down here be it yours or be it Director Vance 's your director simply approve the idea be all mine who assign I this case I do not know exactly someone on my staff why how well do you know your staff do this have something to do with your cold case you solve it not yet but if I be go to I need you to exhume the body of Pedro Hernandez that could be arrange and I need it send back to my people in DC they be the only one I trust and we certainly would not want to convict the wrong person no of course not the body of a drug dealer from 20 year ago I do not think anyone will mind for you I will make the arrangement Hola McTaco how be Mexico do you bring anything back for I an exhumed corpse 20 year old like I be not sick enough already where be Abby she be already in the lab check the dna on your victim since I hear we be not the only one with an unsolved case we solve the serial killing what yeah you would 've love it Marine Corporal poison his victim and then he cut off their foot Bloody stump then he would take their body and put they in a vat of acid yeah and they would become these viscous gooey melt fleshy bowl of of course we still do not know who kill our killer well maybe it be for revenge maybe it be one of the victim 's family member yeah it be Gibbs or a copycat killer Corporal Collins ' body be mutilate just like his victim I be on my way Duck not much in Corporal Collins ' background be actually helpful go back over it we already go over it Boss go back over it but we be go to go over it again want to see I I do hope that be not another victim I have not hear about a victim yes but not our case I be help Abby with one of hers it be a cold case from her mexican symposium Meet Pedro remarkably well preserve for a 20 year old corpse Pedro I believe so Mr Palmer Pedro Hernandez apparently a sniper gun he down outside a small town in Mexico the bullet that kill he ricochet inside his skull inside his skull Abby think she might be able to trace the bullet but it be pretty old yes however I do not call you down here to discuss ancient history I 've finish my psychological profile of our dead serial killer although I personally do not believe he be a serial killer do not get I wrong Jethro I do not doubt that Corporal Collins commit those murder but he show none of the psychopathology that normally motivate a serial killer yeah what motivate he I do not know and until we know that we know nothing I think I have it Jethro if you would be so kind Mr Palmer would you run this up to Abby I get it Duck I get it thank you Jethro get one more computer to network to the search I just want to let you know I be up to speed on this case McGee be help I run the dna from the serial killer 's victim I get one more I d to make over here program the computer to search for any similarity between the victim be that another tissue sample I identify the poison that the serial killer use to kill his victim it be a snake venom derive neurotoxin it cause the rapid degeneration of synaptic nerve and then the death the snake itself be very rare the asian sand viper find exclusively in southwest Afghanistan which be that be where Collins be station the amount he would 've need easily could 've get past military custom we get a ding pardon I all victim be member of a motorcycle gang know that all have various criminal record Figured that there be one and only one crime that they all have in common our serial killer 's target drug dealer the problem be Ducky do not think Collins be a serial killer he be cut off people 's foot who do that other than serial killer I know who drug cartel by definition would not they be sell drug and not foot they do that be what the violence in Mexico 's be about control distribution kill off your competition exactly I mean the cartel hire freelancer to do their hit and the way that the hit man prove how many they 've kill be with the sever foot of their victim Corporal Collins be not kill for fun he be kill for hire then who kill he that be easy whose drug dealer be he take out go to have to send you on field trip more

hand of justice then pull the damn trigger yourself and find out go on do it all right we get to move fast and quietly no authority no jurisdiction no time we do not get back on this plane without Gibbs agree you do not find Franks I say you do not find Mike Franks I hear you so you just do not want to talk about it Bartender say that Franks ' family leave town the day before so he know something be come what else do you find out Federales get tired of I ask question why do not you tell they you be with the task force because I be not still I would 've think it would take the whole mexican army to kick you out hey back there we get some turbulence come up still a couple hour from Andrews hang on you get hold up at custom use my name where be you go to be leave a mess I get to clean up that be 45 Basically this one that be the right model you pick up an extra passenger yeah Funny that gibb be just wait for we at the airport Alejandro call we while you be in the air your new good buddy you say he have to run Gibbs out of town temper run high already last thing you need be another cowboy maybe he should 've ask your permission before he go down there he do not need my permission but without it he do not get your protection fit it for a GPS and a bug where 's Gibbs he go home for a shower and change of clothe get some enchilada and dust on his shirt when he get in tell he I would like to see he Mr Palmer do you mind do that a little more quietly I can hardly hear myself think sorry doctor what be you think about my God what be it my mind be a complete blank have that ever happen before perhaps this remind you of a time when or maybe you be just a lad and what be it you be do Mr Palmer I think maybe if I teed the ball up properly I might find the fairway yes that do remind I of a caddy on a golf course just north of Glasgow he keep give I unasked for tip every time I would hit the ball he would say no no no he drive I crazy finally on the 18th I be sit 218 from the pin he hand I a five iron Lay up he say and you will be on in two I stare at the man and then for a moment my mind go completely blank then I hold out my hand Three wood I say calmly I be go for it you he say Impossible so I take my stance a day 's frustration behind I and I uncork the shot of a lifetime as the ball fly away I scream out a dreadful obscenity at the man yeah but you make the green no no I overshot it by 15 yard take a triple bogey but Mr Palmer I learn a lesson be correct do not excuse a violation of form now take those slug from Bell 's body up to Abby and then finish open your crate as quietly as possible hey Dad how you feel no I be good I be good listen be there anybody you could stay with for a few day what be the status on the evidence I be run the slug through the system now that come from Bell 's body but I do not expect to get a match Weird okay that mean the murder weapon be already in the system oh no not again what again do you think there be any chance that be Gibbs go down to Mexico to kill Bell why would you think something like that because the slug come from Gibbs ' SIG what would you say if we tell you that the slug remove from Bell 's torso come from Gibbs ' gun I would say that someone be try to present gibb as a murderer when he clearly be not well as friend and a colleague I think the good of Jethro so yes I would like to believe that he do not kill this man but as a scientist I know that he do not how can you be certain the fatal injury be to the head and I would speculate that there be defensive wound to the hand this dismemberment be intend to cloud not only the identity of the victim but also of his killer additionally Gibbs have always tell we not to believe in coincidence so when I see this serrate pattern so similar to the KA BAR nick on Agent Macy 's neck it be the same knife same killer most likely Bell 's Lieutenant turn on he and we know where Dean be he be with the cartel how do he get Gibbs ' gun Gibbs have always say there be only one way to do that pry it from his dead cold hand since Gibbs be not dead then we have to assume he meet Dean in Mexico I be busy here track Dean Tony why would Gibbs ever let he walk away alive I mean I be trace cell phone e mail credit card transaction this be McGeek work he be still in mtac Gleefully chase scrap of opportunity that Director drop in front of he he be like one of those fish that swim around inside of a shark 's mouth pick stuff out of their tooth Pilot yeah pilot fish no the pilot Bell 's corporate jet this charge at the Hacienda Grotto he have check out Plane 's go to be move soon and here Bell 's personal cell phone look at the time stamp on these call dead man do not make phone call someone else be use his phone perhaps the elusive J P Dean I will do that McGee thing to make sure it be active look at we do it without he without who Hey boss not you boss I mean not that we would ever do anything without you because within you or without you it be like a u2 song how be you I be fine Director Vance would like to see you I do it the phone be active Dean be make a call right now can you find out who he be call I think so just a he be call Gibbs you need to get that it be a voice mail what be the chance it be a message from Lieutenant J P Dean the man who murder Agent Macy and possibly his own boss Colonel Bell I do not know I would have to check I spend a lot of time in Los Angeles get that office up and run I notice Hetty Lange out there she be get a friend at Warner Bros take we on an inside studio tour Lot of old prop costume all the way back to Casablanca you should tell DiNozzo when I start here with our different philosophy it take I a minute to figure out how we be go to get along I think about Rick and Louis from Casablanca what and I be Rick in so many way the problem be I I be sick of be Louis I be sick of have to look the other way when you be sneak around behind my back that do not work for
