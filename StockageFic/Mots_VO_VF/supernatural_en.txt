about your father can we talk to he look if you do not mind I mean he do not see anything and he be kind of be through a lot we understand now I be sorry but why do the wildlife service care about an accidental drowning you sure it be accidental will Carlton see something grab his sister like what here sit please there be no indigenous carnivore in that lake there be nothing even big enough to pull down a person unless it be the Loch Ness monster yeah right will Carlton be traumatize and sometimes the mind play trick still we drag that entire lake we even run a sonar sweep just to be sure and there be nothing down there that be weird though that be the third miss body this year I know these be people from my town these be people I care about I know anyway all this it will not be a problem much long what do you mean well the dam of course of course the dam it be uh it spring a leak it be fall apart and the feds will not give we the grant to repair it so they 've open the spillway in another six month there will not be much of a lake there will not be much of a town either but as federal wildlife you already know that exactly sorry be I interrupt I think come back

whole lake monster theory it just bug I why Loch Ness lake Champlain there be literally hundred of eyewitness account but here almost nothing whatever it be out there Noone 's living to talk about it wait Bar Christopher Bar where have I hear that name before Christopher Bar the victim in may Christopher Bar be Andrea 's husband Lucas ' father apparently he take Lucas out swim Lucas be on a float wooden platform when Chris drown two hour before the kid got rescue maybe we have an eyewitness after all no wonder that kid be so freak out watch one of your parent die be not something you just get

not think anyone will listen to you or uh or believe you I want you to know that I will you do not even have to say anything you could draw I a picture about what you see that day with your dad on the lake okay no problem this be for you this be my family that be my dad that be that be my mom that be my geek brother and that be I all right so I be a sucky artist I will see you around Lucas Lucas have not say a word not even to I not since his dad 's accident yeah we hear sorry what be the doctor say that it be a kind of post traumatic stress that can not be easy for either of you we move in with my dad he help out a lot it be just when I think about what Lucas go through what he see kid be strong you would be surprised what they can deal with you know he use to have such life he be hard to keep up with to tell you the truth now he just sit there draw those picture play with those army man I just wish hey sweetie thank thank Lucas hey dad you should probably eat something I be go to make some dinner okay so I think it be safe to say we can rule out Nessie what do you mean I just drive past the Carlton house there be an ambulance there will Carlton be dead he drown Yep in the sink what the hell so this be not a creature we be deal with something else yeah but what I do not know a water wraith maybe some kind of demon I mean something that control water water that come from the same source the lake yeah which would explain why it be up the body count the lake be drain it will be dry in a few month whatever this thing be whatever it want it be run out of time and if it can get through the pipe it can get to anyone almost anywhere this be go to happen again soon and we do know one other thing for sure we know this have get something to do with Bill Carlton it take both his kid and I 've be ask around Lucas ' dad Chris Bill Carlton 's godson let us go pay Mr Carlton a visit Mr Carlton we would like to ask you a few question if you do not mind we be from the department I do not care who you be with I 've answer enough question today your son say he see something in that lake what about you you ever see anything out there Mr Carlton Sophie 's drowning and Will 's death we think there might be a connection to you or your family my child be go it be it be bad than die go away please what do you think I think the poor guy be be through hell I also think he be not tell we something so now what what be it maybe Bill 's not the only one who know something I be sorry but I do not think it be a good idea I just need to talk to he just for a few minute he will not say anything what good be it go to do Andrea we think more people might get hurt we think something be happen out there my husband the other they just drown that be all if that be what you really believe then we will go but if you think there be even a possibility that something else could be go on here please let I talk to your son Hey Lucas you remember I you know I uh I want to thank you for that last drawing but the thing be I need your help again how do you know to draw this do you know something bad be go to happen maybe you could nod yes or no for I you be scared it be okay I understand see when I be your age I see something real bad happen to my mom and I be scared too I do not feel like talk just like you but see my mom I know she want I to be brave I think about that every day and I do my good to be brave and maybe your dad want you to be brave too thank Lucas Andrea say the kid never draw like that till his dad die there be case go through a traumatic experience could make certain people more sensitive to premonition psychic tendency what if Lucas be tap into it somehow it be only a matter of time before somebody else drown so if you get a well lead please all right we get another house to find there be about a thousand yellow two story in this county alone see this church I bet there be less than a thousand of those around here oh college boy think he be so smart you know um what you say about mom you never tell I that before it be no big deal oh god we be not go to have to hug or anything be we we be sorry to bother you ma'am but do a little boy live here by chance he might wear a blue ball cap have a red bicycle no sir not for a very long time Peter 's be go 35 year now the police never I never have any idea what happen he just disappear lose he you know it be it be bad than die do he disappear from here I mean from this house he be suppose to ride his bike straight home after school and he never show up Peter Sweeney and Billy Carlton 1970 you 've take everything everyone I 've get nothing leave I do not understand I do not believe now I think I do I think I finally know what you want okay this little boy Peter Sweeney vanishe and this be all connect to Bill Carlton somehow Bill sure as hell seem to be hide something and Bill the people he love they be all getting punish so that Bill do something to Peter what if Bill kill he Peter 's spirit would be furious it would want revenge it be possible Mr Carlton hey check it out Mr Carlton you need to come back come out of the water turn the boat around Baby what be wrong Sam Dean I do not expect to see you here so now you be on a first name basis what be you do here I bring you dinner I be sorry sweetheart I do not really have the time I hear about Bill Carlton be it true be something go on with the lake right now we do not know what the truth be but I think it might be well if you and lucas go on home Lucas hey what be it Lucas Lucas Lucas it be okay it be okay hey Lucas it be okay it be okay okay just so I be clear you see something attack Bill 's boat send Bill who be a very good swimmer by the way into the drink and you never see he again yeah that about sum it up and I be suppose to believe this even though I 've already sonar sweep that entire lake and what you be describe be impossible and you be not really wildlife service that be right I check the department 's never hear of you two see now we can explain that enough please the only reason you be breathe free air be one of Bill 's neighbor see he steer out that boat just before you do so we have a couple of option here I can arrest you for impersonate government official and hold you as material witness to Bill Carlton 's disappearance or we can chalk this all up to a bad day you get into your car you put this town in your rearview mirror and you do not ever darken my doorstep again Door number two sound good that be the one I would pick Baby what be you do up come on let us go to bed Green what Light 's green ah the interstate 's the other way I know but Dean this job I think it be over I be not so sure if bill murder Peter Sweeney and Peter 's spirit get its revenge case close the spirit should be at rest all right so what if we take off and this thing be not do what if we miss something what if more people get hurt but why would you think that because Lucas be really scared that be what this be about I just do not want to leave town till I know the kid 's okay who be you and what have you do with my brother Shut up be you sure about this it be pretty late man Lucas Lucas Lucas can you tell I no it do not make any sense I be go crazy no you be not tell I what happen everything I hear I think I hear there be this voice what do it say it say it say come

would not have access to this it be the cockpit voice recorder for united britannia flight 2485 it be one of ours Maydayé take off from here crash about 200 mile south now they be say mechanical failure Cabin depressurize somehow nobody know why over 100 people on board only seven get out alive Pilot be one his name be chuck lambert he be a good friend of mine Chuck be uh well he be pretty broken up about it like it be his fault you do not think it be no I do not Jerry we be go to need passenger manifest hum a list of survivor all right and huh any way we can take a look at the wreckage the other stuff be no problem but the wreckage fellas the ntsb have it lock down in an evidence warehouse no way I 've get that kind of clearance no problem hey hi you 've be in there forever you can not rush perfection Homeland security that be pretty illegal even for we yeah well it be something new you know People have not see it a thousand time all right so what do you get well there be definitely e v p on the cockpit voice recorder yeah listen no survivor what be that suppose to mean there be seven survivor get I so what be you think a haunted flight there be a long history of spirit and death omen on plane and ship like phantom traveler mm hmm or remember flight 401 right the one that crash the airline salvage some of this part put it in other plane then the spirit of the pilot and copilot haunt those flight right Yep maybe we get a similar deal all rigth so survivor which one do you want to talk to first Third on the list Max Jaffey why he for one he be from around here and two if anyone see anything weird he do what make you say that well I speak to his mother and she tell I where to find he I do not understand I already speak with homeland security right some new information have come up so if you could just answer a couple question just before the plane go down do you notice anything unusual like what strange light weird noise maybe voice no nothing Mr Joffey Jaffey Jaffey you check yourself in here right can I ask why I be a little stressed I survive a plane crash and that be what terrify you that be what you be afraid of I I do not want to talk about this anymore I think maybe you do see something up there we need to know what no no I be delusional see thing he be see thing it be okay then just tell we what you think you see please there be this man and uh he have these eye these uh black eye and I see he I think I see he what he open the emergency exit but that be that be impossible right I mean I look it up there be something like two ton of pressure on that door yeah this man huh do he seem to appear and disappear rapidly it would look something like a mirage what be you nut he be a passenger he be sit right in front of I say here we be George Phelps seat 20c Hmm Man I do not care how strong you be even yoke up on pcp or something no way you can open up an emergency door during a flight not if you be human but maybe this guy George be something else some kind of creature maybe in human form do that look like a creature 's lair to you this be your late husband yes that be my george and you say he be a dentist Mm hmm he be head to a convention in Denver do you know that he be petrify to fly for he to go like that how long be you marry 13 year in all that time do you ever notice anything strange about he anything out of the ordinary well uh he have acid reflux if that be what you mean I mean it go without say it just do not make any sense a middle aged dentist with an ulcer be not exactly evil personify you know what we need to do be get inside that ntsb warehouse check out the wreckage okay but if we be go to go that route we would well look the part I look like one of the blue brother no you do not you look more like a seventh grader at his first dance I hate this thing hey you want into that warehouse or not what be that it be an e M F Meter read electromagnetic frequency yeah I know what an e M F Meter be but why do that one look like a bust up walkman that be what I make it out of it be homemade yeah I can see that check out emergency door handle what be this stuff one way to find out Homeland security what one team of you guy be not enough what be you talk about two of your buddy go inside not five minute ago these monkey suit do come in handy listen Chuck it be like get back on a horse only in this case a little twin engine not even a horse more like a pony I will be right there with you too anytime you feel like you do not want the wheel I will take over look Chuck we do not have to do this today I be not try to rush you no the the waiting be bad okay they be fill up the tank then we go Huh this stuff be cover in sulfur you be sure take a look for yourself you effin ' piece of if you fellow will excuse I I have an idiot to fire Hmm here be not too many thing that leave behind a sulfuric residue demonic possession it would explain how a mortal man would have the strength to open up an emergency hatch if the guy be possess it be possible this go way beyond float over a bed or barf pea soup what mean it be one thing to possess a person but to use they to take down an entire airplane you ever hear of something like this before never I be ready let us do this how you feel I feel great you will be back fly jumbo before you know it I hope so how long we be up Huh almost 40 minute wow Time really do fly so every religion in every world culture have the concept of demon and demonic possession right I mean christian native american hindu you name it yeah but none of they describe anything like this well that be not exactly true you see accord to japanese belief certain demon be behind certain disaster both natural and man make one cause earthquake another cause disease and this one cause plane crash all right so what we have a demonthat be evolve with the time and find a way to ratchet up the body count yeah you know who know how many plane it be bring

More than that they practically liquefy any sign of a struggle maybe somebody do it to he Nope besides the daughter he be all alone what be the official causeof death Doc 's not sure he be think massive stroke maybe an aneurysm something burst up in there that be for sure what do you mean intense cerebral bleeding this guy have more blood his skull than anyone I 've ever see but the eye what would cause something like that capillary can burst see a lot of bloodshot eye with stroke victim yeah you ever see explode eyeball that be a first for I but hey I be not the doctor think we could take a look atthat police report you know for our paper I be not really suppose to show you might not be one of ours might just be some freak medical thing how many time in dad 's long and varied career have it actually be a freak medical thing and not some sign of an awful supernatural death uh almost never exactly all right let us go talk to the daughter feel like we be underdressed you must be Donna right yeah hi uh we be really sorry thank you I be sam this be dean we work with your dad you do yeah this whole thing I mean a stroke I do not think she really want to talk about this right now it be okay I be okay be there ever any symptom dizziness migraine no that be because it be not a stroke Lily do not say that what I be sorry she be just upset no it happen because of I Sweetie it do not Lily why would you saysomethe like that right before he die I say it you say what Bloody Mary three time in the bathroom mirror she take his eye that be what she do that be not why dad die this be not your fault I think your sister 's right lily there be no way it could have be Bloody Mary your dad do not say it do he no I do not think so Sam the Bloody Mary legend dad ever find any evidence that it be a real thing not that I know of I mean everywhere else all over the country kid will play Bloody Mary and as far as we know nobody die from it hey well maybe everywhere it be just a story but here it be actually happen the place where the legend begin but accord to the legend the person who say the person who say you know what get it but here Shoemaker get it instead yeah right never hear anything like that before still the guy do die right in front of the mirror and the daughter 's right the way the legend go you know who scratch your eye out it be worth check into what be you doingup here we we have to go to the bathroom who be you like we say downstair we work with Donna 's dad he be a day trader or something he work by himself no I know I mean and those weird question downstairs what be that so you tell I what be go on or I start scream all right all right we think something happen to Donna 's dad yeah a stroke that be not the sign of a typical stroke we think it might be something else like what honestly we do not know yet but we do not want it to happen to anyone else that be the truth so if you be go to scream go right ahead who be you cop something like that I will tell you what here if you think of anything you or your friend notice anything strange out of the ordinary just give we a call all right say Bloody Mary really be haunt this town there be go to be some sort of proof a local woman who die nasty yeah but a legend this wide spread it be hard I mean there be like 50 version of who she actually be one story say she be a witch another say she be a mutilated bride there be a lot more what be we suppose to be look for every version 's get thingsin common it be always a woman name Mary and she always die in front of a mirror so we 've get to search local newspaper public record as far back as they go see if we can find a Mary who fit the bill well that sound annoying no it will not be so bad as long as we I take it back this will be very annoying I be not sure they be cop or detective or something whoever they be they be cute Jill you do not think so yeah okay they be cute but still do you think something could have happenedto Donna 's dad Maybe Lily be right maybe Bloody Mary get he very funny wait I be sorry be that fear I hear in your voice no Charlie I be walk to the bathroom mirror right now Jill quit it oh no I can not help myself I be go to say it Bloody Mary Bloody Mary Bloody Mary Jill Jill you be such a freak I will call you tomorrow you do it you kill that boy why Sam why have you let I fall asleep 'cause I be an awesome brother so what do you dream about lollipop and candy cane yeah sure you find anything oh besides a whole new level of frustration no I 've look at everything a few local woman a Laura and a Catherine commit suicide in front of a mirror and a giant mirror fall on a guy name dave but uh no Mary maybe we just have not find it yet I 've also be search for strange death in the area you know eyeball bleeding that sort of thing there be nothing Whatever be happen here maybe it just be not Mary hello and they find she on the bathroom floor and her her eye they be go I be sorry and she say it I hear she say it but it could not be because of that I be insane right no you be not insane God that make I feel so much bad look we think something be happen here something that can not be explain and we be go to stop it but we could use your help what do you tell Jill 's mom I just say I need some time alone with Jill 's picture and thing Great I hate lie to her this be for the great good hit the light what be you guy look for we will let you know as soon as we find it hey night vision Thanks Perfect do I look like Paris Hilton so I do not get it I mean the first victim do not summon Mary and the second victim do how be she choose they beat I I want to know why Jill say it in the first place it be just a joke Somebody 's go to say it again it be just a matter of time hey there be a black light in the trunk right Gary Bryman you know who that be no so Gary Bryman be an 8 year old boy two year ago he be kill in a hit and run the car be describe as a black toyota camry but nobody get the plate or see the driver oh my god what Jill drive that car we need to get back to your friend Donna 's house Linda shoemaker why be you ask I this look we be sorry but it be important yeah Linda 's my mom okay and she overdose on sleep pill it be an accident and that be it I think you should leave Donna just listen get out of my house oh my god do you really think her dad could have kill her mom maybe I think I should stick around all right whatever you do do not believe I I will not say it wait wait wait you be do a nationwide search Yep the ncic the FBI database any mary in the country who die in front of a mirror be good enough for I but if she be haunt the town she should have die in the town I be tell you there be nothing local I check so unless you 've gota well idea why Mary 's choose a victim it seem like there be a pattern I know I be think the same thing with mr Shoemaker and Jill 's hit and run both have secret where people die right there be a lot of folklore about mirror that they reveal or your lie or your secret that they be a true reflection of your soul which be why it be bad luck to break they right right yeah so maybe if you 've get a secret I mean like a really nasty one where someone die then mary see it and punish you for it whether you summon she or not take a look at this look like the same handprint her name be Mary Worthington an unsolved murder in Fort Wayne Indiana I be on the job for 35 year detective for most of that now everybody pack it in with a few loose end but the Mary Worthington murder that one still get I what exactly happen you boy say you be reporter we know Mary be 19 live by herself we know she win a few beauty contest dream of get out of Indiana be an actress and we know the night of march 29th someone break into her apartment and murder her cut out her eyeswith a knife that be right see sir when we ask you what happen we want to know what you think happen Technically I be not suppose to have a copy of this now see that there t r e yeah I think Mary be try to spell out the name of her killer you know who it be not for sure but there be a local man a surgeon Trevor Sampson and I think he cut she up good now why would he do something like that her diary mention a man she be see she call he by his initial t well her last entry she be go to tell to his wife about their affair but how do you know it be Sampson who kill she it be hard to say but the way her eye be cut out it be almost professional but you could never prove it no no print no witness he be meticulous be he still alive Nope if you ask I Mary spend she last living moment try to expose this guy 's secret but she never could where be she bury she be not she be cremate what about that mirror it be not in evidence lockup somewhere be it no it be return to Mary 's family a long time ago you have the name of her family by any chance I mean you bring these stranger into my house and they ask I thing like that they be only try to help please Donna you have to believe I what about bloody mary please I know it sound crazy Crazy do not even begin to cover it I mean it be one thing for my sister to believe this crap she be 12 but you think about the way your dad die okay and the way Jill die okay so Bloody Mary no Bloody Mary Bloody Mary see nothing happen why would you do that oh my god there really be something wrong with you element that lose electron become positive ion which be small than other atom of the same element therefore the ionic radius be small than the atomic radius Charlie Charlie Charlie stop it what be wrong just calm down Charlie Aah let I go Charlie oh really ah that be too bad Mr Worthington I would have pay a lot for that mirror okay well maybe next time all right thank so so that be Mary 's brother the mirror be in the family for year until he sell it one week ago to a store call estate antique a store in Toledo so wherever the mirror go that be where Mary go her spirit 's definitely tie up with it somehow be not there an old superstition that say mirror can capture spirit yeah there be when someone would die in a house people would cover up the mirror so the ghost would not get trap this Mary die in front of the mirror and it draw in her spirit yeah but how could she move through 100 different mirror I do not know but if the mirror be the source I say we find it and smash it yeah I do not know maybe hello Charlie hey hey it be okay you can open up your eye Charlie it be okay all right now listen you be go to stay right here on this bed you be not go to look at glass or anything else that have a reflection okay as long as you do that she can not get you but I can not keep that up forever I be go to die be not I no no not anytime soon all right Charlie we need to know what happen we be in the bathroom Donna say it that be not what we be talk about something happen do not it in your life a secret where someone got hurt can you tell we about it I have this boyfriend I love he but he kind of scare I too you know and one night at his house we get in this fight then I break up with he and he get upset and he say he need I and he love I and he say charlie if you walk out that door right now I be go to kill myself and you know what I say I say go ahead and I leave how could I say that how could I leave he like that I just I do not believe he you know I should have her boyfriend kill himself that be not really Charlie 's fault you know as well as I do spirit do not exactly see shade of gray Dean Charlie have a secret someone die that be good enough for Mary I guess you know I 've be think it might not be enough to just smash that mirror why what do you mean Mary 's hard to pin down right and she move around from mirror to mirror so who be to say that she be not go to just keep hide in they forever so maybe we should try to pin she down you know summon she to her mirror and then smash it well how do you know that be go to work I do not I be not for sure well who be gonnasummon her I will she will come after I all right you know what that be it this be about Jessica be not it you think that be your dirty little secret that you kill she somehow Sam this have get to stop man I mean the nightmare and and call her name out in the middle of the night it be go to kill you now listen to I it be not your fault if you want to blame

Zach as well as he know you they be in St Louis we be go I be sorry about your buddy okay but this do not sound like our kind of problem it be our problem they be my friend St Louis be 400 mile behind we Sam oh my god Sam well if it be not little Becky you know what you can do with that little Becky crap I get your e mail I do not think that you would come here Dean old brother hi hi we be here to

be your folk they live in Paris for half the year so they be on their way home now for the trial do you guy want a beer or something hey no thank so tell we what happen well um Zach have come home and he find Emily tie to a chair and she be beat up and bloody and she be not breathe and so he he call 911 and the police they show up and and they arrest he but the thing be the only way that Zach could have kill Emily be if he be in two place at the same time the police they have a video it be from the security tape from across the street and it show Zach come home at 10 30 now Emily be kill just after that but I swear he be here with I have a few beer until at least after midnight you know maybe we could see the crime scene Zach 's house we could why what could you do well I not much but Dean 's a cop a detective actually really where Bisbee Arizona but I be off duty now you guy it be so nice to offer but I just I do not know Beck look I know Zach do not do this now we have to find a way to prove that he be innocent okay I be go to go get the key oh yeah man you be a real straight shooter with your friend look Zach and Becky need our help I just do not think this be our kind of problem two place at once we 've look into less you be sure this be okay yeah I be an officer of the law Beck you wanna wait outside no I wanna help tell we what else the police say well there be no sign of a break in they say that Emily let her attacker in and the lawyer be already talk about a plea bargaining look Beck if Zach do not do this it mean someone else do any idea who um there be something about a week before somebody break in here and steal some clothe Zach 's clothe and the police they do not think it be anything I mean we be not that far from downtown I mean sometimes people get rob you know that use to be the sweetest dog what happen he just change do you remember when he change I guess around the time of the murder so the neighbor 's dog go psycho right around the time Zach 's girlfriend be kill animal can have a sharp sense of the paranormal maybe Fido see something so you think maybe this be our kind of problem no probably not but we should look at the security tape just to make sure yeah yeah so the tape the security footage think maybe your lawyer could get their hand on it I just do not have that kind of jurisdiction I 've already get it I do not want to say something in front of the cop I um I steal it off the lawyer 's desk I just have to see it for myself all right why do they always have to send you because I be the good I know that be why I want you to stay home it be just Kansas city I will be home tomorrow night and make it up to you here he come 22 04 that be just after 10 00 you say time of death be about 10 30 our lawyer hire some kind of video expert he say the tape 's authentic it be not tamper with hey Beck can we take those beer now oh sure hey uh maybe some sandwich too what do you think this be hooter I wish what be it check this out maybe it be just a camera flare that be not like any camera flare I 've ever see a lot of culture believe that a photograph can catch a glimpse of the soul right remember that dog that be freak out maybe he see this thing maybe this be some kind of dark double of Zach 's something that look like he but be not he like a doppelganger that would sure explain how he be two place at once Honey it be I Client cancel at the last minute I call why do not you answer Lindsay Lindsay Lindsay oh it be okay Lindsay it be I please do not hurt I any more leave I alone all right what be we do here at 5 30 in the morning I realize something the videotape show the killer go in but not come out so he come out the back door right so there should be a trail to follow a trail the police would never pursue 'cause they think the killer never leave they catch your friend Zach inside still do not know what we be do here at 5 30 in the morning blood Somebody come this way maybe the trail end I do not see anything over here what happen he try to kill his wife tie she up and beat her really I use to see he go to work in the morning he would wave say hello he seem like such a nice guy hey remember when I say this be not our kind of problem yeah definitely our kind of problem what do you find out I talk to the patrolman who be first on the scene he hear this guy Alex 's story apparently the dude be drive home from a business trip when his wife be attack so he be two place at once exactly then he see himself in the house Police think he be a nut job two dark double attack love one in exactly the same way could be the same thing do it too shapeshifter something that can make itself look like anyone every culture in the world have a shapeshifter lore legend of creature who can transform themselves into animal or other man right skinwalker werewolf we 've get two attack within block of each other I be guess we get a shapeshifter problem in the neighborhood let I ask you this in all this shapeshifter lore can any of they fly not that I know of I pick up a trail here someone run out of the back of this building head off this way just like your friend 's house yeah and just like at Zach 's house the trail suddenly end whatever it be just disappear well there be another way to go down I bet this run right by Zach 's house too the shapeshifter could be use the sewer system to get around I think you be right look at this oh be this from his victim you know I just have a sick thought when the shapeshifter change shape maybe it shed that be sick well one thing I learn from

burn the bone and put he down after execution Jacob Karns be lay to rest in old north cemetery in an unmarked grave Super okay so we know it be Jacob Karns but we still do not know where he will manifest next or why I will take a wild guess about why I think your friend Lori have something to do with this you 've be hold out on I this college thing be awesome this be not really my experience let I guess library study straight as what a geek do you do your homework yeah it be bug I how be the hookman tie with Lori I think I come up with something 1932 clergyman arrest for murder 1967 seminarian hold in hippie rampage there be a pattern here in both case the suspect be a man of religion who openly preach against immorality and then find himself want for killing he claim be the work of an invisible force killing carry out get this with a sharp instrument what be the connection to Lori a man of religion who openly preach against immorality except this time instead of save the whole town he be just try to save his only daughter Reverend Sorenson do you think he be summon the spirit maybe or you know how a poltergeist can haunt a person instead of a place the spirit latch onto the reverend 's repress emotion feed off they without the reverend ever even know it either way you should keep an eye on Lori tonight what about you I be go to go see if I can find that unmarked grave here we go that be it next time I get to watch the cute girl 's house hello preacher I see you from upstairs what be you do here I be keep an eye on the place I be worried about I yeah sorry no it be cool I already call the cop no seriously I think you be sweet which be probably why you should run away from I as fast as you can why would you say that it be like I be curse or something People around I keep die I think I know how you feel Goodbye preacher no one will talk to I anymore except you the sheriff think I be a suspect and you know what my dad will say pave faith what do he know about faith I hear you guy fight before he be see a woman a married woman I just find out she come to our church with her husband I know her kid and he talk to I about religion about morality it be

I do you sure it be the spirit of Jacob Karns Sure as hell look like he and that be not all I do not think the spirit be latch onto the reverend yeah the guy would not send the hookman after himself I think it be latch onto Lori last night she find out that her father be have an affair with a married woman so what so she be upset about it she be upset about the immorality of it she be raise to believe that if you do something wrong you get punish okay so she be conflict and the spirit of preacher Karns be latch onto her emotion and do the punishing for her Right Rich come on too strong

everything in that coffin do you get the hook the hook it be the murder weapon and in a way it be part of he so like the bone the hook be a source of his power so if we find the hook both we stop the hookman here be something I think Logbook Iowa state penitentiary Karns Jacob personal affect disposition thereof do it mention the hook upon execution all earthly item shall be remand to the prisoner 's house of worship St Barnabas church be not that where Lori 's father preach yeah where Lori live that be why the hookman 's be haunt reverend and reverend ' daughter for the past 200 year yeah but

see the local the way they treat this couple fatten they up like a christmas turkey the last meal give to sacrificial victim yeah I be think a ritual sacrifice to appease some pagan god so a god

thats nice I have a right to protest this man be a fraud and hes bilk all these people out of their hard earn money I take it hes not part of the flock but when people see something they cant explain theres controversy come on Sam a faith healer maybe its time to have a little faith Dean you know what Ive get faith in Reality Knowing whats really go on how can you be a skeptic with the thing we see everyday we see they we know theyre real but if you know evils out there how can you not believe goods out there too because ive see what evil do to good people maybe God work in mysterious way maybe he do I think you just turn I around on the subject yeah Im sure Im Dean this be Sam Layla so if youre not a believer then why be you here apparently my brother here believe enough for the both of we Come on Layla Its about to start well I bet you she can work in some mysterious way yeah peace love and trust all over come on what be you do let sit here were sit up

some immoral unspeakable act but I say to you God be watch God reward the good and he punish the corrupt who do the healing here friend the Lord who guide I in choose who to heal by help I see into peoples heart yeah or into their wallet you think so young man sorry no no Dont be just watch what you say around a blind man weve get real sharp ear what your name son Dean Dean I wantI want you

dont look Dean do we really have to look this one in the mouth why cant we just be thankful that the guy save your life and move on because I cant shake this feeling thats why what feel when I be heal I justI feel wrong I feel cold and for a second I see someone this uh this old man and Im tell you Sam it be a spirit but if there be something there Dean I think I wouldve see it too I mean ive be see an awful lot of thing lately well excuse I psychic wonder but youre just go to need a little faith on this one Sam Ive been hunt long enough to trust a feeling like this yeah alright so

so often around Roy when do they start the miracle wake up one morning stone blind doctor figure out I have cancer tell I I have maybe a month so uh we pray for a miracle now I be weak but I tell Sue Ann you just keep right on pray  I go into a coma doctor say I wouldnt wake up but I do and the cancer be go if it wasnt for these eye no one would believe Id ever have it and suddenly you could heal people I discover it afterward yes gods bless I in many way and his flock just swell overnight and this be just the beginning can I ask you one last question of course you can why why I out of all the sick people why save I well like I say before the Lord guide I I look into your heart and you just stand out from all the rest what do you see in my heart a young man with an important purpose a job to do and it isnt finish Im tell you he seem healthy swam every day didnt smoke so a heart attack just kind of seem well bizarre and you say he be run right before he collapse yeah yeah he be freak out he say that something be uh be after he do he say what well thin air be what I mean it wasnt anything alright thank hey buddy your uh your clocks bust oh yeah we uh cant get it workin just freeze at 4 17 be that the same time Marshall die howd you know Dean hey hey how you feel I feel good Cured I guess what be you do here you know my mom she want to talk to the reverend Layla yes Im here again well Im sorry but Roy be rest and he wont be see anyone else right now Sue Ann please this be our sixth time hes get to see us Roy be well aware of Laylas situation and he very much want to help just as soon as the Lord allow have faith Mrs Rourke why be you still even here you get what you want Mom stop no layla this be too much weve be to every single service if Roy would stop choose these stranger over you Strangers who dont even believe I just cant pray any hard Layla whats wrong I have this thing Its a brain tumor Its inoperable in six month the doctor say Im sorry Its okay no it isnt why do you deserve to live more than my daughter whatd you find out Im sorry sorry about what Marshall Hall die at 4 17 the exact time I be heal yeah so I put together a list of everyone roys heal six people over the past year and I cross check they with the local obit every time someone be heal someone else die and each time the victim die of the same symptom LeGrange be heal at the time Someones heal of cancer someone else die of cancer somehow LeGrangehes trade a life for another hello wait wait wait so Marshall Hall die to save I Dean the guy probably wouldve die anyway and someone else wouldve be heal you never shouldve bring I here Dean I be just try to save your life but Sam some guy be dead now because of I I didnt know pray with I friend the thing I dont understand be how be Roy do it Hows he trade a life for a life oh hes not do it something else be do it for he what do you mean the old man I see on stage I didnt wanna believe it but deep down I know it what be you talk about theres only one thing that can give and take life like that were deal with a reaper you really think its the Grim Reaper Angel of death collect your soul the whole deal no no no not the Reaper a reaper theres reaper lore in pretty much every culture on Earth go by a hundred different name Its possible that theres more than one of em but you say you see a dude in a suit well what do you think he shouldve be workin the whole black robe thing you say it yourself that the clock stop right Reapers stop time and you can only see em when theyre comin at you which be why I could see it and you couldnt theres nothing else it could be Sam the question be hows Roy controllin the damn thing that cross what there be this cross I notice it in the church tent I know I have see it before here a tarot it make sense I mean tarot date back to the early christian era right when some priest be still use magic and a few of they veer into the dark stuff Necromancy and how to push death away how to cause it so Roy be use black magic to bind the reaper if he be hes ride the whirlwind Its like put a dog leash on a great White Ok then we stop Roy how you know how wait what the hell be you talk about Dean we cant kill Roy Sam the guy play God hes decide who live and who die thats a monster in my book no were not go to kill a human being Dean we do that were no well than he be okay so we cant kill Roy we cant kill death any bright idea college boy okay uh if Roy be use some kind of black spell on the reaper weve get to figure out what it be and how to break it if Roy be use a spell there might be a spell book see if you can find it hurry up too the service start in fifteen minute ill try to stall Roy Roy LeGrange be a fraud hes no healer amen brother you keep up the good word what do you get roys choose victim he see as immoral and I think I know whos next on his list remember that protestor the guy in the parking lot yeah yeah ill find he but you cant let Roy heal anyone alright Layla Layla Rourke come up here child oh man Layla listen to I you cant go up there why not Weve wait for month you cant let Roy heal you I dont understand I mean Roy heal you didnt he why wouldnt I at least let he try because if you do something bad be go to happen I cant explain I just need you to believe I Layla please Im sorry Layla Layla help pray with I friend I hope youre ready I be help help I please where be it Its right there alright come on Fire hey tents on fire everybody get out of here no no please Please dont stop please Reverend please please friend if youd all just leave the tent in an orderly fashion then we can figure out whats go on out there I do it I stop Roy David I think its okay no Dean it didnt work the reapers still comin Im tellin you Im tellin you it must not have work Roy must not be control this thing well then who the hell be Sue Ann help help I help I get ya I get ya thank God I just dont understand after everything weve do for you after Roy heal you Were very very disappointed Dean you can let he go Im not go to press charge the Lord will deal with he as he see fit we catch you around here again son well put the fear of God in you understand yes sir Fear of God get it layla why would you do that Dean when it couldve be my only chance Hes not a healer he heal you I know it doesnt seem fair and I wish I could explain but Roy be not the answer Im sorry Goodbye Dean I wish you luck I really do same to you you deserve it a lot more than I private session tonight no interruption I give you my word Ill heal your daughter thank you Reverend God bless you so Roy really believe I dont think he have any idea what his wifes do well I find this hide in their library Its ancient write by a priest who go dark side theres a bind spell in here for trap a reaper must be a hell of a spell yeah Youve get to build a black altar with seriously dark stuff Bones human blood to cross the line like that that preachers wife black magic murder Evil Desperate her husband be die shed have do anything to save he she be use the bind spell to keep the reaper away from Roy cheat death literally yeah but roys alive so whys she still use the spell right to force the reaper to kill people she think be immoral may God save we from half the people who think theyre do gods work Weve get to break that bind spell Dean you know Sue Ann have a coptic cross like this and when she drop it the reaper back off so you think weve get to find the cross or destroy the altar maybe both whatever we do we well do it soon roys heal Layla tonight Thats laylas car shes already here yeah Dean you know if Roy would have pick Layla instead of I shed be heal right now Dean dont and if shes not heal tonight shes go to die in a couple month Whats happen to she be horrible but what be you go to do let somebody else die to save she you say

not sure they even really look see there be a time this town be not too friendly to all its citizen thank you truck Keeps come up do not it I be think you hear of the fly dutchman yeah a ghost ship infuse with the captain 's evil spirit it be basically a part of he so what if we be deal with the same thing a phantom truck who be the extension of some bastard ghost re enact past crime the victim

here it'just you and I and not you I and sam which would be easy it be not easy look no forget it it be fine keep it strictly business I forget you do that do what oh whenever we get what be the word close anywhere in the neighborhood of emotional vulnerability you back off or make some joke or find any way to shut the door on I oh that be hilarious see I be not the one who take that big final door and slam it behind I and I be not the one who take the key and bury it be we do with this metaphor all I be say be I be totally up front with you back then and you nail I with it the guy I be hope might be in my future tell I he professionally pop ghost those be not the word I use and he have to leave too work with his father I do all I could think be if you want out fine but do not tell I

hey I try I tell you who I really be it be a big first for I why would you tell I I do not know I guess I could not lie to you Dean when you tell I that story it scare the hell out of I I think you be nuts dangerous even actually maybe I be look for a reason to walk away in my work I see some horrible thing thing that can not be explain I deal with they but work thing out with you I be a scary one all right hmm well usually thgs get work out when you really want they to yeah but I be still really involved in my dad 's work no more excuse okay from you or I okay yeah you be kid and he be with I where be you last night you do not make it back to the motel Nope I be guess you guy work thing out we will be work thing out when we be 90 so what happen every bone crush internal organ turn to pudde the cop be all stumped but it be almost like something run he over something like a truck Yep track Nope what be the mayor do here anyway he own the property buy it a few week ago yeah but he be white do not fit the pattern Killings do not happen up on the road that do not fit either thank I be try to find some link between those killing in the ' 60 and what be go on now there be not a lot about it in the paper not surprising probably minimal police work deal back then equal justice under the law be not too literal around here yeah Sam okay the courthouse record show that mr and mrs Mayor buy an abandon property the previous owner be the dorian family for like 150 year Dorian yeah do not you say the dorian family use to own this paper along with most everything else around here real pillar of the town right right that be interesting what this cyrus dorian he vanish in april of ' 63 the case be investigate but never solve it be the time the string of murder be go on well I pull a bunch of paper up on the dorian place it must 've be in bad shape when the mayor buy it why be that the first thing he do be bulldoze the place Mayor todd knock down the dorianlace it be a big deal one of the old local house leave it make the front page you get a date uh the 3rd of last month Mayor todd bulldoze the dorian family home on the 3rd the first killing be the very next day Dean maybe you could throw a couple shot in that you do not see who be drive the truck it seem to be no one everything be move so fast and then it be just go why do not it kill we whatever be control the truck want you afraid first Mrs Robinson cassie say that your husband see the truck before he die Mom Hmm Martin be under a lot of stress you can not be sure about what he be see well after tonight I think we can be reasonably sure that he be see a truck what happen tonight you and cassie be mark okay your daughter could die so if you know something now would be a really good time to tell we about it Dean yes yes he say he see a truck do he know who it belong to he think he do who be that Cyrus a man name cyrus be this cyrus Cyrus dorian die more than 40 year ago how do you know he die mrs Robinson the paper say he go miss how do you know he die we be all very young I date cyrus a while I be also see martin in secret of course 'cause interracial couple do not go over too well then when I break it off with cyrus and when he find out about martin I do not know he change his hatred his hatred be frightening the string of murder there be rumor people of color disappear into some kind oa truck nothing be ever do Martin and martin and I we be go to be marry in that little church near here but last minute we decide to elope 'cause we do not want all the attention and cyrus the day we set for the wedding be the day someone set fire to the church there be a child 's choir practice in there they all die do the attack stop after that no there be one more one night that truck come for martin Cyrus beat he something terrible but martin you see martin get loose and he start hit cyrus and he just keep hit he and hit he why do not you call the cop this be 40 year ago he call on his friend clayton solme and jimmy anderson and they put cyrus ' body into the truck and then roll it into the swamp at the edge of his land and all three of they keep that secret all these year and now all three be go so be mayor todd now he say that you of all people would know that he be not a racist why would he say that he be a good man he be a young deputy back then investigate cyrus 's disappearance once he figure out what martin and the other have do he he do nothing because he also know what cyrus have do why do not you tell I I think I be protect they and now there be no one leave to protect yes there be oh my life be so simple just school exam paper on polycentric cultural norm so I guess I save you from a boring existence occasionally I miss boring so this killer truck I miss conversation that do not start with this killer truck ah all right well this cyrus guy evil on a level that infect even his truck when he die the swamp become his tomb and his spirit be dormant for 40 year so what wake it up the construction on his house or the destructi Right demolition or remodeling can awaken spirit make they restless like that theater in illinois yeah and the guy who tear down the family homestead harold todd be the same guy that keep cyrus 's murder quiet and unsolved so now his spirit be awaken and out for blood I guess who know what ghost be think anyway you know we be go to have to dredge

it be like she never exist Dude come on man we get our dig in and this one be a bust Alright for all we know those hellhound boy make up the whole thing I say we find ourselves a bar and some beer and leave the legend to the local what the that be all you 've get that be weak that be bush league this be it the point of no return why do I have to go in there because Jill you choose dare instead of truth which mean you either have to grab a jar from Mordecai 's cellar and bring it back or or you can make out with I I will take the homicidal ghost thank would you ever take that dare Hell no hello hello be anybody there ok ok ok ok Aahhhhhhh a couple of cop say that a poor girl hang herself in the house Suicide yeah but she be a straight student with a full ride to UT too it just do not make

it be in the where do it go boy come on no it be what the hell be this symbol it be bug the hell out of I this whole damn job 's bug I I think the legend say Mordecai only go after chick it do well that explain why it go after you but why I Hilarious the legend also say that he hang himself but you see those slit wrist yeah what be up with that and the axe too I mean ghost be usually pretty strict right follow the same pattern over and over but his mood keep change exactly I be tell you where the story go wait a minute what someone add a post on hellhound site listen to this they say Murdocai Murdock be really a satanist who chop up his victim with an axe before slit his own wrist now he be emprisone in the house for eternity what be the hell be this go I do not know but I think I might just figure out where all start hey Craig remember we guy I be really not in the mood to answer anymore of your question ok oh do not worry do not worry we be just here to buy an album that be all you know I could not figure out what that symbol be and then and then I realize that it do not mean anything it be a logo from Blue Oyster Cult so tell I Craig you be into BOC or just scare the hell out of people why do not you tell we about that house without lie through your ass this time alright hum my cousin Dana be on break from TCU I guess we be just bored look for something to do so I show she this abandonne dump I find we think that it would be funny if it may look like it be haunt so we paint symbol on the wall some from some album some from some of Dana 's theology text book then we find out that this guy Murdock use to live there so we we make up some story to go along with that so they tell people who tell other people and then these two guy put it on their stupid website everything just take on a life its own I mean I think it be funny at first but another girl 's dead it be just a joke you know I mean none of this be real we make the whole thing up I swear alright if none of this be real how the hell do you explain Mordecai hey I be back hey where be you oh I go out so I think I might have a theory about what be go on oh yeah yeah what if Mordecai be a tulpa a tulpa yeah uh that be tibetan think form yeah I know I know what a tulpa be why do not you get dress I be go to grap something to eat thank you hey what be your problem nothing I be fine yeah yeah alright so keep go what about these tulpa ok uh so there be an incident in Tibet in 1915 a group of monk visualize a golem in their head they meditate on it so hard they bring the thing to life out of thin air so that be 20 monk imagine what 10 thousand web surfer can do I mean Craig start up a story about Mordecai then it spread go on line now there be countless people all believe in the bastard ok wait a sec you be try to tell I that just because people believe in Mordecai he be real do not know maybe People believe in Santa Claus why be not I getting hook up every Christmas 'cause you be a bad person and cause of this that be a tibetan spirit sigil on the wall of the house Craig say they be paint symbol from a theology text book I bet you they painteed this without know what it be now that sigil have be use for century concentrate meditative thought like a magnify glass so people on the hellhound website stare at the symbol think about Mordecai I mean I do not know but it might be enough to bring a tulpa to life it would explain why it keep change right as the legend change people think different thing so Mordecai himself change like a game or a telephone that would also explain why the rock salt do not work yeah cause he be not a traditionnal spirit per say yeah ok so why do not we just lock up the spirit sidereal thingy off the wall and off the website well it be not that simple you see once tulpa be create they take on the life of their own great all right so if he really be a thought form how the hell be we suppose to kill an idea oh it be not go to be easy and these guy be not help we check out their home page since they post the video the number of hit quadruple in the last day alone I have an idea come on where be we go we need to find a copy

you need one think I be okay thank wow so you boy really want to know about this colt yes sir it be just a story a legend really well I think it be never really believe it until I read Daniel 's letter back in 1835 when Halley 's comet be overhead the same night those man die at the alamo they say Samuel Colt make a gun a special gun he make it for a hunter a man like we only on horseback the story go he make 13 bullet this hunter use the gun a half dozen time before he disappear the gun along with he somehow Daniel get his hand on it they say they say this gun can kill anything kill anything like supernatural anything like the demon yeah the demon ever since I pick up its trail I 've be look for a way to destroy that thing find the gun we may have it Dean there be more hey hey hey shh I be here to help you boy run Dad Dad Dad they will not follow they will wait till tonight once a vampire get your scent it be for life what the hell do we do now you got to find the near funeral home it should not be take this long I should go help Dean 's get it Sammy yeah I do not think I ever tell you this but the day you be bear you know what I do no I put 100 buck into a savings account for you I do the same thing for your brother it be a college fund and every month I would put in another 100 until anyway my point be Sam that this be never the life that I want for you then why have you get so mad when I leave you got to understand something after your mother pass all I see be evil everywhere and all I care about be keep you boy alive I want you prepare ready so somewhere along the line I uh I stop be your father and I I become your drill sergeant so when you say you want to go away to school all I could think about my only thought be that you be go to be alone Vulnerable Sammy it just it never occur to I what you want I just could not accept the fact that you and I we be just different what we be not different not anymore with what happen to mom and Jess we probably have a lot more in common than just about anyone I guess you be right son hey dad what happen to that college fund spend it on the ammo Whoo Man there be some heavy security to protect a bunch of dead guy do you get it you know what to do car trouble let I give you a lift take you back to my place I will pass I usually draw the line at necrophilia I do not normally get this friendly till the second date you know we could have some fun I always like to make new friend oh sorry I never really stay with a chick that long definitely not eternity Damn it barely even sting give it time sweetheart that arrow 's soak in dead man 's blood it be like poison to you be not it load she up I will take care of this one toss this on the fire Saffron skunk cabbage and trillium it will block our scent and hers until we be ready Stuff stink well that be the idea dust your clothe with the ashe and you will stand a chance of not be detect you sure they will come after her Yeah Vampires mate for life she mean more to the leader than the gun but the blood sickness be go to wear off soon so you do not have a lot of time half hour ought to do it and then I want you out of the area as fast as you can but you can not take care of they all yourself I will have she and the colt but after we be go to meet up right use the gun together right you be leave again be not you you still want to go after the demon alone you know I do not get you you can not treat we like this like what like child you be my child I be try to keep you safe Dad all due respect but that be a bunch of crap excuse I you know what Sammy and I have be hunt Hell you send we on a few hunting trip yourself you can not be that worried about keep we safe it be not the same thing Dean then what be it why

out of this fight in one piece your mother 's death it almost kill I I can not watch my child die too I will not what happen if you die Dad what happen if you die and we could have do something about

kill anything though my eye could see I still be a blind man though my mind could think I still be a mad man I hear the voice when I be dream I have these nightmare and sometimes they come true carry on my wayward son you two be all I 've get but I guess we be strong as a family we go after this damn thing together yes Sir yes Sir do not you cry no more good morning can I help you I kinda I need

at the crime scene with blood on his hand jury have convict for less yeah but I mean where be the murder weapon what be the motive you talk about reasonable doubt Diana do you have reasonable doubt we keep lean on these guy one of they will tumble and do not forget about St Louis I be tell you this Dean guy be our guy I know Tony Giles be a friend of yours yeah he be he be a good friend I know you want to clean this mess up quick but come on Tony know a lot of criminal type maybe we just criminal type he be a defense lawyer for god sake of course he know criminal type okay all right let us get

Crouse I be with the public defender 's office I be your lawyer oh thank god I be save can I uh steal a pen from you and some paper sure well the police have not find a weapon yet so that be good but uh they get your print and literally blood on your hand and with your police record Mr Winchester what be you do I think it be an anagram A what an anagram same letter different word could you do I a favor see if you recognize any of these word you know local name place anything like that do you understand how serious these charge be I be handcuff to a table yeah I get it humor I take a quick look well s U p I do not know about that but Ashland be be a street name it be not far from here Street Let us start with where you be the night that Anthony Giles die can you get in to see my brother Mr Winchester you could be face the death penalty here hey thank for the law review Matlock but if you want to help I I need you to see my brother I hope that be meaningful but I would like to discuss your case now sure thing Matlock you two really be brother be not you now as you know the D A might be interested in we need you with the other one this should be nice Counselor your boy decide to confess Mr Winchester I would advise against that strongly talk directly into the camera Start by state your name for the record my name be Dean Winchester I be an aquarius I enjoy sunset long walk on the beach and frisky woman and I do not kill anyone but I know who do or rather what do of course it can not be for sure because our investigation be interrupt but our working theory be that we be look for some kind of vengeful spirit excuse I you know Casper the bloodthirsty ghost Tony Giles see it I will bet you cash money Karen do too see the interesting thing be the word it leave behind for some reason it be try to tell we something but communicate across a veil be not easy and sometimes the spirit they get thing jumble you remember Redrum same concept you know it could be word fragment other time it be anagram see at first we think this be a name Dana shulp but now we think it be a street Ashland whatever be go on I be bet it start there you arrogant bastard Tony and Karen be good people and you be make joke I be not joke Ponch you murder they in cold blood just like that girl in St Louis oh yeah that be not I either that be a shapeshifter creature that only look like I Pete that be enough you ask for the truth lock this guy off what the hell where be he how do he do it the fire escape 's way over what these two guy Hilts and Mcqueen what be that hilt be Steve Mcqueen 's character in the Great Escape can we make this quick I be really tired it be be a long day you know with your partner assault I and all I want to know more about that stuff you be talk about early Time life mystery of the unknown look it up let us pretend for the moment you be not entirely insane what would one of these thing be do here vengeful spirit well they be create by violent death and then they come back for a reason usually a nasty one like revenge on the people that hurt they and uh these spirit they be capable of kill people where do you get that I do not know it be not there before you 've see it have not you the spirit how do you know because Karen have the same bruise on her wrist I be willing to bet that if you look at Giles ' autopsy photo he be get they too it be get something to do with the spirit I do not know what I know you think you be go crazy but let us skip that part shall we because the last two people who see this thing die pretty soon after you hear I you think I be go to die you need to go to Sam he will help you be give your brother up go to the first motel list in the yellow page look for Jim Rockford that be how we find each other when we be separate you can arrest he if you want or you can let he save your life these show up after you see it yeah I guess all right you be go to have to tell I exactly what you see you know I must be lose my mind you be a fugitive I should be arrest you all right well you know what you can arrest I later alright after you live through this but right now you got to talk to I okay okay Great now the spirit what do it look like she be um really pale and her throat be cut and her eye they be like this deep dark red it appear like she be try to talk to I but she could not it be just a lot of blood you know what here I 've be research every girl who have ever die or go missing from Ashland street how do you get those those be from crime scene and book photo you have your job I have mine here I need you to look through these tell I if you recognize anyone this be her I be sure of it Claire Becker 28 year old disappear about eight or nine month ago but I do not even know she why would she come after I well before her death she be arrest twice for deal heroin you ever work narcotic yeah Pete and I do before homicide you ever bust she not that I remember say she be last see enter 2911 Ashland street Police search the place do not find anything guess we get to check it out ourselves see if we can find her body what well we get to salt and burn her bone it be the only way to put her spirit to rest of course it be so what exactly be we look for I will let you know when we find it Sam hey I be here what be it what happen Claire where she be here do she attack you no no she be just like reach out to I she be over there by the window here help I move this all right I get it our little mystery word now the extra letter make sense what be that spirit and certain remain give off electromagnetic frequency so if Claire 's body be here that would indicate that yeah well that be the theory yeah yeah there be definitely something in there you know this be bother I well you be dig up a corpse no not that that be uh pretty par for the course actually then what it be just I mean no vengeful spirit I 've ever tussle with want to be waste so why the hell would Claire lead we to her remain do not make any sense all right here give I your hand her wrist yeah they would be bruise just like your that necklace mean something to you I 've see it before it be rare it be custom make over on Carson street I have one just like it Pete give it to I now this all make perfect sense I be sorry yeah you see Claire be not a vengeful spirit she be a death oman excuse I Claire 's not kill anyone she be try to warn they sometimes spirit they do not want vengeance they want justice which be why she lead we here in the first place she want we to know who her killer be Detective how much do you know about your partner oh my god what about a year ago some heroin go miss from lockup obviously it be a cop we never find out who do it but whoever do it would need someone to fence their product somebody like a heroin dealer somebody like Claire so I be be extradite to St Louis huh you just decide to transfer I yourself 800 mile at 2 00 in the morning this can not be good all right thank what be it Pete just leave the precinct with Dean what he say the prisoner have to be transfer and he just take he Dispatch have be call but he will not answer the radio radio he take a county vehicle yeah then it should have a lojack you just get to get it turn on Pee break so soon so soon I think you might want to get your prostate check Son of a bitch hey I be cool in the van you go do what you get to do you be a cocky son of a bitch you think those people in St Louis be go to buy that crap you be paddle here be the thing you be not go to make it to St Louis you be go to die try to escape wait wait let us talk about this you do not want to do something that you be go to regret or maybe you do Pete put the gun down Diana how have you find I I know about Claire I do not know what you be talk about put the gun down no I do not think so you be fast pretty sure I be fast why be you do this I do not do anything Diana it be a little late for that it be not my fault Claire be go to turn I in I have no choice and Tony Karen same thing Tony scrub the money then he get skittish and then he want to come clean I be sure he tell Karen everything it be a mess I have to clean it up I just panic how many more people be go to die over this pete there be a way out this Dean kid be a friggin ' gift we can pin the whole thing on he okay no trial nothing just one more dead scumbag hey no one will question it Diana please I still love you thank you thank you then why do not you buy I another necklace you ass do not do it do not do it you be do all right not really the death omen Claire what happen to she now it should be over she should be at rest so uh what now officer Pete do confess to I he screw up both your case royally I would say there be a good chance that we can get

let us see what we can see there be not a single mention of a Dana shulp anywhere there be not a D shulp or any other kind of freaking shulp great what do you got nothing no Dana Shulps have ever live or die in Baltimore in the last 50 year at least so what now well I think I be pretty close to crack Giles ' password maybe there be something in his personal file you know by close you mean 30 minute

remark you Sam 's story match Dean 's to the last detail yeah well these guy be good I will give they that if we do not get Sam to flip we have nothing but a lot of circumstantial evidence we get Dean at the crime scene with blood on his hand jury have convict for less yeah but I mean where be the murder weapon what be the motive you talk about reasonable doubt Diana do you have reasonable doubt we keep lean on these guy one of they will tumble and do not forget about St Louis I be tell you this Dean guy be our guy I know Tony Giles be a friend of yours yeah he be he be a good friend I know you want to clean this mess up quick but come on Tony know a lot of criminal type maybe we just criminal type he be a defense lawyer for god sake of course he know criminal type okay all right let us get

Crouse I be with the public defender 's office I be your lawyer oh thank god I be save can I uh steal a pen from you and some paper sure well the police have not find a weapon yet so that be good but uh they get your print and literally blood on your hand and with your police record Mr Winchester what be you do I think it be an anagram A what an anagram same letter different word could you do I a favor see if you recognize any of these word you know local name place anything like that do you understand how serious these charge be I be handcuff to a table yeah I get it humor I take a quick look well s U p I do not know about that but Ashland be be a street name it be not far from here Street Let us start with where you be the night that Anthony Giles die can you get in to see my brother Mr Winchester you could be face the death penalty here hey thank for the law review Matlock but if you want to help I I need you to see my brother I hope that be meaningful but I would like to discuss your case now sure thing Matlock you two really be brother be not you now as you know the D A might be interested in we need you with the other one this should be nice Counselor your boy decide to confess Mr Winchester I would advise against that strongly talk directly into the camera Start by state your name for the record my name be Dean Winchester I be an aquarius I enjoy sunset long walk on the beach and frisky woman and I do not kill anyone but I know who do or rather what do of course it can not be for sure because our investigation be interrupt but our working theory be that we be look for some kind of vengeful spirit excuse I you know Casper the bloodthirsty ghost Tony Giles see it I will bet you cash money Karen do too see the interesting thing be the word it leave behind for some reason it be try to tell we something but communicate across a veil be not easy and sometimes the spirit they get thing jumble you remember Redrum same concept you know it could be word fragment other time it be anagram see at first we think this be a name Dana shulp but now we think it be a street Ashland whatever be go on I be bet it start there you arrogant bastard Tony and Karen be good people and you be make joke I be not joke Ponch you murder they in cold blood just like that girl in St Louis oh yeah that be not I either that be a shapeshifter creature that only look like I Pete that be enough you ask for the truth lock this guy off what the hell where be he how do he do it the fire escape 's way over what these two guy Hilts and Mcqueen what be that hilt be Steve Mcqueen 's character in the Great Escape can we make this quick I be really tired it be be a long day you know with your partner assault I and all I want to know more about that stuff you be talk about early Time life mystery of the unknown look it up let us pretend for the moment you be not entirely insane what would one of these thing be do here vengeful spirit well they be create by violent death and then they come back for a reason usually a nasty one like revenge on the people that hurt they and uh these spirit they be capable of kill people where do you get that I do not know it be not there before you 've see it have not you the spirit how do you know because Karen have the same bruise on her wrist I be willing to bet that if you look at Giles ' autopsy photo he be get they too it be get something to do with the spirit I do not know what I know you think you be go crazy but let us skip that part shall we because the last two people who see this thing die pretty soon after you hear I you think I be go to die you need to go to Sam he will help you be give your brother up go to the first motel list in the yellow page look for Jim Rockford that be how we find each other when we be separate you can arrest he if you want or you can let he save your life these show up after you see it yeah I guess all right you be go to have to tell I exactly what you see you know I must be lose my mind you be a fugitive I should be arrest you all right well you know what you can arrest I later alright after you live through this but right now you got to talk to I okay okay Great now the spirit what do it look like she be um really pale and her throat be cut and her eye they be like this deep dark red it appear like she be try to talk to I but she could not it be just a lot of blood you know what here I 've be research every girl who have ever die or go missing from Ashland street how do you get those those be from crime scene and book photo you have your job I have mine here I need you to look through these tell I if you recognize anyone this be her I be sure of it Claire Becker 28 year old disappear about eight or nine month ago but I do not even know she why would she come after I well before her death she be arrest twice for deal heroin you ever work narcotic yeah Pete and I do before homicide you ever bust she not that I remember say she be last see enter 2911 Ashland street Police search the place do not find anything guess we get to check it out ourselves see if we can find her body what well we get to salt and burn her bone it be the only way to put her spirit to rest of course it be so what exactly be we look for I will let you know when we find it Sam hey I be here what be it what happen Claire where she be here do she attack you no no she be just like reach out to I she be over there by the window here help I move this all right I get it our little mystery word now the extra letter make sense what be that spirit and certain remain give off electromagnetic frequency so if Claire 's body be here that would indicate that yeah well that be the theory yeah yeah there be definitely something in there you know this be bother I well you be dig up a corpse no not that that be uh pretty par for the course actually then what it be just I mean no vengeful spirit I 've ever tussle with want to be waste so why the hell would Claire lead we to her remain do not make any sense all right here give I your hand her wrist yeah they would be bruise just like your that necklace mean something to you I 've see it before it be rare it be custom make over on Carson street I have one just like it Pete give it to I now this all make perfect sense I be sorry yeah you see Claire be not a vengeful spirit she be a death oman excuse I Claire 's not kill anyone she be try to warn they sometimes spirit they do not want vengeance they want justice which be why she lead we here in the first place she want we to know who her killer be Detective how much do you know about your partner oh my god what about a year ago some heroin go miss from lockup obviously it be a cop we never find out who do it but whoever do it would need someone to fence their product somebody like a heroin dealer somebody like Claire so I be be extradite to St Louis huh you just decide to transfer I yourself 800 mile at 2 00 in the morning this can not be good all right thank what be it Pete just leave the precinct with Dean what he say the prisoner have to be transfer and he just take he Dispatch have be call but he will not answer the radio radio he take a county vehicle yeah then it should have a lojack you just get to get it turn on Pee break so soon so soon I think you might want to get your prostate check Son of a bitch hey I be cool in the van you go do what you get to do you be a cocky son of a bitch you think those people in St Louis be go to buy that crap you be paddle here be the thing you be not go to make it to St Louis you be go to die try to escape wait wait let us talk about this you do not want to do something that you be go to regret or maybe you do Pete put the gun down Diana how have you find I I know about Claire I do not know what you be talk about put the gun down no I do not think so you be fast pretty sure I be fast why be you do this I do not do anything Diana it be a little late for that it be not my fault Claire be go to turn I in I have no choice and Tony Karen same thing Tony scrub the money then he get skittish and then he want to come clean I be sure he tell Karen everything it be a mess I have to clean it up I just panic how many more people be go to die over this pete there be a way out this Dean kid be a friggin ' gift we can pin the whole thing on he okay no trial nothing just one more dead scumbag hey no one will question it Diana please I still love you thank you thank you then why do not you buy I another necklace you ass do not do it do not do it you be do all right not really the death omen Claire what happen to she now it should be over she should be at rest so uh what now officer Pete do confess to I he screw up both your case royally I would say there be a good chance that we can get your case dismiss you could take care of that for we I hope so but the St Louis murder charge that be another story I I can not help you unless I just happen to turn my back and you walk away I could tell they that the suspect escape wait be you sure yeah she be sure Sam you could lose your job over something like that look I just want you guy out there do what you do well trust I I will sleep

the werewolf who bite you sever the bloodline might have a cure Meaning who know it be worth a shot we do not even know where to look the puppy that bite she it could be anyone anywhere could have be year ago no I do not think so Madison when be you mug please it be important all right just answer the question about a month ago do you see the guy no he grab I from behind do he bite you how do you

and it be probably the most powerful plant in pagan lore Pagan lore yeah see they use meadowsweet for human sacrifice it be kind of like a chum for their god god be draw to it and they would stop by and snack on whatever be the near human why would somebody be use that for christmas wreath it be not as crazy as it sound dean I mean pretty much every christmas tradition be pagan Christmas be jesus ' birthday no jesus ' birthday be probably in the fall it be actually the winter solstice festival that be co opt by the church and rename christmas but the yule log the tree even santa 's red suit that be all remnant of pagan worship how do you know that what be you go to tell I next Easter bunny 's jewish so you think we be deal with a pagan god yeah probably hold nickar god of the winter

give you in return Lap dance hopefully mild weather like no snow in the middle of december in the middle of michigan for instance do we know how to kill it yet no bobby 's work on that right now we

unfortunate what do you care the raising of samhain be one of the 66 seal so this be about your buddy lucifer Lucifer be no friend of ours it be just an expression Lucifer can not rise the breaking of the seal must be prevent at all cost okay Great now that you be here why do not you tell we where the witch be we will gank she everybody go home we be not omniscient this witch be very powerful she be cloak even to our method okay well we already know who she be so if we work together enough of this who be you and why should I care this be uriel he be what you might call a specialist what kind of a specialist what be you go to do you both of you you need to leave this town immediately why because we be about to destroy it so this be your plan you be go to smack the whole freakin ' town we be out of time this witch have to die the seal must be save there be a thousand people here 1 214 and you be willing to kill they all this be not the first time I 've purify a city look I understand this be regrettable regrettable we have to hold the line too many seal have break already so you screw the pooch on some seal and now this town have to pay the price it be the life of 1 000 against the life of 6 billion there be a big picture here right 'cause uh you be big picture kind of guy Lucifer can not rise he do and hell rise with he be that something that you be willing to risk we will stop this witch before she summon anyone your seal will not be break and no one have to die we be waste time with these mud monkey I be sorry but we have our order no you can not do this you you be angel I mean be not you suppose to you be suppose to show mercy say who we have no choice of course you have a choice I mean come on what you 've never never question a crap order what be you both just a couple of hammer look even if you can not understand it have faith the plan be just how can you even say that because it come from heaven that make it just it must be nice to be so sure of yourself tell I something when your father give you an order do not you obey sorry boy it look like the plan have change you think you can stop we no but if you be go to smite this whole town then you be go to have to smite we with it because we be not leave you go to the trouble of bust I out of hell I figure I be worth something to the man upstairs you want to waste I go ahead see how he dig that I will drag you out of here myself yeah but you will have to kill I then we be back to the same problem I mean come on you be go to wipe out a whole town for one little witch sound to I like you be compensate for something we can do this we will find that witch we will stop the summon Castiel I will not let these enough I suggest you move quickly Astronaut what nothing I think they would be different who the angel yeah well I try to tell you I just I mean I think they would be righteous well they be righteous I mean that be kind of the problem of course there be nothing more dangerous than some a hole who think he be on a holy mission but I mean this be god and heaven this be what I 've be pray to look man I know you be into the whole god thing and jesus on a tortilla and stuff like that but just because there be a couple of bad apple do not mean the whole barrel be rotten I mean for all we know god hate these jerk do not give up on the stuff be all I be say Babe ruth be a dick but baseball 's still a beautiful game be you go to figure out a way to find this witch or be you just go to sit there finger your bone you know how much heat it would take to char a bone like this dean no a lot I mean more than a fire or some kitchen oven okay betty crocker what do that mean it mean we make a stop so tracy use a kiln to char the bone what be the big deal that hex bag turn up in our room not after we talk to tracy after we talk to the teacher oh my god those be all from child I be guess he be not save they for the dog the decision be be make by a mud monkey you should not call they that oh that be what they be savage just plumb on two leg you be close to blasphemy there be a reason we be send to save he he have potential he may succeed here at any rate it be out of our hand it do not have to be and what would you suggest that we drag dean winchester out of here then we blow this insignificant pinprick off the map you know our true order be you prepared to disobey thank you he be go to kill I Ugh that sick son of a bitch I mean do you see what he be do do you hear he how sloppy his incantation be my brother always be a little dim he be go to make I the

use to wear mask to hide from he so I give it a shot you give it a shot how be we go to find this mook where would you go to raise all the dark force of the night a cemetery yeah so this demon 's pretty powerful yeah it might take more than the usual weapon Sam no you be not use your psychic whatever but do not even think about it Ruby 's knife be enough why because the angel say so for one you say they be fanatic they happen to be right about this I do not know do not seem they be right about much forget the angel okay you say yourself these power it be like play with fire please Dude I

chucklehead you be the michael sword what you think you could actually kill lucifer you simper wad of insecurity and self loathing no you be just a human dean and not much of one what do you mean I be the sword you be michael 's weapon or rather his receptacle I be a vessel you be the vessel Michael 's vessel how why why I because you be choose it be a great honor dean oh yeah yeah life as an angel

crossfire huh a million 5 10 probably more if lucifer go unchecked you know how many die all of they he will roast the planet alive there be a reason you be tell I this instead of just nab I you need my consent Michael need my say so to ride around in my skin unfortunately yes there be get to be another way there be no other way there must be a battle Michael must defeat the serpent it be write yeah maybe but on the other hand eat I the answer be no how about this your friend bobby we know he be gravely injure say yes and we will heal he say no he will never walk again no then how about we

for that he betray I punish I just as he be punish you after all how could god stand idly by while that man break into your home and butcher your family in their bed there be only two rational answer nick either he be sadistic or he simply do not care you be angry you have every right to be angry I be angry too that be why I want to find he hold he accountable for his action just because he create we do not mean he can toy with we like plaything if I help you can you bring back my family I be sorry I can not but I can give you the next good thing God do this to you nick and I can give you

go to talk about what be be up with you lately or not or not you want to hear about any other weird one Lester Finch pull his record this gentleman use to weigh 400 pound or so till he get a gastric bypass which bring down his weight but then for some reason last night he decide to go on a Twinkie binge so he die from a Twinkie binge after he blow out the band around his stomach he fill it up till it burst when he could no long swallow he start jam the cake down his gullet with a with a toilet brush like he be ramrodde a cannon so what do you make of it I would say that it be a very peculiar thing to do so this guy be not mark by Cupid but his death be definitely suspicious I just go through the police blotter and count he that be eight suicide since Wednesday and 19 od way out of the average if there be a pattern here it be not just love it be big than we think see you in 10 I know what you be damn it I could smell you what do a demon get to do with this anyway believe I I get no idea you okay I will be all right let us crack she open what be the bad that could happen what be that it be a human soul it be start to make sense now what about that make sense when do you start eat exactly my hunger it be a clue actually for what this town be not suffer from some love go wrong effect it be suffer from hunger starvation to be exact specifically Famine Famine as in the horseman Great that be great I think famine mean starvation like as in you know food yes absolutely but not just food everyone seem to be starve for something Sex attention drug love well that explain the puppy lover that Cupid shoot up right the cherub make they crave love and then famine come and make they rabid for it but what about you since when do angel secretly hunger for white castle it be my vessel Jimmy his appetite for red meat have be touch by famine 's effect so famine just roll into town and everybody go crazy and then will come famine ride on a black steed he will ride into the land of plenty and great will be the horseman 's hunger for he be hunger his hunger will seep out and poison the air Hungry Famine 's hungry he must devour the soul of his victim that be what be in the briefcase the Twinkie dude 's soul Lucifer have send his demon to care for famine to feed he make certain he will be ready ready for what to march across the land Hungry Sam Winchester the vessel he be here where at the hospital we fight but he get away I get this off he Good yes after lunch now where be it sorry the one who love cream cake so much where be his soul I be sorry no the Winchester take the case from I he have the knife I lose it but I be hungry I will get another I will not be 10 minute Hungry now Delicious Famine this whole town be just go to eat drink and screw itself to death we should stop it that be a great idea how how do you stop the last one War get his mojo from this ring after we cut it off he tuck tail and run and everybody that be affect it be like they wake up out of a dream you think famine 's get one too I know he do let us track he down and get to chop what be you the hamburglar I 've develop a taste for beef well have you even try to stop it I can stop anytime I want whatever Sam let us roll I can not I can not go what do you mean I think it get to I I think I be hungry for it for what you know Demon blood you got to be kid I get he out of here Beam he anywhere but here it will not work he be infect the hunger be go to travel with he what do we do you go cut that bastard 's finger off you hear he before you go you well you well
