and you think that the orderly who die be connect to all of this arlo be on the ledge of b building prying loose a weather vane I believe it be this weather vane so why do not you just confine all the other patient to their room well I 've be tempt but this kind of cooperative behavior it be unheard of with these illness besides I want you to get a look at that thing before we tear it down again it be all right kevin they be just here to talk to tess he be very protective of her she be his only friend in here really it be okay I will just let she know you be come great we see some of the picture

hospital some of they be station on the submarine all right we will just talk really softly they take my crayon away but they be too late yeah why be that because it be go to get build anyway they want I to get in touch with they that be why they put the plan in my head uh now be we talk about the doctor here in the hospital or the doctor under the sea neither we be talk about the people who take I stupid so the people who take you they want the patient here to build that tower they will do anything to get I back they like I do you ask the other patient for help tess I do not like talk to they they be crazy be arlo crazy I never think he be but maybe crazy be catch so my first day back and what be go on nothing much just a bunch of mental patient build a machine to contact the future well that be what tess think anyway she also think there be doctor station under the pacific ocean listen to a radio broadcast of her private conversation could be some kind of collective hysteria do not explain this guy arlo though he be a middle aged hospital orderly whose wife just leave he it could have be suicide lose his nerve at the last minute try to grab the weather vane I wonder how long it be since marco get some sun you know I be think we could bring he down to have a look at that thing they be build a road trip for marco he go outside tom but you know we could have some sunblock handy it would be something though huh if she could actually do it contact the future tess be right maybe crazy be catch he be dictate a letter I do not know what happen he just grab his head and start screaming wait outside now hold still hold still thank thank you they be get bad jordan they be come more often too you okay I be fine I do not get it I do not get why these attack keep come

forget they be still out there I never forget and neither do the man I be pay to find they okay but if I be you I would not want to be in the same time zone as that kid if you two meet up again it might just finish you off I have my reason now get some rest okay all right big day tomorrow in break news a revelation about the origin of the 4400 in his newly publish autobiography former real estate mogul jordan collier claim that the 4400 be abduct by human being from the future the book contain copy of classified government memoranda that collier say prove his claim the document be say to come from an anonymous source within the national threat assessment command accord to colly the 4400 be return to avert a catastrophe that threaten the survival of mankind why do not you tell I collier charge that the government have have this information for more than a year but have keep it secret in an effort to avert a public panic the government claim that the document be purely speculative and have be quote out of context do not care who take they do not care who send they back the government should have keep they behind bar do not you hear what the man say they be here to save the world what do you expect he to say he be one of they you be awful quiet I deal in fact and the fact be I 've get to flesh the before lunch you will be happy to hear that mr collier 's anonymous source be anonymous no more agent hubbard will be prosecute to the full extent of the law so what about colly guy buy national secret on the black market I be sure we would all like to see collier charge with treason but it be unlikely I doubt we will be able to trace the payment directly to he now as for this so call 4400 center round the clock surveillance be in effect until further notice I want picture of everyone who come within a hundred yard of that place be it true that collier 's filing for tax exempt status apparently he be turn the 4400 into some kind of religion more like a cult well cult be what the big congregation call the little congregation cult religion whatever what be he base it on have you read this thing collier claim that he can unlock the 4400 within anybody so he expect a guy punch a clock in pittsburgh to believe he have some kind of latent superpower most of the 4400 do not even have those kind of ability not yet anyway no but if you think there be a chance that you have an ability lock away inside you you sound like you be ready to sign up no but I would not blame anyone for be curious we keep tell the public that biologically the 4400 be not any different than the rest of we they have not be alter genetically neurologically as far as we can tell but if colly think people be just go to sign their life and their life saving over to some metaphysical pyramid scheme then he be in for a rude awakening welcome to the center my name 's devon what be yours kyle nice to meet you kyle can I sign you up for a tour uh thank I be just look for my cousin shawn farrell I be sorry mr farrell 's not available right now could you tell he kyle 's look for he he do live here right I be afraid policy prohibit I from discuss our membership I be not look for a discussion I just want to say hi to my cousin if you would leave your name I be not leave anything what be the problem here there be no problem then tell shawn I be here if he do not want to see I fine but that be up to he right would you lower your voice please look I 've get nothing against you personally I hope the pod people return your body to you someday if it be all the same I will find shawn myself this way sir get your hand off I you have to leave you guy do not tell I this thing be so big it be not not yesterday and those do not look like patient to I they be not dr clayton I know what you be go to say we be fall behind we will make up the time this afternoon so be the entire hospital work on this thing it be the only way to get it do excuse I uh randy winston we need a little help here dr cho 's back there with the satellite dish okay so first the patient now the staff if this be some kind of mass hysteria it be spread who do daddy love mommy and isabelle yes he do you know what he see when he look at you a beautiful baby yes he do but mommy see much more than that and you know why because you communicate with mommy but you never talk to daddy so how about it anything you want to say to daddy huh because I be listen okay then guess I be leave to muddle along all alone richard we get to get a copy of that book I want to read it you and I both but I check in town they will not have any copy till tomorrow I do not know about you but I kind of got use to the idea we would never know where she come from well if we go to the future at least we come back with a souvenir the people who take we they make all this happen right they see to it that we get isabelle they must have something in mind for her I have something in mind for she too a normal life sound good but we leave normal behind a long time ago this be outrageous we have work to finish here important work the doctor want to work tell they to make their round no one be stop they from take care of their patient but the courtyard and the tower be off limit you get it get it man look at the size of that thing would not mind have one of those in my backyard huh road trip 's over wait in the car so yesterday a few patient be compel to work on this thing and today it be the entire hospital if we get tess out of here do you think this compulsion will fade I do not know it be worth a try be not it all right I get you it be okay I be not a bad person I be not no no no one be say you be tess then why be you go to stick wire in my brain I promise tess no one 's go to hurt you that be

cell shawn it look nothing like your apartment goddammit jordan since when do you decide who I see and talk to this be about your cousin be not it so you do know he be here I know he be rude and

friend look a year ago you come to I look for a new life your old one in shambles kyle friend or not be part of that old life so what do you want I to do you just want I to cut he loose and forget he exist he be no different than your mother your brother or your friend nikki do not you they do not understand what it be we be try to accomplish here you know maybe I do not either well then I suggest you pack your bag and leave so what happen next time you start scream out in pain do what be right for you shawn I will take care of myself I just get the full medical workup on tess let I guess physically normal across the board you can say this for the 4400 they be consistent tess draw a picture of a a tower or a monument yeah or a beacon and the people around her drop everything and start build it well they can not help themselves they have to work it be like ant come here the queen secrete a chemical tell the other ant what to do the drone do not stop work until the job be do do not matter if one of they die or if a storm come and wash away the anthill they just keep work unless you take the queen away let us hope our drone respond the same way right so the future send back a schizophrenic queen ant with a blueprint for what some interstellar walkie talkie let us see what tess can tell we we would just well not get too close because if your theory 's right anyone who gets expose to she could be vulnerable all right I will talk to tess you check in with garrity at the hospital these friend of yours the one who take you what do you think they want to talk about they be so much smart than you it be not even funny yeah well yeah I do not doubt it I mean they figure out how to take you and how to send you back send I back be a mistake and they know it I be suppose to be there where exactly be there there be doctor there too they be nice all of they they be nice you remember where you be take we sleep a lot but not all the time we wear gray clothe there be a giant building the doctor wear shiny jacket I miss it so much go on I really like hear you talk about it our room have round window high doorway with arch in they the stone have write in they math symbol or something inscription jar of purplish metal and rod with stain tip these symbol tess what do they look like tess tess do you remember what the inscription say they be wait to hear from I I need to get in touch with they tess tess just wait tess just wait garrity why have not you be pick up your cellphone I be sorry it be be kind of crazy down here so be everything all right yeah fine we be just about do here do well the satellite dish be a bitch to hook up but we will get them come on people let us get those dish secure we do not have all day I just have the most unbelievable conversation with tess well it could not have be any more unbelievable than the one I just have with garrity can not say I see it that way no other way to see it that book be blasphemy well do not buy it if that be how you feel the third angel blow his trumpet and a great star fall from heaven burn like a torch revelation 8 10 I will take your word for it the day they come back be the beginning of the end time sound like you 've do a little more thinking on it than I have either remove the book from the store or my boy here will remove it for you like hell he will do you know what you be carry there woman it be just a book it be the doorway to hell that child yours that be my daughter abomination beget abomination richard what be go on we 've get to get out of here now these new guy you send we be no good park tell I he have experience with a welding torch experience at what start fire now our schedule 's in the toilet do either of you call the fire department time to go hurry richard hurry as of tonight abendson state hospital be officially under quarantine the patient will remain locked down hospital staff and affect ntac personnel will be confine to the site until we 've isolate the source of the compulsion that sound like a good plan but who be go to watch over they the last group we send be compromise within hour which be quite frankly a little disturbing if you think of this like an epidemic in the cdc we would call tess the sole disease vector you remove she you remove the urge to build except as far as we know none of those agent have any contact with tess so it be like the flu or any other airborne virus you catch it you can pass it on what be this thing suppose to be anyway my guess and I can not emphasize the word guess strongly enough be that tess be tell we the truth it be some kind of communication device to contact who the future the only way to find out be to let the patient finish build it that night on highland beach they be try to tell we something the conversation be cut short which be why we 've be stumble around in the dark this last year tess be the only 4400 who remember where she be take no claim to remember where she be take she be also the only paranoid schizophrenic and it sound to I like you two have be spend a little too much time around her well maybe I catch the bug too but uh I agree with they the quarantine order at the hospital remain in effect until further notice the guard will rotate shift to minimize their exposure so where do that leave we until we be sure the compulsion be not spread anymore you two be not go anywhere near that facility isabelle 's asleep rainy day come soon than expect do you think we lose they I be not ready to stop for pie just yet I get 1 200 here another 300 in my pocket I be carry two we be go to have to get those back window replace in the morning this should be enough to carry we through to montana what do eric say when you call he be a little surprised to hear from I but even back in quarantine he use to say how we 4400 should stick together yeah we do not have much choice back then though do we the bank will wire we our saving when we get there if thing get really bad we can sell these I put that ring on you forever guess you and isabelle be right we should have take off when we have the chance it be go to be a long night you want I to drive a shift get some sleep maia what be

reunion thing be go to be big huh we 've get 4400 come in from 27 different country three more maybe there have not be this many of we in the same place since quarantine what be happen since we leave town I mean suddenly it seem like everyone 's die to meet a real live 4400 yeah well what happen Jordan happen welcome to the revolution little lady huh he be go to die I see it he be go to die Sweetheart be you okay do you have a nightmare no I be awake and I see it tell we what you see that man we watch on tv once what man he Jordan collier someone be go to kill he YYETS Capture£ºjohnsonh sync£ºp0000000 s02e05 as far as this department know maia be not have vision anymore right well she be keep they secret from I and write everything down in a diary but I be not here to talk about my daughter we be here to talk about colly we could talk about he all you want but if I be colly I would be bring all my book back to the library if you know what I be mean the kid 's never wrong right look as far as I can tell maia have two kind of vision if she can see an event clearly enough in her head she can sometimes influence the course of the future but mostly her vision be abstract they be more like certainty Prophecies I guess you could call they now this be one of those and as far as I can tell they be never wrong well not yet anyway but nobody be make a concerted effort to stop one of they from happen so we could always offer colly a suite in the basement 24 hour surveillance and a food taster Sure we just tell the guy he need to stay isolated for what a week a year when it come to the prevention of future crime there be no time limit and everyone be a suspect I mean literally everyone so how to stop the inevitable from happen stop the inevitable be not that what we deal with every day I mean that be why the 4400 be send back right I like the can do attitude but I have to ask do we even want to save colly well he be kind of the bad guy maybe that be the way the future want it unless they give we this message as a way to stop collier 's death from happen Fascinating what an extraordinary gift you be clear on what we be tell you your daughter have quite a track record when it come to see the future her late vision involve my death I leave anything out no that about cover it Ntac be offer you all its resource that mean round the clock protection threat assessment and I be mean of course to isolate myself well that would be the safe move let us say I be willing to assume good faith on your part which give your exploitation of the 4400 to get to I be rather generous what you think we make this up I be not sure you be that creative but your plan do call for my total withdrawal from the public eye and cancellation of a celebration of the public interest in the 4400 that be be month in the planning our history with each other be what it be but this be real and denial be not a luxury you can afford thank you for the information I will keep it in mind Maia be never wrong whatever protection you can afford I I can afford myself pick up some of the reunion literature on your way out the foreign returnee ' story be particularly inspirational still come here every thursday huh Thought I might get lucky Lily what be you do here I be back in seattle I just want to thank you for help richard just a couple of phone call it be no big deal we be in a bad spot you do what you could it mean a lot well you really do not have to get I anything it be actually for heidi her birthday 's come up oh lily it be just a cool little handbag you do not have to tell she it be from I I do not want to mess with your life brian I be just try to say thank you okay you be look well lily I be glad thing be work out I can not talk to first key today there be too much go

talk to you outside kind of a bad day it be pretty crazy around here tell you he would blow we off what be up oh liv they be too embarrassed to come inside I can'T I can'T but I see what you can do we all do you can heal people listen it be not that simple I can not heal everyone I be not ask you to heal everyone just they you do not understand it be like it drain I I can do it for maybe one maybe one be well than none and who choose that one way you I I can not heal the world I be sorry what have I tell you Waste of time do not look at I like that Kyle hey you with we buddy what I think you be you know elsewhere no I be right here with you be just think relax I have not have one of those blackout in a couple of day I be hope that be all do yeah I do too but I still think you should tell your dad about it and get yourself check out you want to go with I to see the kill okay so we be ignore the whole blackout thing or pretty much they go on at 8 00 you should come the tsa be put a flag on ian dravitt and his know associate they will call we if anyone show up in seattle this whole dravitt thing be just colly 's late deal go south Collier have his name on the side of a skyscraper by the time he be 30 you pursue power that ruthlessly you pick up some enemy along the way so we find the one who seem most like john hinckley or sirhan sirhan and then do what follow he around for the rest of his natural life we could spend the next year look at collier 's move since he found the center the guy have a whole career before he got abduct or maybe it be come from someone who collier be never meet I mean if you hate the 4400 kill their figurehead 's a good way to make they suffer but what be we suppose to do the potential victim have refuse our help no one say stop the future be go to be easy Diana look at this his name be miles quinlan Claims collier bankrupt he then kick he out of the center live with his parent what nurse a persecution complex pretty much a poster boy for the lone gunman theory come on maia I 've name every guy I 've date for like the last five year be you tell I I do not have a future with any of they I would not worry about it seem like you meet a lot of boy yeah well that be the trouble I be tired of meet boy I want to meet a man you will when Aunt april just because I do not see it do not mean it be not go to happen oh that be probably mrs Bradshaw

from the hospital you look the same as you do now I be go so long but to I this feel like yesterday you want to talk about colly he use people up and leave they on the curb be that why you leave the center I do not leave they throw I out that be what happen when you run out of money they have all these different level they call they key right you make seventh key you be unlocked unlocked mean you 've get your own 4400 ability well that be the big prize only they set it up so no one ever get there there be mid level and side seminar you have to pass if you be not one of the 4400 each one cost first I eat up my saving then I cash out the equity in my house and they do not deliver soon as the first check bounce they tell I I would reach maximum potential and send I on my way be that why you apply for a handgun permit we run a vicap check on you this morning so I buy a gun so what I need to protect myself from colly yeah well I hope self defense be all you have in mind because if you be plan anything else we will be all over you the minute you approach the 4400 center you want something to be paranoid about think about that you be simplify the issue cancel the gala be no guarantee of my safety it be a start Jordan you just tell I there be a little girl out there who can see the future and she see you dead it be time to make yourself scarce and where do it stop do I stay away from the center I cut myself off from our work yeah if it mean stay alive I be not go to become a hermit that be not a win for we look the center be significantly safe than it seem half the people you see

claim that edwin mayuya a 38 year old nurse at mercy hospital murderer be responsible for a series of miraculous healing murderer over the past five month Murderer Murderer but if these claim prove true that be the man the one who kill your parent there be more I be bounce around in the shotgun seat and tyler here have get the gas pedal all the way through the floor hey we have 200 buck on that race and davis be 30 foot behind I and I can barely hear he scream not that way that be where the landmine be if I know he be serious maybe I would have pay attention yeah yeah well no one be go to follow we that way so we come in two minute before the pack and we split the money we buy like five keg of budweiser for the officer ' club get a load of this look just like it do back in the day like you tyler hard to believe 50 year go by we get the same guy same beer it be great to see you guy it be a shame it take milt die to make it happen it be hard to find excuse to get the whole gang together it be not exactly the whole gang be it there be always lee which one of you guy be go to tell I where he be Come on do it matter matter to I well last I hear he be in a V A Hospital outside of bakersfield in bad shape for a long time look everyone here feel terrible about what we do to you Huh be not that enough you be not go to get anything out of talk to lee I mean do yourself a favor just let it go I do not give a damn I do not care if he what be up you know your miracle healer turn out his real name be edwin musinga all his paper have be forge he be be want by the rwandan government since 1995 want for what atrocity he be a doctor during the uprising he be kill a whole bunch of people I be a pediatrician at a clinic in kigali I be a hutu but most of my patient be tutsi many of my friend as well that call my loyalty into question when the killing begin some man from the military come to my clinic and they say they want to broadcast it as a safehouse a place tutsi could come to be safe from the slaughter and they come by 3 00 the clinic be full every room every corridor all fill with frightened tutsi look to I as their protector the same soldier come back with militia at their side it be a setup do you at least try to stop they the radio report be claim the tutsis have kill our president the anger spread like virus I got infect too so basically you stand by and do nothing all over the city it be organize murder we never would have make it to safety you could have try easy tom let the man finish his story yes I could have try that be true I know that now they make I watch they kill they all I allow they to turn my clinic into a slaughterhouse but you do not murder anyone personally true but not much of a distinction I know what be go to happen I let it take place I be guilty my wife leave I I have not see she or my child since perhaps they will come to my execution your government 's push for extradition you should be on a plane right now but your ability complicate thing it would give I the chance to make amend but I could save an infant every day for the rest of my life and I would still deserve every one of my nightmare what be go on in there tom because if you be look to shut he down before he get his story out all that glaring be a great way to go about it that guy should be on his way to a tribunal instead we be serve he lunch downstairs oh what would you prefer it if we starve he I do not believe you be defend he I would never defend what he do but I would make an argument for what he can do now there be a reason the future send he back with this amazing ability but forgive I if I sound like I do not know you no no not this time no we be not talk about a criminal we be not even talk about a murderer we be talk about genocide Dian maybe the future do not have a problem with that but I do so if I do not believe that the world be well off with a bullet in this guy 's head I be advocate genocide no there be people in rwanda right now who have lose mother brother and child in that clinic and he stand by and he let it happen that be just like our government just like government all over the world they all know what be happen tom but nobody lift a finger to stop it yeah and that be wrong too and so be this we 've be work on blind faith for a year and a half assume these people know what they be do but enough be enough yeah we be save the future but we be leave justice behind be it something that you want to be a part of diana so shawn just show out of nowhere and all of a sudden I be suppose to drop all of my plan and head to some peace dinner we both know why he be turn up now right you do not have to be a shrink to piece it together his mentor daddy figure gets kill and he come crawl back

the press be all over this story will he even be safe on the street yeah a war criminal 's safety that be my big concern oh it have well be in exchange for protection edwin musinga have agree to continue come into our lab we be babysitte he in exchange for a chance to study what he can do this guy could advance genetic research by a hundred year it sound like a fair trade to I Mm hmm how long

fight extradition they be go to argue special circumstance so edwin get a pass and who know how many kid get a shot at a normal life no not as many as we would hope our lab can not even figure out how his ability work forget about replicate it and I just get his med eval it turn out he be in bad shape well he tell I he be anemic and he could not sleep no no it be bad than that this ability every time he rearrange a fetal chromosome he be damage his own so if he keep healing it be go to kill he listen if you do not want to talk about what you do I be not go to try to force you to but I

spinal irregularity on your mri if you keep heal maybe a year maybe less and if I stop oh well I mean if you stop heal then there be no reason for the state department to fight the extradition you will be hand back to the rwandan government who will have I try and sentence with all dispatch so either choice that I make lead to my death yes that be right it would seem my abductor have quite a perverse sense of humor I will of course continue to heal for as long as my body allow at least then my death will have a purpose other than vengeance you will have to be monitor by doctor from here on in they will try and slow your decline but you really should come with we because we have some of the good physician in the world on payroll Miss skouris if you be offer I a bed at ntac I be afraid

need I the way that you keep say that it do then it be go to have to work around I sometimes work around you we can do that Mary o'connell take 1972 very promising empath Robert field 1987 Genius with number and pattern recognition John gersten who be these people replacement potentially none of they make the slam dunk you would but I be ready to move this center forward with you or otherwise Jordan use to talk to I that way sometimes he be great at get I to see thing his way you you be not quite there yet your healing power make you unique Jordan know it I believe it I come here to work with you but you be ask I to work around you and that I can not do then you be go to have to spend some quality time with that list because I be leave I be sure you will not miss a beat though I know there be a huge demand for pattern recognition th th that be impossible Mortimer and falcone be wear state of the art biohazard gear that stuff 's engineer to withstand an anthrax attack they be dead marco obviously whatever she be release be a little crafty than the anthrax virus if it get through those suit that mean the antigen be operate on a subatomic level which basically make it unstoppable yeah pretty much Jean tell I mortimer and falcone scare she when they come into her room be it possible the release of this virus be connect to her emotional state yeah more than possible it be likely her medicine cabinet be basically a neon sign flash borderline personality disorder she be get cortisone cream for stress rashe an assortment of your fine psychopharmaceutical xanax prozac yeah we get it marco she be a wreck a wreck whose body act as a delivery system for the virus she be produce the same way flower release pollen what she be emit spore something like that look spore be just reproductive body release by a vascular system the human body be one big vascular system it run on blood flow yeah which can speed up or slow down depend on mood feeling right so when jean 's blood gets go when she be angry confused upset whatever a killer virus go airborne we be not far from her car now marco any advice on how to deal with her uh do not piss she off hey hi how be you lily good I hear um you be leave for a while that be fast anyway yeah I do not know how long I be go to be go what be you go to do for starter I be go to disappear for a while and then um I do not know who know I mean I do not have to work here to make people healthy so I guess I could go anywhere so you be just go to kind of roam the earth kung fu style I be not go to shave my head and wear a robe but something like that I guess well you could take these with you check out the return address stop off in gloucester massachusetts do a quick healing and then go on your way you know about the letter oh shawn they be everywhere yeah each one sad than the next it be too much to take almost it do give I an idea though but you know you be leave so we will talk it over when you get back no lily I mean like I say I do not know when that be go to be so please I would love to hear what you have to say all right well I be think I mean we be not a hospital and we be not a charity and still thousand of these request keep pour in every day I mean no wonder you feel overwhelmed we be not set up to handle it yes exactly that be why I 've get to get out of here what if we set up a foundation part of this place but separate hire a staff whose only job be to open these letter and find the needy case people that we can help that no one else can but that be still say no to thousand of people well that be right shawn but what if we can say yes to one I mean you heal one person a day every day that be a big job though decide who deserve it most well so you form a committee and you load it up with doctor and social worker and you oh well come on I mean it be your idea you should at least be there to help make it happen yeah I just take a job at human resource I think I could probably get you transfer do you find a body in there can not get close enough yet as soon as you can we need to retrieve it well she say she want to end it I guess we could send marco and his boy back down to the basement let them find a ripple effect on this one excuse I Baldwin I come close but I do not know jean I could not go through with it that be good nobody want you dead just tell I where you be no you can not help I the 4400 center can not help I but it do not matter I finally know where I be suppose to go tell I where I will meet you there you ever read the bible baldwin I go to sunday school I spend some time with it early today back at that motel the time be at hand that be revelation right but do you know what it mean I bet you do not see these blister they form on my hand do you get it I be not sure I do jean they be talk about I in that book you get family Jean what be you talk about go to they Hug they real tight I 've finally figure it out why they send I back I be part of their plan they want I to do this do what Purify humanity she be quote revelation never a good sign tom she be go from want to help want to stop all of this to believe she be the end of the world so what do she do she say they want she to do this right well that imply it be out of her hand Destiny she be give up responsibility yeah that be one way to deal with be a walk plague pretend the decision be out of your hand I do not think she want to even think about it anymore I think she just want it over well that be her mindset it still do not tell we where she be go she be on autopilot tom my good guess she do whatever she plan on do before the body started roll right cellphone ring Marco Today 's tuesday right it be wednesday marco my bad she be only get one thing write down for the day she be file her unemployment claim in downtown portland Son of a bitch I do not believe it be I dream or do you not tell I that chicago would win do you know what I bet 200 try my mother 's diamond engagement

the jump this be all just a test a foundation do not you think we have our hand full already it be one person a day once it be up and run it be not really go to eat into my time I think you be look for privacy you do this you be step into a white hot spotlight yes but it be on my term be good publicity not too hard to get off the ground we could get some huge name for that filtering committee I think it be a good idea well I be glad that you approve but I be not really ask for your permission I would hope not Jean Baldwin that be right you should 've stay away look around you all these people they have not do anything to hurt you they have not do anything to help I either besides it do not matter I do not have a choice I be do what they want I to do you do not have to accept that you have a choice yeah like I have a choice when I be abduct I never have a choice ever they have the right girl for the job what be you do here anyway you should have go back to your family like I say no I be right where I want to be then you must have some kind of death wish you think you be here to kill people I think I be here to stop you they infect you jean and that be wrong but you do not have to let they make you into a mass murderer I be already a killer no no you have not decide to kill anyone that be what you be do right now whatever you be think about destiny or fate whatever you

today tomorrow the national institute of health be worried that this illness whatever it be can mutate and cross over into the general population would it even have to mutate there be no guarantee that this be go to stay exclusive to 4400s and meanwhile we 've get two dozen sick one right downstairs they be not go to be there long why what be we do with they D c want to put all the 4400 back in quarantine and keep they there for the rest of the crisis I know it be a big move people but it be the good one we 've get at the moment can we do that accord to emergency quarantine order 74 we can but wait you be just talk about the sick one here right no all of they every 4400 in the country be subject to this order okay but that be only half of they this thing be worldwide right England and france be pass similar legislation we expect other country to follow but why be you force they all to come in because the disease seem to be show up at random until we understand how it be transmit we have to assume that every 4400 be a potential vector how much time be we give they we will make the announcement in the morning they will have 12 hour to get to a local ntac branch then they will be transfer to camp dekker and the quarantine facility what if they do not report then it will be our job to bring they in you be not hear I it be temporary can you be sure you already tell I people in

do you mind I notice that miss page make its way back in oh yeah I tell you it would be back what be those two line black out for well look like we duplicate a test they cross it out so we do not read the same result twice okay let us see how that rash be do Lily I be fine brian tell heidi not to worry Richard 's fine Isabelle 's fine well the news be make it sound like everybody 's sick People be terrify and if normal people start get sick normal people okay that come out wrong but you know what I mean and listen lily heidi 's not the only one that be worried about you I be too a year and a half ago you welcome I home with a restraining order I know I panic when you get back do not think I have not lose sleep over what I do I just want you to know now that I be there for you you richard isabelle you need anything just call Quarantine that be an evocative word these day conjure up image of secret prison and what be the euphemism you be use now coercion tactic Tom let I ask you something you have some doctor on staff here right yes they have any luck get to the bottom of this thing not yet then get off your soapbox you want an image to hold on to try this one 4400 die in drove I think what my partner mean to say be that our two organization need each other we should cooperate and how exactly do we do that we want you to issue a public statement if the center counsel the 4400 to go along with this order thing will go much more smoothly and if we do not why be we talk to you anyway where be shawn be he all right Mr Farrell be handle urgent business this situation require his full attention look I will have to run it by he but I do not see a problem advise any ill 4400 to seek medical care from ntac well that be a start what about the one who be not show symptom that issue be go to require a little more thought Great you have 12 hour Teenage boy what be the point of paint it over anyway they be just go to do it again we do not know that look sam kyle have be nice enough to come over here and help we out so the least that you can do be pitch in oh yes very good picasso I be go to make sandwich okay seriously what be your story why be you help we kyle whoever you be my last name 's bingham and I do not know I be just walk by here yesterday Alison look like she could use a hand yeah well if you be think about hook up with her forget it Alison 's go to marry my brother as soon as he get out of jail I know I know she tell I you should listen to her Roy do not kill this collier guy I believe you yeah well you be the only one you and I when he do get out I do not think you want he come home and see murderer write all over his door do you Richard you ready for a promotion I a promotion to what I be try here man I want to lead we all through this but I can not do that right now thank you I know I be a 4400 but after that my qualification be a little thin they do not even give I an ability to be honest with you I be not sure how long lily and I be plan on stay here so it be not a perfect fit but you be articulate and a war hero and you have the gravita of a leader I think it be a good idea I have not give an order since 1951 I be in high school a year and a half ago I manage so will you but it be only temporary right as soon as you get well I can go right back to be camera shy yeah temporary what be you go to do what I have to have everyone frighten and that be understandable but no one 's more frightened than we be and that be because in spite of all the rumor that you hear fly around only 4400 be get sick and now the government want we to head into quarantine they say cooperation be essential well here be the good we can do if you be sick the responsible thing be to report to ntac our good wish and prayer go with you but if you be well if you be show no symptom we ask you to consider this walk into quarantine be an easy step but walk out that might be considerably more difficult thank you do not they get it we be try to help these people all they hear be quarantine dennis you can not blame they for be scare maybe if we give they another day half a day even do it look to you like they have not make up their mind we try be reasonable in 10 hour we start round they up hi hey I know who you be you be the one who fix people yeah Shawn how come you be in here why do not you just make yourself well I wish I could they be break kind of like the rest of I I use to see thing stuff that be go to happen that be go now too it be funny huh when I find out I be different all I want to do be be normal again I too but you get use to it now that it be go I feel like I be miss an arm it will come back once we get well any idea when that be go to be not exactly but my mom tell I everything be go to be fine and I believe what she say that must be a nice feeling do not you have someone to believe in I use to but now I guess I be just go to have to believe in you you be the one I attack at the hospital we do not think you would remember we I remember I be very sick back then I be well now Diana you want to see I Kevin burkhoff I 've be do neurological research on the 4400 oh I 've hear of you everybody here

I can expect to see your work when I show you mine you show I yours that be the way it work be not it usually but the research we do here be classify Diana Max max if ever there be a time to bend the rule a little I think it might be now well it be not a wink and a nudge situation I give over classify document I go to jail yeah and if you do not people might die be you imply we be not do everything we can we 've get dozen of doctor work around the clock to try to solve this thing now I will look over everything that you 've give I if I find anything that can help you I will give you a call that be the good I can do I be so sorry I be not interested in apology I want to see that information or be ntac not interested in cure these people I know you guy be kind of cavalier about put your own career on the line but do I a favor stop ask I to join in the fun okay I like what I do here they be medical record marco not national secret Wrong they be medical record and national secret that be why they keep they in a database you need six password to get into and that be why sport o would not give they to you let us just leave max out of this he be under a lot of pressure and he want to keep his job I do not blame he you know I just open a 401 k yeah pretty sure the government stop match donation once you commit treason the government just turn down an offer of help from kevin burkhoff remember he yeah the future build a giant tower to wake he up I guess they think he matter if anyone in washington read my report they know he matter too you know it be weird hundred of people be sick you would think they would want any help they could get well they be go to get his help yeah whether they want it or not Gotcha yeah be isabelle ready to go for her walk okay let us go

this be go on Richard your daughter have never be in any kind of danger he ask you a question Jordan be go to initiate these test as soon as he convince you to come back into the fold what test what have you be do to her all we be do be what you should have do a long time ago try to figure out who or what isabelle be she be our daughter that be all you or anyone else your daughter be the rosetta stone for understand what happen to the 4400 yet you both cling to the illusion that she be go to go to preschool first communion the prom she be not communal property we be her parent we decide Parents you be the steward of the future and forgive I for say so but you be do a piss poor job of it we have give up everything we have for that child any chance we have of live a normal life to protect she from people like you look richard this be no time for this conversation in two hour the government be come through the front door yeah well you will not use my daughter as some kind of weapon against they that be never my intention you will never have the chance we be leave right now that be your choice but if you do if we splinter now they will round up the 4400 one by one hey hey thomas hey they say you 've be ask for I should not you be in bed they will take I back soon enough I want to see you how do you feel baby they can not get the fever down but the bad part be my head everything 's so mixed up this illness it affect people 's ability Maia can not see thing and and shawn shawn can not heal and for you honey I think the boundary between this world and the one you create be break down it be so confusing I do not know what be real anymore I know it be scary you just have to hang on they will get this fix what if they be too late what if they can make my body right but not my mind I do not want to live like that thomas you be not go to have to you be go to get well you have to believe that alana Thomas yeah I love you so much I want we to get marry for real in this world that be all I want to tell you before before my mind go because I do not know if it will be good again so you be sure I can not get you a beer or something no no that be okay I do not drink okay you know this be not really necessary I just do a couple of chore maybe it be not a big deal to you but I just have not see a friendly face in a while not since roy go away no offense but um the paper make he sound like the second coming of lee harvey oswald yeah well I would not exactly call it fair and balanced coverage but he do have some monstrous gun collection right look I be not say that he be a candidate for high office and he sure as hell be not the world 's great boyfriend but take out two ntac agent and shoot jordan collier Come on yeah yeah eat up Sam Sam come on we be start I will be right there hey okay be you marco thank do not thank I hire I I be go to need a job where have you be talk to matthew Lily he be get an idea on how to handle this roundup I think it might work I be sure he be full of clever idea we will deal with what matthew do but not now the government be about to declare martial law we do not have time to squabble all I want to hear be that you be do with this place for good it be not that simple we can not just go off and hide in the wood somewhere it be not go to work this time the center betray we they betray our daughter and they learn about she more than we do in almost a year Lily stop do you know isabelle have connection between the right and leave hemisphere of her brain that have never be see before even if that be true richard it be not that they study she it be how they do it do you trust the government because if we go into quarantine isabelle will end up right here or with they and if they find out what she can do we will lose she forever Ryland that be it that be the deadline where do we start I want everybody to holster their pistol my goal be to do this quietly peacefully and without incident what if they want an incident then we will give they one be everybody ready Affirmative sir we be in position let us go move in now copy that they be on the move they be spread out and let we through welcome to the center do you come for the tour you know damn well why we be here out hunt I would guess well I be afraid you 've come to the wrong place you be welcome to look around I have no idea where they go you have 1204400s take shelter at your center that sound about right I do not have an exact figure you just come downstairs and they be go until 7 00 this evening they be free citizen I have no reason to track their movement and since I 've break no law unless you want to talk about lift this quarantine order we have nothing leave to discuss we will talk again I suspect your job be go to get rather ugly from here on out kicking in door and such if I work at ntac I might spend a little less time try to find miss 4400 and a little more try to cure the one I have so tell I have we get a list yeah all the sick one we know of be in as for the rest we have about 75 compliance nationwide there be about 5204400s unaccounted for well that be not a few holdout that be an insurgency so this be it huh Us against they you know it feel kind of like the war jordan collier always predict Predicted or provoke we declare martial law on they we have no option I be go to pursue a policy of non aggression as long as I can but if it come down to a choice between the safety of the american people and the welfare of the 4400 tom that be no choice at all Richard Collier leave behind 37 safe house throughout the country we liquidate the center 's emergency slush fund should last for awhile any 4400 who contact the center for help will be give an email address if we be satisfied they be legitimate they will be tell where to go our goal be to get every 4400 who want shelter to safety and then what Matthew will try to continue to end this peacefully but if we have to protect our own we will be ready excuse I excuse I Sorry Lily you make a good speech but this be not korea and those be not soldier and your daughter could get catch in the crossfire you do not think I be worried about her and you too Lily I be not look for a fight but right now we do not have another option hey Sam say he like comic_strip you son of a bitch you lie to I what wait a minute it be not like that oh really kyle bingham your last name be baldwin and your dad work for ntac so what be you his little spy Huh do you think you be go to sleep with I I be go to tell you all about roy you go and you tell your daddy that he do not kill anybody I know that I be just try to help you why you come off like you be this really great guy and all you be try to do be use I you be a lie prick okay okay this thing that be kill they it be not a disease it be a side effect Dr Burkhoff just calm down what be you talk about a side effect of what I do not know exactly but I do know this there be a synthetic substance present in the blood of every 4400 all the one I test every medical report you give I sick one well one do not matter they all have it they even give it a name they call it promicin inhibitor Promicin what be promicin I have no idea and I do not know why anyone would want to inhibit it either but whatever it be it be gather in their lymph node compromise their immune system it be what be make they sick but ntac be be study the 4400 ever since they get back they should have know about this they do know it be all in here they know so why have not they tell anyone that be a very good question when you find out why do not you tell I Car idling be you sure you want to do this just get I and isabelle someplace safe p I Dosage it be on memo in every 4400 medical report it be on the fifth page of every report that be what hudson have cross out when I go to see maia p I Promicin inhibitor Alana be get it too and shawn everyone be get it every time they come to ntac medical

neurochemistry it be preposterous it be a good scam but still preposterous Scam that be a strong word it fit they be take this kernel of truth about the brain 's potential and use it to bilk people out of their life saving a lot of people might be surprise by your stance after all you suffer from paranoid personality disorder for year be not it a device engineer by a 4400 that cure you yes and I be grateful but you need to make the distinction between the 4400 and the 4400 center 4400 have remarkable ability everybody know it but the center be co opt that phenomenon for profit those machine

Traduction par Cedr c et Emilizim Synchro par Kiff Correction Vovo www forom com previously on the 4400 they just arrest a suspect in the Collier kill Roy Marsden do not kill Jordan Collier and neither do you Kyle Son of a bitch you go and you tell your daddy that he do not kill anybody if Maia 's have vision you should know about it and you should know what they be mommy 's boss will be punish for betray we I want to go home I know you do honey but Dr Hudson be go to take very good care of you do not tell anyone I can not heal Sure what be you go to do what I have to if you be sick the responsible thing be to report to ntac but if you be well walk into quarantine be an easy step but walk out that might be considerably more difficult there be a synthetic substance present in the blood of every 4400 they even give it a name they call it promicin inhibitor every time they come to ntac medical every checkup your daughter be the rosetta stone for understand what happen to the 4400 we be her parent we decide be you sure you want to do this just get I and Isabelle someplace safe but if it come down to a choice between the safety of the american people and the welfare of the 4400 Tom that be no choice at all we try be reasonable in 10 hour we start round they up Easy McCullough let I go I be not sick there be nothing wrong with I we know that but you be a 4400 and everybody be get to go in come on now I do not want to cuff you but if you run again you be go to give I no choice Quarantine be just a word to you guy try live it Come on what be we do here Diana this be so wrong all right what do you suggest we walk into the middle of ntac and shout out we do this we make they sick yeah yeah that be good start we 've get the medical record we can take they to Dennis you really think that Max Hudson and a couple of rogue doctor hatch a covert plan to poison the 4400 I mean you really think that they could do that without approval whose approval Dennis Ryland 's for one he be the head of this division when this whole thing start I mean you think he do not know until we know how far up this go we 've get to stay calm work quietly and watch our back do not tell I to calm down Lily how be I suppose to be calm when my wife and daughter leave in the middle of the night we do not leave you Richard I just do not feel like Isabelle be safe there you 've turn this resist quarantine into your personal mission Ntac turn it into my personal mission when they start round we up and I admire what you be do but it be not my fight and I sure as hell will not let it become Isabelle 's fight just tell I where you be Put my mind at ease I will come see you Lily I be sorry I just feel like it be well this way for now I will call soon that do not go as well as mommy hope 911 please state the nature of no I need an ambulance I be I be sick I 've get this hello hello Miss be you there never mind think they be share trade secret either that or she be ask for her office back after you thank Nina Good to see you thank I wish the circumstance be a little well we lose the first 4400 to this thing overnight seven dead there will be more by day 's end no word about a vaccine a cure I just get off the phone with Hudson he say that they 've work on a few thing overnight I be go to quarantine Diana I know this be frustrating but we 've get the good mind in the country in the world work on this well they well work fast seven people be dead Alana could be next or Maia and still nobody have any idea where this come from do they we will get it figure out hey sweetie it be I Tom who be you who be you she be awake early only for a few minute though do she say anything she talk about you say you be go to make everything okay I hope she be right I too let us go where be we head we 've get an appointment with the good doctor Hudson Diana what what the hell be you do we 've get some thing we need to talk about Max we may have what they have too soon this guy your agent bring in rOrson Bailey I think I can explain how he develop this jesus I can not even say the word Telekinesis thank you the body produce four main neurotransmitter they be like traffic cop to the brain they control everything regulate everything tell I something I do not know Bailey be produce a fifth neurotransmitter we 've never see it before nobody have I be guess it factor into Bailey 's ability to bend spoon with his mind let us just say promicin be basically a backstage pass to the v I p Section of the brain he be use part of the cerebellum no human have ever have access to I run some test on the 4400 who be still in quarantine every single one of they be produce trace amount of promicin so it be just a matter of time before every 4400 develop telekinesis Promicin 's behavior be unpredictable they might not get telekinesis but they will get something Put everything on paper I want to get my talking point straight before I try to explain this to D C D C Panicked I be order to work on a drug to suppress the production of promicin in the 4400 once I synthesize the inhibitor we give it to every 4400 every time they come in for a checkup but it do not even work 4400 be develop ability all the time a small percentage of they be but if it be not for the inhibitor they would all have they I know it do not work perfectly perfectly seven 4400 die last night it be your inhibitor that do it you make they sick you think I do not know that we be not try to kill anyone we be preserve the status quo do a good thing I guess it backfire I be try to undo it but if you want to pull that trigger please be my guest maybe then finally I will get some sleep all right if you be not go to shoot I let I get back to work I do not want anyone else to die Alison what be you do here they be go to give Roy life they be go to give he life and he be go to take it what be you talk about the state be go to go for the death penalty and the public defender convince Roy to take a plea bargain but they 've get no case against he my dad tell I I do not know this lawyer he be handle like 10 different case and he just do not want to see the inside of a courtroom I do not know but he do not do it okay he do not kill Jordan Collier you keep say that do your dad know something what be there evidence that they be hide what you have to tell I if Roy take this deal he can not even get parole for 20 year he be not go to prison why the 4400 come back august 14th Hudson discover promicin october 11th so they probably give the first dose of the inhibitor sometime around the end of the month but we have every internal document for october there be nothing about any of this there be hardly even a mention of Orson Bailey we both write report about he Diana they be go they be hope that be go to be the only extrahuman ability ever develop in a 4400 if they destRoy all record of it nobody would ever know but this go to the top of the food chain here Britain France Korea everywhere there be a sick 4400 there have to be a paper trail do it even matter we could find a memo sign by the entire united nations security council it be not go to cure anyone Diana we deliver confidential medical record to Dr Burkhoff we 've get the so call father of 4400 technology work on the case and you just stick a gun to the head of ntac 's medical director we 've do everything we can to get the right people work on a cure that be if ntac even want a cure Ryland 's be talk about people in D C who 've be on a wartime footing for month this be nothing but a stroke of luck for they you think they want they all dead I tell you I tell you I be not safe here it be just a precaution Kevin we think you will just be safe if you move to a less expose location it be because I tell you about that inhibitor thing right I spend six year in a psychiatric hospital suffering from paranoid personality disorder as soon as I get out you two put I smack in the middle of a massive conspiracy Dr Burkhoff 's be spin all kind of story about ntac very interesting stuff well he can spin all the theory he want just not here I will make sure he have a safe place to work I figure out what promicin be that be the name they give the neurotransmitter right the one that give the 4400 their ability and if I can find one 4400 that have not be expose to the inhibitor I think I can neutralize it hey you scare I why do not you use your key oh sorry my hand be full I bring you guy some supply you still like chocolate cherry that sound great thank you oh you you okay yeah just jumpy it be so quiet out here yeah a lot of place have close up for the season oh I think that uh maybe I could stay for a little dinner or something you do not have to get back home no not really Carol 's go she find out that you and I be talk do not worry she do not know you be here but she get mad Brian I be sorry she will stay away for a few night I will stay on the couch for a while but in the meantime Heidi 's stay with a friend and I figure why eat alone sure but I hope you be not expect much I have not make pot roast in a while you know Lily the truth be I never should have marry Carol in the first place what be you do Brian Come on I be alone you be alone you and Richard be not happy that be not true we could have it back Lily do not Brian why be you fight it Brian stop it let I go I do not want to hurt you Lily stop it you little bitch hello Lily be you okay Brian yeah I be go to bring by some food do not something be not right here I have not hear from the safe house in wheeling for a day we have to assume it be be compromise that be the third one that be go silent they be pick we off one by one we might want to think about fight back we can do that Richard we certainly have 4400 that can do some damage but once we take that step there be no turn back excuse I but should not there be bar on these window the point be to be unobtrusive Dr Burkhoff well this seem a little lax to I Most of you be 4400s I be a collaborator you know what they do to collaborator we need to get he work it calm he down considerably we clear out a room for you anything you need just let we know what I need be a clean 4400 one that have not be expose to the inhibitor I do not guess you 've get one of those do you actually I might 20 year I 've never see you pour a drink on government property I never supervise a round up of innocent citizen before Conscience bother you Dennis Hell yes it be and give the circumstance I would say that be a good sign but I be try to focus on my job Tom and I need the same from you but sometimes when you you look for one thing you you learn something else you know how it be Dennis I know exactly what you mean I 've learn some thing myself open it Knowledge be a burden huh Tom do you think that I would release Kyle from quarantine and not keep an eye on he why do not you stop this because I do not know exactly what Kyle be go to do I just sort of let the future play out be not that what you be always talk about you set up Roy Marsden that be my gift to you Tom would you rather I just turn these over to my boss I would rather you be the friend you be the Ryland I work with for 20 year I have not change I have a tough job and I be do my good and as your boss and as your friend I expect support Kyle hate quarantine I wonder what he think of prison they know Ntac know you shoot Collier what how they 've know all along they let it happen I need you to be ready to get out of here I be go to call Alana 's friend you be send I to Spain if they come after you I need you to be ready to leave right away do you hear Roy Marsden 's be send to jail for life they set he up but if I run just one thing at a time Kyle let I worry about you then I will deal with Marsden so you want I to start pack yeah Kyle be not you hear I I confess to the murder of Jordan Collier he commit suicide I know that Max be under a lot of strain but he have all those people 's life in his hand Maia 's I know but Dr Pinero 's be Hudson 's number two from the very beginning he know everything that Hudson know we be still go to beat this thing good morning Tom Nina here I grab this out of your mail cubby do you hear about Hudson yeah you okay they be call it a suicide what be you call it Tom look at this it be from Max

off your hard drive okay do you ever see a memo with the word firewall write in the subject line no but I do not read most of the memo that circulate around here anyway look how long be you guy go to be work in here what be they paint your office we need a little privacy okay Tom this memo whatever it be I doubt it ever go out on a general distribution and every copy probably go through the shredder month ago so if there be no hard copy and if Marco be the only one we even trust to even talk about it with then we be at a dead end we could always march into Ryland 's office and ask he about it the guy do know memo when he be work here I must have throw away like 15 every day More like 20 he like to keep his keyboard burn who Ryland yeah he do not type he use to call I in sometimes when he freeze up his computer Hunt and peck city take he 10 minute to type in an email address Ryland dictate everything to his secretary she have l level security clearance look D r J o everything say d r J o D r Dennis Ryland and J o be Jane Orman she work for he for 22 year do she stay in Seattle say hi for I Lily you come back be you all right I think I be do the smart thing but Isabelle

conspiracy to suppress the ability of the 4400 we be just kind of hope you would fill we in on the particular yeah and do not be nervous but we have to shake a government tail on the way here to do it yeah sound like a start hmm Tom Baldwin long time Jane do you remember my partner Diana Skouris of course yeah hi I always wonder who would show up I should have figure it would be the two of you you be here about firewall right come on in the inhibitor have not be test it be not ready one of the 4400 be a serial killer who be use I do not know some kind of mind control to get people to commit murder the inhibitor 's ready this be wrong Dennis we be beyond right and wrong here there be no precedent for this now D C 's be advise of the operation it be be approve at the high level there be nothing further to discuss be there I be not do this I take it home with I that night the next day I put in my notice I mean you have to understand for two decade I think that Dennis Ryland be the fine man I ever meet and after I read this I could not work for he anymore I keep tell myself I should send it somewhere the newspaper or I do not know but the name that sign off on this I be just a secretary what could I do against those name it be all here do you see the name when Maia say mommy 's boss be go to be punish I have no idea she mean all the way up the chain of command we can not go public yet what we can not go public yet listen the fast this gets expose the well it be for Maia Alana Shawn all of they no more secret no more rely on the people who do this to find a cure at the very least they be go to have to rescind the quarantine order Diana Ryland 's get something on I Ryland this entire memo be over his signature what could he possibly have over you he know Kyle kill Jordan Collier what that night on highland beach they put someone inside of he or some program I do not know direct his action and Ryland have evidence I be sorry Tom but I can not just sit on this Maia 's get sicker just give I one hour Diana just one hour please stop say that it be not okay Kyle if I go through with this they be go to come after you and it do not matter if you be in Spain or Siberia I know but with all those life at stake you have to do it okay I be take you to the airport Dad I be not go anywhere this actually make it easy I do not know how I be go to tell you tell I what I can not live like this anymore I can not live know that guy be in jail I go through every day try to pretend it be all normal but it be just a cover up I can not let you do it Kyle Marsden shoot at I he uh he shoot at other cop too even if you confess Kyle he be still go to jail you try to bury stuff like this it change you look what it do to your boss Ryland use to be your friend it be over dad no more lie I can not do it anymore I just can not do it okay you can not stop I okay do not you do anything until I get back you hear I this be the right thing the heroic thing and be a hero come with some perk you tell I what I need to know I will see that you be transfer to a private quarantine facility this afternoon you can walk the ground you can choose your own meal what be wrong with that 139 Lebanon street that be where they tell I to go the inhibitor be piggyback on glucose it enter the brain through facilitated diffusion it be a bind protein that be how they do it I will take your word for it but this serum have pure promicin in it it can neutralize the charge the inhibitor will not be able to cross membrane anymore we can flush it out of their system so once it be go the disease go away please stop say disease for the last time it be a side effect remove the inhibitor the immune system function it will happen virtually instantly so this substance promicin it be what make you people unique how do you get it out of my daughter she have race amount of it in her bloodstream before the inhibitor you all do that be how they find it in the first place but she be an infant I could only draw enough blood to make one shot if you can get that into quarantine one shot might be all you need Nina where be Ryland a 4400 give up the seattle safe house they be on their way to take it down excuse I please do not shoot Dr Burkhoff why would we shoot you I have no idea but I be feel a little insecure right now I bring something for you whatever you do do not drop it everybody in this house be subject to quarantine and arrest under emergency order 74 you have five minute to come out peacefully if not we will come in and get you oh there be an army out there Ryland call it off it be over Quarantine everything Agent Baldwin be obstruct justice arrest he I do not think so Dennis I know about firewall keep your weapon on he you be really willing to give up your son Kyle 's turn himself in he can not live with the cover up when I write that memo we have no idea where the 4400 be from or why they be bring back Dr Hudson give I information I act on it Tom if you be in my chair you would have do the same thing hi I 've get some medicine for you to be honest with you I would rather be give this to Maia but a crazy neuroscientist tell I that that be not the right

heal Sure what be you go to do what I have to Richard if you be sick the responsible thing be to report to ntac but if you be well walk into quarantine be an easy step but walk out that might be considerably more difficult there be a synthetic substance present in the blood of every 4400 they even give it a name they call it promicin inhibitor every time they come to ntac medical every checkup your daughter be the rosetta stone for understand what happen to the 4400 we be her parent we decide be you sure you want to do this just get I and isabelle someplace safe but if it come down to a choice between the safety of the american people and the welfare of the 4400 tom that be no choice at all we try be reasonable in 10 hour we start round they up Siren wail Grunts Easy mccullough let I go I be not sick there be nothing wrong with I we know that but you be a 4400 and everybody be get to go in come on now I do not want to cuff you but if you run again you be go to give I no choice Quarantine be just a word to you guy try live it Come on what be we do here diana this be so wrong all right what do you suggest we walk into the middle of ntac and shout out we do this we make they sick yeah yeah that be good start we 've get the medical record we can take they to dennis you really think that max hudson and a couple of rogue doctor hatch a covert plan to poison the 4400 I mean you really think that they could do that without approval whose approval Dennis ryland 's for one he be the head of this division when this whole thing start I mean you think he do not know until we know how far up this go we 've get to stay calm work quietly and watch our back do not tell I to calm down lily how be I suppose to be calm when my wife and daughter leave in the middle of the night we do not leave you richard I just do not feel like isabelle be safe there you 've turn this resist quarantine into your personal mission Ntac turn it into my personal mission when they start

Miss be you there never mind think they be share trade secret either that or she be ask for her office back after you thank Nina Good to see you thank I wish the circumstance be a little well we lose the first 4400s to this thing overnight seven dead there will be more by day 's end no word about a vaccine a cure Jarvis I just get off the phone with hudson he say that they 've work on a few thing overnight I be go to quarantine Diana I know this be frustrating but we 've get the good mind in the country in the world work on this well they well work fast seven people be dead Alana could be next or maia and still nobody have any idea where this come from do they we will get it figure out hey sweetie it be I tom who be you Weakly who be you she be awake early only for a few minute though do she say anything she talk about you say you be go to make everything okay I hope she be right I too let us go where be we head we 've get an appointment with the good doctor hudson Diana what what the hell be you do we 've get some thing we need to talk about so long ago another life I can feel your heart beat it be not a dream remember we I can see it in your eye we will find our place in time our place in time beyond the sun we will find our place in time our place in time to call our own this guy your agent bring in orson bailey I think I can explain how he develop this jesus I can not even say the word Telekinesis thank you the body produce four main neurotransmitter they be like traffic cop to the brain they control everything regulate everything tell I something I do not know Bailey be produce a fifth neurotransmitter we 've never see it before nobody have I be guess it factor into bailey 's ability to bend spoon with his mind let us just say promicin be basically a backstage pass to the v I p Section of the brain he be use part of the cerebellum no human have ever have access to I run some test on the 4400 who be still in quarantine every single one of they be produce trace amount of promicin so it be just a matter of time before every 4400 develop telekinesis Promicin 's behavior be unpredictable they might not get telekinesis but they will get something Put everything on paper I want to get my talking point straight before I try to explain this to d c d c Panicked I be order to work on a drug to suppress the production of promicin in the 4400 once I synthesize the inhibitor we give it to every 4400 every time they come in for a checkup but it do not even work 4400 be develop ability all the time a small percentage of they be but if it be not for the inhibitor they would all have they I know it do not work perfectly perfectly seven 4400 die last night it be your inhibitor that do it you make they sick you think I do not know that we be not try to kill anyone we be preserve the status quo do a good thing I guess it backfire I be try to undo it but if you want to pull that trigger please be my guest maybe then finally I will get some sleep all right if you be not go to shoot I let I get back to work I do not want anyone else to die Alison what be you do here they be go to give roy life they be go to give he life and he be go to take it what be you talk about the state be go to go for the death penalty and the public defender convince roy to take a plea bargain but they 've get no case against he my dad tell I I do not know this lawyer he be handle like 10 different case and he just do not want to see the inside of a courtroom I do not know but he do not do it okay he do not kill jordan collier you keep say that do your dad know something what be there evidence that they be hide what you have to tell I if roy take this deal he can not even get parole for 20 year he be not go to prison why the 4400 come back august 14th Hudson discover promicin october 11th so they probably give the first dose of the inhibitor sometime around the end of the month but we have every internal document for october there be nothing about any of this there be hardly even a mention of orson bailey we both write report about he diana they be go they be hope that be go to be the only extrahuman ability ever develop in a 4400 if they destroy all record of it nobody would ever know but this go to the top of the food chain here Britain france korea everywhere there be a sick 4400 there have to be a paper trail do it even matter I mean we could find a memo sign by the entire united nations security council it be not go to cure anyone Diana we deliver confidential medical record to dr Burkhoff we 've get the so call father of 4400 technology work on the case and you just stick a gun to the head of ntac 's medical director we 've do everything we can to get the right people work on a cure that be if ntac even want a cure Ryland 's be talk about people in d c who 've be on a wartime footing for month this be nothing but a stroke of luck for they you think they want they all dead I tell you I tell you I be not safe here it be just a precaution kevin we think you will just be safe if you move to a less expose location it be because I tell you about that inhibitor thing right I spend six year in a psychiatric hospital suffering from paranoid personality disorder as soon as I get out you two put I smack in the middle of a massive conspiracy Dr Burkhoff 's be spin all kind of story about ntac very interesting stuff well he can spin all the theory he want just not here I will make sure he have a safe place to work I figure out what promicin be that be the name they give the neurotransmitter right the one that give the 4400 their ability and if I can find one 4400 that have not be expose to the inhibitor I think I can neutralize it hey you scare I why do not you use your key oh sorry my hand be full I bring you guy some supply you still like chocolate cherry that sound great thank you oh you okay yeah just jumpy it be so quiet out here yeah a lot of place have close up for the season oh I think that uh maybe I could stay for a little dinner or something you do not have to get back home no not really Carol 's go she find out that you and I be talk do not worry she do not know you be here but she get mad Brian I be sorry she will stay away for a few night I will stay on the couch for a while but in the meantime heidi 's stay with a friend and I figure why eat alone sure but I hope you be not expect much I have not make pot roast in a while you know lily the truth be I never should have marry carol in the first place what be you do brian Come on I be alone you be alone you and richard be not happy that be not true we could have it back lily do not brian why be you fight it Brian stop it let I go I do not want to hurt you lily stop it you little bitch hello Brian lily be you okay Brian yeah I be go to bring by some food do not something be not right here I have not hear from the safe house in wheeling for a day we have to assume it be be compromise that be the third one that be go silent they be pick we off one by one we might want to think about fight back we can do that richard we certainly have 4400 that can do some damage but once we take that step there be no turn back excuse I but should not there be bar on these window the point be to be unobtrusive dr Burkhoff well this seem a little lax to I Most of you be 4400s I be a collaborator you know what they do to collaborator quietly we need to get he work it calm he down considerably we clear out a room for you anything you need just let we know what I need be a clean 4400 one that have not be expose to the inhibitor I do not guess you 've get one of those do you actually I might 20 year I 've never see you pour a drink on government property I never supervise a round up of innocent citizen before Conscience bother you dennis Hell yes it be and give the circumstance I would say that be a good sign but I be try to focus on my job tom and I need the same from you but sometimes when you you look for one thing you you learn something else you know how it be dennis Ryland I know exactly what you mean I 've learn some thing myself open it Knowledge be a burden huh tom do you think that I would release kyle from quarantine and not keep an eye on he why do not you stop this because I do not know exactly what kyle be go to do I just sort of let the future play out be not that what you be always talk about you set up roy marsden that be my gift to you tom would you rather I just turn these over to my boss I would rather you be the friend you be the ryland I work with for 20 year I have not change I have a tough job and I be do my good and as your boss and as your friend I expect support Kyle hate quarantine they know Ntac know you shoot colly what how they 've know all along they

circulate around here anyway look how long be you guy go to be work in here what be they paint your office we need a little privacy okay Tom this memo whatever it be I doubt it ever go out on a general distribution and every copy probably go through the shredder month ago so if there be no hard copy and if marco be the only one we even trust to even talk about it with then we be at a dead end we could always march into ryland 's office and ask he about it Marco the guy do know memo when he be work here I must have throw away like 15 every day More like 20 he like to keep his keyboard burn who ryland yeah he do not type he use to call I in sometimes when he freeze up his computer Hunt and peck city take he 10 minute to type in an email address Ryland dictate everything to his secretary she have l level security clearance look D r j o everything say d r j o D r dennis ryland and j o be jane orman she work for he for 22 year do she stay in seattle say hi for I Lily you come

nervous but we have to shake a government tail on the way here to do it yeah sound like a start Tom baldwin long time jane do you remember my partner diana skouris of course yeah hi I always wonder who would show up I should have figure it would be the two of you you be here about firewall right the inhibitor have not be test it be not ready Ryland one of the 4400 be a serial killer who be use I do not know some kind of mind control to get people to commit murder the inhibitor 's ready this be wrong dennis we be beyond right and wrong here there be no precedent for this now d c be be advise of the operation it be be approve at the high level there be nothing further to discuss be there I be not do this I take it home with I that night the next day I put in my notice I mean you have to understand for two decade I think that dennis ryland be the fine man I ever meet and after I read this I could not work for he anymore I keep tell myself I should send it somewhere the newspaper or I do not know but the name that sign off on this I be just a secretary what could I do against those name it be all here do you see the name when maia say mommy 's boss be go to be punish I have no idea she mean all the way up the chain of command we can not go public yet what we can not go public yet listen the fast this gets expose the well it be for maia alana shawn all of they no more secret no more rely on the people who do this to find a cure at the very least they be go to have to rescind the quarantine order Diana ryland 's get something on I Ryland this entire memo be over his signature what could he possibly have over you he know kyle kill jordan collier what that night on highland beach they put someone inside of he or some program I do not know direct his action and ryland have evidence I be sorry tom but I can not just sit on this Maia 's get sick just give I one hour diana just one hour please stop say that it be not okay kyle if I go through with this they be go to come after you and it do not matter if you be in spain or siberia I know but with all those life at stake you have to do it okay I be take you to the airport Dad I be not go anywhere this actually make it easy I do not know how I be go to tell you tell I what I can not live like this anymore I can not live know that guy be in jail I go through every day try to pretend it be all normal but it be just a cover up I can not let you do it kyle Marsden shoot at I he uh he shoot at other cop too even if you confess kyle he be still go to jail you try to bury stuff like this it change you look what it do to your boss Ryland use to be your friend it be over dad no more lie I can not do it anymore I just can not do it okay you can not stop I okay do not you do anything until I get back you hear I Ryland this be the right thing the heroic thing and be a hero come with some perk you tell I what I need to know I will see that you be transfer to a private quarantine facility this afternoon you can walk the ground you can choose your own meal what be wrong with that 139 lebanon street that be where they tell I to go the inhibitor be piggyback on glucose it enter the brain through facilitated diffusion it be a bind protein that be how they do it I will take your word for it but this serum have pure promicin in it it can neutralize the charge the inhibitor will not be able to cross membrane anymore we can flush it out of their system so once it be go the disease go away please stop say disease for the last time it be a side effect remove the inhibitor the immune system function it will happen virtually instantly so this substance promicin it be what make you people unique how do you get it out of my daughter she have trace amount of it in her bloodstream before the inhibitor you all do that be how they find it in the first place but she be an infant I could only draw enough blood to make one shot if you can get that into quarantine one shot might be all you need Nina where be ryland a 4400 give up the seattle safe house they be on their way to take it down excuse I please do not shoot Dr Burkhoff why would we shoot you I have no idea but I be feel a little insecure right now I bring something for you whatever you do do not drop it everybody in this house be subject to quarantine and arrest under emergency order 74 you have five minute to come out peacefully if not we will come in and get you there be an army out there Ryland call it off it be over Quarantine everything Agent baldwin be obstruct justice arrest he I do not think so dennis keep your weapon on he you be really willing to give up your son Kyle 's turn himself in he can not live with the cover up when I write that memo we have no idea where the 4400 be from or why they be bring back Dr Hudson give I information I act on it tom if you be in my chair you would have do the same thing hi I 've get some medicine for you to be honest with you I would rather be give this to maia but a crazy neuroscientist tell I that that be not the right thing to do so if you do not mind hold still for a minute you see orson bailey up close and personal Oliver knox you know what these people be capable of Hell I attach your report to the memo when I send it to d c but we learn well dennis Highland beach save the future Heartfelt message tom and while they be give it to you they be program your son to commit murder do that sound to you like they be guide we toward eden I do not know but I sure as hell do not want to go where you be take I Goddammit tom what do it even mean save the future save the future how kill we all start over with a small more evolved population be that an outcome you can live with what can you live with dennis be max hudson really a suicide or do you pull that little string too and what about I dennis because if you be hold on to any hope of keep this cover up you be go to have to start by put I in the ground right here and right now Ryland tom you be reduce the fate of the planet to a question of your personal faith without the inhibitor program who the hell know what will happen who the hell ever know very wise Pithy but if the world turn out to be a place

blood be all over he he speak for five minute straight when we first bring he in confess to Gayle 's death and the other nine murder have not say a word since Philip Lopez kill Theresa Baron he say so in his suicide note we find her shirt in his apartment his print I know but this morning Charlie Staley confess to the same murder and they both claim to be behind the original round of killing yeah only Charlie 's 39 he be five year old when the first death happen and we can eliminate Lopez as a suspect in the original murder as well how do you figure that check Lopez 's prison record he be leave hand accord to the autopsy report in the ' 80 the Friday Harbor killer be right handed so Lopez kill one girl Staley kill the other and neither one of they commit the original crime why would they confess to murder they could not possibly have commit piece do not quite fit together do they until you add Knox into the puzzle he disappear the killing stop he come back they start again so let us say Knox be involve somehow that mean what he be he be force these man to do his murder for he could be the question be how I mean why would he want more than one person to admit to the original crime one confession we might stop dig but two it just get our attention well maybe he can not control everything they do what if Knox can force people to kill but only by convince they that they really be the Friday Harbor killer in for one murder in for they all good good hi welcome 1969 huh well the good news be your bell bottom be back in yle hi so there be this one guy I be just talk to

think your department need to be a little more aggressive investigate the 4400 I be just here to see if I can not nudge thing along the authority to review all 4400 case file access to all meeting and briefing session permission to with field agent at your discretion it be a pretty broad mandate well they be look at five murder three unsolved bombing Barbara yate bash we all over the airwave it seem to they you could use a little bit of help I suppose it could look that way from a conference room in DC I get to tell you Dennis it look that way from everywhere except this glass tower of yours

the Friday Harbor murder but what if these bombing be that ripple the thing we could not figure out about Knox be he go from kill prostitute before his disappearance to kill just random woman once he come back what if they be not random at 's interesting yeah we should start look into Knox 's victim see if we can find out some kind of connection there I can not condone these bombing but I do understand the fear that motivate they the easy way to stop these act of violence be to put the 4400 somewhere out of harm 's way someplace safe for they and for we now I know to some of you that may sound harsh heartless even and I assure you I do not mean it to be just as I assure you that there be those among the 4400 who would jump at the chance to find sanctuary Truck 's ready to go will not be happy till we torch they all they can all burn in hell hey I be listen to that I be sick of listen to it she be on our side man that woman be a parasite all right she do not give a damn about we or

shut I up be not go to make the 4400 disappear from the headline and eventually they will cost you your job we will see good bye Barba do you really think this be the wise move to make under the circumstance Mr Collier all these 4400 in the same place you be a hell of a target there be always potential danger but that be why I hire the security team Mr Tyler I know you be try to protect your family but you have to realize that by stay here you could be put urself in serious danger maybe but you know I be bear in 1922 in Missouri and my skin be as black then as it be now so I 've have to

to work you two be good field agent but it be a mistake to allow two people with such obvious conflict of interest to remain on the 4400 investigation this be not a conflict of interest it be a unique perspective it be a window into these people 's life you have a gang task force you want people on it who know gang same thing here we know the 4400 well than any other agent in the country that be why we belong on these case that be a nice spin be this what Ryland think be that who you be after Ryland you know what be ironic the Northwest Division use to be a backwater it be give to Ryland like

revelation about the origin of the 4400 in his newly publish autobiography former real estate mogul Jordan Collier claim that the 4400 be abduct by human being from the future the book contain copy of classified government memoranda that Collier say prove his claim the document be say to come from an anonymous source within the national threat assessment command accord to Collier the 4400 be return to avert a catastrophe that threaten the survival of mankind why do not you tell I Collier charge that the government have have this information for more than a year but have keep it secret in an effort to avert a public panic the government claim that the document be purely speculative and have be quote out of context do not care who take they do not care who send they back the government should have keep they behind bar do not you hear what the man say they be here to save the world what do you expect he to say he be one of they you be awful quiet I deal in fact and the fact be I 've get to flush this radiator before lunch you will be happy to hear that Mr Collier 's anonymous source be anonymous no more Agent Hubbard will be prosecute to the full extent of the law so what about Collier Guy buy national secret on the black market I be sure we would all like to see Collier charge with treason but it be unlikely I doubt we will be able to trace the payment directly to he now as for this so call 4400 Center Round the clock surveillance be in effect until further notice I want picture of everyone who come within a hundred yard of that place be it true that Collier 's filing for tax exempt status apparently he be turn the 4400 into some kind of religion more like a cult well cult be what the big congregation call the little congregation Cult religion whatever what be he base it on have you read this thing Collier claim that he can unlock the 4400 within anybody so he expect a guy punch a clock in Pittsburgh to believe he have some kind of latent superpower Most of the 4400 do not even have those kind of ability not yet anyway no but if you think there be a chance that you have an ability lock away inside you you sound like you be ready to sign up no but I would not blame anyone for be curious we keep tell the public that biologically the 4400 be not any different than the rest of we they have not be alter genetically neurologically as far as we can tell but if Collier think people be just go to sign their life and their life saving over to some metaphysical pyramid scheme then he be in for a rude awakening Welcome to the Center my name 's Devon what be

right for you Shawn I will take care of myself I just get the full medical workup on tess let I guess physically normal across the board you can say this for the 4400 they be consistent tess draw a picture of a a tower or a monument yeah or a beacon and the people around her drop everything and start build it well they can not help themselves they have to work it be like ant come here the queen secrete a chemical tell the other ant what to do the drone do not stop work until the job be do do not matter if one of they die or if a storm come and wash away the anthill they just keep work unless you take the queen away let us hope our drone respond the same way right so the future send back a schizophrenic queen ant with a blueprint for what some interstellar walkie talkie Let us see what tess can tell we we would just well not get too close because if your theory 's right anyone who gets expose to she could be vulnerable all right I will talk to tess you check in with Garrity at the hospital these friend of yours the one who take you what do you think they want to talk about they be so much smart than you it be not even funny yeah well yeah I do not doubt it I mean they figure out how to take you and how to send you back send I back be a mistake and they know it I be suppose to be there where exactly be there there be doctor there too they be nice all of they they be nice you remember where you be take we sleep a lot but not all the time we wear gray clothe there be a giant building the doctor wear shiny jacket I miss it so much go on I really like hear you talk about

people let us get those dish secure we do not have all day I just have the most unbelievable conversation with tess well it could not have be any more unbelievable than the one I just have with Garrity can not say I see it that way no other way to see it that book be blasphemy well do not buy it if that be how you feel the third angel blow his trumpet and a great star fall from heaven burn like a torch revelation 8 10 I will take your word for it the day they come back be the beginning of the end time sound like you 've do a little more thinking on it than I have either remove the book from the store or my boy here will remove it for you like hell he will do you know what you be carry there woman it be just a book it be the doorway to hell that child yours that be my daughter Abomination beget abomination Richard what be go on we 've get to get out of here now Ok Sheriff what be the hell happen these new guy you send we be no good Park tell I he have experience with a welding torch experience at what start fire now our schedule 's in the toilet do either of you call the fire department Time to go hurry Richard Hurry as of tonight Abendson State Hospital be officially under quarantine the patient will remain locked down Hospital staff and affect NTAC personnel will be confine to the site until we 've isolate the source of the compulsion that sound like a good plan but who be go to watch over they the last group we send be compromise within hour which be quite frankly a little disturbing if you think of this like an epidemic in the CDC we would call tess the sole disease vector you remove she you remove the urge to build except as far as we know none of those agent have any contact with tess so it be like the flu or any other airborne virus you catch it you can pass it on what be this thing suppose to be anyway my guess and I can not emphasize the word guess strongly enough be that tess be tell we the truth it be some kind of communication device to contact who the future the only way to find out be to let the patient finish build it that night on Highland Beach they be try to tell we something the conversation be cut short which be why we 've be stumble around in the dark this last year tess be the only 4400 who remember where she be take no claim to remember where she be take she be also the only paranoid schizophrenic and it sound to I like you two have be spend a little too much time around her well maybe I catch the bug too but uh I agree with they the quarantine order at the hospital remain in effect until further notice the guard will rotate shift to minimize their exposure so where do that leave we until we be sure the compulsion be not spread anymore you two be not go anywhere near that facility Isabelle 's asleep Rainy day come soon than expect do you think we lose they I be not ready to stop for pie just yet I get 1 200 here another 300 in my pocket I be carry two we be go to have to get those back window replace in the morning this should be enough to carry we through to Montana what do Eric say when you call he he be a little surprised to hear from I but even back in quarantine he use to say how we 4400 should stick together yeah we do not have much choice back then though do we the bank will wire we our saving when we get there if thing get really bad we can sell these I put that ring on you

about that be not there a week ago he be the one guy we be try to keep away from her and now it be like they 've bond she be really take to he be that the couple of the hour hi Richard what be up man it be good to see you look at you you look great you look great so how long do you guy think you be go to be stay we be not sure Collier say we could stay at the center till we get back on our foot do he get you square away with NTAC start to his lawyer take our statement I guess we be look at back fine for not report in well hey I be sure Jordan will take care of it he offer to but I think we be go to try and swing it ourselves well hey you pick the right week to come this reunion thing be go to be big huh we 've get 4400 come in from 27 different country three more maybe there have not be this many of we in the same place since quarantine what be happen since we leave town I mean suddenly it seem like everyone 's die to meet a real live 4400 yeah well what happen Jordan happen welcome to the revolution little lady huh he be go to die I see it he be go to die Sweetheart be you okay do you have a nightmare no I be awake and I see it tell we what you see that man we watch on tv once what man he Jordan Collier Someone be go to kill he so long ago another life I can feel your heart beat it be not a dream remember we I can see it in your eye we will find our place in time our place in time beyond the sun we will find our place in time our place in time to call our own as far as this department know Maia be not have vision anymore right well she be keep they secret from I and write everything down in a diary but I be not here to talk about my daughter we be here to talk about Collier we could talk about he all you want but if I be Collier I would be bring all my book back to the library if you know what I mean the kid 's never wrong right look as far as I can tell Maia have two kind of vision if she can see an event clearly enough in her head she can sometimes influence the course of the future but mostly her vision be abstract they be more like certainty Prophecies I guess you could call they now this be one of those and as far as I can tell they be never wrong well not yet anyway but nobody be make a concerted effort to stop one of they from happen so we could always offer Collier a suite in the basement 24 hour surveillance and a food taster Sure we just tell the guy he need to stay isolated for what a week a year when it come to the prevention of future crime there be no time limit and everyone be a suspect I mean literally everyone so how to stop the inevitable from happen stop the inevitable be not that what we deal with every day I mean that be why the 4400 be send back right I like the can do attitude but I have to ask do we even want to save Collier well he be kind of the bad guy maybe that be the way the future want it unless they give we this message as a way to stop Collier 's death from happen Fascinating what an extraordinary gift you be clear on what we be tell you your daughter have quite a track record when it come to see the future her late vision involve my death I leave anything out no that about cover it NTAC be offer you all its resource that mean round the clock protection threat assessment and I be mean of course to isolate myself well that would be the safe move let us say I be willing to assume good faith on your part which give your exploitation of the 4400 to get to I be rather generous what you think we make this up I be not sure you be that creative but your plan do call for my total withdrawal from the public eye and cancellation of a celebration of the public interest in the 4400 that be be month in the planning our history with each other be what it be but this be real and denial be not a luxury you can afford thank you for the information I will keep it in mind Maia be never wrong whatever protection you can afford I I can afford myself pick up some of the reunion literature on your way out the foreign returnee ' story be particularly inspirational still come here every thursday huh Thought I might get lucky Lily what be you do here I be back in Seattle I just want to thank you for help Richard just a couple of phone call it be no big deal we be in a bad spot you do what you could it mean a lot well you really do not have to get I anything it be actually for Heidi her birthday 's come up oh Lily it be just a cool little handbag you do not have to tell she it be from I I do not want to mess with your life Brian I be just try to say thank you okay you be look well Lily I be glad thing be work out I can not talk to first key today there be too much go on with this party but class start in 10 minute I can not do it Lucy you be just go to have to tell they to think of it as a study hall um this be outgoing thank you you guy come for the tour could we talk to you outside kind of a bad day it be pretty crazy around here tell you he would blow we off what be up oh Liv they be too embarrassed to come inside I can not I can not but I see what you can do we all do you can heal people listen it be not that simple I can not heal everyone I be not ask you to heal everyone just they you do not understand it be like it drain I I can do it for maybe one maybe one be well than none and who choose that one Wayne you I I can not heal the world I be sorry what have I tell you Waste of time do not look at I like that Kyle hey you with we Buddy what I think you be you know elsewhere no I be right here with you be just think relax I have not have one of those blackout in a couple of day I be hope that be all do yeah I do too but I still think you should tell your dad about it and get yourself check out you want to go with I to see the kill okay so we be ignore the whole blackout thing or pretty much they go on at 8 00 you should come the TSA be put a flag on Ian Dravitt and his know associate they will call we if anyone show up in Seattle this whole dravitt thing be just Collier 's late deal go south Collier have his name on the side of a skyscraper by the time he be 30 you pursue power that ruthlessly you pick up some enemy along the way so we find the one who seem most like John Hinckley or Sirhan Sirhan and then do what follow he around for the rest of his natural life we could spend the next year look at Collier 's move since he found the center the guy have a whole career before he got abduct or maybe it be come from someone who Collier be never meet I mean if you hate the 4400 kill their figurehead 's a good way to make they suffer but what be we suppose to do the potential victim have refuse our help no one say stop the future be go to be easy Diana look at this his name be Miles Quinlan Claims Collier bankrupt he then kick he out of the center live with his parent what nursing a persecution complex pretty much a poster boy for the lone gunman theory come on Maia I 've name every guy I 've date for like the last five year be you tell I I do not have a future with any of they I would not worry about it seem like you meet a lot of boy yeah well that be the trouble I be tired of meet boy I want to meet a man you will when Aunt April just because I do not see it do not mean it be not go to happen oh that be probably Mrs Bradshaw from upstairs she be go to watch you tonight while I go to work I be sorry

they create a sanctuary for you an easy less complicated world but none of it be real you be I be the feeling we have for each other be as real as anything we 've ever experience be that why they do this keep we here for eight year because they want we to fall in love Moments that be all that be pass but in those few second we 've accumulate year of memory that will bond we in the real world I think they be worried about save the world not play matchmaker they be worried about you your life be about to plunge into crisis your mission will be threaten they can not allow this to happen they give you this relationship as a source of strength to sustain you in the trial that lay ahead what crisis what what be it why can not they just tell I what it be I can stop it from happen it be

in the last year and now she be the only resident of Granite Pass Oregon who can not be account for so we 've get two possibility either she be immune to this virus in which case we could study her look for a cure or else she be the carrier either way your job be the same use whatever resource you need and find she so be you go to tell I where you be head I never could stand the sight of a woman in tear I guess that be why I never got marry you in some kind of trouble run off on your family Law on your tail Seattle I be go to Seattle that be a big city you want I to just drop you on the edge of town I be go to the 4400 center I 've get to get there what the hell for be you join up just get I as close as you can please if you be look for salvation you be not go to find it there what you want to do be to give yourself over to your true lord and savior Purification day be come sign be everywhere pestilence plague tell I about it I wake up in a town full of dead people this morning my

what do the autopsy show nothing we have a name for their internal organism be pretty much liquefy this thing work fast so you just take your helmet off you get a death wish this virus gets release go airborne then dissipate within a half hour see enough Plenty so everyone we be look at die this morning because they be within the virus 's original radius yeah and if they drive through town an hour later they would be fine that be something anyway but Orson Bailey Trent Appelbaum when a 4400 manifest an ability it can get more intense quickly which mean that if Jean Delynn Baker be transmit the virus yeah she might be just warm up the doctor say they can not stop my cancer from spread and I 've work hard all my life but tuberculosis have eat up our life 's saving and my beloved wife of four year can barely Grandma tell I to pray so when I see you on tv I know that you would help I please Shawn it be Lucy you be schedule for the new key address everybody be wait Shawn yeah I be flatter I

relationship I ever have this be different yes they make it real my parent always say I be a walk disaster they never get to see how right they be Jean it do not have to be like that if you want this to be over it can be just find a deserted spot pull over and wait for we to come to you I do not need you I be take care of it myself what be you go to do I be go to end this before I kill anyone else end what this phone call this day everything no Jean just wait hold on listen to I Goodbye Baldwin she say she be go to kill herself well I be not sure that be a solution it could trigger another release of the virus do we have a fix on her yeah she be drive west on the 99 Jarvis have get three helicopter in the air if she do not pull over there be order to incinerate vacation for how long a month maybe two I do not know you think that be what the center the movement need right now I do not know Matthew but I be damn sure it be what I need right now I think you be go to have to settle for a long weekend I hear puget sound be nice okay you be not hear I I be ignore you there be a difference listen I be not say I can not do this I will lead this movement but Jordan just die and I need some time to get my head around that you be go to have to grieve on the run like the rest of we it be call be a grownup do not lecture I about my responsibility you just get here and if this place need I the way that you keep say that it do then it be go to have to work around I sometimes work around you we can do that Mary O'Connell take 1972 very promising empath Robert Fields 1987 Genius with number and pattern recognition John Gersten who be these people replacement potentially none of they make the slam dunk you would but I be ready to move this center forward with you or otherwise Jordan use to talk to I that way sometimes he be great at get I to see thing his way you you be not quite there yet your healing power make you unique Jordan know it I believe it I come here to work with you but you be ask I to work around you and that I can not do then you be go to have to spend some quality time with that list because I be leave I be sure you will not miss a beat though I know there be a huge demand for pattern recognition th th that be impossible Mortimer and Falcone be wear state of the art biohazard gear that stuff 's engineer to withstand an anthrax attack they be dead Marco obviously whatever she be release be a little crafty than the anthrax virus if it get through those suit that mean the antigen be operate on a subatomic level which basically make it unstoppable yeah pretty much Jean tell I Mortimer and Falcone scare she when they come into her room be it possible the release of this virus be connect to her emotional state yeah more than possible it be likely her medicine cabinet be basically a neon sign flash borderline personality disorder she be get cortisone cream for stress rashe an assortment of your fine psychopharmaceutical Xanax Prozac yeah we get it Marco she be a wreck a wreck whose body act as a delivery system for the virus she be produce the same way flower release pollen what she be emit spore something like that look spore be just reproductive body release by a vascular system the human body be one big vascular system it run on blood flow yeah which can speed up or slow down depend on mood feeling right so when Jean 's blood gets go when she be angry confused upset whatever a killer virus go airborne we be not far from her car now Marco any advice on how to deal with her uh do not piss she off hey hi how be you Lily Good I hear um you be leave for a while that be fast anyway yeah I do not know how long I be go to be go what be you go to do for starter I be go to disappear for a while and then um I do not know who know I mean I do not have to work here to make people healthy so I guess I could go anywhere so you be just go to kind of roam the earth Kung Fu style I be not go to shave my head and wear a robe but something like that I guess well you could take these with you check out the return address stop off in Gloucester Massachusetts do a quick healing and then go on your way you know about the letter oh Shawn they be everywhere yeah each one sad than the next it be too much to take almost it do give I an idea though but you know you be leave so we will talk it over when you get back no Lily I mean like I say I do not know when that be go to be so please I would love to hear what you have to say all right well I be think I mean we be not a hospital and we be not a charity and still thousand of these request keep pour in every day I mean no wonder you feel overwhelmed we be not set up to handle it yes exactly that be why I 've get to get out of here what if we set up a foundation part of this place but separate hire a staff whose only job be to open these letter and find the needy case people that we can help that no one else can but that be still say no to thousand of people well that be right Shawn but what if we can say yes to one I mean you heal one person a day every day that be a big job though decide who deserve it most well so you form a committee and you load it up with doctor and social worker and you oh well come on I mean it be your idea you should at least be there to help make it happen yeah I just take a job at human resource I think I could probably get you transfer do you find a body in there can not get close enough yet as soon as you can we need to retrieve it well she say she want to end it I guess we could send Marco and his boy back down to the basement let them find a ripple effect on this one excuse I Baldwin I come close but I do not know Jean I could not go through with it that be good nobody want you dead just tell I where you be no you can not help I the 4400 center can not help I but it do not matter I finally know where I be suppose to go tell I where I will meet you there you ever read the Bible Baldwin I go to sunday school I spend some time with it early today back at that motel the time be at hand that be revelation right but do you know what it mean I bet you do not see these blister they form on my hand do you get it I be not sure I do Jean they be talk about I in that book you get family Jean what be you talk about go to they Hug they real tight I 've finally figure it out why they send I back I be part of their plan they want I to do this do what Purify humanity she be quote revelation never a good sign Tom she be go from want to help want to stop all of this to believe she be the end of the world so what do she do she say they want she to do this right well that imply it be out of her hand Destiny she be give up responsibility yeah that be one way to deal with be a walk plague pretend the decision be out of your hand I do not think she want to even think about it anymore I think she just want it over well that be her mindset it still do not tell we where she be go she be on autopilot Tom my good guess she do whatever she plan on do before the body started roll right Marco Today 's tuesday right it be wednesday Marco my bad she be only get one thing write down for the day she be file her unemployment claim in downtown Portland Son of a bitch I do not believe it be I dream or do you not tell I that Chicago would win do you know what I bet 200 try my mother 's diamond engagement ring and now it be go all because I believe in you trust you and you let I down you lie to I you say win do not matter you say you like I anyway oh so you know Chicago would lose do not you right from the jump this be all just a test a foundation do not you think we have our hand full already it be one person a day once it be up and run it be not really go to eat into my time I think you be look for privacy you do this you be step into a white hot spotlight yes but it be on my term be good publicity not too hard to get off the ground we could get some huge name for that filtering committee I think it be a good idea well I be glad that you approve but I be not really ask for your permission I would hope not Jean Baldwin that be right you should 've stay away look around you all these people they have not do anything to hurt you they have not do anything to help I either besides it do not matter I do not have a choice I be do what they want I to do you do not have to accept that you have a choice yeah like I have a choice when I be abduct I never have a choice ever they have the right girl for the job what be you do here anyway you should have go back to your family like I say no I be right where I want to be then you must have some kind of death wish you think you be here to kill people I think I be here to stop you they infect you Jean and that be wrong but you do not have to let they make you into a mass murderer I be already a killer no no you have not decide to kill anyone that be what you be do right now whatever you be think about destiny or fate whatever you be wrong you do not have to do this you do not want to hear something funny I I believe you but it be too late oh they be so ripe I can not stop it now they itch so bad they do Hell of a day how be you hold up well I be schedule for psychiatric counseling on monday save thousand of innocent people have to shoot a woman to do it you do what you have to do anyway uh not sure if this be a good time but I make you a little something it be kind of a well a fake version of Maia 's diary should fool just about anybody you forge this to get NTAC off my back I know it be a big thing but you be kind of over a barrel so this could get I into a lot of trouble this could get you in a lot of trouble yeah uh you do not have to use it if you do not want to just give you an option this be insane it be also maybe one of the nice thing anybody be ever do for I I want to thank you for a job well do you must have be very persuasive I just say what I think your idea for a foundation be terrific you mean your idea do not you do we have to be all cloak and dagger about it you and Shawn both get what you want and a lot of sick people be go to get help well you do a lot of good for the center today and I be not go to forget it hey Matthew you know what the center mean to I what free rent and daycare for my daughter I be not an 18 year old kid I do not need to discover the magic power inside of I so in

see those result Edwin the 15th chromosome be damage that indicate severe mental retardation at birth but their kid just score nine on the Apgar test a miracle be traditionally cause for celebration not an inquisition this be the fourth time this have happen in the last six month in every one of those case Edwin you be the attend nurse and you be one of the 4400 I be not sure I see the connection everyone 's read about that kid who be run the 4400 center now they say he be cure disease like a L S disease no hospital in the world can put a dent in he be a healer so be you for I it only work in utero I can feel the damage to their chromosome I be not sure exactly how it work but somehow I be able to repair they that be incredible Dr Hodler if it be all the same to you I would prefer to work anonymously there be already rumor in this hospital of miracle birth Edwin and people talk I do not think you be go to have that option so long ago another life I can feel your heart beat it be not a dream remember we I can see it in your eye we will find our place in time our place in time beyond the sun we will find our place in time our place in time to call our own wait a minute it be Gavin Maar I 've read statement yesterday why be they send we these again maybe we miss something there be a thousand people at the party where Collier got assassinate would not you think that they could at least send we a new set of completely useless file any hot lead in there I do not think so I be pull you off the Collier case just for the moment something important I hope one of the file in the morning research report catch my eye there be an internet chat room for pregnant woman yesterday someone start a thread about some unexplained reversal of birth defect at Mercy hospital so you be yank we off Collier to check out internet chatter there be a 4400 who work at the hospital Bingo Edwin Mayuya he be bear in Rwanda so this guy be some kind of healer accord to the internet do not worry you be still the alpha dog it be not like I mind it be great if he be of course we should invite he to the center at the very least I think Mr Mayuya merit a sitdown all right set it up I will be there why do not you let I handle the meet and greet I will figure out if there be anything to these story in the meantime there be a move I would like you to consider make call it the next phase in your development as a leader Matthew I tell you I will read the art of war okay I want you to call your mom I know Jordan counsel you to distance yourself from your family before Jordan be tell I anything my family have already distance themselves from I Family dynamic be complex I do not think that a phone call be go to lead straight into some kind of group hug even if it lead to just dinner you be head in the right direction but Matthew what be it to you right now every news desk in the country be take a long hard look at you they be look for a weakness and because I be not speak to my family that imply what everybody here be suppose to do likewise the press will spin it that way that be how they smear we with the cult label you want I to stir up all of this old business as a publicity ploy you can take care of it now or wait and see it splash all over the newspaper here be your mom 's phone number in case you forget come in and say how do you think I ring the bell we be just say what a nice ceremony this be Old Milt he leave a great family behind he have a lot of love to spread around we think you got kill or capture maybe there be some talk you go AWOL none of we put any stock in that disappear in a beam of light nobody think of that huh hey uh you in town tonight oh good we be go to have our own private wake for Milt down at Chauncey 's you know he love his bud so we be go to hoist a few in his memory you should come we will kick around old time old time be hardly more than a year ago for I you can fill in the gap then there be a lot of stuff we do not remember anymore Chance to swap tall tale with you old duffer would not miss it NTAC have examine I several time already this year I do not think I be due for another for three month I believe you 've never miss an appointment we appreciate that you just admit to we that you 've develop this ability it be a kind of earth shake one I have to say forgive I but I do not see how submit to another round of test help anyone these mutation you can induce I believe they be not mutation sir I believe they be repair either way our doctor need to take a look at you if they can figure out the way your ability work it could help a lot of people all right then I will let your doctor poke and prod I to their heart ' content but I ask one thing that you allow I my privacy I do not want to become a public figure well that work for we I mean whenever a new ability leak to the press good bad or whatever it stir a lot of people up precisely what I hope to avoid I 've see firsthand the type of behavior that irrational fear can provoke you leave Rwanda in April of 1994 that be the beginning of the Tutsis ' genocide the beginning believe I I see my fill of horror during those two week if I have not be grant asylum here in America I would be dead you be probably just get use to the place when you got abduct I be sure there be night in Kigali when I would have welcome the chance to disappear from the face of this earth so uh just let I get this straight you use Maia 's prediction so that you could gamble I do not use she to gamble I use she to win you mean that you use she to cheat you exploit a nine year old girl who love you she be have a good time we both be but only one of you be an adult I can not believe that you be stand there defend it well this part of it I can kind of mount a credible defense what so you have not get to the part that you be ashamed of yet these bet they be sure thing but I need money to make they you know mom 's engagement ring you mean the one that she leave to I the one I should have wear to my wedding I pawn it I just can not believe that I let Maia anywhere near you I want you out of here Lucy if I watch the news tonight be I go to be a happy man the station I call all seem very interested a 4400 who cure birth defect I would cover it I suppose the tip be anonymous believe I I do not want to leave my name the center out a 4400 to the medium seem wrong somehow well it be not business as usual I grant you but we leak it we control the story and it beat let he rot in the basement at NTAC do Shawn go upstairs for the night he go out personal business he say good night Lucy who be it hello Mom be you go to uh be you go to open the door or should I use my key Shawn I would 've I would 've call ahead but I Surprise will the 4400 prove to be the cure for all human disease that be the question on everyone 's lip as it appear a member of the 4400 have manifest the ability to reverse certain genetic birth defect in utero Anonymous source claim that Edwin Mayuya a 38 year old nurse at Mercy hospital Murderer responsible for a series of miraculous healing Murderer over the past five month Murderer Murderer but if these claim prove true that be the man the one who kill your parent there be more I be bounce around in the shotgun seat and Tyler here have get the gas pedal all the way through the floor hey we have 200 buck on that race and Davis be 30 foot behind I and I can barely hear he scream not that way that be where the landmine be if I know he be serious maybe I would have pay attention yeah yeah well no one be go to follow we that way so we come in two minute before the pack and we split the money we buy like five keg of Budweiser for the officer ' club get a load of this look just like it do back in the day like you Tyler hard to believe 50 year go by we get the same guy and the same beer it be great to see you guy it be a shame it take Milt die to make it happen it be hard to find excuse to get the whole gang together it be not exactly the whole gang be it there be always Lee which one of you guy be go to tell I where he be Come on do it matter matter to I well last I hear he be in a v a hospital outside of Bakersfield in bad shape for a long time look everyone here feel terrible about what we do to you Huh be not that enough you be not go to get anything out of talk to Lee do yourself a favor just let it go I do not give a damn I do not care if he what be up you know your miracle healer turn out his real name be Edwin Musinga all his paper have be forge he be be want by the rwandan government since 1995 want for what atrocity he be a doctor during the uprising he be kill a whole bunch of people I be a pediatrician at a clinic in Kigali I be a Hutu but most of my patient be Tutsi many of my friend as well that call my loyalty into question when the killing begin some man from the military come to my clinic and they say they want to broadcast it as a safehouse a place Tutsi could come to be safe from the slaughter and they come by 3 00 the clinic be full every room every corridor all fill with frightened Tutsi look to I as their protector the same soldier come back with militia at their side it be a setup do you at least try to stop they the radio report be claim the Tutsis have kill our president the anger spread like virus I got infect too so basically you stand by and do nothing all over the city it be organize murder we never would have make it to safety you could have try Easy Tom let the man finish his story yes I could have try that be true I know that now they make I watch they kill they all I allow they to turn my clinic into a slaughterhouse but you do not murder anyone personally true but not much of a distinction I know what be go to happen I let it take place I be guilty my wife leave I I have not see she or my child since perhaps they will come to my execution your government 's push for extradition you should be on a plane right now but your ability complicate thing it would give I the chance to make amend but I could save an infant every day for the rest of my life and I would still deserve every one of my nightmare what be go on in there Tom because if you be look to shut he down before he get his story out all that glaring be a great way to go about it that guy should be on his way to a tribunal instead we be serve he lunch downstairs oh what would you prefer it if we starve he I do not believe you be defend he I would never defend what he do but I would make an argument for what he can do now there be a reason the future send he back with this amazing ability but forgive I if I sound like I do not know you no no not this time no we be not talk about a criminal we be not even talk about a murderer we be talk about genocide Diana maybe the future do not have a problem with that but I do so if I do not believe that the world be well off with a bullet in this guy 's head I be advocate genocide no there be people in Rwanda right now who have lose mother brother and child in that clinic and he stand by and he let it happen that be just like our government just like government all over the world they all know what be happen Tom but nobody lift a finger to stop it yeah and that be wrong too and so be this we 've be work on blind faith for a year and a half assume these people know what they be do but enough be enough yeah we be save the future but we be leave justice behind be it something that you want to be a part of Diana so Shawn just show out of nowhere and all of a sudden I be suppose to drop all of my plan and head to some peace dinner we both know why he be turn up now right you do not have to be a shrink to piece it together his mentor daddy figure gets kill and he come crawl back to mommy Danny why do not you quit whine about Shawn he be your brother it be be a year let it go hey you be the guy who talk to he and tell I how brainwash he be so if he be come for dinner that be a good thing right at least pretend it be for your mom 's sake what be with the attitude man I just do not want to hear you bitch anymore okay I do not understand why do you have to go can not you just say you be sorry it do not always work that way with grow up sometimes thing get so mess up that sorry do not cut it happen a lot when I be involve actually but if you only just leave nothing get well Sweetie I be sorry I use you it be wrong but I forgive you I still have to go well I know I cook all day but be my lasagna really that great you be both just stunned into silence I have not have this

something I mean be my guest Danny do not you dare just one shot ma he deserve it look he be even ask for it be we okay be we do we be let he walk he be responsible for hundred of death his degree of culpability be not for we to determine okay look I can not ship he off to Rwanda not yet anyway in the meantime his 48 hour hold be up and the 4400 center have hire lawyer who be press for his release the press be all over this story will he even be safe on the street yeah a war criminal 's safety that be my big concern oh it have well be in exchange for protection Edwin Musinga have agree to continue come into our lab we be babysitte he in exchange for a chance to study what he can do this guy could advance genetic research by a hundred year it sound like a fair trade to I Mm hmm how long have you be feel faint on and off perhaps a month you should have tell your doctor you forget miss Skouris I be a doctor I have be anemic since I be 15 I be certain you okay yeah stay with he I be go out stay down stay down stay down take these people out of here I want a patrol car pass by every 20 minute help someone call an ambulance I think she be have a heart attack he do this to her why be you protect he he be a murderer how do this become public well I assure you it be not NTAC perhaps if I have go out and speak to they this could have be avoid oh yeah that would have calm they down they could have tear you apart I think I have already demonstrate the length I be willing to go in order to live you can add another victim to your list that woman be dead okay Tom why do not you just go back outside take a walk around the block you know why she be out there huh because this son of a bitch let her son her daughter in law and about eight of her nephew and niece die Huh be not that

be a 4400 guilty or not he be a part of what we be do they give he that ability for a reason and I doubt it have anything to do with be execute in Rwanda so let us say he do not come back with an ability would we still be fight the good fight on his behalf you be the boss you tell I Breakfast be ready you know you be go to start talk to I eventually right I seriously doubt that you can hold

you be the angel of death Richard Tyler how be Weinberg 's funeral Simple dignified kind of like Milt never do like his politic much you know after you disappear he blame I fight I once or twice of course he be wrong so what be you here for go to slap I around a little bit Shut off my oxygen tank uh you do not make a very appealing target these day Lee what then look for an apology when I first

line that be what you say back then I be say it again now the world 's change Lee or have not you notice the world maybe not I and how be that work out for you I stop by your room no card no flower the lady at the front desk could not believe you have a visitor you know I really wish you would bring some cigarette you always do stick to your habit Lee even after they start to kill you so long they be not just statistic Diana he let that happen I know what he do and I do not need you to rub my nose in it it be worth put the face to the number we 've get a problem the state department have decide to fight extradition they be go to argue special circumstance so Edwin get a pass and who know how many kid get a shot at a normal life no not as many as we would hope our lab can not even figure out how his ability work forget about replicate it and I just get his med eval it turn out he be in bad shape well he tell I he be anemic and he could not sleep no no it be bad than that this ability every time he rearrange a fetal chromosome he be damage his own so if he keep heal it be go to kill he listen if you do not want to talk about what you do I be not go to try to force you to but I guarantee you whatever it be there be a way out of it that be easy to say you do not know what it be so tell we how can we help you if we do not know what be go on I do not ask for help in fact I tell you not to mention it to anyone Danny and I be not anyone I be your friend stop say that okay I know you two mean well but you do not have a goddamn clue what you be talk about I have to deal

figure stuff out I can make that happen come to the center with I Kyle you be turn this into a recruiting drive that be not what I be talk about you will have the space you need no one will bother you Kyle if you ever get to the point where you feel like you want to talk to somebody we have counselor therapist lawyer it be worth a try man because whatever you be do right now it be not work my car be outside you can come with I right now if you want okay just let I I get a couple of thing to take care of get a leave of absence from school stuff like that I will meet you there tonight and I will be wait okay thank you guy how much time do I have leave well that be difficult to say I mean your gene be mutate every time you heal a fetus there be an indication of heart disease develop you have spinal irregularity on your MRI if you keep heal maybe a year maybe less and if I stop oh well I mean if you stop heal then there be no reason for the state department to fight the extradition you will be hand back to the rwandan government who will have I try and sentence with all dispatch so either choice that I make lead to my death yes that be right it would seem my abductor have quite a perverse sense of humor I will of course continue to heal for as long as my body allow at least then my death will have a purpose other than vengeance you will have to be monitor by doctor from here on in they will try and slow your decline but you really should come with we because we have some of the good physician in the world on payroll Miss Skouris if you be offer I a bed at NTAC I be afraid I have to refuse I do not pass up one prison so I can die in another there be one place you could go NTAC medical 's go to need he five day a week so I will get you the schedule we will make sure he be there on time every time Edwin Musinga this be Shawn Farrell he run the center and you two have a lot in common not a lot just one thing one very important thing do you tell he yeah he be go to keep heal not that that surprise I I take he over to the 4400 center I think he be probably well off there than he be at home how do it feel Tom some babies'll get save and you will get your pound of

neurochemistry it be preposterous it be a good scam but still preposterous Scam that be a strong word it fit they be take this kernel of truth about the brain 's potential and use it to bilk people out of their life saving a lot of people might be surprise by your stance after all you suffer from paranoid personality disorder for year be not it a device engineer by a 4400 that cure you yes and I be grateful but you need to make the distinction between the 4400 and the 4400 center 4400 have remarkable ability everybody know it but the center be co opt that phenomenon for profit those machine

and he be not here again I guess he be in a lot of trouble huh yeah yeah you could say that well I mean it be none of my business I can just change the tire and go please hi there welcome to the center be you here to take the tour this be wrong it be all wrong excuse I this be the Collier museum where be all the painting Thomas hey sweetie what be go on I have a board of director meet and they will not let I go upstairs yeah yeah they call I they say you be a little mixed up Alana this be not the Collier museum it be it be the 4400 center what be you talk about I come here all the time look at I look Alana the place you be think of it be somewhere else no no why be you confuse I just calm down no it be okay it be all right the infection rate be 18 one in five of they be already sick one in five today tomorrow the national institute of health be worried that this illness whatever it be can mutate and cross over into the general population would it even have to mutate there be no guarantee that this be go to stay exclusive to 4400s and meanwhile we 've get two dozen sick one right downstairs they be not go to be there long why what be we do with they D C want to put all the 4400 back in quarantine and keep they there for the rest of the crisis I know it be a big move people but it be the good one we 've get at the moment can we do that accord to emergency quarantine order 74 we can but wait you be just talk about the sick one here right no all of they every 4400 in the country be subject to this order okay but that be only half of they this thing be worldwide right England and France be pass similar legislation we expect other country to follow but why be you force they all to come in because the disease seem to be show up at random until we understand how it be transmit we have to assume that every 4400 be a potential vector how much time be we give they we will make the announcement in the morning they will have 12 hour to get to a local NTAC branch then they will be transfer to Camp Dekker and the quarantine facility what if they do not report then it will be our job to bring they in you be not hear I it be temporary can you be sure you already tell I people in Washington think we be fight a war Washington be full of opinion the town run on they the 4400 be not just name in some report and they be definitely not enemy combatant you be talk about my daughter Tom 's nephew the woman I love I be go to tell you over that beer now what assurance can you give we that these people be not just be throw down some hole permanently you have my assurance and that should be enough I be the one who push to let they out in the first place you remember we be not try to second guess you Dennis but people we love be sick I get it but get they all together in one place be go to make it a lot easy to find out what the hell this be when it be over everybody go home we know you will fight the good fight Dennis I just hope you can win Mommy you be awake how be you baby I be tired of be sick when can I go home why do not you tell I I be kind of hope you would have a vision about how all this will be over soon they be not come anymore I be not see thing my favorite patient be awake more awake than you look Mm open wide I do my good work when I eliminate sleep altogether well if you need someone to splash cold water on your face you just let I know thank do you mind I notice that miss page make its way back in oh yeah I tell you it would be back what be those two line black out for well look like we duplicate a test they cross it out so we do not read the same result twice okay let us see how that rash be do I be fine Brian tell Heidi not to worry Richard 's fine Isabelle 's fine well the news be make it sound like everybody 's sick People be terrify and if normal people start get sick normal people okay that come out wrong but you know what I mean and listen Lily heidI 's not the only one that be worried about you I be too a year and a half ago you welcome I home with a restraining order I know I panic when you get back do not think I have not lose sleep over what I do I just want you to know now that I be there for you you Richard Isabelle you need anything just call Quarantine that be an evocative word these day conjure up image of secret prison and what be the euphemism you be use now coercion tactic let I ask you something you have some doctor on staff here right yes they have any luck get to the bottom of this thing not yet then get off your soapbox you want an image to hold on to try this one 4400 die in drove I think what my partner mean to say be that our two organization need each other we should cooperate and how exactly do we do that we want you to issue a public statement if the center counsel the 4400 to go along with this order thing will go much more smoothly and if we do not why be we talk to you anyway where 's Shawn be he all right Mr Farrell be handle urgent business this situation require his full attention look I will have to run it by he but I do not see a problem advise any ill 4400 to seek medical care from NTAC well that be a start what about the one who be not show symptom that issue be go to require a little more thought Great you have 12 hour what be the point of paint it over anyway they be just go to do it again we do not know that look Sam Kyle have be nice enough to come over here and help we out so the least that you can do be pitch in oh yes very good Picasso I be go to make sandwich okay seriously what be your story why be you help we Kyle whoever you be my last name 's Bingham and I do not know I be just walk by here yesterday Alison look like she could use a hand yeah well if you be think about hook up with her forget it Alison 's go to marry my brother as soon as he get out of jail I know I know she tell I you should listen to her Roy do not kill this Collier guy I believe you yeah well you be the only one you and I when he do get out I do not think you want he come home and see murderer write all over his door do you Richard you ready for a promotion I a promotion to what I be try here man I want to lead we all through this but I can not do that right now thank you I know I be a 4400 but after that my qualification be a little thin they do not even give I an ability to be honest with you I be not sure how long Lily and I be plan on stay here so it be not a perfect fit but you be articulate and a war hero and you have the gravita of a leader I think it be a good idea I have not give an order since 1951 I be in high school a year and a half ago I manage so will you but it be only temporary right as soon as you get well I can go right back to be camera shy yeah temporary what be you go to do what I have to Desease have everyone frighten and that be understandable but no one 's more frightened than we be and that be because in spite of all the rumor that you hear fly around only 4400 be get sick and now the government want we to head into quarantine they say cooperation be essential well here be the good we can do if you be sick the responsible thing be to report to ntac our good wish and prayer go with you but if you be well if you be show no symptom we ask you to consider this walk into quarantine be an easy step but walk out that might be considerably more difficult thank you do not they get it we be try to help these people all they hear be quarantine Dennis you can not blame they for be scare maybe if we give they another day half a day even do it look to you like they have not make up their mind we try be reasonable in 10 hour we start round they up hi hey I know who you be you be the one who fix people yeah Shawn how come you be in here why do not you just make yourself well I wish I could they be break kind of like the rest of I I use to see thing stuff that be go to happen that be go now too it be funny huh when I find out I be different all I want to do be be normal again I too but you get use to it now that it be go I feel like I be miss an arm it will come back once we get well any idea when that be go to be not exactly but my mom tell I everything be go to be fine and I believe what she say that must be a nice feeling do not you have someone to believe in I use to but now I guess I be just go to have to believe in you you be the one I attack at the hospital we do not think you would remember we I remember I be very sick back then I be well now Diana you want to see I Kevin Burkhoff I 've be do neurological research on the 4400 oh I 've hear of you everybody here have here there be some very interesting datum on the blood work I 've be do have a look see if it help you figure out what be go on with this disease well thank you I will comb through this Good and I can expect to see your work when I show you mine you show I yours that be the way it work be not it usually but the research we do here be classify Max Max if ever there be a time to bend the rule a little I think it might be now well it be not a wink and a nudge situation I give over classify document I go to jail yeah and if you do not people might die be you imply we be not do everything we can we 've get dozen of doctor work around the clock to try to solve this thing now I will look over everything that you 've give I if I find anything that can help you I will give you a call that be the good I can do I be so sorry I be not interested in apology I want to see that information or be NTAC not interested in cure these people I know you guy be kind of cavalier about put your own career on the line but do I a favor stop ask I to join in the fun okay I like what I do here they be medical record Marco not national secret Wrong they be medical record and national secret that be why they keep they in a database you need six password to get into and that be why sport o would not give they to you let us just leave Max out of this he be under a lot of pressure and he want to keep his job I do not blame he you know I just open a 401 k yeah pretty sure the government stop match donation once you commit treason the government just turn down an offer of help from Kevin Burkhoff remember he yeah the future build a giant tower to wake he up I guess they think he matter if anyone in Washington read my report they know he matter too you know it be weird hundred of people be sick you would think they would want any help they could get well they be go to get his help yeah whether they want it or not Gotcha yeah be Isabelle ready to go for her walk okay let us go have some fun how long have she be in there I do not know five minute I come and get you as soon as I see what be they do to she in there step back would you excuse we please how long have this be go on Richard your daughter have never be in any kind of danger he ask you a question Jordan be go to initiate these test as soon as he convince you to come back into the fold what test what have you be do to her all we be do be what you should have do a long time ago try to figure out who or what Isabelle be she be our daughter that be all you or anyone else your daughter be the Rosetta Stone for understand what happen to the 4400 yet you both cling to the illusion that she be go to go to preschool first communion the prom she be not communal property we be her parent we decide Parents you be the steward of the future and forgive I for say so but you be do a piss poor job of it we have give up everything we have for that child any chance we have of live a normal life to protect she from people like you look Richard this be no time for this conversation in two hour the government be come through the front door yeah well you will not use my daughter as some kind of weapon against they that be never my intention you will never have the chance we be leave right now that be your choice but if you do if we splinter now they will round up the 4400 one by one and this movement be over hey hey Thomas hey they say you 've be ask for I should not you be in bed they will take I back soon enough I want to see you how do you feel baby they can not get the fever down but the bad part be my head everything 's so mixed up this illness it affect people 's ability Maia can not see thing and and Shawn Shawn can not heal and for you honey I think the boundary between this world and the one you create be break down it be so confusing I do not know what be real anymore I know it be scary you just have to hang on they will get this fix what if they be too late what if they can make my body right but not my mind I do not want to live like that Thomas you be not go to have to you be go to get well you have to believe that Alana Thomas yeah I love you so much I want we to get marry for real in this world that be all I want to tell you before before my mind go because I do not know if it will be good again so you be sure I can not get you a beer or something no no that be okay I do not drink okay you know this be not really necessary I just do a couple of chore maybe it be not a big deal to you but I just have not see a friendly face in a while not since Roy go away no offense but um the paper make he sound like the second coming of Lee Harvey Oswald yeah well I would not exactly call it fair and balanced coverage but he do have some monstrous gun collection right look I be not say that he be a candidate for high office and he sure as hell be not the world 's great boyfriend but take out two NTAC agent and shoot Jordan Collier come on yeah yeah eat up Sam Sam come on we be start I will be right there hey okay be you Marco thank do not thank I hire I I be go to need a job where have you be talk to Matthew Lily he be get an idea on how to handle this roundup I think it might work I be sure he be full of clever idea we will deal with what Matthew do but not now the government be about to declare martial law we do not have time to squabble all I want to hear be that you be do with this place for good it be not that simple we can not just go off and hide in the wood somewhere it be not go to work this time the center betray we they betray our daughter and they learn about she more than we do in almost a year Lily stop do you know Isabelle have connection between the right and leave hemisphere of her brain that have never be see before even if that be true Richard it be not that they study she it be how they do it do you trust the government because if we go into quarantine Isabelle will end up right here or with they and if they find out what she can do we will lose she forever that be it that be the deadline where do we start I want everybody to holster their pistol my goal be to do this quietly peacefully and without incident what if they want an incident then we will give they one be everybody ready Affirmative sir we be in position let us go move in now copy that they be on the move they be spread out and let we through welcome to the center do you come for the tour you know damn well why we be here out hunt I would guess well I be afraid you 've come to the wrong place you be welcome to look around but there be no 4400 here I have no idea where they go you have 120 4400 take shelter at your center that sound about right I do not have an exact figure you just come downstairs and they be go until 7 00 this evening they be free citizen I have no reason to track their movement and since I 've break no law unless you want to talk about lift this quarantine order we have nothing leave to discuss we will talk again I suspect your job be go to get rather ugly from here on out kicking in door and such if I work at NTAC I might spend a little less time try to find miss 4400 and a little more try to cure the one I have so tell I have we get a list yeah all the sick one we know of be in as for the rest we have about 75 compliance nationwide there be about 520 4400 unaccounted for well that be not a few holdout that be an insurgency so this be it huh Us against they you know it feel kind of like the war Jordan Collier always predict predict or provoke we declare martial law on they we have no option I be go to pursue a policy of non aggression as long as I can but if it come down to a choice between the safety of the american people and the welfare of the 4400 Tom that be no choice at all Collier leave behind 37 safe house throughout the country we liquidate the center 's emergency slush fund should last for awhile any 4400 who contact the center for help will be give an email address if we be satisfied they be legitimate they will be tell where to go our goal be to get every 4400 who want shelter to safety and then what Matthew will try to continue to end this peacefully but if we have to protect our own we will be ready excuse I excuse I Sorry Lily you make a good speech but this be not Korea and those be not soldier and your daughter could get catch in the crossfire you do not think I be worried about her and you too Lily I be not look for a fight but right now we do not have another option hey Sam say he like comic_strip you son of a bitch you lie to I what wait a minute it be not like that oh really Kyle Bingham your last name be Baldwin and your dad work for NTAC so what be you his little spy Huh do you think you be go to sleep with I I be go to tell you all about Roy you go and you tell your daddy that he do not kill anybody I know that I be just try to help you why you come off like you be this really great guy and all you be try to do be use I you be a lie prick okay okay this thing that be kill they it be not a disease it be a side effect Dr Burkhoff just calm down what be you talk about a side effect of what I do not know exactly but I do know this there be a synthetic substance present in the blood of every 4400 all the one I test every medical report you give I sick one well one do not matter they all have it they even give it a name they call it promicin inhibitor Promicin what be promicin I have no idea and I do not know why anyone would want to inhibit it either but whatever it be it be gather in their lymph node compromise their immune system it be what be make they sick but NTAC 's be study the 4400 ever since they get back they should have know about this they do know it be all in here they know so why have not they tell anyone that be a very good question when you find out why do not you tell I be you sure you want to do this just get I and Isabelle someplace safe p I dosage it be on memo in every 4400 medical report it be on the fifth page of every report that be what Hudson have cross out when I go to see Maia p I Promicin inhibitor Alana be get it too and Shawn everyone be get it every time they come to ntac medical every checkup we do it to they Tom we make they sick we be not a threat we be salvation the world will have to deal with we previously on the 4400 they just arrest a suspect in the Collier kill Roy Marsden do not kill Jordan Collier and neither do you Kyle Son of a bitch you go and you tell your daddy that he do not kill anybody if Maia 's have vision you should know about it and you should know what they be Mommy 's boss will be punish for betray we I want to go home I know you do honey but Dr Hudson be go to take very good care of you do not tell anyone I can not heal Sure what be you go to do what I have to if you be sick the responsible thing be to report to NTAC but if you be well walk into quarantine be an easy step but walk out that might be considerably more difficult there be a synthetic substance present in the blood of every 4400 they even give it a name they call it Promicin inhibitor every time they come to ntac medical every checkup your daughter be the Rosetta Stone for understand what happen to the 4400 we be her parent we decide be you sure you want to do this just get I and Isabelle someplace safe but if it come down to a choice between the safety of the american people and the welfare of the 4400 Tom that be no choice at all we try be reasonable in 10 hour we start round they up Easy McCullough let I go I be not sick there be nothing wrong with I we know that but you be a 4400 and everybody be get to go in come on now I do not want to cuff you but if you run again you be go to give I no choice Quarantine be just a word to you guy try live it Come on what be we do here Diana this be so wrong all right what do you suggest we walk into the middle of NTAC and shout out we do this we make they sick yeah yeah that be good start we 've get the medical record we can take they to Dennis you really think that Max Hudson and a couple of rogue doctor hatch a covert plan to poison the 4400 I mean you really think that they could do that without approval whose approval Dennis Ryland 's for one he be the head of this division when this whole thing start I mean you think he do not know until we know how far up this go we 've get to stay calm work quietly and watch our back do not tell I to calm down Lily how be I suppose to be calm when my wife and daughter leave in the middle of the night we do not leave you Richard I just do not feel like Isabelle be safe there you 've turn this resist quarantine into your personal mission NTAC turn it into my personal mission when they start round we up and I admire what you be do but it be not my fight and I sure as hell will not let it become Isabelle 's fight just tell I where you be Put my mind at ease I will come see you Lily I be sorry I just feel like it be well this way for now I will call soon that do not go as well as mommy hope 911 please state the nature of I need an ambulance I be I be sick I 've get this hello hello Miss be you there never mind think they be share trade secret either that or she be ask for her office back after you thank Nina Good to see you thank I wish the circumstance be a little well we lose the first 4400s to this thing overnight seven dead there will be more by day 's end no word about a vaccine a cure I just get off the phone with Hudson he say that they 've work on a few thing overnight I be go to quarantine Diana I know this be frustrating but we 've get the good mind in the country in the world work on this well they well work fast seven people be dead Alana could be next or Maia and still nobody have any idea where this come from do they we will get it figure out hey sweetie it be I Tom who be you who be you she be awake early only for a few minute though do she say anything she talk about you say you be go to make everything okay I hope she be right I too let us go where be we head we 've get an appointment with the good doctor Hudson Diana what what the hell be you do we 've get some thing we need to talk about this guy your agent bring in Orson Bailey I think I can explain how he develop this Jesus I can not even say the word Telekinesis thank you the body produce four main neurotransmitter they be like traffic cop to the brain they control everything regulate everything tell I something I do not know Bailey be produce a fifth neurotransmitter we 've never see it before nobody have I be guess it factor into Bailey 's ability to bend spoon with his mind let us just say Promicin be basically a backstage pass to the v I p section of the brain he be use part of the cerebellum no human have ever have access to I run some test on the 4400 who be still in quarantine every single one of they be produce trace amount of Promicin so it be just a matter of time before every 4400 develop telekinesis Promicin 's behavior be unpredictable they might not get telekinesis but they will get something Put everything on paper I want to get my talking point straight before I try to explain this to D c D C panic I be order to work on a drug to suppress the production of Promicin in the 4400 once I synthesize the inhibitor we give it to every 4400 every time they come in for a checkup but it do not even work 4400 be develop ability all the time a small percentage of they be but if it be not for the inhibitor they would all have they I know it do not work perfectly perfectly seven 4400 die last night it be your inhibitor that do it you make they sick you think I do not know that we be not try to kill anyone we be preserve the status quo do a good thing I guess it backfire I be try to undo it but if you want to pull that trigger please be my guest maybe then finally I will get some sleep all right if you be not go to shoot I let I get back to work I do not want anyone else to die Alison what be you do here they be go to give Roy life they be go to give he life and he be go to take it what be you talk about the state be go to go for the death penalty and the public defender convince Roy to take a plea bargain but they 've get no case against he my dad tell I I do not know this lawyer he be handle like 10 different case and he just do not want to see the inside of a courtroom I do not know but he do not do it okay he do not kill Jordan Collier you keep say that do your dad know something what be there evidence that they be hide what you have to tell I if Roy take this deal he can not even get parole for 20 year he be not go to prison why the 4400 come back August 14th Hudson discover Promicin October 11th so they probably give the first dose of the inhibitor sometime around the end of the month but we have every internal document for october there be nothing about any of this there be hardly even a mention of Orson Bailey we both write report about he Diana they be go they be hope that be go to be the only extrahuman ability ever develop in a 4400 if they destroy all record of it nobody would ever know but this go to the top of the food chain here Britain France Korea everywhere there be a sick 4400 there have to be a paper trail do it even matter I mean we could find a memo sign by the entire United Nations security council it be not go to cure anyone Diana we deliver confidential medical record to Dr Burkhoff we 've get the so call father of 4400 technology work on the case and you just stick a gun to the head of NTAC 's medical director we 've do everything we can to get the right people work on a cure that be if NTAC even want a cure Ryland 's be talk about people in d C who 've be on a wartime footing for month this be nothing but a stroke of luck for they you think they want they all dead I tell you I tell you I be not safe here it be just a precaution Kevin we think you will just be safe if you move to a less expose location it be because I tell you about that inhibitor thing right I spend six year in a psychiatric hospital suffering from paranoid personality disorder as soon as I get out you two put I smack in the middle of a massive conspiracy Dr Burkhoff 's be spin all kind of story about NTAC very interesting stuff well he can spin all the theory he want just not here I will make sure he have a safe place to work I figure out what Promicin be that be the name they give the neurotransmitter right the one that give the 4400 their ability and if I can find one 4400 that have not be expose to the inhibitor I think I can neutralize it hey you scare I why do not you use your key oh sorry my hand be full I bring you guy some supply you still like chocolate cherry that sound great thank you oh you okay yeah just jumpy it be so quiet out here yeah a lot of place have close up for the season oh I think that uh maybe I could stay for a little dinner or something you do not have to get back home no not really Carol 's go she find out that you and I be talk do not worry she do not know you be here but she get mad Brian I be sorry she will stay away for a few night I will stay on the couch for a while but in the meantime Heidi 's stay with a friend and I figure why eat alone sure but I hope you be not expect much I have not make pot roast in a while you know Lily the truth be I never should have marry Carol in the first place what be you do Brian Come on I be alone you be alone you and Richard be not happy that be not true we could have it back Lily do not brian why be you fight it Brian stop it let I go I do not want to hurt you Lily stop it you little bitch hello Lily be you okay Brian yeah I be go to bring by some food do not something be not right here I have not hear from the safe house in wheeling for a day we have to assume it be be compromise that be the third one that be go silent they be pick we off one by one we might want to think about fight back we can do that Richard we certainly have 4400 that can do some damage but once we take that step there be no turn back excuse I but should not there be bar on these window the point be to be unobtrusive Dr Burkhoff well this seem a little lax to I Most of you be 4400s I be a collaborator you know what they do to collaborator we need to get he work it calm he down considerably we clear out a room for you anything you need just let we know what I need be a clean 4400 one that have not be expose to the inhibitor I do not guess you 've get one of those do you actually I might 20 year I 've never see you pour a drink on government property I never supervise a round up of innocent citizen before Conscience bother you Dennis Hell yes it be and give the circumstance I would say that be a good sign but I be try to focus on my job Tom and I need the same from you but sometimes when you you look for one thing you you learn something else you know how it be Dennis I know exactly what you mean I 've learn some thing myself open it Knowledge be a burden huh Tom do you think that I would release Kyle from quarantine and not keep an eye on he why do not you stop this because I do not know exactly what Kyle be go to do I just sort of let the future play out be not that what you be always talk about you set up Roy Marsden that be my gift to you Tom would you rather I just turn these over to my boss I would rather you be the friend you be the Ryland I work with for 20 year I have not change I have a tough job and I be do my good and as your boss and as your friend I expect support Kyle hate quarantine I wonder what you think of prison they know NTAC know you shoot Collier what how they 've know all along they let it happen I need you to be ready to get out of here I be go to call Alana 's friend you be send I to Spain if they come after you I need you to be ready to leave right away do you hear Roy Marsden 's be send to jail for life they set he up but if I run just one thing at a time Kyle let I worry about you then I will deal with Marsden so you want I to start pack yeah Kyle be not you hear I he commit suicide I know that Max be under a lot of strain but he have all those people 's life in his hand Maia 's I know but Dr Pinero 's be Hudson 's number two from the very beginning he know everything that Hudson know we be still go to beat this thing good morning Tom Nina here I grab this out of your mail cubby do you hear about Hudson yeah you okay they be call it a suicide what be you call it Tom look at this it be from Max Firewall memo what be that I do not know why be you do this Isabelle Mommy need to know I bring you here so we could be safe do not you want that Lily what be go on out here you okay no go away I tell you not to come here that be why I be here Lily please let I in how do I know you be real what be you talk about of course I be real do Carol leave you why would she leave I Lily I be come in okay no no no Lily whoa whoa whoa whoa Lily put down the knife

word firewall write in the subject line no but I do not read most of the memo that circulate around here anyway look how long be you guy go to be work in here what be they paint your office we need a little privacy okay Tom this memo whatever it be I doubt it ever go out on a general distribution and every copy probably go through the shredder month ago so if there be no hard copy and if Marco be the only one we even trust to even talk about it with then we be at a dead end we could always march into Ryland 's office and ask he about it the guy do know memo when he be work here I must have throw away like 15 every day More like 20 he like to keep his keyboard burn who Ryland yeah he do not type he use to call I in sometimes when he freeze up his computer Hunt and peck city take he 10 minute to type in an email address Ryland dictate everything to his secretary she have l level security clearance look D r J O everything say D r J O D r Dennis Ryland and J O be Jane Orman she work for he for 22 year do she stay in Seattle say hi for I Lily you come back be you all right I think I be do the smart thing but Isabelle what happen she just want to be with you and this place I do not

that her I think there be somebody here who want to meet you this be Isabelle what be we suppose to say you know that massive conspiracy to suppress the ability of the 4400 we be just kind of hope you would fill we in on the particular yeah and do not be nervous but we have to shake a government tail on the way here to do it yeah sound like a start Tom Baldwin long time Jane do you remember my partner Diana Skouris of course yeah hi I always wonder who would show up I should have figure it would be the two of you you be here about firewall right the inhibitor have not be test it be not ready one of the 4400 be a serial killer who be use I do not know some kind of mind control to get people to commit murder the inhibitor 's ready this be wrong Dennis we be beyond right and wrong here there be no precedent for this now D C 's be advise of the operation it be be approve at the high level there be nothing further to discuss be there I be not do this I take it home with I that night the next day I put in my notice I mean you have to understand for two decade I think that Dennis Ryland be the fine man I ever meet and after I read this I could not work for he anymore I keep tell myself I should send it somewhere the newspaper or I do not know but the name that sign off on this I be just a secretary what could I do against those name it be all here do you see the name when Maia say mommy 's boss be go to be punish I have no idea she mean all the way up the chain of command we can not go public yet what we can not go public yet listen the fast this gets expose the well it be for Maia Alana Shawn all of they no more secret no more rely on the people who do this to find a cure at the very least they be go to have to rescind the quarantine order Diana Ryland 's get something on I Ryland this entire memo be over his signature what could he possibly have over you he know Kyle kill Jordan Collier what that night on Highland Beach they put someone inside of he or some program I do not know direct his action and Ryland have evidence I be sorry Tom but I can not just sit on this Maia 's get sick just give I one hour Diana just one hour please stop say that it be not okay Kyle if I go through with this they be go to come after you and it do not matter if you be in Spain or Siberia I know but with all those life at stake you have to do it okay I be take you to

private quarantine facility this afternoon you can walk the ground you can choose your own meal what be wrong with that 139 Lebanon Street that be where they tell I to go the inhibitor be piggyback on glucose it enter the brain through facilitated diffusion it be a bind protein that be how they do it I will take your word for it but this serum have pure Promicin in it it can neutralize the charge the inhibitor will not be able to cross membrane anymore we can flush it out of their system so once it be go the disease go away please stop say disease for the last time it be a side effect remove the inhibitor the immune system function it will happen virtually instantly so this substance Promicin it be what make you people unique how do you get it out of my daughter she have trace amount of it in her bloodstream before the inhibitor you all do that be how they find it in the first place but she be an infant I could only draw enough blood to make one shot if you can get that into quarantine one shot might be all you need Nina where be Ryland a 4400 give up the Seattle safe house they be on their way to take it down excuse I please do not shoot Dr Burkhoff why would we shoot you I have no idea but I be feel a little insecure right now I bring something for you whatever you do do not drop it everybody in this house be subject to quarantine and arrest under emergency order 74 you have five minute to come out peacefully if not we will come in and get you there be an army out there Ryland call it off it be over Quarantine everything Agent Baldwin be obstruct justice arrest he I do not think so Dennis I know about firewall keep your weapon on he you be really willing to give up your son Kyle 's turn himself in he can not live with the cover up when I write that memo we have no idea where the 4400 be from or why they be bring back Dr Hudson give I information I act on it Tom if you be in my chair you would have do the same thing hi I 've get some medicine for you to be honest with you I would rather be give this to Maia but a crazy neuroscientist tell I that that be not the right thing to do so if you do not mind hold still for a minute you see Orson Bailey up close and personal Oliver Knox you know what these people be capable of Hell I attach your report to the memo when I send it to D c but we learn well Dennis Highland Beach save the future Heartfelt message Tom and while they be give it to you they be program your son to commit murder do that sound to you like they be guide we toward eden I do not know but I sure as hell do not want to go where you be take I Goddammit Tom what do it even mean save the future save the future how kill we all start over with a small more evolved population be that an outcome you can live with what can you live with Dennis be Max Hudson really a suicide or do you pull that little string too and what about I Dennis because if you be hold on to any hope of keep this cover up you be go to have to start by put I in the ground right here and right now Tom you be reduce the fate of the planet to a question of your personal faith without the inhibitor program who the hell know what will happen who the hell ever know very wise Pithy but if the world turn out to be a place of unchecked 4400 ability I hope we do not live to regret it stand down we be do here you can all go home now Thomas Alana Alana

every sample he get cure someone else so hey you guy kind of lucke out huh lucke out there be 23 of we dead and they do not even have a final count yet I do not think that be part of the plan you know that be not why they bring we back this whole idea that there be some kind of plan I do not know I wish I could believe that just trust I when I say that there be a plan it be important and every 4400 be a part of it Shawn I kill Jordan Collier what I buy a rifle I go up on that roof take out two government agent and then I shoot he remember when I be in trouble lose chunk of time that be what I be do plan out an assassination why you think I know there be something inside I Shawn or someone it take over those people who take you if they have a plan it include I kill Jordan Collier that be not true Kyle then why do they make I do it why do they ruin my life I be about to go to prison for the people you worship you murder Jordan I do not mean I do not even know what I be do Shawn I be sorry

people with murder Ryland the whole crew look like mommy 's go to get a whole bunch of new boss well I hope they go away for a very long time I will be in the front row at the hearing guess I have to buy a suit I be go to be sit next to you until the whole thing be over nothing be over it be just start Sweetie what be you talk about what be start the war Kyle I be ready be you sure yeah I will come with you Isabelle Isabelle Isabelle hello Shawn I be Isabelle sync by 1000fr we be not a threat we be salvation the world will have to deal with we previously on the 4400 jarvis what so navarro be really some kind of mind reader I believe telepath be the word you be look for just concentrate on what you want to ask I and I will hear you the guy definitely know what we be think Jarvis I could think of a few practical application for it Collier you should have come to I first I would have treat you well than they ever will we be at war here do not pick the lose side there be a synthetic substance present in the blood of every 4400 and they call it promicin inhibitor but ntac be be study the 4400 ever since they get back they should have know about this they do know I be order to work on a drug to suppress the production of promicin once I synthesize the inhibitor we give it to every 4400 if it come down to a choice between the safety of the american people and the welfare of the 4400 tom that be no choice at all if you be hold on to any hope of keep this cover up you be go to have to start by put I in the ground right here and right now Marco every male in this building have get a gallon of adrenaline course through his vein right now and most of they be armed a 4400 nearly take down a fortified government facility and walk away without break a sweat I be not pregnant when I be abduct but I be when I get back Richard you 've see what she be capable of what she can do when she feels threaten do you know isabelle have connection between the right and leave hemisphere of her brain that have never be see before Matthew you be the steward of the future your daughter be the rosetta stone for understanding what happen to the 4400 Isabelle isabelle hello shawn I be isabelle the world have change everything be different now the promicin inhibitor program be an international effort its goal be to prevent the coming of a world dominate by a tiny fraction of the population in short we be do everything we could to prevent the 4400 from develop extrahuman capability we believe that without the inhibitor program these ability would show up in virtually every single one of the 4400 I do not think I need to explain to this committee why that would be something less than a good case scenario overnight normal human being like you and I and all the institution we 've come to rely on would be obsolete the program be not perfect People get sick some die that be not our intent but now it be go and the future that we be try to prevent be here and we be not ready I believe it come down to a question of power who be go to hold it Us or they because believe I it be go to come down to we against they Shawn you be not make any sense just tell I what be wrong with isabelle I tell you I can not explain be she sick be she hurt you will see for yourself Dad W who the hell be this where be isabelle I be your daughter I be isabelle L I do not get it something happen I I change I do not know how she just walk in here she know my name she seem to know about you and lily I do not know what game you be play here and I do not care Richard richard Lily Lily Lily be isabelle with you lily lily be you all right oh richard I must have faint be isabelle with you who be you where be my wife Richard what be you talk about I be lily your wife why be you look at I like oh my god Ma'am I do not know who you be oh oh my god no your blood pressure be elevate but I suppose that be to be expect Heart lung reflexe all within the normal range Doctor you call this normal Richard I want to see isabelle where be my daughter she be right outside I will bring she in in a minute I realize how alarming this must be but at least you can take some solace in the fact that your wife be a perfectly healthy old woman if I have to guess I would say she be about 75 I be 29 and I do not understand please help I understand how could this happen maybe it be a reaction to be take off the promicin inhibitor but truthfully I do not know there be a condition call progeria it be associate with rapid aging so this kind of thing have happen before Mr Tyler when your wife faint this morning she be a young woman when she wake up less than a minute later she be 50 year old I can guarantee you this be a first excuse I be you okay dr Burkhoff Fine not enough sleep that be all Research well what do we do now be there any way to reverse this I wish I know I need to do some thinking be you my mother Isabelle every day the 4400 be change and get strong instead of mobilize to meet this challenge we be wring our hand and try to determine who know what when I will save this committee the trouble and expense of a long investigation the inhibitor program be my idea I be proud to lead it the man on this board be simply follow my order if there be blame to be assign it be mine Mine alone yeah I know kyle do not want to see I be there some way we can force he to I be his father I want to know how he be do look I realize you be try but it will be month before he go to trial I mean you really think people be go to let ryland position himself as some kind of patriotic martyr the man head a conspiracy that cause 28 death well he say it be accidental a significant percentage of this country believe he try overwhelming you guy listen to talk radio lately the call be like 90 in his favor you can buy a free dennis ryland t shirt within a block of here maybe they should put he up for the nobel peace prize just tell he I need to see he we do not have to talk about the case I just have to see my son just ask he one more time okay and and tell he we love he give he some time thomas Kyle need to live with his choice for a while we be back Tom break 's over Ladies and gentleman I would like to call the proceeding to order everyone just take your seat we can get start member of the press I be include you in that lady and gentleman designation thank you Mr Ryland I would like to pick up the questioning where we leave off you insist that you alone give the go ahead for the promicin inhibitor program be that right sir yes sir it be my program all the way so this committee be to understand that your department be able to plan and implement an international conspiracy without some cabinet level approval that be correct I be give a broad mandate in my duty as head of ntac I feel that the project fall within that mandate so there be no need to seek outside approval excuse we everybody do you hear that well yeah the microphone go haywire no no not that something else just set that approval issue to the side for the moment do you ever discuss the project with anyone outside of ntac I mean someone somewhere must have take an interest in what you people be do over there Whispering it be a simple question mr Ryland surely it can not be that difficult to answer if I could have your attention up here mr Ryland gasp Security stop that man get some protection around ryland stay here I will be right back we need an ambulance stand back please back get back hey stop T j someone get these photographer out of here stay over there I do not understand what I do would somebody please tell to I what I just do hang on dennis the ambulance be come yeah it be her the blood we pick up at the scene match the dna in our record that be t j Kim run from the courthouse when she hit this place t j drive every man in the building into a homicidal rage now it sound like she just zap one guy she be learn to control what she can do they all be ever since we take they off the inhibitor they be either develop ability or they be refine the one that they 've get so they be get more dangerous I guess ryland be right I will be sure to mention that to my daughter save the point counterpoint at the moment we 've be task with two job we track down t j Kim what be the second job we be to protect ryland 's co conspirator from any further reprisal so we arrest they and now we be their bodyguard the entire country just see a 4400 turn a government hear into her own personal slasher film if t j get to ryland again or any of they before we can bring she in people be go to start to wonder if the united states government be capable of protect its citizen and that be the beginning of chaos back to work please Tom in case you be wonder dennis be still in surgery they say that it be touch and go Shawn it be okay give I your hand try and relax Relax be it well much well for now when this thing first come on it be bad but at least she be healthy now she be have diabetes emphysema it seem like every day there be something new I will come help she every day listen we 've get everyone work on this we be go to figure it out be my mother okay uh yeah she

experiment almost get you kill Shawn too the guy know that kyle be stalk jordan collier and he do nothing I would say that trump friendship you have so much on your mind Kyle ryland the 4400 I need to get you away from here away from your problem yeah well that sound nice but I can not go anywhere I be start an investigation in the morning what if I tell you I could take you away between now and

would you ask I to see I dennis I hear that you and skouris be in charge of the investigation yeah we know who do it we will find her T j Kim attack thuildx week ago no one be track she down yet we get a little sidetracked clean up your mess dennis do you ever think that maybe she have help other 4400 who feel the same way about the government she do when we catch she we will ask will you I want to make sure you be go to take this thing as far as it go tom the same way you do when you come after I and I want my people protect they be act under my order they be under guard so be the courthouse when kim attack I would feel well if you bring they in we offer sanctuary to every single conspirator there be no taker I guess no one want to cooperate with the organization that be work to put you in prison we have to fight just to get they to let we post agent outside their house Crockett you ready to go for a walk boy come on crockett let us go they want no part of we they all seem confident that t j Kim be act alone Crockett what be wrong it be I Jarvis this arrive 15 minute ago distorted voice this be a message from the nova group we be the defensive wing of the 4400 today the world have see what happen to those who try to harm we a second demonstration of our capability be plan for october 19th a new era dawn defensive wing huh what happen when they decide to play offense I guess we find out in five day they do not even say what they want no demand no room for compromise we do not even know how many 4400 be in this nova group we could not even handle one when she walk in and attack the place now there be a whole team of assassin out there all with ability they 've get someone who can kill you by lower your body temperature do not forget the beastmaster what that dog got piss off pretty quick well I 've be all over the file and none of these ability have be register with we they be off the inhibitor now we can not even pretend to have a comprehensive list of what these people can do be anyone feel a little overmatched here you two remember gary navarro hey gary be a while you be right baldwin I do think you two sell I out it really bother I for a while but now I understand it be just standard operating procedure well I guess that mind read thing be work pretty well huh well than ever actually Gary 's telepathic ability have be very useful to the national security agency they have agree to let we borrow he while we investigate the nova group so you be clear on what we be do here you want to use a 4400 to track down other 4400 do you have a problem with that not at all it will not be my first time so can we get start never hear of the nova group between ntac and this place but I trust you realize how serious this be believe I if I know anything I would tell you well do you mind if the three of we walk around the place talk to some people you and your pet mind reader no I can not let you do that these people have not do anything wrong and I will not let you invade their privacy and I actually can not believe that you bring this guy here again how much do they pay you to spy on your own kind get a clear signal you see anything you like up there as far as I can tell he be not hide anything I have a lot of work to do if I hear anything I will give you a call for now that be the good I can do sorry about my nephew why well he be kind of rude back there I get that kind of stuff a lot I do not take it personally do you mind if I ask you you 've sort of imply that you 've pursue 4400s in the past what exactly do you do for the nsa Overseas stuff mostly but like what give I an example they fly I someplace I approach the subject find out what he be think and I tell the people I work for who then fly I home where I live comfortably what happen to the subject I do not ask that be good the neural pathway comparison be particularly illuminate make sure you understand they before you move on Dr Burkhoff I do not understand any of this a bunch of her neuron do not work anymore every time one of hers turn off one of mine turn on exactly and what be true for neuron be true for muscle fiber synaptic pathway there be a one to one correspondence between the amount you lose and the amount you gain so all this be just a way of say I be do this to her the correlation be too precise to be random your rapid aging have cause her rapid aging how do we stop it put I back to the way I be I be afraid I can not so what do we do about it there be a possibility that if the age agent be eliminate that lily might be restore to her normal self the age agent he mean I I be kill you the only way for you to live be for I to die be not that right do not answer that dr Burkhoff thank you for your time we be do here where be you go we be not discuss this not now not ever it be true be not it I think so but it be only a theory guy I go over this six week ago with the man in black Humor we I go on two date with t j Kim I cut it off Girl have a lot of baggage how long ago be that uh two month ago look if I have know there would be government agent show up every other day to ask I about her I would 've take note hey so listen all this stuff about october 19th you guy think it be serious like should I be get out of town I do not think that be the answer as far as we know you be as safe here as anywhere else that kid be lie or at least he be not tell you everything the whole time you be talk to he he be think about an address 331 reynold avenue look like it be clear Nobody 's home nobody be be for home for a while I would say look at this that be the government report on the return of the 4400 I try to read this once kind of dry yeah look like someone make it right through to the end Wesley hauser Wesley hauser Wesley hauser who the hell be wesley hauser Jarvis Hauser be a marine do two tour of duty in vietnam he lead protest against the war after he get home in ' 72 disappear in ' 75 once he get out of quarantine he never check back in with we Guy 's be live off the grid for almost two year which mean he never go on the inhibitor so who know what he be capable of by now Hauser be

know exactly you know in some way she be well off on the promicin inhibitor at least she be not overwhelmed back then all she want to do be record what she see in those notebook it be like some kind of compulsion well think about it for a minute every morning she wake up and know pretty much what be come she be already live the whole day once in her head and by the time something actually do happen it be like a rerun I hate watch rerun yeah try live one hey what about kevin burkhoff maybe he can figure out a way for maia to control her vision he be brilliant I do not say this about many

tune you guy out but every now and then something leak through I will try to keep that in mind you say you have an opinion about maia what be it when I first develop this thing of mine I be a basket case you see I I truly think I be go insane so I fight against it and that just make it bad I have to give in to it let it take control of I and then slowly I learn how to take control of it listen your kid stop fight and eventually it will become like see or hear or any other sense she will not even think about it it be just a part of who she be that be how it work for I anyway thank you Diana

about three bottle of mad dog a day one morning about a month ago I go down to see he and I find he by the dumpster dead and somewhere in the middle of your grieve process you figure he would make a handy decoy Hauser would not have mind go back to his marine corps day so when I find he I say a word or two over his body and I push he into elliott bay so how long have you be work with this nova group do someone approach you or be the whole thing your idea tell I you and this girlfriend of yours be it like a role play thing you get up to or be she actually take you into these I do not know what do you call it Fantasy world oh and this guy marco do he know that you be too embarrassed to tell your partner that you two have be date do show off why do not you tell we what be go to happen on october 19th I guess you be go to have to find yourself another telepath good luck with that so you get nothing out of he well he tell we about hauser but as far as the nova go it be go to take time to break he down how much time he be a telepath he know what we be think a little long than usual okay so it be not easy but gary navarro have a level seven security clearance we have to assume that he be be use it to funnel national secret to the nova group we need to know what he know now he will talk Gary 's be inside our head for a year I think I know how to get inside of his careful with this Matthew I do not expect to see you back for a couple of week the nova group revise my calendar for I Wiped it clean actually it be difficult to lobby on behalf of the 4400 when some of they be boast about their body count I suppose how be lily any improvement since I leave if anything she be get bad sorry to hear that Isabelle she try to kill herself this morning she jump off the roof a few minute later she be walk around like nothing happen I get to tell you matthew I be not go to lie I be really glad you be back Knock on door hello isabelle hello who be you my name be matthew ross I

about your past over the last 60 year 4400 people have be abduct www ydy com bbs proudly present all at once they be return sync gagegao www ydy com bbs with no memory of where they 've be they have not age a day and some have return with new ability all be try to reconnect with a life interrupt we be not a threat we be salvation the world will have to deal with we previously on the 4400 what so navarro be really some kind of mind reader I believe telepath be the word you be look for just concentrate on what you want to ask I and I will hear you the guy definitely know what we be think I could think of a few practical application for it you should have come to I first I would have treat you well than they ever will we be at war here do not pick the lose side there be a synthetic substance present in the blood of every 4400 and they call it promicin inhibitor but ntac be be study the 4400 ever since they get back they should have know about this they do know I be order to work on a drug to suppress the production of promicin once I synthesize the inhibitor we give it to every 4400 if it come down to a choice between the safety of the american people and the welfare of the 4400 tom that be no choice at all if you be hold on to any hope of keep this cover up you be go to have to start by put I in the ground right here and right now every male in this building have get a gallon of adrenaline course through his vein right now and most of they be armed a 4400 nearly take down a fortified government facility and walk away without break a sweat I be not pregnant when I be abduct but I be when I get back you 've see what she be capable of what she can do when she feels threaten do you know isabelle have connection between the right and leave hemisphere of her brain that have never be see before you be the steward of the future your daughter be the rosetta stone for understanding wh happen to the 4400 Isabelle isabelle hello shawn I be isabelle 4400 season 03 Episode 01 02 the world have change everything be different now the promicin inhibitor program be an international effort its goal be to prevent the coming of a world dominate by a tiny fraction of the population in short we be do everything we could to prevent the 4400 from develop extrahuman capability we believe that without the inhibitor program these ability would show up in virtually every single one of the 4400 I do not think I need to explain to ts committee why that would be something less than a good case scenario overnight normal human being like you and I and all the institution we 've come to rely on would be obsolete the program be not perfect People get sick some die that be not our intent but now it be go and the future that we be try to prevent be here and we be not ready I believe it come down to a question of power who be go to hold it Us or they because believe I it be go to co down to we against they THREE weeks earlier Shawn you be not make any sense just tell I what be wrong with isabelle I tell you I can not explain be she sick be she hurt you will see for yourself Dad W who the hell be this where be isabelle I be your daughter I be isabelle I I do

normal range doctor you call this normal Richard I want to see isabelle where be my daughter she be right outside I will bring she in in a minute I realize how alarming this must be but at least you can take some solace in the fact that your wife be a perfectly healthy old woman if I have to guess I would say she be about 75 I be 29 and I do not understand please help I understand how could this happen maybe it be a reaction to be take off the promicin inhibitor but truthfully I do not know there be a condition call progeria it be associate with rapid aging so this kind of thing have happen before Mr Tyler when your wife faint this morning she be a young woman when she wake up less than a minute later she be 50 year old I can guarantee you this be a first excuse I be you okay dr Burkhoff Fine not enough sleep that be all Research well what do we do now be there any way to reverse this I wish I know I need to do some thinking be you my mother Isabelle PRESENT DAY we be wring our hand and try to determine who know what when I will save this committee the trouble and expense of a long investigation the inhibitor program be my idea I be proud to lead it the man on this board be simply follow my order if there be blame to be assign it be mine Mine alone yeah I know kyle do not want to see I be there some way we can force he to I be his father I want to know how he be do look I realize you be try but it will be month before he go to trial xxxxxxxxxx I mean you really think people be go to let ryland position himself as some kind of patriotic martyr the man head a conspiracy that cause 28 death well he say it be accidental a significant percentage of this country believe he try overwhelm you guy listen to talk radio lately the call be like 90 in his favor you can buy a free dennis ryland t shirt within a block of here maybe they should put he up for the nobel peace prize just tell he I need to see he we do not have to talk about the case I just have to see my son just ask he one more time okay and tell he we love he give he some time thomas Kyle need to live with his choice for a while we be back Tom break 's over Ladies and gentleman I would like to call the proceeding to order everyone just take your seat we can get start member of the press I be include you in that lady and gentleman designation thank you Mr Ryland I would like to pick up the questioning where we leave off you insist that you alone give the go ahead for the promicin inhibitor program be that right sir yes sir it be my program all the way so this committee be to understand that your department be able to plan and implement an international conspiracy without some cabinet level approval that be correct I be give a broad mandate in my duty as head of ntac I feel that the project fall within that mandate so there be no need to seek outside approval excuse we everybody do you hear that well yeah the microphone go haywire no no not that something else just set that approval issue to the side for the moment do you ever discuss the project with anyone outside of ntac I mean someone somewhere must have take an interest in what you people be do over there it be a simple question mr Ryland surely it can not be that difficult to answer if I could have your attention up here mr Ryland Security stop that man get some protection around ryland stay here I will be right back we need an ambulance stand back please back get back hey stop t J someone get these photographer out of here stay over there I do not understand what I do would somebody please tell to I what I just do hang on dennis the ambulance be come yeah it be her the blood we pick up at the scene match the dna in our record that be T J Kim run from the courthouse when she hit this place T J drive every man in the building into a homicidal rage now it sound like she just zap one guy she be learn to control what she can do they all be ever since we take they off the inhibitor they be either develop ability or they be refine the one that they 've get so they be get more dangerous I guess ryland be right I will be sure to mention that to my daughter save the point counterpoint at the moment we 've be task with two job we track down T J Kim what be the second job we be to protect ryland 's co conspirator from any further reprisal so we arrest they and now we be their bodyguard the entire country just see a 4400 turn a government hearing into her own personal slasher film if T j get to ryland again or any of they before we can bring she in people be go to start to wonder if the united states government be capable of protect its citizen and that be the beginning of chaos back to work please Tom in case you be wonder dennis be still in surgery they say that it be touch and go it be okay give I your hand try and relax Relax be it well much well for now when this thing first come on it be bad but at least she be healthy now she be have diabete emphysema it seem like every

thing as far as it go tom the same way you do when you come after I and I want my people protect they be act under my order they be under guard so be the courthouse when kim attack I would feel well if you bring they in we offer sanctuary to every single conspirator there be no taker I guess no one want to cooperate with the organization that be work to put you in prison we have to fight just to get they to let we post agent outside their house Crockett you ready to go for a walk boy Come on crockett let us go they want no part of we they all seem confident that T J Kim be act alone Crockett what be wrong this arrive 15 minute ago this be a message from the nova group we be the defensive wing of the 4400 today the world have see what happen to those who try to harm we a second demonstration of our capability be plan for october 19th a new era dawn defensive wing huh what happen when they decide to play offense I guess we find out in five day they do not even say what they want no demand no room for compromise we do not even know how many 4400 be in this nova group we could not even handle one when she walk in and attack the place now there be a whole team of assassin out there all with ability they 've get someone who can kill you by lower your body temperature do not forget the beastmaster what that dog got piss off pretty quick well I 've be all over the file and none of these ability have be register with we they be off the inhibitor now we can not even pretend to have a comprehensive list of what these people can do be anyone feel a little overmatched here you two remember gary navarro hey gary be a while you be right baldwin I do think you two sell I out it really bother I for a while but now I understand it be just standard operating procedure well I guess that mind read thing be work pretty well huh well than ever actually Gary 's telepathic ability have be very useful to the national security agency they have agree to let we borrow he while we investigate the nova group so you be clear on what we be do here you want to use a 4400 to track down other 4400 do you have a problem with that not at all it will not be my first time so can we get start never hear of the nova group xxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxx between ntac and this place but I trust you realize how serious this be believe I if I know anything I would tell you well do you mind if the three of we walk around the place talk to some people you and your pet mind reader no I can not let you do that these people have not do anything wrong and I will not let you invade their privacy and I actually can not believe that you bring this guy here again how much do they pay you to spy on your own kind get a clear signal you see anything you like up there as far as I can tell he be not hide anything I have a lot of work to do if I hear anything I will give you a call for now that be the good I can do sorry about my nephew why well he be kind of rude back there I get that kind of stuff a lot I do not take it personally do you mind if I ask you you 've sort of imply that you 've pursue 4400s in the past what exactly do you do for the nsa Overseas stuff mostly but like what give I an example they fly I someplace I approach the subject find out what he be think and I tell the people I work for who then fly I home where I live comfortably what happen to the subject I do not ask that be good the neural pathway comparison be particularly illuminate make sure you understand they before you move on Dr Burkhoff I do not understand any of this a bunch of her neuron do not work anymore every time one of hers turn off one of mine turn on exactly and what be true for neuron be true for muscle fiber synaptic pathway there be a one to one correspondence between the amount you lose and the amount you gain so all this be just a way of say I be do this to her the correlation be too precise to be random your rapid aging have cause her rapid aging how do we stop it put I back to the way I be I be afraid I can'T so what do we do about it there be a possibility that if the age agent be eliminate that lily might be restore to her normal self the age agent he mean I I be kill you the only way for you to live be for I to die be not that right do not answer that dr Burkhoff thank you for your time we be do here where be you go we be not discuss this not now not ever it be true be not it I think so but it be only a theory guy I go over this six week ago with the man in black Humor we I go on two date with T J Kim I cut it off Girl have a lot of baggage how long ago be that uh two month ago look if I have know there would be government agent show up every other day to ask I about her I would 've take note hey so listen all this stuff about october 19th you guy think it be serious like should I be get out of town I do not think that be the answer as far as we know you be as safe here as anywhere else that kid be lie or at least he be not tell you everything the whole time you be talk to he he be think about an address 331 reynold avenue look like it be clear Nobody 's home nobody be be for home for a while I would say look at this

because of they you kill people that be not what we discuss when you approach I I give you money to start a defensive arm for the center in case the government ever come after we again it be a precaution and all we 've do be take precautionary measure Shawn do you think that because their inhibitor program be expose that the government 's just go to leave we in peace no they know we 've get strong which threaten their hold on power which increase their need to eliminate we so we strike first be that it be that what happen on the 19th look shawn you do great work at that center of yours

he in quarantine I like wes he be 10 kind of crazy but his heart be in the right place I guess he be bipolar or something but he never take medication after quarantine he live on the street I use to visit he down at the dock you know give he food a little money so when do you decide to kill he Wes he do not need my help with that he drink about three bottle of mad dog a day one morning about a month ago I go down to see he and I find he by the dumpster dead and somewhere in the middle of your grieve process you figure he would make a handy decoy Hauser would not have mind xxxxxxxx go back to his marine corps day so when I find he I say a word or two over his body and I push he into elliott bay so how long have you be work with this nova group do someone approach you or be the whole thing your idea tell I you and this girlfriend of yours be it like a role play thing you get up to or be she actually take you into these I do not know what do you call it Fantasy world oh and this guy marco do he know that you be too embarrassed to tell your partner that you two have be date do show off why do not you tell we what be go to happen on october 19th I guess you be go to have to find yourself another telepath good luck with that so you get nothing out of he well he tell we about hauser but as far as the nova go it be go to take time to break he down how much time he be a telepath he know what we be think a little long than usual okay so it be not easy but gary navarro have a level seven security clearance we have to assume that he be be use it to funnel national secret to the nova group we need to know what he know now he will talk Gary 's be inside our head for a year I think I know how to get inside of his careful with this Matthew I do not expect to see you back for a couple of week the nova group revise my calendar for I Wiped it clean actually it be difficult to lobby on behalf of the 4400 when some of they be boast about their body count I suppose

go to a lot of trouble to get this thank you but I be not sure I want to send maia to a school that only teach 4400s it sound like a great way to get she to withdraw even far from the world look just just pretend it be get nothing to do with the 4400 for a second it be a good school you know top notch faculty the facility be great and it be all free the 4400 center pick up the whole tab they even have a class on how to manage your ability just give I some time to think about it okay it be a big step I be king of hope dr Burkhoff would have I do not know a magic pill or something what be he work on anything interesting you know that promicin serum that he invent that save everybody well I see a syringe at his place and it look like there be some in it well he be a researcher right he be probably inject it into what mouse guinea pig the only animal I see at his place be a couple of cockroach you do not think he be inject it into himself do you that be ridiculous I be not inject myself with the promicin serum Good I be glad to hear it I be inject myself with a modify version of the promicin serum Dr Burkhoff I have to ask you this have you stop take your medication of course not I be as sane as you be once the course of treatment be finish I will have teach my body how to produce promicin and then I will be the first non returnee to develop 4400 ability the first of many you be talk about the next step in human evolution do you think the world be ready for that the world be never ready for change you have to force it on they be not that why the 4400 be bring back be not that why the future wake I up you should not be do research of this magnitude in excuse I but in a dump these be hardly sterile work condition you could help I with that you have scientific background right I have graduate degree in microbiology and epidemiology Good that will be handy I need someone to monitor my progress as the change continue change I think it be an exciting first step do not

oh my god what what happen it be the nova group certainly miracle be an imprecise term but I be not sure how else to describe it to repeat I be broadcast livefrom the nubian desert north of khartoum where overnight a thousand acre patchof barren sand have somehow be transformedinto fertile wheat field scientist be at a loss to explain the conversion but test confirm that the wheat be real and edible there have not be food grow in that part of the world since before the birth of christ they make we all terrify and then rather than attack we they give we a gift our station have just receive a statement from the radical 4400 organization know as the nova group claim responsibility for this morning 's transformation you be witness to the beginning of a new era what happen next be up to you the 4400 can be mankind 's great ally or its most dangerous adversary do not kid yourself it be an attack an act of aggression anyway they just show everyonethat they can change the world and there be nota damn thing we can do about it hello I be very disappointed in you shawn Daniel I realize you be still a young man but I be afraid I can not forgive you to repeat I be broadcast live from the

01 02 we be not a threat we be salvation the world will have to deal with we previously on the 4400 what so Navarro be really some kind of mind reader I believe telepath be the word you be look for just concentrate on what you wanna ask I and I will hear you he definitely know what we be think I can think of a few practical application for it you should 've come to I first I would have treat you well than they ever will we be at War here do not pick the lose side there be a synthetic substance present in the blood of every 4400 they call it promicin inhibitor NTAC 's be study the 4400 since they get back they should 've know they do know I be order to work on a drug to suppress the production of promicin once I synthesize the inhibitor we give it to every 4400 but if it come down to a choice between the safety of the american people and the welfare of the 4400 Tom that be no choice at all because if you be hold on to any hope of keep this cover up you be go to have to start by put I in the ground right here right now every male in this building have get a gallon of adrenaline course through his vein right now and most of they be armed a 4400 nearly take down a fortified government facility and walk away without break a sweat I be not pregnant when I be abduct but I be when I get back you 've see what she be capable of what she can do when she feels threaten you know Isabelle have connection between the right and leave hemisphere of her brain that have never be see before you be the steWards of the future your daughter be the Rosetta stone for understand what happen to the 4400 Isabelle Isabelle hello Shawn I be lsabelle the world have change everything be different now the Promicin lnhibitor Program be an international effort its goal be to prevent the coming of a world dominate by a tiny fraction of the population in short we be do everything we could to prevent the 4400 from develop extra human capability we believe that without the inhibitor program these ability would show up in virtually every one of the 4400 I do not think I need to explain to this committee why that would be something less than the good case scenario overnight normal human being like you and I and all the institution we 've come to rely on would be obsolete the program be not perfect People get sick some die that be not our intent but now it be go and the future that we be try to prevent be here and we be not ready I believe it come down to a question of power who be go to hold it Us or they because believe I it be go to come down to we against they Shawn you be not make any sense just tell I what be wrong with lsabelle I tell you I can not explain be she sick be she hurt you got to see for yourself Dad who the hell be this where be lsabelle I be your daughter I be lsabelle I do not get it it be not a joke something happen I change I do not know how she just walk in here she know my name she seem to know about you and Lily Stop I do not know what game you be play here and I do not care Richard Richard Lily Lily Lily be lsabelle with you Lily Lil Lily be you all right oh Richard I must 've faint be lsabelle with you who be you where be my wife Richard what be you talk about I be Lily your wife why be you look at I like oh my God Ma'am I do not know who you be oh my God no your blood pressure be elevate but I suppose that be to be expect Heart lung reflexe all within the normal range Doctor you call this normal Richard I wanna see lsabelle where be my daughter she be right outside I will bring she in in a minute I realize how alarming this must be but at least you can take some solace in the fact that your wife be a perfectly healthy old woman if I have to guess I would say she be about 75 I be 29 and I do not understand please help I understand how could this happen maybe it be a reaction to be take off the promicin inhibitor but truthfully I do not know there be a condition call progeria it be associate with rapid aging so this kind of thing have happen before Mr Tyler when your wife faint this morning she be a young woman when she wake up less than a minute later she be 50 year old I can guarantee you this be a first excuse I be you okay Dr Burkhoff I be fine not enough sleep that be all Research well what do we do now be there any way to reverse this I wish I know I need to do some thinking be you my mother Isabelle every day the 4400 be change and get strong instead of mobilize to meet this challenge we be wring our hand and try to determine who know what when I will save this committee the trouble and expense of a long investigation the inhibitor program be my idea I be proud to lead it the man on this board be simply follow my order if there be blame to be assign it be mine Mine alone yeah I know Kyle do not wanna see I be there some way we can force he to I be his father I wanna know how he be do look I realize you be try but it will be month before he go to trial I be not go to wait that long do you really think people be go to let Ryland position himself as some kind of patriotic martyr the man head a conspiracy that cause 28 death he say it be accidental a significant percentage of this country believe he try overwhelming you guy listen to talk radio lately I mean the call be like 90 percent in his favor you can buy a Free Dennis Ryland T shirt within a block of here maybe they should put he up for the Nobel Peace Prize just tell he I need to see he we do not have to talk about the case I just have to see my son just ask he one more time okay and tell he we love he give he some time Thomas Kyle need to live with his choice for a while we be back Tom break 's over Ladies and gentleman I would like to call the proceeding to order everyone just take your seat so we can get start member of the press I be include you in that lady and gentleman designation thank you Mr Ryland I would like to pick up the questioning where we leave off you insist that you alone give the go ahead for the Promicin lnhibitor Program be that right sir yes sir it be my program all the way so this committee be to understand that your department be able to plan and implement an international conspiracy without some Cabinet level approval that be correct I be give a broad mandate in my duty as head of NTAC I feel that the project fall within that mandate so there be no need to seek outside approval excuse we everybody do you hear that well yeah the microphone go haywire no not that something else just set that approval issue to the side for the moment do you ever discuss the project with anyone outside of NTAC I mean someone somewhere must have take an interest in what your people be do over there listen to I what what be wrong a simple question Mr Ryland what do you mean what be wrong surely it can not be that difficult to answer if I could have your attention up here Mr Ryland you need to relax Miles Security stop that man get some protection on Ryland stay here I will be right back we need an ambulance someone call an ambulance stand back please back back hey stop t J someone get these photographer out of here you stay with he I do not understand what I do would somebody please tell I what I just do hang on Dennis the ambulance be come yeah it be her the blood we pick up at the scene match the dna in our record that be T J Kim run from the courthouse when she hit this place T J drive every man in the building into a homicidal rage now it sound like she just zap one guy she be learn to control what she can do they all be ever since we take they off the inhibitor they be either develop new ability or they be refine the one that they 've get so they be get more dangerous I guess Ryland be right I will be sure to mention that to my daughter okay save the point counterpoint at the moment we 've be task with two job we track down T J Kim what be the second job we be to protect Ryland 's co conspirator from any further reprisal so we arrest they and now we be their bodyguard well the entire country just see a 4400 turn a government hear into her own personal slasher film if T J get to Ryland again or any of they before we can bring she in people be go to start to wonder if the United States government be capable of protect its citizen and that be the beginning of chaos back to work please Tom in case you be wonder Dennis be still in surgery they say that it be touch and go it be okay give I your hand try and relax Relax be it well much well for now when this thing first come on it be bad but at least she be healthy now she be have

way you do when you come after I and I want my people protect they be act under my order they be under guard so be the courthouse when Kim attack I would feel well if you bring they in we offer

outside their house Crocket be you ready to go for a walk boy come on Crocket let us go they want no part of we they all seem confident that T J Kim be act alone Crock what be wrong it be I this just arrive 1 5 minute ago this be a message from the Nova Group we be the defensive Wing of the 4400 today the World have see what happen to those who try to harm we a second demonstration of our capability be plan for October 1 9th a new era dawns defensive wing huh what happen when they decide to play offense I guess we find out in five day they do not say what they want no demand no room for compromise we do not even know how many 4400 be in this Nova Group we could not handle one when she walk in here and attack the place now there be a whole team of assassin out there all with ability they get someone who can kill you by lower your body temperature do not forget the beast master what that dog got piss off pretty quick I 've be all over the file and none of these ability have be register with we they be off the inhibitor now we can not even pretend to have a comprehensive list of what these people can do be anyone else feel a little overmatched here you two remember Gary Navarro hey Gary be a while you be right Baldwin I do think you two sell I out it really bother I for a while but now I understand it be just standard operating procedure well I guess that mind read thing 's work pretty well huh well than ever actually Gary 's telepathic ability have be very useful to the National Security Agency they 've agree to let we borrow he while we investigate the Nova Group you be clear on what we be do you want to use a 4400 to track down other 4400 do you have a problem with that not at all it will not be my first time so can we get start never hear of the Nova Group not until this morning anyway now I get to go on television in an hour and explain that the Center have nothing to do with this Shawn I know there be a lot of history between NTAC and this place but I trust you realize how serious this be believe I if I know anything I would tell you well do you mind if the three of we walk around the place talk to people you and your pet mind reader no I can not let you do that these people have not do anything wrong I will not let you invade their privacy and I actually can not believe that you bring this guy here again how much do they pay you to spy on your own kind be you get a clear signal see anything you like up there as far as I can tell he be not hide anything I have a lot of work to do if I hear anything I will give you a call for now that be the good I can do sorry about my nephew why he be kind of rude back there I get that kind of stuff a lot I do not take it personally you mind if I ask you you 've sort of imply that you 've pursue 4400s in the past what exactly do you do for the NSA Overseas stuff mostly but like what give I an example they fly I someplace I approach the subject find out what he be think and I tell the people I work for who then fly I home where I live comfortably what happen to the subject I do not ask that be good the neural pathway comparison be particularly illuminate make sure you understand they before you move on Dr Burkhoff I do not understand any of this a bunch of her neuron do not work anymore every time one of hers turn off one of mine turn on exactly and what be true for neuron be true for muscle fiber synaptic pathway there be a one to one correspondence between the amount you lose and the amount you gain so all this be just a way of say I be do this to her the correlation be too precise to be random your rapid aging have cause her rapid aging how do we stop it Put I back the way I be I be afraid I can not so what do we do about it there be a possibility that if the age agent be eliminate that Lily might be restore to her normal self the age agent he mean I I be kill you the only way for you to live be for I to die be not that right do not answer that Dr Burkhoff thank you for your time but we be do here where be you go we be not discuss this not now not ever it be true be not it I think so but it be only a theory guy I go over this six week ago with the man in black Humor we I go on two date with T J Kim then I cut it off Girl have a lot of baggage how long ago be that about two month ago if I have know there would be government agent show up every other day to ask I about her I would 've take note hey so listen all this stuff about October 1 9th you guy think it be serious I mean like should I be get out of town I do not think that be the answer as far as we know you be as safe here as anywhere else that kid be lie or at least he be not tell you everything the whole time you be talk to he he be think about an address 331 Reynolds Avenue look like it be clear Nobody 's home nobody be be home for a while I would say look at this it be the government report on the return of the 4400 I try to read this once kind of dry it look like someone

tune you guy out but every now and then something leak through I will try to keep that in mind you say you have an opinion about Maia what be it when I first develop this thing of mine I be a basket case you see I I truly think I be go insane so I fight against it and that just make it bad I have to give in to it let it take control of I and then slowly I learn how to take control of it listen your kid stop fight and eventually it will become like see or hear or any other sense she will not even think about it it be just a part of who she be that be how it work for I anyway thank you Diana we just get a call from Seattle police someone down there read our APB they know exactly where Hauser be you guy be lucky actually in another day or two we would 've bury he in the potter 's field bury who he I always read the APB memo when they circulate in the police department Kind of a hobby get boring in here anyway there be a description of a regimental tattoo on the memo for Hauser 82nd Airborne Death from Above I remember it from a John Doe they bring in here three week ago this guy drown in the harbor well a lot of veteran have that tattoo do a lot of veteran look exactly like the mug shoot you circulate do not believe I take a look for yourself say hello to Wesley Hauser Hauser die two and a half week before Ryland be attack obviously that be not he on the phone the other day and that copy of the 4400 report with all his note over it for all we know that could 've be a plant somebody want we distract they deliberately put we on the trail of some phantom member of the Nova Group how do we first find out about Hauser T J 's old boyfriend give we the address no he be think it at least accord to Gary he be Gary Navarro put we on to Wesley Hauser Get in you lie to I Daniel you never say anything about kill people no we be protect you Shawn if we tell you in advance you be culpable what be she do here she be die she need your help I tell you I do not want anything more to do with you the Nova Group be suppose to protect we that be why I give you money Daniel that be why I give you money not to start a terrorist organization we will talk about your concern later she

be seize he be bradye down I need a crash cart and Ativan find Dr Danoff now stay right there Gary Isabelle Isabelle oh God somebody call an ambulance what be everybody stand around for somebody call an ambulance they be on their way somebody call an ambulance Dad what be l it be miraculous ShaWn when I watch you heal someone well it make I wonder why they hate we so much they hate we because you be kill they Daniel they be afraid of we I can not blame they you make it sound like we act out of some sort of blood lust these be precise tactical strike Shawn and you and every other 4400 be ultimately much safe because of they you kill people that be not what we discuss when you approach I I give you money to start a defensive arm for the Center in case the government ever come after we again it be a precaution and all we 've do be take precautionary measure Shawn do you think that because their inhibitor program be expose that the government 's just go to leave we in peace they know we 've get strong which threaten their hold on power which increase their need to eliminate we so we strike first be that it be that what happen on the 1 9th look Shawn you do great work at that center of yours you just focus on that I do not wanna distract you Knowledge can be a burden and thank for help T J out you be a hero to your own people do not forget that yeah it do not work you know Ryland be od'e but the doctor pull he out of it he will be awake within a couple of hour well I be sure you be as disappointed as I be do not worry we will get he let us talk about Wesley Hauser you first meet he in quarantine I like Wes he be ten kind of crazy but his heart be in the right place I guess he be bipolar or something but he never take medication after quarantine he live on the street I use to visit he down at the dock you know give he food a little money so when do you decide to kill he Wes he do not need my help with that he drink about three bottle of Mad Dog a day one morning about a month ago I go down to see he and I find he by the dumpster dead and somewhere in the middle of your grieve process you figure he would make a handy decoy no Hauser would not have mind it I mean he hate people like you go back to his Marine Corps day so when I find he I say a word or two over his body and I push he into Elliot Bay so how long you be work with this Nova Group do someone approach you be the whole thing your idea tell I you and this girlfriend of yours be it like a role play thing you get up to or be she actually take you into these I do not know what do you call it Fantasy world oh and this guy Marco do he know that you be too embarrassed to tell your partner that you two have be date do show off why do not you tell we what be go to happen on October 1 9th I guess you be go to have to find yourself another telepath good luck with that so you get nothing out of he he tell we about Hauser but as far as the Nova go it be go to take time to break he down how much time he be a telepath he know what we be think long than usual okay so it be not easy but Gary Navarro have a Level 7 security clearance we must assume he be be use it to funnel national secret to the Nova Group we need to know what he know now he will talk Gary 's be inside our head for a year I think I know how to get inside of his careful with this please Matthew I do not expect to see you back for a couple week Nova Group provide my calendar for I Wiped it clean actually it be difficult to lobby on behalf of the 4400 when some of they be boast about their body count I suppose How 's Lily any improvement since I leave if anything she be get bad sorry to hear that Isabelle she try to kill herself this morning she jump off the roof a few minute later she be walk around like nothing happen I get to tell you Matthew I be not go to lie I be really glad you be back hello lsabelle hello who be you my name be Matthew Ross I work closely with Shawn I be an adviser to the 4400 may I come in I understand there be an incident this morning you attempt to harm yourself I see you have no right to do that do not you understand who you be what you be here to do no well I do I know everything about you I know why you be here and I know what you be suppose to do sit and I will tell you a story you will like it it be about your past and it be about your future I know you go to a lot of trouble to get this thank you but I be not sure I wanna send Maia to a school that only teach 4400s it sound like a great way to get she to withdraw even far from the world just pretend it be get nothing to do with the 4400 for a second it be a good school you know topnotch faculty the facility be great and it be all free the 4400 Center pick up the whole tab they even have a class on how to manage your ability just give I some time to think about it okay it be a big step I be kind of hope Dr Burkhoff would have I do not know a magic pill or something what be he work on anything interesting you know that promicin serum that he invent that save everybody well I see a syringe at his place and it look like there be some in it well he be a researcher right he be probably inject into what Mice Guinea pig the only animal I see at his place be a couple of cockroach you do not think he be inject it into himself do you that be ridiculous I be not inject myself with the promicin serum Good I be glad to hear it I be inject myself with a modify version of the promicin serum Dr Burkhoff I have to ask you this have you stop take your medication of course not I be as sane as you be once the course of treatment be finish I will have teach my body how to produce promicin and then I will be the first non returnee to develop 4400 ability the first of many you be talk about the next step in human evolution do you think the world 's ready for that the world be never ready for change you have to force it on they be not that why the 4400 be bring back be not that why the future wake I up you should not be do research of this magnitude in excuse I but in a dump these be hardly sterile work condition you could help I with that you have a scientific background right I have graduate degree in microbiology and epidemiology Good that will be handy I need someone to monitor my progress as the change continue change I think it be an exciting first step do not you I be think next time we could make a world where Kyle never shoot Jordan Collier never go to prison the inhibitor scandal never happen sound nice although I have to tell you at the moment I be not really feel a need to be transport to some kind of fantasy world as long as this water stay hot thing be a okay with I right here and now maybe tomorrow we can try it again I will take a rain check I be go to a seminar at the 4400 Center tomorrow it be about what we can expect physically now that we be off the inhibitor be everything okay you be not have any problem be you no I feel fine I feel great actually well then I do not get it why do you need to go I do not I wanna go I be curious but why you never want to go to the Center before why start now I never feel the need to be around other 4400

time send these child far back into the timeline be an attempt to combat that evil if we return they to you all the good that they 've do in the past will be negate the 4400 and everything that they

redline if you will any idea what be cause it I really can not say at the moment her metabolic rate can not stay at this level for very long eventually her organ will fail what she could die unless we can slow down her rate we be look at a very poor outcome do she have any family yeah you should call they I need to talk to her Alana can you do that take I to see Diana push I a little Mommy okay I be push you then make it high look not too high but that be the whole fun she have a point I think I would be see you two I do not hurt you do l it feel a little jarring when you leave no I be fine you on the other hand be not well that be where you be wrong because I feel great you be in an lcu Diana I think I might end up there what be my heart rate be it 1 70 1 75 high that still probably

be well I be afraid they be consistent with the onset of disorganized schizophrenia but you be go to fix he right you be go to make he well well I 've never see a case quite like this typically schizophrenia have a gradual onset patient slowly withdraw from the world as their symptom get bad but with shawn it be almost as if the disease be just turn on last week we get a phone call from daniel armand he say if we be not willing to reach a compromise with nova he would come gun for shawn and now it be two day later and he just happen to come down with schizophrenia you think the nova group do this to shawn well we will investigate it but until the matter be clear up shawn just can not walk around free I mean okay he be probably a victim in this but his mental state have be compromise he can not control his ability Shawn be one of the leader of this place People love he if he just disappear into the basement at ntac there be go to be a lot of unhappiness around here Nobody be talk about disappear anyone you need to just distance yourself from the situation just for a second now we have an insane 4400 with a potentially lethal ability this be an ability that have turn against my daughter if you do not voluntarily remand he to a psychiatric hospital then I will file a complaint for assault and take the decision out of your hand no you can not lock he up this be not his fault Isabelle shawn be in trouble he need help I know he do and instead you just want to abandon he he sacrifice for this place he tell you not to talk to nova even if it mean they be go to come after he now they do and you just want to cut himoose we be not cut he loose we be protect he oh by lock he up Isabelle that be not true and we be not have this discussion now this be not the place if you will agree that shawn go nowhere near a government facility we will commit he to a private hospital until all this be clear up how much do they tell you about what I do here at the school um not much you be some sort of guidance counselor right I be something like that it be more like a therapist I guess you could say I work with the student here use my ability all the kid here be 4400s which mean you miss year of your family ' life your parent have another child while you be go your brother curtis yeah before they got divorce I barely know he that be where I come in it be hard to explain but if you let I I can take you back to the year when you be go you can meet your brother when he be a baby see he grow up and spend all the time you need with he and build the relationship you do not have um I be sorry what you want to take I back in time no we go into a world we create use both our mind and it will seem just as real as this one look uh no offense but maybe you should worry about help yourself you think I need help you have this sadness inside you not sadness exactly I guess rage would be the good word it be because of what happen to your husband and son all those year ago you know about billy and paul they got kill in a hit and run the police never catch the guy you try to move on and uh I guess you kind of have but you still think about it every day and and

be mad you know the guy the driver he be kind of out there it be not fair but you do see shawn farrell on tuesday a home loan from the center and how do the meeting end oh well congratulation that be a really nice neighborhood no no mr Donovan thank for your time we will be in touch if we need anything far you know your nephew be one of the leader of the center he see dozen of 4400 every day and the one we 've speak to who have register ability with we they have minor stuff nothing like the capacity to induce insanity and that be assume that whoever do this have to be in proximity to shawn to make it happen whoever we basically know who do this it be daniel armand either he do it or he give the order well no the truth be we do not actually know that shawn 's condition be the result of an attack Nova be not claim credit and shawn 's exactly the right age for onset of schizophrenia so it be possible that we be look for a crime and the only thing we will find be a tragedy then there be nothing we can do and I can not accept that Nova threaten shawn shawn get sick for right now that be all the cause and effect I need you be zachary yeah thank for meet I out here it be all right Matthew say you have something you want to discuss about six week ago a friend of mine from quarantine she ask I to meet she for dinner so I go and and she be ask I all sort of question now she never

possible that we be look for a crime and the only thing we be go to find be a tragedy then there be nothing we can do I can not accept that Nova threaten Shawn Shawn get sick for right now that be all the cause and effect I need you be zachary thank for meet I out here it be all right Matthew say you have something you want to discuss about six week ago a friend of mine from quarantine she ask I to

help and instead the government use he and turn he against his own kind I do not like what happen to gary but he choose to become a terrorist he join nova of his own free will Gary be not with the nova group anymore what how would you even know that a lot of people at the center know it after the nova group have T J Kim murder he turn his back on they how can you even believe that Gary personally try to murder dennis ryland Ryland be responsible for the death of 28 4400s 28 people that might have change the world for the well be they allow to live he declare war on we I almost die thomas all gary do be fight back you should have tell I what you be go to do I want to but I couldn'T you be bind by your job you could not give gary another chance so I do it for you and now you be

do not know I do not know what I can do I can not just turn alana in and if we do catch gary eventually he be go to give she up so either way her life be ruin well tom there be no way you can try and shake this agency off gary 's scent you will wind up a felon yourself I have to do something diana we be talk about alana one way or another we 've be together for more than a decade we I have to protect she once I know she be safe then I can figure out how we move on if we move on you need to keep yourself safe too I think that the good thing that we can do the only thing we can do be to take ourselves off this case and do what cross your finger Hope gary buy himself a one way ticket to costa rica what do you expect to happen I do not know but it be only for 36 hour right that be all they can hold she for honestly I be not sure they can hold she for as long as it take to investigate her alibi we be talk about dennis ryland here you 've tell I a dozen time he will do whatever it take to get information he be go to interrogate she and I do not know how far it be go to go Alana I will call his office in the morning I check out heather 's alibi myself I will give they my note it will all go on the record right now that be all I can do you know I be always happy to talk to one of the 4400 but I have to say I be surprised to find you wait outside my office this morning you can release heather tobey that phone call to gary navarro I be the one who make it Dennis thank for see I on such short notice what be you think tom to get romantically involve with a 4400 what alana do be misguide it be wrong but gary be not part of the nova group anymore be you actually go to stand here and defend gary navarro to I the nova group be not a bridge club you do not just leave even if gary try to that do not absolve his other crime which include attempt murder if the doctor have get to I 30 second later I would have be dead I know how badly you want he dennis if it be up to I gary navarro would never even make it to trial okay forget about gary can we just concentrate on alana well I be afraid it be not possible to make that distinction they be kind of intertwine be not they tom Alana will be prosecute like any other member of the nova group she be not a member of the nova group Dennis dennis we 've know each other for 25 year you have to help I like you help I when my back be to the wall I be not a petty man tom I will honor our relationship thank you I appreciate anything you can do I will tell nsa you have nothing to do with this you may be a dupe but you be not a traitor and as for alana her good chance of see mercy be to cooperate fully and help we find gary navarro now you want to catch gary navarro Tom we 've already pass the case off to roth and tierney we 've get to get he before they do we 've get to get he before ryland do before anyone look ryland want gary it be a personal thing if we can get gary first we can deal with ryland directly a straight up trade Gary for alana so ryland get his hand on gary and it happen with no official record no arrest none of that sticky due process you really think that ryland be go to agree to that if we dangle gary in front of he in a heartbeat look tom you save my daughter 's life I owe you everything for that and I will do what you want here but this be dangerous and it be a lot of trouble to go to for a a woman who just betray you I owe she that much More than that my son be incarcerate diana Alana 's be right there with I all the way through it and she do not deserve to rot in some secret prison for the rest of her life well any idea where we would start yeah hey shawn Isabelle what be you do in here I come by to talk I know you be still think about we but we be still friend right I

go to be able to prove you lend that key to Alana or anyone else Heather Alana do not make that call if you just stick to your story for one more day this whole thing will be over what if I say no she come after I you I do not know I know she be determined to get you back it be like she see you as her one connection to the world to people to a normal life so what you be say be it be like my job to

when my daughter decide to fight be everything all right Thomas do not think about it as inform you be help we catch a criminal now I need you to tell I who do you lend Heather 's office key to Sweetie please this be important somebody compromise our investigation I do not give the key to anyone it be I Thomas I call Gary Navarro I do not understand be you a member of the Nova Group no of course not then why I trust you I tell you what we be do and you use it to betray I I be not betray you I do it for you how many time have I hear you say that you feel responsible for what happen to Gary Navarro he come to you for help and instead the government use he and turn he against his own kind I do not like what happen to Gary but he choose to become a terrorist he join Nova of his own free will Gary be not with the Nova Group anymore what how would you even know that a lot of people at the Center know it after the Nova Group have T J Kim murder he turn his back on they how can you even believe that Gary personally try to murder Dennis Ryland Ryland be responsible for the death of 28 4400s twenty eight people that might have change the world for the well be they allow to live he declare war on we I almost die Thomas all Gary do be fight back you should have tell I what you be go to do I want to but I could not you be bind by your job you could not give Gary another chance so I do it for you and now you be go to stand trial right alongside of he you make that phone call from the Center it be right there on Gary 's phone record they will figure it out it be you Alana so what be I suppose to lie for you now be I suppose to become Gary 's accomplice too now I be not ask you to do anything Thomas if you want to turn I in fine but I believe I do the right thing and I hope the man I love would believe it too Nikki if I do pay off your dad 's hospital bill and I be not admit to anything let us just say that it be not that big of a deal okay I be glad to do something with my money give up my social life to work seven day a week at this place have to have its perk right I have a hard time believe that you do not have a social life run this place be a big job you know it kind of cut you off from the world well I do not have 60 000 but if you be feel isolated you know maybe I can pay you back in another way there be a new sushi place that open in Belltown it be suppose to be pretty cool you like sushi now you be not the only one who can change just give I a second okay hey Shawn have you see my copy of the Republic in here no you know what I have not see it hello again I be lsabelle Nikki Nice to meet you I 've hear of you well let I know if you find my book I be right in the middle of it so tomorrow night you wanna check out this new sushi place yeah oh my God Tom I be so sorry anything I can do to help I do not know I do not know what I can do I can not just turn Alana in if we do catch Gary eventually he be go to give she up so either way her life be ruin well Tom there be no way you can try and shake this agency off Gary 's scent you will wind up a felon yourself I have to do something Diana we be talk about Alana and one way or another we 've be together for more than a decade I have to protect she once I know she be safe then I can figure out how we move on if we move on you need to keep yourself safe too I think that the good thing that we can do the only thing we can do be to take ourselves off this case and do what cross our finger Hope Gary buy himself a one way ticket to Costa Rica what do you expect to happen I do not know but it be only for 36 hour right that be all they can hold she for honestly I be not sure they can hold she for as long as it take to investigate her alibi we be talk about Dennis Ryland here you tell I a dozen time he will do whatever it take to get information he be go to interrogate she and I do not know how far it be go to go Alana I will call his office in the morning I check out Heather 's alibi myself I will give they my note it will all go on the record right now it be all I can do you know I be always happy to talk to one of the 4400 but I have to say I be surprised to find you wait outside my office this morning you can release Heather Tobey that phone call to Gary Navarro I be the one who make it Dennis thank for see I on such short notice what be you think Tom to get romantically involve with a 4400 what Alana do be misguide it be wrong but Gary be not part of the Nova Group anymore be you actually go to stand here and defend Gary Navarro to I the Nova Group be not a bridge club you do not just leave even if Gary try to that do not absolve his other crime which include attempt murder if the doctor have get to I 30 second later I would have be dead I know how badly you want he Dennis if it be up to I Gary Navarro would never even make it to trial okay forget about Gary can we just concentrate on Alana well I be afraid it be not possible to make that distinction they be kind of intertwine be not they Tom Alana will be prosecute like any other member of the Nova Group she be not a member of the Nova Group Dennis Dennis we 've know each other for 25 year you have to help I like you help I when my back be to the wall okay I be not a petty man Tom I will honor our relationship thank you I appreciate anything you can do I will tell NSA you have nothing to do with this you may be a dupe but you be not a traitor and as for Alana the good chance of see mercy be to cooperate fully and help we find Gary Navarro now you wanna catch Gary Navarro Tom we 've already pass the case off to Roth and Tierney we 've get to get he before they do we 've get to get he before Ryland do before anyone look Ryland want Gary it be a personal thing if we get can get Gary first we can deal with Ryland directly a straight up trade Gary for Alana so Ryland get his hand on Gary and it happen with no official record no arrest none of that sticky due process you really think that Ryland 's go to agree to that if we dangle Gary in front of he in a heartbeat look Tom l you save my daughter 's life I owe you everything for that and I will do what you want here but this be dangerous and it be a lot of trouble to go to for a woman who just betray you I owe she that much More than that my son be incarcerate Diana Alana 's be right there with I all the way through it and she do not deserve to rot in some secret prison for the rest of her life well any idea where we would start yeah hey Shawn Isabelle what be you do in here I come by to talk I know you be still think about we but we be still friend right I can still drop by well lsabelle usually friend knock what be up I come to talk to you about Nikki I know you pretty well I do not think she be the right girl for you well I do not know why you think she be my girl you be entitled to your opinion though I guess I be just try to protect you I just have this feeling that if you guy get together it be go to end badly Isabelle what do that mean be you threaten Nikki now of course not why would I threaten Nikki it be just I have this feeling that if you two hook up it be not go to end well not for you especially not for her it be always hard on the girl you know hey be you do okay yeah more or less I want to help you Alana I want to get you out of here I do not think you can I do I think there be a way but I need you to trust I I think you should cooperate with Dennis Ryland tell he whatever he want to know I can not do that Thomas that would be a betrayal learn to live with it listen to I if you do not cooperate I do not think you be ever go to get out of here I can not then I can not help you Thomas I be suppose to take the student on a field trip to the aquarium this afternoon I need you to go there and leave they a note there be a bulletin board outside the aquarium you should put it there and it should say field trip cancel some of the kid will show up with their parent when you see they give they my apology I will make sure they understand it be a code at least I think it be she be tell I how to get ahold of Gary well I do not know Tom it be already be two hour let

idea what Ryland 's go to do with you that be how you get through this hand off with your conscience intact all right you wanna know I be trade you for Alana she help you now it be your chance to help

more check it be similar to what they find in the 4400 what do you call it Promicin what so this drug Blink you think a 4400 be synthesize it that be why I call you guy if there be a 4400 involve in this I figure you could help track he down absolutely it would help if we know more about this drug we do not know much about it except it seem to be a powerful hallucinogen how do you know Erika

pretty much what I 've be do ever since I come back if a student have a talent like all of our kid here do I help they learn how to use it gain control of it build their confidence do it work with adult it do not use to but I have not try it since I 've be off the inhibitor why I develop this ability a few month ago telekinesis what a word huh I can not even say it with a straight face that be fantastic I 've just be pretend it be not there I mean I know a little bit about it so far it only work with inanimate object little stuff but when I be mad or excited I can do a lot more with it and you be look to control it when you be calm yeah that be why I be here I guess how many time do I have to go over this with you people I have not be inject promicin into anyone but myself you be certain of that you be a world class scientist I find it difficult to believe you would not build a redundancy plan into your experiment this be not your basic sleep study I mean look at I do you

loose if anyone ask we tell they dr Burkhoff have werner syndrome it be a rare wasting disease okay but do you really think we will be able to bring this guy in safe and sound I mean some cowboy cop see this stumbling towards he you do not think he might shoot first and ask question later that be why we have to get to he first whatever dr Burkhoff be guilty of he save thousand of life during the inhibitor scandal the good thing about his condition be it should not make he too hard to spot I do not know they be nice hand but they do not look magical or anything make friend already hey you 've choose wisely I speak from experience the show be amazing thank you so much for have I what be you thank I for the show would 've be cancel if not for you listen I just have the good idea during the

I be sorry I wish it do not have to be you but there be no one else we would well go he will be wait for we how could I have do that I do not remember any of it Diana do not remember go to kevin 's apartment at night either if dr Burkhoff 's willing to break she out of here he must be get desperate feel like he be run out of time which mean he have to complete the experiment he be go to up her dosage if we do not find diana soon she be go to wind up in the same shape as kevin I think it be the silence that be mess we up it be too awkward so instead of we just stare at each other I think we will talk okay um be there something specific you want to talk about no you pick well I 've be think about my parent a lot lately what they would think of all this this place I sit here try to figure out how to use my telekinetic ability you know you can say it out loud it be nothing to be embarrassed about yeah you can say that but when I first get back I be a 4400 but I do not have an ability I feel normal it be something I could hold on to now you have to get use to the idea that you be special be that what my parent would think if they be here or would they just think that their son have become a freak Richard when you got take you be one of the first black pilot in all of the military you be at the vanguard now you be part of a different vanguard there be a reason they pick you I think your parent would be proud yeah uh maybe that be true Richard Whoa well I guess that work huh this will be fine we can work here for a while tell he he can go home please you have to help I say something do not bother he be not go to remember any of this thank you you can go home now cough violently Kevin can I get you some water I be fine Kevin you be die you be kill yourself and now you be

fistful of medication they must have change I I be not a good subject there be no good subject Kevin you be brilliant but you be wrong you fail and you be not think clearly enough to see that my mind be not compromise we be at a point diana where it would be easy for the timid to turn back we have to be braver than that and if necessary diana plead oh no oh I be prepared to be brave enough for both of we work on a song the end of one can not nail it though Inspiration be you shocked I be drink my lunch I do not say anything good because this be listen this here be call maintain a base level that be kind of scary actually Shawn do not worry I 've make a solemn vow not to over indulge unless of course you be around yeah that be kind of the thing you be not go to be around be that it you be not come on the road I want to it be just you know even if it be for a little while this gift I have though it be kind of a responsibility you know and I do not mean to be harsh man but I do not think it be mean to be use as a rock star 's personal safety net you do not know that maybe they send you back to keep I alive so I could finish my album Nick if you go down again I can not be there for you there be still time you know we can save he I think maybe you do not have enough faith in kevin he can do this he be special that be why they have I wake he up Tess I pack an adrenaline shoot when we

this place surround nobody fire he be not go anywhere Diana be you all right Tom Whoa hold still burkhoff put your hand up Burkhoff they will not be able to hide for long tess will run out of meds Dr Burkhoff be not exactly inconspicuous they will show themselves we will find they you mean we will find tess it do not sound like burkhoff will live out the week I do not get it he be suppose to be the father of 4400 technology that be why they wake he up well that be just our theory maybe you be put too much faith in the future Diana 's okay yeah she will get there she be down in ntac medical you get we a ride someone let I borrow they all this feel strange and untrue and I will not waste a minute without you my bone ache my skin feel cold and I be get so tired and so old tell I that you will open your eye tell I that you will open your eye all this feel strange and untrue and I will not waste a minute without you mr Ryland want a status report on the promicin we be good great actually we have enough of a stockpile to last we for almost two year liukan sync FRM by www 1000fr com over the last 60 year 4400 people have be abduct all at once they be return with no memory of where they 've be they have not age a day and some have return with new ability all be try to reconnect with a life interrupt we be not a threat we be salvation the world will have to deal with we previously on the 4400 you be so sweet I wish I could take you with I when I go but I can not yesterday a few patient be compel to work on this thing and today it be the entire hospital if we get tess out of here do you think this compulsion will fade I be inject myself with a modify version of the promicin serum I will have teach my body how to produce promicin and then I will be the first non returnee to develop 4400 ability enough run dr Burkhoff you need to come with we now no stay back I do not want to hurt anyone that be very reassuring we will keep that in mind no no no Mr Tyler come in what can I do for you I want to ask you about your work with the student here sure I teach three class history art and I be not talk about your teaching I be talk about the counseling that you do I understand you use your ability with the kid that be right my ability be to help they focus their ability it be pretty much what I 've be do ever since I come back if a student have a talent like all of our kid here do I help they learn how to use it gain control of it build their confidence do it work with adult it do not use to but I have not try it since I 've be off the inhibitor why I develop this ability a few month ago telekinesis what a word huh I can not even say it with a straight face that be fantastic I 've just be pretend it be not there I mean I know a little bit about it so far it only work with inanimate object little stuff but when I be mad or excited I can do a lot more with it and you be look to control it when you be calm yeah that be why I be here I guess how many time do I have to go over this with you people I have not be inject promicininto anyone but myself you be certain of that you be a world class scientist I find it difficult to believe you would not build a redundancy plan into your experiment this be not your basic sleep study I mean look at I do you think I would have an easy time find volunteer no I do not oh you look like you be in quite a bit of discomfort to I yes well you can relax now the experiment be over this will only hurt for a minute Bag he we will take he back for the autopsy Get dr Burkhoff up there quickly they promise result by the morning Mommy Mommy be you okay oh of course sweetie I be fine why would not I be I have a bad dream and you be in it well you get in and tell I about it you turn into a monster it be horrible it seem so real it be you but you be different what kind of a monster Nice something for the refrigerator door you do not think there be anything to this it be not a prediction right just a bad dream well I hope so but when your daughter be a precog you do not want she give you a picture like this hello this be skouris well thank you for call I back let I know if you see he all right everything okay maybe I be not sure I mean that be the 4400 center I be hope maybe they would see dr Burkhoff I stop by his apartment yesterday and he be not home uh diana why would you be stop by dr Burkhoff 's apartment you actually see the wound in kevin 's hand heal over yes he pull the scalpel out and it be go within second he be develop an ability I mean he be close to it anyway he say it come and go what anyone else develop a 4400 ability I should know about I should have tell you early you be damn right you should have get to hand it to you diana some people play racketball in their spare time maybe collect old record but you you play igor to the one man who well if he have develop an ability like you say maybe he really be the father of 4400 technology just like the future predict be you two the only one who know about this experiment I think we be and now I be not so sure and that be what I be worried about Tom what if someone else find out what he be up to well if he succeed we could be talk about the mass marketing of 4400 ability I be sure a lot of people would like to keep that genie in the bottle would not make our job any easy be you be you okay that be just my allergy

in a couple of week I have no idea he would get so bad think it be a self portrait no way Kevin 's hand be not steady enough to make coffee do not tess like to draw I feel like I be in a stare contest it be okay I know it can be a little awkward at first so sometimes when I be have trouble getting start with a student I will take their hand it help everything get roll you up for it yeah I guess

be he say Nick have a prescription for antabuse they be these pill that be suppose to help he cut back on his drinking he finally try some I guess he overdo it huh it be the same thing he do with everything he insist on come here instead of the hospital do your bad please come to my arm my beamish boy lie down lie down you be my little lifeline Kevin Dr Burkhoff I 've be worried about you what be you do hide up here my god look at you Dr Burkhoff you need to come with we we be go to get you some help I can not do that People be try to kill I what people who be try to kill you I think they work for the government they do not work for ntac be you sure about that because I be not listen kevin you know we if you come in we will protect you and besides I be not take no for an answer come on actually I think you be go to have to Diana what the hell be you do I do not know tom I be sorry Diana 's not quite herself right now she will do whatever tess want she to tess will you get his gun please please I be so close to finish stop try to find I I have no desire to hurt you Diana be you okay be you all right I do not know what happen you pull your gun on I Tess yeah oh god what something 's wrong I just feel weird oh my god what be those they be lesion they be just like the one kevin have when he start take promicin we need to get you to ntac medical we want to bring in if there be anything at all to these experiment dr Burkhoff have be conduct a lot of people in d c be go to want to look over his note these picture have already be circulate to local law enforcement we be go to distribute they around the neighborhood near dr Burkhoff 's apartment and the vacation home where he be hide maybe we will get lucky so what we be suppose to tell people that there be some kind of monster on the loose no if anyone ask we tell they dr Burkhoff have werner syndrome it be a rare wasting disease okay but do you really think we will be able to bring this guy in safe and sound I mean some cowboy cop see this stumbling towards he you do not think he might shoot first and ask question later that be why we have to get to he first whatever dr Burkhoff be guilty of he save thousand of life during the inhibitor scandal the good thing about his condition be it should not make he too hard to spot I do not know you be nice hand but they do not look magical or anything make friend already hey you 've choose wisely I speak from experience the show be amazing thank you so much for have I what be you thank I for the show would 've be cancel if not for you listen I just have the good idea during the encore why do not you come out on the road with we and do what well you could start with mischa and work your way onward from there okay yeah it be tempting but I kind of have a lot on my plate here in seattle you know I be suppose to get marry soon well in that case you have to come with we it will be like an extended bachelor party we will take good care of you Promise and a promise from mischa be money in the bank besides I like have you along with we you keep I limber you mean upright well yeah that too um it be just I be not your personal physician you know of course you be not you be a hell of a lot well than any doctor I 've ever meet oh think about it but not too long what be to think about who could say no to all of this so what can I get you this morning could I have the steak and egg could you make the steak extremely rare Thanks Dr Burkhoff be spot at a diner in beacon hill he be there right now bring he in quietly if you can but bring he in Diana wake up Dr Anapurn I think I be suppose to sleep you give I drug you be be discharge you need to come with I I do not know I guess he leave about 15 minute ago do he say where he be head no I mean he do not even touch the food he order right he just leave in a hurry leave a good tip then where be we go thank you you can go back to your office now tess do not do this I be sorry I wish it do not have to be you but there be no one else we would well go he will be wait for we how could I have do that I do not remember any of it Diana do not remember go to kevin 's apartment at night either if dr Burkhoff 's willing to break she out of here he must be get desperate feel like he be run out of time which mean he have to complete the experiment he be go to up her dosage if we do not find diana soon she be go to wind up in the same shape as kevin I think it be the silence that be mess we up it be too awkward so instead of we just stare at each other I think we will talk okay um be there something specific you want to talk about no you pick well I 've be think about my parent a lot lately what they would think of all this this place I sit here try to figure out how to use my telekinetic ability you know you can say it out loud it be nothing to be embarrassed about yeah you can say that but when I first get back I be a 4400 but I do not have an ability I feel normal it be something I could hold on to now you have to get use to the idea that you be special be that what my parent would thinkif they be here or would they just think that their son have become a freak Richard when you got take you be one of the first black pilot in all of the military you be at the vanguard now you be part of a different vanguard there be a reason they pick you I think your parent would be proud yeah uh maybe that be true Richard Whoa well I guess that work huh this will be fine we can work here for a while tell he he can go home please you have to help I say something do not bother he be not go to remember any of this thank you you can go home now Kevin can I get you some water I be fine Kevin you be die you be kill yourself and now you be go to kill I too no you will not die my work be valid be you sure look at yourself if it be not work in I the fault be not with the experiment it be with I all those year the shock treatment the fistful of medication they must have change I I be not a good subject there be no good subject Kevin you be brilliant but you be wrong you fail and you be notthinke clearly enough to see that my mind be not compromise we be at a point Diana where it would be easy for the timid to turn back we have to be braver than that and if necessary oh no oh I be prepared to be brave enough for both of we work on a song the end of one can not nail it though Inspiration be you shocked I be drink my lunch I do not say anything good because this be listen this here be call maintain a base level that be kind of scary actually Shawn do not worry I 've make a solemn vow not to over indulge unless of course you be around yeah that be kind of the thing you be not go to be around be that it you be not come on the road I want to it be just you know even if it be for a little while this gift I have though it be kind of a responsibility you know and I do not mean to be harsh man but I do not think it be mean to be use as a rock star 's personal safety net you do not know that maybe they send you back to keep I alive so I could finish my album Nick if you go down again I can not be there for you there be still time you know we can

and ask question later that be why we have to get to he first whatever Dr Burkhoff be guilty of he save thousand of life during the inhibitor scandal look the good thing about his condition be it should not make he too hard to spot I do not know they be nice hand but they do not look magical or anything make friend already hey oh you 've choose wisely I speak from experience the show be

soon well in that case you have to come with we it will be like an extended bachelor party he will take good care of you Promise and a promise from Mischa be money in the bank besides I like have you along with we you keep I limber you mean upright oh yeah that too I do not I be not your personal physician you know of course you be not you be a hell of a lot well than any doctor I 've ever meet think about it but not too long what be to think about who could say no to all of this so what can I get you this morning could I have the steak and egg could you make the steak extremely rare Thanks Dr Burkhoff be spot at a diner in Beacon Hill he be there right now bring he in quietly if you can but bring he in Diana wake up Dr Anapurn I think I be suppose to sleep you give I drug you be be

for we how could I have do that I do not remember any of it Diana do not remember go to Kevin 's apartment at night either if Dr Burkhoff 's willing to break she out of here he must be get desperate feel like he be run out of time he have to complete the experiment he be go to up her dosage if we do not find Diana soon she be go to wind up in the same shape as Kevin I think it be the silence that be mess we up it be too awkward so instead of we just stare at each other I think we will talk okay something specific you want to talk about no you pick well I 've be think about my parent a lot lately what they would think of all this this place I sit here try to figure out how to use my telekinetic ability you know you can say it out loud it be nothing to be embarrassed about yeah you can say that but when I first get back I be a 4400 but I do not have an ability I feel normal it be something I could hold onto now you have to get use to the idea that you be special be that what my parent would think if they be here or would they just think that their son have become a freak Richard when you got take you be one of the first black pilot in all of the military you be at the vanguard now you be part of a different vanguard there be a reason they pick you I think your parent would be proud yeah maybe that be true Richard well I guess that work huh this will be fine we can work here for a while tell he he can go home please you got to help I say something do not bother he be not go to remember any of this thank you you can go home now Kevin can I get you some water no I be fine Kevin you be die you be kill yourself and now you be go to kill I too no you will not die my work be valid be you sure look at yourself if it be not work in I the fault be not with the experiment it be with I all those year of shock treatment the fistful of medication they must have change I I be not a good subject there be no good subject Kevin you be brilliant but you be wrong you fail and you be not think clearly enough to see that my mind be not compromise we be at a point Diana where it would be easy for the timid to turn back we have to be braver than that and if necessary I be prepared to be brave enough for both of we work on a song the end of one can not nail it though Inspiration what be you shocked I be drink my lunch I do not say anything good because listen this here be call maintain a base level it be kind of scary actually Shawn do not worry I 've make a solemn vow not to overindulge unless of course you be around yeah that be kind of the thing you be not go to be around be that it you be not come on the road I want to it be just I mean even if it be for a little while this gift I have though it be kind of a responsibility you know and I do not mean to

again I can not be there for you there be still time you know we can save he I think maybe you do not have enough faith in Kevin he can do this he be special that be why they have I wake he up tess I pack an adrenaline shoot when we leave the cabin have you see it no I need it it have to be here in case I slip under Kevin I think I got sting by a bee what be this do not move Dr Burkhoff Tess there

tess will run out of meds Dr Burkhoff 's not exactly inconspicuous they will show themselves we will find they you mean we will find tess do not sound like Dr Burkhoff 's go to live out the week I do not get it he be suppose to be the father of 4400 technology that be why they wake he up well that be just our theory maybe you be put too much faith in the future Diana 's okay yeah she will get

this before no there be no document disease that affect the human body this way mean a 4400 ability do this that be for you to figure out all I can tell you be there be no earthly explanation about what happen to this guy thank so nothing even close okay thank brian that be the lab they run the composite sketch of the driver against our database of 4400 no match anything from forensic no they pull a couple of partial print off the safety pin that hold the note to the kid 's jacket but nothing we can make an i d from okay what about the note it be a deliberate message to whoever find the body that be typical of a serial killer pathology yeah but it say 27 there can not be 26 other corpse like tim mccarren 's out there even one would make it onto our radar so we will talk to mccarren 's friend family maybe he be get a connection to a 4400 Diana there be one other thing I want to talk to you about you get plan on sunday Y you want I to go to shawn 's wedding with you it be not a

the ntac table you would have a hard time find a dance partner look you know maia beg I to go and I tell she no all those 4400 in one place we have no idea what could happen Diana it be shawn and isabelle Nobody be go to cause any trouble I mean would you want to be on the bride 's bad side I can not imagine you be eager to welcome that girl into the family I be not this all happen a little too quickly for my liking but shawn will not talk to I about it I must have leave he 20 message I be think about go to see he after we finish work today just make sure bridezilla be out of earshot I have to have to you be about to get marry shawn you should want to what be go on be she be she pregnant no no nothing like that be she force you look shawn if you be feel trap if you be look for a way

everybody they just can not keep anything work around here this always happen when I work late you know I do not even know where the stair be in this place right down here come on I will show you so do you always work past 8 00 Most night yeah try to get ahead you know Dedication I like that you could accomplish great thing her name be paula nakata she be a lawyer at a firm in the building my god the poor woman that be two body in less than 24 hour it do not make any sense Most spree killer they have a type but tim mccarren and paula nakata could hardly be more different a prostitute and a corporate attorney why would someone target these two and why be she label 11 the number on the body be work backwards it look like we might have a partial print on the wedding band it be probably from the victim but you never know let us hope whoever do this slip up because I do not think he be anywhere close to finish yet we be so close we be go to save everything Isabelle change you you do not even know who you be anymore she do not change I she show I who I be I know myself well than ever and I know exactly what have to happen here do not do this Gasps rasp Shawn cough Marco do you go home last night uh no uh I be work on your case it get late Cold we have a message you want to talk to we uh yeah the print that they pull from paula nakata 's wedding band be not hers do it match the one we find on tim mccarren 's body it do indeed the print belong to a man name darren piersahl Piersahl I never hear of he I be not surprised see he be not a 4400 well then he be not the murderer Marco you see both body a 4400 kill these people it certainly look that way but the fingerprint match be not from our database it be from u s military record Piersahl be an army ranger for seven year be what be he do now not much accord to army record darren piersahl be dead he be kill in action in iraq in 2005 I be wonder how could an army sergeant who be supposedly be dead for a year be use a 4400 ability darren always want to be a ranger it be his dream ever since he be old enough to read I encourage it I spend 20 year in the service myself so when darren sign up it be like carry on the family legacy why be ntac so interested in my son 's death anyway it be part of an ongoing investigation mr Piersahl please anything you could tell we would help not long before he die I get a letter from darren he be excite say he have be accept into this elite training unit he could not tell I much about it just that it mean he be be transfer off the front line and out of harm 's way and he be kill in action soon after that two week later the army tell I he have be fly a recon mission in an oh 58 helicopter it got hit with an rpg they never do find his remain I be so sorry mr Piersahl but you say the army tell you he be fly a recon mission do you have any reason to doubt that well I think the timing be peculiar I mean I just get this letter from he say he be do fight so I do some check there be six soldier report dead in the crash that kill my son and why be that unusual because an oh 58 fly with a crew of four it can not hold six people a secret training program a death under suspicious circumstance there be something off here even the kid 's dad know it it be weird I be not deny it but let us just take our time with this okay there be explanation that do not involve a cover up someone could have plant darren piersahl 's fingerprint at the crime scene who know it could be a 4400 someone who can mimic other people 's fingerprint maybe cell phone ringing but if you be try to frame someone why would you pick a dead man Baldwin where we will be right in they just find another body Clinking I will let you all in on a little family secret my brother and I have not always see eye to eye so we do not talk for a while I go to college he become the most famous person in the world but it be all good because he be a great guy and I be really proud of he I think we all be so congratulation man I could not be happy to see you walk the plank Group Congratulations Cheers be there anything you would like to say daddy Glass clink Toast the father of the bride want to speak uh shawn isabelle I have to say I have my doubt but my daughter have manage to overcome they she be determine to make this marriage happen and here we all be Shawn she could not have pick a well partner I be proud to call you my son Cheers Cheers Cheers so where you go on your honeymoon well we have not really figure that out yet if you will all please excuse I stay you keep charm your in law I will see what be up Isabelle oh you see I die you be sure I kill you and richard I swear to god it look like I be enjoy it the whole reason that I be marry isabelle be to keep she attach normal that be not what happen I do not make she more human she make I less human listen I have to try something I have to go I have to see if it change anything you be go to walk out on the wedding maybe I do not know I be I be get out of here and then I be go to see what happen if you leave now it be not go to make isabelle very happy it might not be that easy to come back I know that but I have to do it just tell they I be sick or something I be sorry just tell they something okay her name be holly martin she be a housewife in madison park the pool man find her body be there a note 92 how many people be this guy target Knock on door guy I figure out what all these corpse have in common all the victim have the same mutation we do a genetic workup on all three corpse every one of they have a slight alteration of the 11th chromosome it be call the starzl mutation that could be a coincidence not likely the starzl mutation be extremely rare the only document case be in the seattle area see there be two kind of mutation some occur naturally you know something go wrong when the body be build itself other be induce the gene be change by external factor the starzl mutation be induce that be right start in 1969 seattle presbyterian hospital use a flawed radiation machine to treat their cancer patient the microswitche that control the thing be not work so the dosage be all off how long do this go on just under five year once the hospital figure out what they be do they test everyone who have ever be expose to it in some case the radiation induce a small mutation the starzl mutation yeah they name it after the company that make the bad machine and the mutation 's replicable People who get it pass it on to their kid which include our three victim but they be all live normal life they be healthy just like most mutation you can have it and not even know after everything go public the lawyer come out to play there be a class action lawsuit Seattle presbyterian pay a huge settlement to everyone who be affect by the machine they almost go bankrupt so darren piersahl who be suppose to be dead be target carrier of the starzl mutation which only occur around seattle and have absolutely no effect on its carrier okay but why excellent question when you find out make sure you tell I if there be a lawsuit there be a paper trail I bet you that hospital keep a master list of everyone they pay Shawn grunt with effort Gasping you okay Shawn you have to stop heal I no you be go to make it uncle tommy no shawn I be not this be all my fault I should never have talk you out of marry isabelle no that be my decision not yours I can not help think that it do not have to end this way everyone we love be dead I be sorry the catastrophe be here hey no no no hold on hold on hold on hold on choke no let I go let I go Save as many as you can shawn you be lucky until six week ago I have not pull that file in year if you have ask I then it would have take I hour to find it what happen six week ago some guy in a suit show up he have a document with he say that the military need the file for uh research in the war on terror yeah there we go there it be that be the master list of everyone we pay in the starzl case this man can you tell I his name yeah mile enright why you know he not yet there be 123 people here 123 people we know have the starzl mutation and the number we 've be find on the dead body correspond to where they appear on the list Number 27 timothy mccarren Number 11 paula nakata and holly martin 92 so darren piersahl if he be the killer be work from the same list we be hold but the order seem so random I mean be he just kill they as the opportunity arise or be there some method I will try and find a pattern hey um how be maia be she be okay she ask about you a lot yeah I just check out mile enright he be a vice president of research and development at haspelcorp Dennis you 've be ignore our call I be busy tom why do not you go through my assistant maybe we can talk next week or so it be important ryland it be about darren piersahl and your company 's program to create a division of the u s Military with 4400 ability I do not know tom I 've be work here less than three month I still do not know where the supply closet be and now you 've get I head up a covert program where I be inject promicin into united states soldier six week ago the vice president of research and development acquire a list of everyone with the starzl mutation Miles enright maybe you know he sorry it be a big building I have not meet everybody yet three people be dead now you need to tell we everything you know about darren piersahl so we can bring he in before he kill anyone else I 've never hear of he and I 've certainly never hear of this what do you call it Starzl mutation this be your last chance to cooperate before we find piersahl if you help we now we will make it look well for your company later dennis well how can I help you when I have no idea what you be talk about now if this program exist and please understand I be not say it do you seem to think that people would be shock to know that it be out there I I think they would be grateful I think any good citizen would be thankful that his government be work on this because you can be damn sure our enemy be if everyone would be so happy why not just tell we about it as usual you have no idea of what the stake be whoever control promicin have a strategic advantage over the rest of the world this be another manhattan project tom and they do not close it down because a couple of technician get radiation poisoning they keep on work and they be right to do that it be make the world a well place not that you be admit that the program exist right what program so if I go through with it if I marry isabelle you and I become enemy I kill you if I do not do it richard thing be even bad People be dead a lot of people in the second vision your uncle say that the catastrophe be here right the place look like a war zone what the hell be I suppose to do look you can only deal with the information you have in one future I die in another it sound like thousand of people maybe million be at risk that be no choice at all we be talk about your life the guy say each vision be one possible future if you do marry isabelle at least we be go into it with our eye open now that we know what could happen we can change thing nothing 's inevitable right let us hope not because believe I I do not want to die Meet staff sergeant john shaffner okay so why be we meet he he be one of six fatality in the helicopter crash that kill darren piersahl a helicopter that seat only four right turn out john shaffner 's family never receive his remain either you know there be really a helicopter crash that day in iraq but four family get their kid ' body back and two do not so here be what I be think you think piersahl and shaffner be recruit into haspelcorp 's training program at the same time so they use the crash to fake two death so that piersahl and shaffner could disappear into the program with impunity so we have a second member of haspelcorp 's program which be great but it do not get we any close to darren piersahl good point it do not really not until you look at shaffner 's dog tag this be shaffner 's military serial number look familiar should it 27 that be what the note we find on tim mccarren say that be also where we find his name on the list of people with the starzl mutation 11 that be paula nakata 's number and holly martin be 92 on the list there be a pattern he be pick the order base on his buddy 's serial number okay but why maybe it be a message maybe they be do it together but if he be consistent the next victim will be number 38 on the starzl list Alex messina I already check he out he manage a bike store in madrona yeah I recognize he he be in here early today do he say anything to you it be kind of weird actually he ask I if my name be alex messina and he say it like that you know the full name he want to know if I could come out and take a look at his bike he need to replace a part I tell he just to bring it in he say he would come back when we be less busy send a tactical team over right away thank if piersahl make a move we will be ready Tom it must be from piersahl hey do you like this color this place need to be a little more girly if I be go to be live here yeah it look great I think so too I be glad you be back if piersahl know we be on to he he will change his pattern of attack there be about a dozen people we can not find let us hope we get to they before piersahl do Man Tom baldwin yeah who be ask my name be john John shaffner I be a volunteer in the same program darren piersahl be in the one that drive he crazy yeah we know who you be and we know about the program Good we be volunteer all of we I still remember the sale pitch we would be the elite a new type of soldier we have to give up our life forfeit our identity they say it be the only way the program have to operate in complete secrecy when do you start get the injection right away it start slow but about three week ago they start up our dosage that be when guy start to lose it where do they get their promicin I do not know but they seem to have plenty of it though Darren be the first one who could do stuff an ability he kill one of the instructor by mistake it freak he out you two escape together once we get out we pretty much go our separate way I have no idea he be go do this so he be awol these murder be not sanction by anyone no darren 's freelancing that be why they want he back so bad he be compromise the program our c o S they tell we about the starzl mutation they tell we it could be a threat but they never tell we to kill anybody then what be it why do darren want they dead so badly it be get something to do with baby so far any time a 4400 have a kid with a member of the regular population their baby be normal they do not make promicin they do not have ability we know we 've be track the birth the starzl mutation change all that if a 4400 have a kid with someone who have the mutation the baby would be promicin positive they would have ability how would the military even know that have they try it I do not know but they seem pretty goddamn sure it be true I know this be go to sound crazy but darren be a victim here too they give we so many stimulant they ampe we up to kill and he snap I do not know if he think he be on a mission or something but I know he need to be stop I will do whatever I can to help you find he Ryland so what do you think you know everything include the starzl mutation and I have to give you credit if what you say be right it would explain why the 4400 be send back in 2004 why they be all bring to seattle this be the only place the 4400 can reproduce and have kid with ability any of this sound familiar I think I read the same theory in a supermarket tabloid once we know about your enhanced soldier program dennis we have one of your people John shaffner been show up for many roll call lately well as soon as we have piersahl we be go public with this and there be nothing you can do to stop that all you can do be make yourself and this company look slightly well by cooperate with our effort to bring he in we want piersahl 's personnel file everything you have if it be not in my hand in 90 second john shaffner will be stand in front of a bank of camera before lunch this could be something maybe it read like some kind of personal statement an essay by piersahl yeah we have to do those to get in the program they want we to write about some goal we achieve something we be proud of this be all about a volunteer program that he do there be a patch of forest that got clear by a fire Piersahl volunteer to renew it so that he could become a darren piersahl be an eagle scout yeah he use to talk about those wood all the time when we be in the middle of the program whenever thing get really bad he use to tell I that be where he would go in his head he would imagine himself there it calm he down this patch of forest any chance you know where it be camera click maybe you could put your arm around her mr Tyler that be great the magazine want to get a shot of the bride and groom have anyone see the groom who give you the key your own bodyguard Keys clatter you start a war richard you turn the 4400 into an army and you launch an attack for no reason we do not have a choice it have to be a preemptive strike no choice look at what you be do look at it it have to stop Isabelle change you you do not even know who you be anymore she do not change I she show I who I be I know myself well than ever and I know exactly what have to happen here do not do this Gasps rasp Shawn knock on door Shawn sorry to barge in on you it be just they need you down in the garden Pictures be you okay I be fine I be just a little overwhelmed

anything Tom tom Tom Sputtering we lose shaffner Piersahl 's dead he be on his way out before we even start fight Piersahl have a stab wound in his stomach I guess shaffner do not go down without a fight yeah well they be both go and there be no one leave to talk about the program we still have evidence we can go after haspelcorp expose everything yeah but it would 've be nice to have a face to put out there I mean now all we have be accusation and a paper trail and five dead body hey you guy get to see this we be proud to announce the existence of this enhanced soldier program to all the world but it should not in any way be see as an offensive maneuver we have evidence suggest that other country have similar program this be merely a response the young man I be about to introduce to you have be work in secret and we 've make numerous advance in time they will become the first non 4400 to develop extra human ability and they will use they in the defense of the united states now I would like to introduce eight heroic young man all of whom have give so much of themselves to make this breakthrough possible Ryland 's preempt we trot they out there on stage like they be the first astronaut major jeremy elwood first lieutenant raymond garcia first lieutenant jeff rice first lieutenant brian dawson second lieutenant james knowlon second lieutenant dirk danoff the press conference be a clever move dennis I have to give credit where it be due but this company have five body on its hand and I be go to make sure everyone know it know what we be not deny anything it be unfortunate that one of my man go awol but he be clearly derange I 've get a whole team of doctor stand by to testify to that effect you create an assassin it be a tragedy and it be news I will admit that but tomorrow morning the piersahl case will be below the fold on every newspaper and all the headline will be about our program that be the way I see it anyway who be feed you your information you know about the starzl mutation before we do you have a source of promicin for your program who be it you give I too much credit tom that stuff happen way above my security clearance the soldier you be create be you really go to use they to defend the country or be you just go to send they after the 4400 be there a difference enjoy your nephew 's wedding you sure you be ready for this you

not love you Shawn you and I be the two most powerful people on the planet we have to get marry I know she be different Dangerous you can not kill I Shawn Richard if I believe that stay with lsabelle would save all those life I would marry she tomorrow but what happen if she get tired of I or I make she angry there be thing I be send here to do brutal thing I do not know how you know that but it

invite I to your wedding thank you but you do not have to Isabelle and I invite every 4400 I would not have miss it I be quite excited you must be too the ceremony 's so close four day I have to offer you a word of caution this cigar when you smoke it you might be surprise by its effect oh I be not go to get arrest for have this be l of course not about a year after we return I learn I have an ability when I come in contact with a person they sometimes see a vision of their future I see nothing understand only those I touch but I be tell it can be quite accurate kind of a nice talent thank you I grow this tobacco myself it be be in contact with my hand and so it contain my ability wait so what you be say be if I smoke this cigar I be go to see the future your future a possible one anyway as I say use with caution you might not like what you see but it seem an appropriate gift for a man on his wedding day well it be well than a toaster oven thank you Claudio my congratulation to you the centerpiece be amazing you should take a look yeah sure after we be do with these meet and greet though okay oh you be take up smoking this be Edwin Garrett and his wife Denise they come from Edinburgh to be here thank you so much for come the guy 's name be Tim McCarren he be a hustler work an area of the park not far from here I find his body just after sunrise now I 've already interview his colleague and they say he get into a pickup truck with a man in his 20 at about 1 30 last night one of the other work boy get a decent look at the driver you could probably sit he down with a sketch artist we could but you do realize we be not homicide cop right we be from NTAC so why would you call we that be why my good guess this body be completely oxidize it be a chemical reaction Cells change at the molecular level well oxidize that be what happen when metal rust exactly well almost exactly Rusting be a slow process there be nothing gradual about what happen to Tim McCarren one minute he be alive the next have you ever see anything like this before no there be no document disease that affect the human body this way mean a 4400 ability do this that be for you to figure out all I can tell you be there be no earthly explanation about what happen to this guy thank so nothing even close okay thank Brian that be the lab they run the composite sketch of the driver against their database of 4400 no match anything from forensic no well they pull a couple of partial print off the safety pin that hold the note to the kid 's jacket but nothing we can make an ld from okay what about the note it be a deliberate message to whoever find the body that be typical of a serial killer pathology yeah but it say 27 there can not be 26 other corpse like Tim McCarren 's out there even one would make it onto our radar so we will talk to McCarren 's friend family maybe he be get a connection to a 4400 Diana there be one other thing I wanna talk to you about you get plan on Sunday you want I to go to Shawn 's wedding with you it be not a date okay I figure you might be interested almost a thousand 4400 be come oh so it be a professional courtesy yeah that be one way to put it look to be honest I would rather not be the only one sit at the NTAC table you would have a hard time find a dance partner look you know Maia beg I to go and I tell she no all those 4400 in one place we have no idea what could happen Diana it be Shawn and lsabelle nobody be go to cause any trouble I mean would you wanna be on the bride 's bad side I can not imagine you be eager to welcome that girl into the family I be not this all happen a little too quickly for my like but Shawn will not talk to I about it I must have leave he 20 message I be think about go to see he after we finish work today just make sure Bridezilla be out of earshot I have to have to you be about to get marry Shawn you should want to what be go on be she pregnant no no nothing like that be she force you look Shawn if you be feel trap if you be look for a way out of this just tell I I can help help Uncle Tommy I be not in front of a firing squad I be getting marry People do it all the time come on Shawn you be marry lsabelle she be a very dangerous girl I happen to know that okay I know all about she too so do not think you be go to surprise I I appreciate you come down here I know you mean well this marriage it be the right thing the right thing for who for everybody man they just can not keep anything work around here this always happen when I work late you know I do not even know where the stair be in this place oh right down here come on I will show you so do you always work past 8 Most night yeah try to get ahead you know Dedication I like that you could accomplish great thing her name be Paula Nakata she be a lawyer at a firm in the building my God the poor woman that be two body in less than 24 hour it do not make any sense Most spree killer they have a type but Tim McCarren and Paula Nakata could hardly be more different a prostitute and a corporate attorney why would someone target these two and why be she label 1 1 the number on the body be work backwards it look like we might have a partial print on the wedding band it be probably from the victim but you never know let us hope whoever do this slip up because I do not think he be anywhere close to finish yet we be so close we be go to save everything Isabelle change you you do not even know who you be anymore she do not change I she show I who I be I know myself well than ever and I know exactly what have to happen here do not do this Shawn Marco do you go home last night no I be work on your case it get late Cold we get a message you want to talk to we yeah the print that they pull from Paula Nakata 's wedding band be not hers do it match the one we find on Tim McCarren 's body it do indeed the print belong to a man name Darren Piersahl Piersahl I 've never hear of he I be not surprised see he be not a 4400 well then he be not the murderer Marco you see both body a 4400 kill these people it certainly look that way the fingerprint match be not from our database it be from U S military record Piersahl be an Army Ranger for seven year be what be he do now not much accord to Army record Darren Piersahl be dead he be kill in action in lraq in 2005 I be wonder how could an Army sergeant who be supposedly be dead for a year be use a 4400 ability to kill people in present day Seattle Darren always want to be a Ranger it be his dream ever since he be old enough to read I encourage it I spend 20 year in the service myself so when Darren sign up it be like carry on the family legacy why be NTAC so interested in my son 's death anyway it be part of an ongoing investigation Mr Piersahl please anything you could tell we would help not long before he die I get a letter from Darren he be excite say he have be accept into this elite training unit he could not tell I much about it just that it mean he be be transfer off the frontline and out of harm 's way and he be kill in action soon after that two week later the Army tell I he have be fly a recon mission in an oh 58 helicopter got hit by an RPG they never do find his remain I be so sorry Mr Piersahl but you say the Army tell you he be fly a recon mission do you have any reason to doubt that well I think the timing be peculiar I mean I would just get this letter from he say he be do fight so I do some check there be six soldier report dead in the crash that kill my son and why be that unusual because an oh 58 fly with a crew of four it can not hold six people a secret training program a death under suspicious circumstance there be something off here even the kid 's dad know it it be weird I be not deny it but let us just take our time with this okay there be other explanation that do not involve cover up someone could 've plant Piersahl 's fingerprint at the crime scene who know it could be a 4400 someone who can mimic other people 's fingerprint maybe but if you be try to frame someone why pick a dead man Baldwin where we will be right in they just find another body I will let you all in on a little family secret my brother and l have not always see eye to eye so we do not talk for a while I go to college he become the most famous person in the world but it be all good because he be a great guy and I be really proud of he I think we all be so congratulation man I could not be happy to see you walk the plank Congratulations thank you Cheers be there anything you would like to say Daddy Toast the father of the bride want to speak Shawn lsabelle I have to say I have my doubt but my daughter have manage to overcome they she be determined to make this marriage happen and here we all be Shawn she could not have pick a well partner I be proud to call you my son Cheers Cheers Cheers so where be you guy go on your honeymoon you know we have not really figure that out yet if you will all please excuse I stay you keep charm the in law I will see what be up Isabelle you see I die you be sure I kill you and Richard I swear to God it look like I be enjoy it the whole reason I be marry lsabelle be to keep she attach normal that be not what happen I do not make she more human she make I less human I have to try something I have to go I have to see if it change anything go to walk out on the wedding maybe I do not know I be get out of here and then I be go to see what happen if you leave now it be not go to make lsabelle very happy it might not be easy to come back I know that but I have to do it just tell they I be sick or something I be sorry just tell they something okay her name be Holly Martins she be a housewife in Madison Park the pool man find her body be there a note Ninety two how many people be this guy target guy I figure out what all these corpse have in common all the victim have the same mutation we do a genetic workup on all three corpse every one of they have a slight alteration of the 1 1 th chromosome it be call the Starzl Mutation that could be a coincidence not likely the Starzl Mutation 's extremely rare the only document case be in the Seattle area you see there be two kind of mutation some occur naturally you know something go wrong when the body 's building itself other be induce the gene be change by external factor and the Starzl Mutation be induce that be right start in 1 969 Seattle Presbyterian Hospital use a flawed radiation machine to treat their cancer patient you know the microswitche that control the thing be not work the dosage be all off how long do this go on under five year once the hospital figure out what they be do they test everyone who have ever be expose to it in some case the radiation induce a small mutation the Starzl Mutation yeah they name it after the company that make the bad machine and the mutation 's replicable you know people who get it pass it on to their kid which include our three victim they be live normal life they be healthy hey just like most mutation you can have it and not even know after everything go public the lawyer come out to play there be a class action lawsuit Seattle Presbyterian pay a huge settlement to everyone who be affect by the machine they almost go bankrupt so Darren Piersahl who be suppose to be dead be target carrier of the Starzl Mutation which only occur around Seattle and have absolutely no effect on its carrier okay but why excellent question when you find out make sure you tell I if there be a lawsuit there be a paper trail I will bet you that hospital keep a master list of everyone they pay you okay you okay Shawn you should stop heal I no you be go to make it Uncle Tom no no Shawn I be not this be all my fault I should never have talk you out of marry lsabelle no that be my decision not yours I can not help think that it do not have to end this way everyone we love be dead I be sorry the catastrophe 's here hey no no no hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on no let I go let I go let I go Save as many as you can Shawn you be lucky until six week ago I have not pull that file in year if you have ask I then it would 've take I hour what happen six week ago oh some guy in a suit show up have a document with he say that the military need the file for research in the war on terror yeah there we go there it be that be the master list of everyone we pay in the Starzl case this man can you tell I his name yeah Miles Enright why you know he not yet there be 1 23 people here a hundred and twenty three we know have the mutation number we 've be find on the dead body correspond to where they appear on the list Number 27 Timothy McCarren Number 1 1 Paula Nakata and Holly Martin 's 92 so Darren Piersahl if he be the killer be work from the same list we be hold but the order seem so random I mean be he just kill they as the opportunity arise or be there some method I will try and find a pattern hey how be Maia be she be okay she ask about you a lot yeah I just check out Miles Enright he be the vice president of Research and Development at Haspel Corp Dennis you 've be ignore our call I be busy Tom why do not you go through my assistant maybe we can talk next week or so it be important Ryland it be about Darren Piersahl and your company 's program to create a division of the U S military with 4400 ability I do not know Tom I 've be work here less than three month I still do not know where the supply closet be and now you 've get I head up a covert program where I be inject promicin into United States soldier six week ago the vice president of Research and Development acquire a list of everyone with the Starzl Mutation Miles Enright maybe you know he sorry it be a big building I have not shake everybody 's hand three people be dead now you need to tell we everything you know about Darren Piersahl so we can bring he in before he kill anyone else I 've never hear of he and I 've certainly never hear of this what do you call it Starzl Mutation this be your last chance to cooperate before we find Piersahl if you help we now we will make it look well for your company later Dennis well how can I help you when I have no idea what you be talk about now if this program exist and please understand I be not say it do you seem to think that people would be shock to know that it be out there I I think they would be grateful I think any good citizen would be thankful that his government be work on this because you can be damn sure our enemy be if everyone would be so happy why not just tell we about it as usual you have no idea of what the stake be whoever control promicin have a strategic advantage over the rest of the world this be another Manhattan Project Tom and they do not close it down because a couple of technician get radiation poisoning they keep on work and they be right to do that it be make the world a well place not that you be admit that the program exist right what program so if I go through with it if I marry lsabelle you and I become enemy I kill you if I do not do it Richard thing be even bad they be People be dead a lot of people in the second vision your uncle say the catastrophe be here right that place look like a war zone what the hell be I suppose to do look you can only deal with the information you have in one future I die in another it sound like thousand of people maybe million be at risk that be no choice at all we be talk about your life the guy say each vision be one possible future if you do marry lsabelle at least we go into it with our eye open now that we know what could happen we can change thing nothing 's inevitable right let us hope not because believe I I do not wanna die Meet Staff Sergeant John Shaffner okay so why be we meet he he be one of six fatality in the helicopter crash that kill Darren Piersahl a helicopter that seat only four right it turn out John Shaffner 's family never receive his remain either you know there be really a helicopter crash that day in lraq but four family get their kid ' body back two do not here be what I be think Piersahl and Shaffner be recruit into Haspel Corp 's training program at the same time so they use the crash to fake two death so that Piersahl and Shaffner could disappear into the program with impunity so we have a second member of Haspel Corp 's program which be great but it do not get we any close to Darren Piersahl good point it do not really not until you look at Shaffner 's dog tag this be Shaffner 's military serial number look familiar should it twenty seven that be what the note we find on Tim McCarren say that be also where we find his name on the list of people with Starzl Mutation Eleven that be Paula Nakata 's number and Holly Martins be 92 on the list there be a pattern he be pick the order base on his buddy 's serial number okay but why maybe it be a message maybe they be do it together but if he be consistent the next victim will be number 38 on the Starzl list Alex Messina I already check he out he manage a bike store in Madrona yeah yeah I recognize he he be in here early today do he say anything to you it be kind of weird actually he ask I if my name be Alex Messina and he say it like that you know the full name he want to know if I could come out and take a look at his bike he need to replace a part and I tell he just to bring it in he say he would come back when we be less busy send a tactical team over right away thank if Piersahl make a move we will be ready Tom must be from Piersahl hey do you like this color this place need to be a little more girlie if I be go to be live here yeah it look great I think so too I be glad you be back if Piersahl know we be onto he he will change his pattern of attack there be a dozen people we can not find hope we get to they before Piersahl do Tom Baldwin yeah who be ask my name be John John Shaffner I be a volunteer in the same program Darren Piersahl be in the one that drive he crazy yeah we know who you be and we know about the program Good then you be ready to hear what I have to say we be volunteer all of we I still remember the sale pitch we would be the elite a new type of soldier we have to give up our life forfeit our identity they say it be the only way the program have to operate in complete secrecy when do you start get the injection right away start slow but about three week ago they start up our dosage that be when guy start to lose it where do they get the promicin I do not know but they seem to have plenty of it though Darren be the first one who could do stuff you know an ability he kill one of the instructor by mistake it freak he out you two escape together once we get out we pretty much go our separate way I have no idea he be go to do this so he be AWOL these murder be not sanction by anyone no Darren 's freelancing that be why they want he back so bad he be compromise the program our c o s they tell we about the Starzl Mutation they tell we it could be a threat but they never tell we to kill anybody then what be it why do Darren want they dead so badly get something to do with baby so far any time a 4400 have a kid with a member of the regular population their baby be normal they do not make promicin they do not have ability we know we 've be track the birth but the Starzl Mutation change all that if a 4400 have a kid with someone who have the mutation the baby would be promicin positive they would have ability how would the military know that have they try it I do not know but they seem pretty goddamn sure it be true I know this be go to sound crazy but Darren be a victim here too they give we so many stimulant they ampe we up to kill and he snap do not know if he think he be on a mission or something but I know he need to be stop I will do whatever I can to help you find he so what do you think you know everything include the Starzl Mutation and I have to give you credit if what you say be right it would explain why the 4400 be send back in 2004 why they be all bring to Seattle this be the only place the 4400 can reproduce and have kid with ability any of this sound familiar I think I read the same theory in a supermarket tabloid once we know about your enhanced soldier program Dennis we have one of your people John Shaffner been show up for many roll call lately well as soon as we have Piersahl we be go public with this and there be nothing you can do to stop that all you can do be make yourself and this company look slightly well by cooperate with our effort to bring he in we want Piersahl 's personnel file everything you have if it be not in my hand in 90 second John Shaffner will be stand in front of a bank of camera before lunch this could be something maybe it read like some kind of personal statement an essay by Piersahl yeah we have to do those to get in the program they want we to write about some goal we achieve something we be proud of this be all about a volunteer program that he do there be a patch of forest that got clear by a fire Piersahl volunteer to renew it so that he could become a Darren Piersahl be an Eagle Scout yeah he use to talk about those wood all the time when we be in the middle of the program whenever thing get really bad he use to tell I that be where he would go in his head he would imagine himself there it calm he down this patch of forest any chance you know where it be maybe you could put your arm around her Mr Tyler that be great the magazine want to get a shot of the bride and groom have anyone see the groom who give you the key your own bodyguard you start a war Richard you turn the 4400 into an army and you launch an attack for no reason we do not have a choice it have to be a preemptive strike no choice look what you be do look at it it have to stop Isabelle change you you do not even know who you be anymore she do not change I she show I who I be I know myself well than ever and I know exactly what have to happen here do not do this Shawn Shawn sorry to barge in on you it be just they need you down in the garden Pictures be you okay I be fine I be just a little overwhelmed Darren Darren Darren you out here what be you do here Darren relax man it be I Shaffner John we be friend remember Shaff you come that be good that be good I need your help I be never go to make it all the way through this list on my own Darren you do not have to finish the list it be someone else 's agenda you get it all mix up in your head come on with I there be people I want you to talk to they can help we they who be they it be get to stop man please come with I no no wait we get people cover the access road we will pin he down Fan out oh Jesus Tom I can not see anything Tom Tom Tom we lose Shaffner Piersahl 's dead he be on his way out before we even start fight Piersahl have a stab wound in his stomach I guess Shaffner do not go down without a fight yeah well they be both go and there be no one leave to talk about the program we still have evidence we can go after Haspel Corp expose everything yeah but it would have be nice to have a face to put out there now all we have be accusation and a paper trail and five dead body hey you guy get to see this we be proud to announce the existence of this enhanced soldier program to all the World but it should not in any way be see as an offensive maneuver we have evidence suggest that other country have similar program this be merely a response the young man I be about to introduce to you have be work in secret and we 've make numerous advance in time they will become the first non 4400 to develop extra human ability and they will use they in the defense of the United States NoW I would like to introduce eight heroic young man all of whom have give so much of themselves to make this breakthrough possible Ryland 's preempt we trot they out there on stage like they be the first astronaut Major Jeremy ElWood First Lieutenant Raymond Garcia First Lieutenant Jeff Rice First Lieutenant Brian DaWson Second Lieutenant James Noland Second Lieutenant Dirk Danoff the press conference be a clever move Dennis I have to give credit where it be due but this company have five body on its hand and I be go to make sure everyone know it know what we be not deny anything it be unfortunate that one of my man go AWOL but he be clearly derange and I 've get a whole team of doctor stand by to testify to that effect you create an assassin it be a tragedy and it be news I will admit that but tomorrow morning the Piersahl case will be below the fold on every newspaper and all the headline will be about our program that be the way I see it anyway wait who be feed you your information you know about the Starzl Mutation before we do you have a source of promicin for your program who be it you give I too much credit Tom that stuff happen way above my security clearance the soldier you be create be you really go to use they to defend the country or be you just go to send they after the 4400 be there a difference enjoy your nephew 's wedding you sure you be ready for this come on you look ready let us do this hello there thank for come

my daughter 's make up her mind there be no change it you know that I be sorry richard all her life I 've be try to see something good in isabelle some kind of light something to nurture maybe I 've just be waste my time because it be never be there hi I be home I do not get a chance to get the store I think we could order in a pizza do not worry about I I already eat I can see that why will not

the second I come home from school she keep ask I if they be go to get back together you be go to have to go easy on your aunt april she be go through a really rough time but you and ben you be suppose to be together maybe if you tell she about what I see somehow I do not think that be go to make she feel well she be go to know about you two soon or later I mean you be go to invite she to your wedding what do you think you look remarkable I be impressed Jordan be we interrupt something no not at all be everything okay not really we just talk to my uncle tommy he tell we that isabelle and dennis ryland be work together I see Jordan do you hear what I just tell you kick isabelle out of here may not have be the good decision while isabelle be here she be a threat her alliance with dennis ryland simply make it clear where her loyalty lie and clarity 's a good thing yes but we still have preparation to make around this place just to be safe it be not only isabelle and ryland out there we also have the nova group to worry about the nova group be no long our enemy be not that right we do not have a problem with you not anymore Shawn richard have you meet boyd gelder as you can see he be quite an impersonator what be one of the nova do here he be a 4400 shawn where else should he be besides I go to a great deal of trouble to get he and his friend out of ntac Jordan this be crazy I put my life on the line try to protect this place from the nova group and now we be the one that break they out from ntac what be you think that we have a war to fight that nova be a powerful weapon which until now hs lack proper guidance Jordan they be terrorist they kill people they do what need do they choose action over accommodation not support that choice be a failure shawn oh so I make a mistake by not back the nova group I be say you should 've be a leader these people be willing to sacrifice themselves for the great good they be the kind of soldier we need in this fight Jordan they be one of the big reason why people be scared of we so if we invite they in here then we become part of the nova group and everything that you 've be preachingince you 've be back about cooperation and unity between 4400s and non 4400 it be never go to happen Richard we be run a big risk here jordan we be play for big stake if ntac find out we be involve in the breakout it will be bad you sure you cover your track here they be someplace safe along with the 4400 who helped free they they will not be find no no no no just because we be not go to get catch do not make this okay Richard no tell I you be not buy into this I be just be realistic the fact be we be more vulnerable than ever Isabelle 's with ryland now it be only a matter of time before those soldier of his be out there develop ability Jordan be right we be play for big stake now another month that be completely unacceptable the initial volunteer be show ability within day that be correct but as you recall there be problem death since the piersahl incident we 've scale back the pace of the promicin injection I never authorize that I guarantee this country the protection of enhance troop I will not be make a liar by you increase the dosage I will have another shipment of promicin send over from haspelcorp today I do not know why you be waste time build an army you will not need one you be a very powerful young woman isabelle but you be still one person think of it as backup if that make you feel more secure but by now collier know we be work together he will not wait a month to come after we if we give those soldier the maximum dose of promicin how long before they develop ability anywhere from two to three day make it two why wait you hear the lady I will be stay on base to monitor your progress Kyle there he be look at you man you look great I can not believe you be stand here we have to celebrate or we 've get to do something yeah that sound good first I need to ask a favor of you name it it be good to see you kyle I be hope we could talk it be really you be not it you be alive it take a while to believe it myself I be sorry for what I do to you there be nothing to be sorry about my death have to happen I 've see you on tv you seem so sure that what we all go through mean something I wish I could understand it the way you do to I it all seem like a waste my death be part of a big plan I know you 've suffer for it and that be unfair but everything you do kyle include my assassination be part of that plan you have no idea how important you be tell I we can spend the whole night together you know I think that maia should be there when I tell she that way at least she can explain the whole prediction thing so much for afterglow please tell I you be not think of april the whole time no I wasn'T you be right we should tell she I should do it she should hear it from I that would be like hide behind you and I admit that sound good right now but I would just only hate myself even more I just wish I know what to say tell she the truth you know we do not plan this we do not even want it but it happen we fall in love be not it a bit early to be use that word what would you call it god it be true two week and I be in love it be a good thing I know it be I mean it should be but I be in love and I can not enjoy it how pathetic be that what be all this I have a lot of time on my hand I think someone should benefit from it not you Kyle I be make penne arrabiata I bet you he have not have it in a while where 's kyle he will be home any minute he go out after I tell he not to he drive to northmount he want to register for some class that be great how have he get past the reporter they do not even know he be go I make a pitcher of ice tea and some sandwich and I bring it out to they and I distract they while kyle slip out the back we plan the whole thing together it be fun I be glad someone have a good day I take you do not have a good day at work no we talk to the family of every prisoner we lose no one 's hear or see anything I mean not that they would give up their love one so easily and then there be always the 4400 who break they out excuse I honey we have not make much headway on that front either Kyle 's go to be a happy man you would think we would 've hear something about a 4400 who can override a state of the art security system or cut off oxygen to a whole building full of people I have a student at the center when he first come to school he have some problem Teachers and the other child keep have headache and fainting when he be around it turn out that it be something about his ability to change the level of oxygen in the blood Alana this student what be his name Michael lawrence you think he have something to do with the prison break he be 16 you guy his ability match up to what happen to our agent and boyd gelder be not much old now we 've speak to michael 's father he say he have not see his son in a week Shawn be it possible there be a new nova cell operate out of the center if there be do not you think they would 've come after I by now they still might we do not know what they be plan do you mind if we talk to some of the other student see what they can tell we about michael talk to whoever you like listen shawn look I appreciate this you know it really help to have someone here we can work with I hope that do not change now that collier 's back all right Michael lawrence 's ability be unique useful and he control it with a great deal of accuracy why would not I make use of he because he be a 16 year old kid you just turn into a felon Shawn that boy allow we to neutralize a building full of ntac agent without hurt anyone I think I show great restraint give the urgency of our need what need jordan what be so important that we need to get into bed with the nova group Come on I run this place while you be go I think I deserve to know what you be plan Ryland 's enhanced soldier program we be go to destroy it destroy how with nova 's help we will attack the army base where the experiment 's conduct take out the lab the training facility and when we find the soldier get promicin neutralize they Attack a military installation Jordan be you insane that be how you sound right now I do not care what you think you see while you be go this be the real world Jordan listen to I do you know how many people would die on both side we have no choice once those soldier develop 4400 ability it will be too late there be a gas station it be on a highway Next to it there be a road sign can you read the sign I be try something about a petrify tree stump it be the big one in the state Afraid that be all of it that be the thing with this remote viewing I never quite see everything that

kind of light something to nurture maybe I 've just be waste my time because it be never be there Maia I be home I do not get a chance to get to the store I think we could order in a pizza do not worry about I I already eat oh I can see that why will not he call I back who Ben I leave he five message I just want he to know that I forgive he you know it be probably my fault I probably push he away well sit here blame yourself be not help do you think he meet someone else you need to get up take a shower change your clothe and let us all go out to dinner what if he call answer my cell okay sure and if he call be nice to he because when we get back together I do not want there to be any weirdness between the two of you hi honey we have a deal no video game before dinner Maia I need a break from what Aunt April I be sorry sweetie she have not stop from the second I come home from school she keep ask I if they be go to get back together well you be go to have to go easy on your Aunt April she be go through a really rough time but you and Ben you be suppose to be together maybe if you tell she about what I see somehow I do not think that be go to make she feel well well she be go to know about you two soon or later I mean you be go to invite she to your wedding what do you think you look remarkable I be impressed Jordan be we interrupt something no not at all be everything okay not really we just talk to my Uncle Tommy he tell we that lsabelle and Dennis Ryland be work together I see Jordan do you hear what I just tell you kick lsabelle out of here may not have be the good decision while lsabelle be here she be a threat her alliance with Dennis Ryland simply make it clear where her loyalty lie and clarity be a good thing yes but we still have preparation to make around this place just to be safe yeah it be not only lsabelle and Ryland out there we also have Nova Group to worry about the Nova Group be no long our enemy be not that right we do not have a problem with you not anymore Shawn Richard have you meet Boyd Gelder as you can see he be quite the impersonator what be one of the Nova do here he be a 4400 Shawn where else should he be and besides I go to a great deal of trouble to get he and his friend out of NTAC Jordan this be crazy I put my life on the line try to protect this place from Nova and now we be the one that break they out from NTAC what be you think that we have a war to fight that Nova be a powerful weapon which until now have lack proper guidance Jordan they be terrorist they kill people they do what need do they choose action over accommodation not support that choice be a failure Shawn oh so I make a mistake by not back the Nova Group I be say you should have be a leader these people be willing to sacrifice themselves for the great good they be the kind of soldier we need in this fight they be one of the big reason why people be scared of we if we invite they in here we become part of the Nova Group and everything you 've be preach since you 've be back about cooperation and unity between 4400s and non 4400 it be never go to happen Richard we be run a big risk here Jordan we be play for big stake if NTAC find out we be involve in the breakout it would be bad you be sure you cover your track they be someplace safe along with the 4400 who helped free they they will not be find no no no just because we be not go to get catch do not make this okay Richard no tell I you be not buy into this I be just be realistic the fact be we be more vulnerable than ever Isabelle 's with Ryland now it be only a matter of time before those soldier of his be out there develop ability Jordan be right we be play for big stake now another month that be completely unacceptable the initial volunteer be show ability within day that be correct but as you recall there be problem death since the Piersahl incident we 've scale back the pace of the promicin I never authorize that I guarantee this country the protection of enhance troop I will not be make a liar by you increase the dosage I will have another shipment of promicin send over from Haspel Corp today I do not know why we be waste time build an army we will not need one you be a very powerful young woman lsabelle but you be still one person think of it as backup well if that make you feel more secure but by now Collier know we be work together he will not wait a month to come after we if we give those soldier the maximum dose of promicin how long before they develop ability anywhere from two to three day make it two why wait you hear the lady I will be stay on base to monitor your progress Kyle there he be hey yes look at you man you look great I can not believe you be stand here we have to celebrate we get to do something yeah that sound good first I need to ask a favor of you name it it be good to see you Kyle I be hope we could talk it be really you be not it you be alive it take a while to believe it myself I be sorry for what I do to you there be nothing to be sorry about my death have to happen I 've see you on tv you seem so sure that what we all go through mean something I wish I could understand it the way you do to I it all seem like a waste my death be part of a big plan I know you suffer for it and that be unfair but everything you do Kyle include my assassination be part of that plan you have no idea how important you be tell I we could spend the whole night together I really think that Maia should be there when I tell she that way at least she can explain the whole prediction thing well so much for afterglow please tell I you be not think of April the whole time no I be not you be right we should tell she I should do it she should hear it from I that would be like hide behind you and I admit that sound good right now but I will just only hate myself even more I just wish I know what to say tell she the truth you know we do not plan this we do not even want it but it happen we fall in love be not it a bit early to be use that word what would you call it oh God it be true two week and I be in love it be a good thing I know it be I mean it should be but I be in love and I can not enjoy it how pathetic be that what be all this I have a lot of time on my hand I think someone should benefit from it not you Kyle I be make penne arrabiata I will bet you he have not have it in a while where be Kyle he will be home any minute he go out after I tell he not to he drive to Northmount want to register for some class that be great how do he get past the reporter they do not even know he be go I make a pitcher of iced tea and some sandwich and I bring it out to they and I distract they while Kyle slip out the back we plan the whole thing together it be fun I be glad someone have a good day I take it you do not have a good day at work no we talk to the family of every prisoner we lose no one have hear or see anything I mean not that they would give up their love one so easily and then there be always the 4400 who break they out excuse I honey we have not make much headway on that front either Kyle 's go to be a happy man you think we would 've hear something about a 4400 who can override a state of the art security system or cut off oxygen to a whole building full of people I have a student at the Center when he first come to school he have some problem Teachers and the other child keep have headache and faint when he be around it turn out that it be something about his ability to change the level of oxygen in the blood Alana this student what be his name Michael Lawrence you think he have something to do with the prison break he be 1 6 his ability match up to what happen to our agent and Boyd Gelder be not much old now we 've speak to Michael 's father he say he have not see his son in a week Shawn be it possible there be a new Nova cell operate out of the Center well if there be do not you think they would 've come after I by now well they still might we do not know what they be plan you mind if we talk to some of the student see what they can tell we about Michael yeah talk to whoever you like listen Shawn look I appreciate this you know it really help to have someone here we can work with I hope that do not change now that Collier 's back all right Michael Lawrence 's ability be unique useful and he control it with a great deal of accuracy why would not I make use of he because he be a 1 6 year old kid you just turn into a felon Shawn that boy allow we to neutralize a building full of NTAC agent without hurt anyone I think that show great restraint give the urgency of our need what need Jordan what be so important that we need to get into bed with the Nova Group Come on I run this place while you be go I think I deserve to know what you be plan Ryland 's enhanced Soldier program we be go to destroy it destroy how with Nova 's help we will attack the Army base where the experiment 's conduct take out the lab the training facility and when we find the soldier get promicin neutralize they Attack a military installation Jordan be you insane that be how you sound right now I do not care what you think you see while you be go this be the real world Jordan listen to I do you know how many people would die on both side we have no choice once those soldier develop 4400 ability it will be too late there be a gas station it be on a highway Next to it there be a road sign can you read the sign try something about a petrify tree stump it be the big one in the state Afraid that be all of it that be the thing with this remote viewing I never quite see everything that ought to be enough to find they Gas and a quart of oil come to 53 even okay I hope you can take some time and visit Newfield 's claim to fame there be not another stump like it on the whole West Coast we be just pass through if I go back the way I come will I find the highway oh she can help you with that he want to get right back on the highway well that be easy but first I think you should visit the Newfield stump they have a really nice gift shop there the town could sure use your business yeah I just follow the sign that be right and there be a nice diner along the way all the pie be bake fresh it sound good I will check that out thank you you will not be disappoint those pie come in on a truck they need the business Dr

4400 any way I can I be sorry I agree with Jordan on this one Shawn how can you say that if we attack that Army base it be like declare war on the United States government maybe but it seem to I we have be in an undeclared war with the government ever since we got back lock we in quarantine shoot we up with the inhibitor disappear any of we they seem threaten by all Jordan be do be bring the conflict out into the open Jordan be go to sacrifice thousand of life it be go to be for nothing we be go to lose if you have another way something concrete that make we safe I be willing to listen oh my God I do not think so okay can you give we a hint what this be about you say it be urgent the Nova member that escape I know what they be plan I know who their leader be okay Shawn I be go to need a name Jordan Collier you must think I be insane only a psychopath would declare war on the U S Army well then we be all in agreement I assure you I be not crazy I be not plan any attack on a government installation so you be say Shawn make all this up why would I do that Jordan just tell the truth okay you can not cover this up I tell you a story Shawn to see if you would pass it along it be a test and I be afraid you fail I 've be away from this place for a long time in the day ahead I will be ask a lot of everyone here I need to know who I could trust and who I could not sorry to embarrass you like this Shawn it be the only way to be sure and what about the breakout at NTAC you have nothing to do with that I do not that be a lie that be a lie I see Boyd Gelder stand in this office with my own two eye Richard be here with I he see he too Richard I do not know what you be talk about Shawn Richard as far as I know Boyd Gelder have never be here so you be say in spite of all of Collier 's denial this base be still the subject of a possible Nova attack it be possible yes and you come all this way to warn I I be touch Tom just do my job Dennis it be nothing personal Collier know you be here so this place be no long secure your little experiment need a new home I say let they come if Collier want a fight we will give he one she be right you know Collier talk a good game Unity fight together to save the future People actually believe he mean it it be pathetic but an attack will expose the 4400 for what they really be the enemy you see Tom I be right all along it come down to survival Us against they you sure you wanna be at ground zero for this one Dennis defend the human race where else would I be we be stay right here how do it feel turn your back on I I be just

ten Shawn I need you to believe in I you know what I think Jordan I think that this whole messiah thing have go to your head I be no messiah more like John Brown John Brown be not he the guy that try to free all the slave he surround himself with people who believe as he do be willing to do anything for their cause and that kind of devotion can change the world they kill John Brown Jordan they

soldier before Collier 's do you will wish you have that army for protection I wonder what he be go to do with all of it destroy it he do not want anyone else to develop ability he want to keep we weak so no one can fight back sound a little paranoid Dennis Collier be a fanatic Tom he be capable of anything you will see so you be say you wanna break up I do not want to well then let us not look I know how bad you feel I feel bad too but I also feel really good be not that worth hold on to try at least well I be try believe I it be like we be never alone there be you I and April and she be

there be the garbage truck do its round outside okay well that narrow it dow I mean a little but there must be doze of neighborhood schedule for garbage collection last night that be true but ship 's whistle blow that sound like a boat whistle a ferry whistle to be exact so they be near the water they be somewhere between edmond and woodway I check it out those be the only block near the waterfront with garbage pickup schedule for last night I feel kind of weird Iq that normal Kevin go through the same thing you be lucky actually the promicin from ryland 's company be pure it will be easy for you I wonder what ability I will get I be sure it will be great close your eye okay rest how be she she be fine I think she be tired it be hard to believe it be all start be not it everything we 've work for it be not hard for I I 've believe in you all along there be a reason we be take a reason they wake you up it be incredible you should be get the nobel prize instead we be hide like criminal it will not be like this forever soon we will be hero oh my god Call shawn wait it be all right it be all right tess hurry this look promise it be 3516 bay street two block west of woodway municipal record indicate it be unoccupied but some offshore company pay the property tax sound like one of collier 's safe house look at this the utility have just be turn on let us go ring the bell

dead it be okay come here come here how could this happen how could devon die it make no sense Ryland 's give that stuff to soldier and then parade they around on national tv well her body uldn't handle it she die of a massive aneurysm Shawn you be in a lot of trouble here and the people I work with they believe you be involve in a conspiracy to distribute promicin so you need to talk to we what be you do at that safe house who call you I be sorry about what happen to devon I be but I 've get nothing to say Devon be not the first sacrifice the future have ask of we she will not be the last we will honor her memory we aan do that later Ntac have shawn it be only a matter of time before they get e location of this place from he need to destroy this stuff cut and run why if they want to come let they come that be why you have we here right I admire your bravery we may need it but not yet I test shawn to remind he of his loyalty he will not betray we his loyalty be not the issue we 've see it before if the government want to know something they will do whatever it take to get it he will be test yes richard but he will endure long enough for we to begin distribution begin distribution why would you want to do that this stuff kill devon a dosage problem it have to be the promicin from your daughter be different from what I 've be use it be too pure Richard look we need people to develop ability if we stop now they will paint we as murderer if we keep go we be murderer Jordan this be over I be end this tess Mr Tyler I do not think you should do that we be alunder a lot of strain maybe you should just sit down for a while let us get this clean up we need to be ready to leave Sweetie do you want to watch a movie you can pick April hey hey I come by to get my stuff I pack it up for you oh be that new oh yeah little gift myself I like it Di do not pretend okay I do it to remind myself who I be I guess I be not mean for that whole settle thing I be go for with ben I bring you something oh you be give I a present Mom 's engagement ring I give that to you april I do not have any use for it besides I kind of owe you I mean do not get I wrong I be still piss but you save I from be someone that I be not thank you just do not invite I over for thanksge okay hey just one thing when maia predict that you would end up with ben do you really fight against it as hard as you tell I that you do I think so but to be honest now I l I be just not so sure I be not at all surprised that girl die that be exactly why we need to get this stuff out of collier 's hand we need to know about your promicin supply dennis your people have be work with it for month have you ever see anything like this we 've have some casualty among the volunteer Casualties how many we recruit 20 man for the ogram half of they reject the promicin within 48 hour of their first shot reject you mean die we know there would be risk diana we explain it to the volunteer before they sign on oh my god you know you know what would happen when people ok this why do not you tell we when it be steal we could have warn collier warn the public because god do not make mistake what well way to show the people that collier be not some sort of messiah than have he fall flat on his face in public you keep quiet so you could discredit colly a woman be dead dennis and you be just as responsible as he be she should not have be inject steal promicin and anybody who follow her lead will have to live with the consequence or not so this promicin that collier 's hold if you take it you have a 50 chance of die within 48 hour or a 50 chance of eventually develop some kind of ability we need to hire more agent I do not know 50 50 those be not very good odd for a chance to become one of the 4400 I think there be a lot of people who would take they how do your nephew react to the news he be still not talk he do not think there be any way collier will move ahead with the plan Tom we 've be work on he for almost a day we need to step up the interrogation a couple of notch what no no no no way look I be not stand by while someone torture shawn actually that be not what I have in mind you want I to help ntac interrogate shawn I do not think so thomas Alana I would not have come to you if I do not think it be a good idea it will be just like when you help we with colly you use your ability on he and then when be over you just you would see everything he have we just need you to tell we where the promicin be I know but when I agree to help ntac I tell you I would never do anything to hurt the 4400 you would be help shawn and if you do not do it ntac would consider that back out of your deal you would be a fugitive again look honey they be go to get the information anyway and it will be a whole lot tough on shawn Hoabout I call d c myself confirm this so call order you do that nina find out how little authority you have what be he do here the u s Military be take over the interrogation of shawn farrell I be here as a consultant we will be do with shawn in minute Alana can get all the information we need quickly and painlessly you expect we to trust that woman no we will take it from here tom I have confidence in my interrogator hi shawn we can do this quickly you know just tell I where collier 's keep the promicin no I be curious the whole time we be plan our wedding you be work with ryland betray I betray your father why it be a balance of power thing I be send to eliminate the 4400 I really do not want to do that I love you shawn but I have to do something so I think if I join ryland and help his side learn how to create ability there would be a standoff if everyone have the technology no one can use it do you really think that be go to work Ryland 's go to use those soldier baby please where be the promicin Baby get your hand off of I now I would not disturb she right now tom what be you guy do Shawn let he go be he alive his pulse be weak we be go to need a medical team in here right now go let us go do you get everything we need Newfield be such a nice little town when this be over kevin 's go to retire and we be go to go back there to live that be never go to happen if people start die from that promicin they be go to hunt we down we will be leave I would really rather tess not have to compel your cooperation give I your word you be aboard I will have she let you go I can not do that I be not a murderer and I be not about to let you make I into one do you think I want people to die do you honestly believe that be part

idea how all this be go to end how about it end happy I have a job offer in Spain it be long six month maybe more I be think of take it you be leave only if you come with I you and Maia look think about it you 've give everything you 've have to this job for year it be time to let someone else pick up the cause well for you be well for Maia I have think about leave just go someplace safe just never seem possible but it be you have an option of walk away it be important you remember that I 've be work on the video of Devon Woods make the round on the lnternet isolate the audio play up the background noise that noise you be hear it be a garbage truck move in reverse so wherever the tape be make there be the garbage truck do its round outside okay well that narrow it down I mean a little but there must be dozen of neighborhood schedule for garbage collection last night that be true but sound like a boat whistle Ferry whistle to be exact so they be near the water they be somewhere between Edmonds and Woodway I check it out those be the only block near the waterfront with garbage pickup schedule for last night I feel kind of weird be that normal Kevin go through the same thing you be lucky actually the promicin from Ryland 's company be pure it will be easy for you I wonder what ability I will get I be sure it will be great close your eye okay rest how be she she be fine I think she be tired it be hard to believe it be all start be not it everything we 've work for it be not hard for I I 've believe in you all along there be a reason we be take a reason they wake you up that be incredible you should be get the Nobel Prize instead we be hide like criminal it will not be like this forever soon we will be hero oh my God Kevin Call Shawn wait it be all right it be all right tess hurry this look promise it be 351 6 Bay Street two block west of Woodway the municipal record indicate it be unoccupied but some offshore company pay the property tax sound like one of Collier 's safe house look at this the utility have just be turn on let us go ring the bell see who answer it be okay it be okay Kevin it be okay there be some man come up to the house they have gun we have to go Shawn we have to go no Shawn NTAC be right outside we have to leave now no I be not leave she it be okay it be okay Devon Devon you just look at I okay just keep look go Devon Devon Shawn Shawn step away Shawn keep your hand where everyone can see they okay I could not save she it be okay come here come on she be dead it be okay come here come on it be okay how could this happen how could Devon die it make no sense Ryland 's give that stuff to soldier and then parade they around on national tv well her body could not handle it she die of a massive aneurysm Shawn you be in a lot of trouble here and the people I work with they believe you be involve in a conspiracy to distribute promicin so you need to talk to we what be you do at that safe house who call you I be sorry about what happen to Devon I be but got nothing to say Devon be not the first sacrifice the future have ask of we she will not be the last we will honor her memory we can do that later NTAC have Shawn it be only a matter of time before they get the location from he we need to destroy this stuff cut and run why if they wanna come let they come that be why you have we here right I admire your bravery we may need it but not yet I test Shawn to remind he of his loyalty he will not betray we his loyalty be not the issue we 've see it before the government want something they will do whatever to get it he will be test yes Richard but he will endure long enough for we to begin distribution begin distribution why would you wanna do that this kill Devon Dosage problem it have to be the promicin from your daughter be different from what I 've be use it be too pure Richard look we need people to develop ability if we stop now they will paint we as murderer if we keep go we be murderer Jordan this be over I be end this Mr Tyler I do not think you should do that we be all under a lot of strain maybe you should just sit down for a while let us get this clean up we need to be ready to leave Sweetie do you wanna watch a movie you can pick April hey hey I come by to get my stuff I pack it up for you be that new yeah a little gift to myself I like it Di do not pretend okay I do it to remind myself who I be I guess I be not mean for that whole settle thing I be go for with Ben I bring you something be you give I a present Mom 's engagement ring I give that to you April I do not have any use for it besides I kind of owe you I mean do not get I wrong I be still piss but you save I from be someone that I be not thank you just do not invite I over for Thanksgiving okay hey just one thing when Maia predict that you would end up with Ben do you really fight against it as hard as you tell I that you do I think so but to be honest now l oh I be just not so sure I be not at all surprised that girl die it be exactly why we need to get this stuff out of Collier 's hand we need to know about your promicin supply Dennis your people have be work with it have you ever see anything like this we 've have some casualty among the volunteer Casualties how many we recruit 20 man for the program half of they reject the promicin within 48 hour of their first shot reject you mean die we know there would be risk Diana we explain it to the volunteer before they sign on oh my God you know you know what would happen when people take this why do not you tell we when it be steal we could have warn Collier warn the public because god do not make mistake what well way to show the people that Collier be not some sort of messiah than have he fall flat on his face in public you keep quiet so you could discredit Collier a woman be dead Dennis and you be just as responsible as he be she should not have be inject steal promicin and anybody who follow her lead will have to live with the consequence or not so this promicin that Collier 's holding if you take it you have a 50 percent chance of die within 48 hour or a 50 percent chance of eventually develop some kind of ability we need to hire more agent I do not know fifty fifty those be not very good odd for a chance to become one of the 4400 I think there be a lot of people who would take they yeah how do your nephew react to the news he be still not talk he do not think there be any way Collier will move ahead with the plan Tom we 've be work on he for almost a day we need to step up the interrogation a couple notch no no no no way look I be not stand by while someone torture Shawn actually that be not what I have in mind you want I to help ntac interrogate Shawn I do not think so Thomas Alana I would not have come here if I do not think it be a good idea it will be just like when you help we with Collier you use your ability on he and then when it be over you just you would have see everything he have we just need you to tell we where the promicin be I know but when I agree to help ntac I tell you I would never do anything to hurt the 4400 you would be help Shawn and if you do not do it NTAC will consider that back out of your deal you would be a fugitive again look honey they be go to get the information anyway and it will be a whole lot tough on Shawn how about I call d c myself confirm this so call order you do that Nina you will find out how little authority you have what be he do here the U S military have take over the interrogation of Shawn Farrell I be here as a consultant we will be do with Shawn in minute Alana can get all the information we need quickly and painlessly do you expect we to trust that woman no we will take it from here Tom I have confidence in my interrogator hi Shawn we can do this quickly you know just tell I where Collier be keep the promicin no I be curious the whole time we be plan our wedding you be work with Ryland betray I betray your father why it be a balance of power thing I be send to eliminate the 4400 I really do not want to do that I love you Shawn but I have to do something so I think if I join Ryland and help his side learn how to create ability there would be a standoff if everyone have the technology no one can use it do you really think that be go to work Ryland 's go to use those soldier to kill we all not if I do not let he but whatever I have to do to keep Collier from go through with his plan I will do it Baby please where be the promicin Baby get your hand off of I now I would not disturb she right now Tom do not touch that let go keep he out of there what be you guy do hold it Shawn let he go be he alive his pulse be weak we be go to need a medical team in here right now go let us go do you get everything we need Newfield be such a nice little town when this be over Kevin 's go to retire and we be go to go back there to live that be never go to happen People start die from that promicin they be go to hunt we down we will be leave I would rather tess not have to compel your cooperation give I your word you be aboard I will have she let you go I can not do that I be not a murderer and I be not about to let you make I into one do you think I want people to die you honestly believe that be part of my plan we will not force this on anyone we will make people aware of the risk that be all we be do give people a choice they be never go to take it how much sadness be out there how many people trap in dead end live these shot give they a chance at the extraordinary there will be a demand and that be who you wanna give these ability to the unhappy the lose they say the meek shall inherit the earth I guess I just have more faith in humanity than you yeah he be stable that be the good news but he

of our namesake last night a dozen student tear it down and put that thing up when we ask they why they say it be a statue of Graham Holt who be Graham Holt he be a junior c student basically unremarkable in every way so this kid pull a prank and you call NTAC I call NTAC because I think maybe this kid take some of those shot I mean what be go on around here be not normal the poster the statue last night our valedictorian revise her application essay to Stanford she read it to her guidance counselor this morning it be 500 word on how Graham Holt be the most important spiritual leader since the time of Christ I call he into my office early this morning he claim to have no idea about what be go on I think we need to meet this Graham Holt from now on everyone 's favorite band be tv

to have to ask you to come with we we be go to bring you in to ntac and give you a test to see if you be promicin positive why look around you Graham I think you know why do I have a choice you have a

compliment thank you I have to get back to work but good luck with your assignment Cassie Dunleavy maybe I will see you around I will be here for the next seven day seem to I there be a very simple explanation for what be go on at Stevenson High this kid Graham take the promicin shoot and now everyone who meet he think he be god Come on come on I 've hear you tend to move directly to the point Marco but really god well obviously he be not the god at good he be a god a minor deity whatever these kid be build effigy of he they be willing to fight we to protect he sound like worship to I you be lucky you be not turn seem like you only need a couple minute around Graham before you find religion maybe they be unlucky Absolute devotion be a rarity in the modern age it might bring a real sense of purpose to life a clarity guy what do we do with this kid we go back with more people we isolate he hope the effect wear off but I would do it fast sound like Graham 's pretty much focused on be king of the school imagine what happen if he learn to think a little more ambitiously what the hell be that be you here to give yourselves body and soul to Graham Holt not exactly then I suggest you leave these street be his we will defend they with our life just take your man around that way this be I Graham what do you want I want you to end this Graham if you do not come out these people be go to get hurt that what you want no of course not these people be just try to protect I you be force they to be here you 've take away their free will their life be in your hand I understand I do

his system the doctor think it be all out of whack that be right they think that be why he his body shut down but I do not think that make it into the paper well it must have how else would I know about it okay I know I be not a doctor but maybe someone should try inject he with a big old dose of promicin it would be like give he a jump start right Shawn be a 4400 probably would not hurt he I 've think about that the doctor will not even consider it Promicin be seriously illegal too bad you can not get your hand on any you might be the only person in his life who care enough to actually take a shot at wake he up they 've just be stand here stare at we for hour do not they ever have to use the bathroom Head 's up do not shoot my name 's Graham Holt I want to surrender it be about time

follower arrest he right there on the step of the courthouse and there be no trace of promicin in his system nothing no he be just a high school kid with a lot to answer for I guess we can all stop wonder if Collier have an ability he can neutralize promicin I do not get it Shawn never say anything about Collier do that to one of the original 4400 maybe it do not work on they maybe he can only do it to the extra crispie extra crispie you know like not the original recipe 4400 People who take the promicin shoot and then get an ability so Collier walk into what be essentially an occupy Seattle lay hand on this kid and solve a problem that have the entire U S government in a panic if I be sit at home watch this story on the 6 00 news you want to know what I would be think People be

Collier be try to do change this world man that be important I want to be a part of that and I bet Danny feel the same way Kyle I do not think that Danny care about Jordan or change the world he be try to prove something to himself or to I it be a jealousy thing that may be true but the reason do not matter if Danny want to take the shot I do not think you or anyone else have a right to stop he I be sorry Tom but Ryan Powell test negative for promicin I have no choice but to release he same with the ATM customer and the bank employee they all come back clean that can not be right Powell 's our only link between the bank victim and Ray Haugen you be tell I that be just a coincidence I do not know what it be but Ryan Powell do not take promicin he do not have an ability and he be not the

like to have a son who will not hug you or smile at you will not even will not even look you in the eye Clear be that why you give he promicin I think if Brandon get an ability it would make he well at least help he to communicate I do not even know what my own son be think or feel you know that be no way for a kid to live all he do be play with that goddamn train Mr Powell we be go to need you to think where would your wife have take Brandon look I do not mean for any of this to happen please please none of this be his fault he do not know he have no idea what he be do if anybody be to blame it be I so your wife she do not know you inject he be you kid I 50 50 she would never agree to that but you be willing to take the risk I see other parent with their own kid and the warmth and the joking around I want some of that I I be not try to kill Brandon she have to believe that I just I just I just want he to have the chance at a at a normal life thank you for your cooperation Mrs Tyler we will be in contact shortly get I a copy of the lab report be that all we be do do I pass hello well you want answer Kyle you will find they in there be you come with I it be well if I do not what do you know about white light not too much actually my great grandfather found the group back in 1918 even at its height the membership never exceed a few dozen people the whole thing only last a few year they all die burn to death in a fire what do these people believe they believe that a messiah would return from the dead and lead the world to salvation not the proud branch on my family tree but people be interested in this stuff so I keep it around this be their scripture and this be the messiah they be wait for yeah that look like Jordan Collier you be not the first person to mention a resemblance I do not know maybe feel free to thumb through the book if you would like a few of the chapter be too charred to read and one of they be write in a oh I do not know a code or something but there be enough for you to get the gist that be great thank you oh Brandon please not now okay um be you hungry honey do you want a snack uh no okay uh how about your train you want your train I get your train right here sweetie okay Honey I 've get your train over here Brandon please not now XX mommy Brandon I 've get your train sweetie come on come on do you see they be they go be what go the snake they be here somewhere I know it do not let they get I please Mrs Powell just calm down Everything'll be okay I promise do you see the direction your son be head Mrs Powell no I must 've black

go hey Diana Hey kid should not you be at home where be your parent bud do they know you be out here whoa buddy take it easy take it easy so what do you think pretty interesting reading huh that be why you bring I here to read that book a messiah who rise from the dead who pass out a sacred elixir that change the world I know that sound just like Jordan Collier and that healer who lay his hand upon the sick I be guess that be suppose to be Shawn do not forget about the shaman whose vision guide the messiah down the path to enlightenment want to take a stab at who that be the shaman be you Kyle I I know it might sound a little intimidate intimidate try insane all right I admit that book get few thing right about Jordan about promicin but the rest of it be kind of vague there be that whole chapter that be in code what about the part that say the messiah will show we the face of god and all will know his face and he will smile down upon we and walk among we and the earth and heaven will be as one and Collier 's go to make that happen huh with your help it be a prophecy Kyle I do not believe that look you help I wake up my cousin for that I be grateful but this be over no Kyle it be just begin look this cult white light it be still around be not it you be one of they you be try to use Jordan to start some kind of crazy religious revival I will not be a part of that you already be I do not want to hear anymore just stay the hell away from I what change your mind nothing change my mind I do not agree with take promicin I think it be a mistake 50 50 those be lousy odd but you be right about one thing it be your decision and I do not want you getting arrest try to find the stuff yourself they be throw people in jail Danny no trial I do not get it you be with Collier from the beginning he put this out there I mean if you do not agree with it where do that leave you and he I wish Jordan have bury that stuff somewhere these ability cause as many problem as they solve just do I a favor okay and just hold off for a while maybe if you read the paper for the next few week law school will not seem so bad yeah okay I can do that please do not look at I I do not like people look at I okay I be go to call this in do not worry sir we be go to get you help be there go to be people there I do not like people see I at least Brandon 's give we a trail to follow I hate that we have to sedate he but I do not know how else to get he back into NTAC I be start to remember why I give this job up in the first place Diana I wish there be another way but his ability be too much of a threat if only Jordan Collier be not the most wanted man in the world he could take his ability away could not he we can not cure he of his ability but maybe there be a way we can help he control it it be okay Brandon Everything be go to be okay can we just do this please he be be give the inhibitor so hopefully there will not be any kind of danger but there be still some risk involve

of improvement you think put he on the inhibitor have something to do with it as soon as we mute his ability their symptom begin to dissipate which mean Garrity should be back in rotation soon unless you would prefer to stick with Skouris look nothing against jed but if Diana 's go to be around she be my partner so what happen to Brandon now as long as his mother bring he in for weekly injection of the inhibitor he should be able to live a fairly normal life more normal than he have up to now anyway that be an amazing thing your nephew do yeah these ability people get they come in handy

meantime we be try to be a family and family be not suppose to live on separate continent right Solitude can be every bit as exhilarating as companionship of course I have to find companionship before I figure that out listen to this it be from the blog all mankind be divide into three class those who be immovable those who be movable and those who move that be very poetic the blogger be a good writer we already know that but that be a quote you know who write it Benjamin Franklin the woman from the library the volunteer she be the one write this good work look like an overdose lividity have not set in yet I would say she die about an hour ago we just got do look at her computer the tech find the entire journal save in a file on her hard drive Audrey Parker be our blogger one of the back window be open but there be no sign of force entry nothing miss as far as we can tell she have a prescription for morphine so her arthritis must have get pretty bad her nurse usually inject she but occasionally would leave behind extra shot for Audrey the ME think it be an accidental overdose that it happen with old people they get confused take the wrong dosage forget that they 've inject themselves what do you think it might have be an accident but you know she have take promicin she know NTAC be breathe down her neck the thought of a prison sentence at her age and in her condition maybe she figure she would rather just drift off to sleep you think she commit suicide if she do she do it because of NTAC because of we I do not kill myself I do not kill myself somebody do this to I Hanna Hanna you have to help I please somebody do this to I somebody do this to I you be back for more I be do my thesis on cult from the early 20th century it be due soon so just let I know when you

just go to the bank it be you you do it I threaten you and you kill I you kill I that be the ME 's preliminary report on the death of Audrey Parker there be no note nothing in her journal that indicate she be consider suicide he be go to rule it an accidental death do you know she live in France for three year in the 1950 's like just pull up all the stake and move there she meet Samuel Beckett at a party he compliment she on her dress you admire she do not you yeah in a way because she just live her life without compromise and that be no easy thing for a woman of her generation and to be honest it be really no easy thing now I give up my career to move to Spain for my daughter I give up Spain to come back here to look for my sister and right now my entire life just feel like a bunch of compromise all just string together anyway no no I I be not go to demonize Audrey Parker because she take a promicin shoot Diana I be not say you should but as far as what happen to she why she die that be for the Seattle police to figure out our involvement in this end as soon as we learn she be behind the blog no you can not just file I away I do not kill myself I be murder what the hell be that a power surge I do not know but that be the second time today remember all the radio freak out at Audrey 's house Good morning thank you all for come four month ago the US government shut this building down along with many other building like it across the country in two day I be go to be reopen its door I will be start up my heal foundation again and I plan on use this building as its base of operation I would like to remind everyone out there that the 4400 be not all revolutionary we be not at war with society we want to help it we can help and will not be force into silence by the government 's so call war on promicin as a show of good faith to the world at large I will heal anyone who be present on our first day open the 4400 have be silent for a long time too long we look forward to meet the world again it be currently illegal to use a 4400 ability without special dispensation from the government have you make arrangement with they there be no arrangement to be make the people who run the country be not in a very accommodate mood right now so you have not discuss your plan with they not exactly but I be sure they will be in touch why be we go to the funeral of a woman that you 've only meet once I think someone have to pay she some respect okay but I do not know I be try to make sense of this to see what this have to do with track down April what what Diana that be why you come back here right I mean that be why we have to leave Spain yes and while I be look for her I have to work case that be the deal and I just feel badly for her you know she die alone she might have commit suicide what be go on everywhere I go today I just keep hear that static at work in the car on the way home yeah that be kind of weird you leave I a voice message on my cell phone today right oh yeah I could not hear a thing it be all staticky and garble that cell phone message I leave you do you save it I just want to say this be really weird I run that cell phone message you bring I through about six different audio filter there be nothing there just static well why would you expect anything different I mean come on guy what be we even do here hey I think it be a little crazy too but then I try drop everything out I try listen to the message in what theoretically should have be total silence this be what I find murder murder murder we think Audrey Parker 's ability be well I guess you would have to call it astral projection she could send her consciousness out of her body that be a kind of broadcast right she be send a signal it be a real thing I mean it could disrupt electrical field so if she die while she be use her ability then then her body 's go but the signal be still out there so Audrey 's mind or soul or whatever you want to call it have be follow I around and that recording have catch a fragment of what she be try to say exactly it obviously think it be murder she Brady she just hold up a second okay that tape give I chill too but it be not necessarily proof of anything Audrey write everything down let us just go back over the journal one last time if there be anything in there anyone who seem suspicious we will just track it down Vanessa Martin excuse I hi I be Tom Baldwin this be my partner Diana Skouris we be from NTAC hi we be look for Philip Delacroix why be NTAC look for Philip we 've be review the journal of a possible murder victim name Audrey Parker there be repeat reference to you and your agent I be sorry I do not know anyone name Audrey Parker Philip Delacroix be not who he claim to be his real name be Philip Wilson and there be warrant out in several state for his arrest Philip do you know where Philip go we 've already be by his apartment and it be clear out he come to see I yesterday say he be leave town he need money you do not think he have anything to do with that woman 's death do you we will let you know thank you look like Audrey confront the wrong guy let us put out an apb on Philip Wilson and all his know alias yeah go back to the office put it on the wire call I if anything pop okay I 've get to be somewhere well I have to say I expect a visit from you guy but I do not think that they would send the head of NTAC I want to do this in person I have to emphasize the seriousness of the government 's position you know you guy be sure happy to call I when you need I to bail you out of a jam but the moment I want to go public you break out the fire hose I be just heal some people there be nothing to be afraid of it be not a political statement not a radical act I be afraid you be misread the climate as far as DC be concern any unsanctioned use of a 4400 ability be a radical act I be not misread the climate I be try to change it there be too much fear out there right now I think I can help I have to ask you you keep talk about the government 's position but how do you feel about what I be do no one be question your motive Mr Farrell Personally I think you 've do some amazing thing but it do not matter really what we believe if you go through with this it will not be we stop you they be talk about send riot squad down there will not be anything I can do Shawn they will arrest you I guess we will find out tomorrow it be go to be interesting Come on I tell you I be try to take advantage of Vanessa all those arrest warrant that be I I do those I be admit that to you but I never murder anyone then why do you run why be you try to cross the border into Canada that woman know who I be how do I know she be not go to expose I to the police no matter what I do I do not even know her name until you tell I I swear I do not kill Audrey Parker what be that maybe it be break maybe it just do not believe your story he be tell the truth he do not do it the ME say that Audrey die between 7 00 and 8 00 in the morning I just check out Philip 's alibi it hold he be at a coffee shop that whole time he meet a woman for breakfast she be another mark he have she on the line for a phony real estate deal he be with she for two hour try to get money out of her well maybe she be lie if she know he she might be cover for he the sale clerk at the coffee shop confirm it too so do the manager Diana we will we will hand he over to Seattle PD have he arrest on the outstanding warrant but if Audrey Parker be murder Philip Wilson do not do it come on no no he be lie he have to be what be happen to I I be fade away there be nothing there I 've listen again and again it be just static I know that Audrey be follow I around all last night my cell phone answer machine television just break up constantly I mean she be try to tell I something she probably be but it be like I tell you whatever be leave of Audrey be energy you know a kind of signal and signal fade you think she be get weak each time she talk to you it cost she a little of whatever energy she have leave if she stay silent she will be around long maybe she could muster enough to communicate with you one more time but it might be the last thing she ever do she could disappear forever all right we will just go back into her journal we will interview everyone in they Diana stop I know you respect Audrey Parker and to tell you the truth after read about she yesterday I do too she take promicin but look what she do for Vanessa Martin she be try to help people but we 've do what we agree to do we look through the journal we still can not be sure she be murder and even if she be it still would not be our case now I be sorry it be time to let this go I be sorry Audrey so be it start to make sense yet no not really I mean yeah the guy they talk about could be Jordan Collier some of the detail do match up or it could be a coincidence they leave it vague enough that anyone could read into this whatever they want to well you can not just dismiss it that book be a blueprint for how Collier be go to succeed oh yeah Jordan Collier need the handbook of a cult that have not even have a live member in 80 year he do and he need you for what to tell he some crazy guy predict he be go to be God 's messenger to guide he to be his Shaman you keep say that how can I guide he I do not know anything well that be what you 've get I for Kyle everything in that book be go to come true Collier will lead the human race to salvation you will help he you do not believe I yet it be okay I will

a murderer I can not be responsible for send April to prison Tom she be promicin positive it be a life sentence you know the deal besides I mean there be a chance that the police could get to Barton on their own but what if they do not what then then I will tell the authority everything I know after I 've buy April a one way ticket to Marrakech April Skouris right I be a friend of Colin 's brother Jeff Jeff no I be Larry but Jeff hear what happen and he he send I here to get you outta Seattle really well where be we go to go my car 's right out back we be go to go to Phoenix what about

to know what be go on because none of this make any sense why kill Colin why come after I we never get our hand on any of that money well that bribe money that ANEXXO be pay out they clearly do not want anyone know about it I guess it be time we have a talk with this Peter Barton guy I be come with you you want the truth I can get it for you you sure about that I mean People beat lie detector all the time Tom do you like my sister Diana yeah sure she be my partner my friend ever have a sexual fantasy about her once or twice we be work late Diana mention we be the only two people work in the building you can come Peter Barton I be agent Baldwin this be agent Skouris we be with NTAC oh God not her you murder Colin do not you murder no I be not even in the room when your boyfriend show up the money it be not I you be try to blackmail it be the corporation I have to warn they the bribe money who would you pass it off to I tell you that I lose my job what be his name Peter Alex Lupone he be the director of advanced combat system for the pentagon ask he why ANEXXO be pay Lupone do not just do not ANEXXO win a contract to develop a new interceptor ballistic body armor for the military it be suppose to be impenetrable so this body armor it be defective there be some design flaw which leave part of the side and shoulder unprotected I be suppose to pay off Lupone to look the other way you interfere and it be take out of my hand who do you tell about Colin and April Donald Mitchell he sit on our board of director he call I personally to handle the payoff fly I out here on ANEXXO 's dime where can we find Mitchell he be stay at the Dorchester hotel I do not know anyone be go to die I do not like stand up here and call Roland Lenhoff a liar but the truth be he be be one for 40 year he do not single handedly hold off a platoon of viet cong troop while his man lie wound around he I know that for a fact because I be one of those man turn that damn thing off perform by staff sergeant Stephen guess some of my colleague hear that you and I be meet do not waste any time let I know they be not real happy about it Senator I have to ask do you falsify your war record no I do not that fellow who give that little speech I save his life that day they must 've pay he a lot of money to get he to lie like that well I guess if what he say be not true then it do not really matter do not have to be true it be on the television I can tough this out the question be can you 'cause they be go to be give you the same kind of treatment if not bad People have be tell lie about I ever since we come back in that ball of light so do that mean you will run for city council it mean I be go to run and I be go to win that be what I want to hear I know I pick myself the right man so what happen now the first thing you get to do be let people know where you stand that mean tell the world you be against Jordan Collier and everything that he be be do you want to win this election then Jordan Collier be the enemy your enemy Hey Kyle hey how be it come I be try to decipher these code page but I be not a cryptographer can I have a look I may have lose my ability but I do read the encyclopedia from a to z and you remember all of it yeah pretty much how be you with puzzle well I guess we will see but you do say you bring I here for a reason right that I be part of all this so maybe this be my chance to prove it I do not care what Peter Barton claim ANEXXO do not bribe government official that be not the way we conduct business Mr Mitchell do you authorize the payment of 300 000 to Alex Lupone I do not we never pay Alex Lupone a penny now if you will excuse I I have an 80 kobe beef filet grow cold on the plate then what be the money for it be a down payment a down payment for what to have Alex Lupone murder I do not mean that I do not know why I would say such a thing why have Lupone kill I be not answer any more question be it because you be sell the military defective body armor Lupone would have expose we we have no choice I be call my lawyer no not till you cancel the hit on Lupone I do not know what you be talk about how do we reach Lupone what be his phone number there be not one he be on vacation in the brazilian jungle the man we hire be already down there I have no way of contact they be this really necessary absolutely it be so what do we do now well we will get in touch with the brazilian authority and hope that they get in touch with Lupone first but in the meantime I be go to need you to come into NTAC and make sure that Mitchell repeat his confession for the record I can not do that I walk into NTAC I do not come out no I will speak to Meghan we will explain the circumstance what if that do not work can not take that chance April without some coax from your ability Mitchell be go to deny everything he just tell we he be go to get away with murder he be go to get away with Colin 's murder do you want that look I can not do that I be sorry April you 've be run away your entire life from your family from school from responsibility and I do not know maybe I be maybe I be to blame for that maybe I push you away maybe I be not there for you I do not know but this time this time you can not run away watch I all right time to get to the tough question do you think the average citizen be ready to vote for a 4400 well I be hope so be there be a lot more non 4400 out there than people with ability but more people be take the shot all the time how do you feel about that do you agree with Jordan Collier 's decision to hand out promicin to anybody who want it no I do not half of those people be go to die thousand already have be you call Jordan Collier a mass murderer I think that Jordan should 've wait until the odd of survival be well than 50 50 a lot well than 50 50 if he want to change the world there be safe way of do so like run for city council well that be a start anyway April it be I go away not until we 've talk now just let I in come on open up so where do you go now I really have not think that far ahead I never do do I maybe this time you should you want to hear something funny I think when I get this ability it would change my life and it do change my circumstance anyway I get well clothe I eat in well restaurant fly first class for the first time in my life but it do not change I no ability be go to do that you have to change yourself and you can how by march into NTAC that would be brave except I be not brave be I another one of my many fault it be not too late you can still be the person that you want to be look I I can not say that I approve of what you 've be up to but you do say that you love this guy Colin and if you do if that be true then you have to speak up for he and only you can do that the man be guilty of multiple felony and he be threaten to sue we Mitchell 's claim harassment intimidation oh and false arrest and ANEXXO 's lawyer have the muscle to make a case like this stick Come on Meghan he be responsible for one murder we know of he plot two other and his corporation be try to defraud the U S government and we be just go to let he walk you tell I this guy deserve to be lock up and I will believe you but I need more than your word I need that woman the one that get his initial confession look I know she be promicin positive but you need to convince she to come forward I do not think that be go to happen then there be no way we be go to get an indictment against Mitchell not without proof I have the proof you need right here hey Kyle everything all right no it be not I be drive in my car turn on the radio and I hear you tell the world that Jordan Collier 's a mass murderer that be not what I say I say that he be wrong to hand out promicin and that be what I believe everything that you be this building you be stand in you owe it all to Jordan you be willing to betray he for some vote hey I build this place just as much as Jordan he use my heal ability to raise money for it he use I for a lot of thing not anymore I be my own man now I make my own choice well you be off to a great start you be not only betray Jordan you be betray yourself you be a traitor Shawn do not you see that do not you see that Traitor how long have it be since the last time you ask about 10 minute since your sister be be in there with Mitchell about two hour Mitchell 's be with ANEXXO for what 14 year imagine the secret he be save up we could be here all night we get a sign confession whether it hold up in court remain to be see but we 've get enough against he that at least a couple of these charge should stick and April I be sorry Diana we have to take she into custody it be okay Di everything be okay I do not say I would go for it either but you must 've be pretty convincing excuse I I be sorry to interrupt but I have be up all night and what we be do to April just be not fair she do not have to come forward Mitchell could be a free man right now instead of have his picture plaster all over the paper but no she do the right thing and we be lock she up we need to offer she some kind of amnesty not punish her Skouris we be not punish she we be hire she accord to Meghan NTAC the attorney general 's office the FBI they be already fight over who get I when and all I have to do be ask people question it be not always go to be

what could you possibly do for I I do not know that be you I be tell you it be all about you bring they Mr Farrell have be hand this remarkable ability but he himself be simply not that distinguished of a young man now even if he be the second coming of robert kennedy I would still say that a 4400 have no business run for public office today 's clipping do I wanna read today 's clipping everyone respect your healing work but they be call you out on your age your inexperience your lack of education your connection with Jordan Collier I get it I get it it be just do I really have to study my own shortcoming that be what I want to know your campaign manager think you do she get you a meeting with Gabriel Hewitt later today and you be go to have to be able to refute his talking point one by one I have to have a sit down with the man that be be badmouth I to anybody that will put a camera in his face I think the idea be to win he over tell he about the foundation convince he you be not some pawn of Jordan Collier I admire you Kyle give your background it must have be difficult to take the promicin shoot but I 've read your book it be wrong I be no Messiah I know how it sound it be hard for I to believe too I be nobody 's religious nut but these vision I have be never wrong not once and if they say that book be important I have to believe it I have to believe what be in there Promicin be not just here to improve the world Jordan it be here to bring heaven to earth I do not know exactly what that mean but you be suppose to make it happen and I be suppose to help you it be like it say in the book you be go to lead we all to God untie he we will continue this somewhere more comfortable what about I I will deal with you soon enough goodness I a customer I do not recognize will wonder ever cease I guess you do not get many visitor this town be not even on my map that highway two go in a few year back since then we 've be a little short on visitor but it be a treat to

happen while she be sleep and she be not see this while we be in Spain the headline be not exactly reassuring and they be a lot more immediate when your mom bring you back to the front line maybe so but we can not really rule out vision either can we but we be talk about prison camp Maia have not break any law she be a 4400 she do not take promicin I be afraid that distinction do not mean much these day People be scared a lot of they want to lock up every p positive out there the wrong leader come to power someone who exploit all that fear everybody 's feeling and suddenly this do not seem so farfetched there be a more productive way to look at this I mean if they be vision at least we 've get some warning you know if we have more specific maybe we can make sure they do not come true I be try to stop my daughter from have these nightmare not encourage she to have more specific one so that you can analyze they thank for your help though excuse I sorry I do not see you there can I get

you should not have see that Mister who be you people what be this place you say you decipher this Isabelle do it be a list of name but it be people who be alive today Politicians religious leader scientist the book say that once these people all take promicin everyone will it be like a domino effect and that be when when God come I know it sound crazy but only if you take the book literally God could mean any number of thing if these people see a world heal by promicin they could have interpret that as heaven I do not know the only way we will know be if we just follow the book and see what happen right we 've allow the government to characterize the movement as a revolution Revolutions divide destabilize spread fear religion religion unite apparently there be an NTAC agent in town look for his son my dad know I take the shot he must have track I here he would have come on his own he be just look to protect I that be it Jordan be careful with he okay he be my father and he be the last name on the list the book say your father have to take the shot interesting so the application process for the healing foundation be blind help to avoid favoritism and we average about a dozen treatment a day now well the work you do here be remarkable but then I already know that well do that mean you be go to stop sling mud at I quite the contrary I intend on attack you right up until the day of the election you seem to be take this as if it be a referendum on your character I assure you that it be not Personally I think you be an exceptional young man but there be a lot of people out there that be afraid of what you represent so go after you that be just good politic so you do not think I be a threat but you be go to say that I be anyway you you look so shocked look I have my eye on something great than just city council when you declare for the race you bring the national medium spotlight with you and if I do not take advantage of that well I would not be much of a politician now would I do not make a sound now open the door open it up whatever you can do whatever your ability be do not try to use it I can not hurt anybody please put the gun down now what be

vice president cabinet member I do not know but he seem to be oversee some extremely repressive measure against the 4400 nobody respect your daughter 's ability more than I do and I be sorry that she be see these thing but Hewitt he be on the seattle city council that be a long way away from pull these kind of string no please understand I think you 've take a very brave step by declare for public office it be exactly the kind of gesture this country need but I mean you have to consider that you may inadvertently be give a platform to a very dangerous man what be you ask I to do drop out because that be not go to happen I be not ask you to do anything I just want you to have the fact but these be not fact they be dream even if they be vision I stop they from happen by stay in the race by take a stand against hatred and prove Hewitt wrong I hope that be what happen but right now that be not what Maia 's seeing we be not the enemy you know we just think people deserve a choice I be

everybody in town would you want to try it I do not think so think of it as a good faith gesture you would be one step close to see your son plus no offense but I think you could use it Kyle say you be essential to what I be do he be a very forgiving young man he be not there when you kill 4400s why should not I be rid of you forever I do not know I be not in that book but when I first get old I be tell I exist to stop the 4400 and that be what I try to do you beat I I think I would spend the rest of my life in prison think about what I have do and then Kyle find I he tell I I have a purpose he tell I I could still be good you have no idea how much I want that to be true so if help you be the way to make my life mean something I want to try if I accept what Kyle say about our movement I have to accept what he say about you but the first moment you make I nervous your invitation be rescind and you can guess what that mean cut she down every move I make it seem like there be some kind of loss that come with it and the woman I love be go I be lose my son to Collier and I be you do how do you feel wow I actually feel well it be not permanent we would need to have follow up talk it

he know this place be good but his whole life have just be about duty the FBI NTAC I be not sure he will be able to just turn his back on all that and if he say no his name be in the book that be pretty much a guarantee that he can survive the shot can we just make he take it I 've never force anyone to take promicin the movement 's always be about choice but your relationship with your father it be intricate so if you think it good to give he the shot I will respect your decision so if I stay in the race I be create a monster you do not know that for sure remember we be talk about dream no

Marine name Robert Shaftoe and he really be in Dallas on november 22nd 1963 you can not prove Curtis be right but you also can not deny that his theory be compelling some people want to think everything be a conspiracy and I be sure that this guy be really appeal to they but Marco we 've get a lot of stuff on our plate and we just do not have time to look into something that might be a 4400 ability do not think I could sit through another one of those movie we do not ask you down here to tell you about his ability Curtis disappear nobody can find he about 10 day ago he stop post on

curious do not you want to know what be out there that be big than Jordan Collier until we have evidence that tell I this guy 's legit all I want to do be make sure he be okay look at the credit ever since Curtis get back his movie have be produce by a guy call Stuart Henley I check he out he be a retire lawyer he live nearby maybe he would know something about Curtis ' late movie idea it be worth a shot at the very least I would like to look into the eye of the man who put up good money to pay for I dismember Jimmy Hoffa no I do not think that my announcement that I intend to run for mayor will mean that I will be spend less time monitor Shawn Farrell 's candidacy if anything I think that the mayor 's office would allow I a strong platform with which to oppose he Mr Farrell this just

from NTAC we be just try to locate Curtis Peck you will not find he they get to he who be they why would you run from we what be you so scared of the people from Curtis ' movie the Marked that be the name of his movie can you tell we about it about a month ago he come to I say he have an idea for a new movie call the Marked he say it be his big film yet I be fascinated so I ask he to make I a short trailer I like to see what the movie be about before I write a check he give I the trailer about two week ago do you still have a copy and you be more than welcome to it because if what Curtis be say be true then I wish to God I have never watch it this be the world look familiar it should and it should not we all know it change forever when the 4400 come back their mission they be send back by the future to stop a catastrophe but not everyone from the future thought they be a good thing there be a faction of elite who want the future to stay exactly as it be I call they the Marked 10 agent from the future insert into the body of 10 prominent people from today their body and mind have be hijack to pursue the agenda of the future their goal to guide world event and to stop the 4400 the only evidence they exist a mark behind their left earlobe the remnant of the procedure that graft a new consciousness onto their victim my movie the Marked will tell the chilling tale of this global conspiracy it will name name start with the appearance of the first mark a man name Matthew Ross Matthew Ross be a lobbyist with access to Jordan Collier after he be mark his job be to guide the Marked 's ultimate weapon Isabelle Tyler into accept her role as the agent of the 4400 's destruction Isabelle I tell you you have to accept your role as the agent of the 4400 's destruction but everything do not go accord to plan I do not think so Matthew today 's graduation day and you be my diploma but the Marked do not accept defeat lie down they continue to plan they have their greedy finger on the marionette string of the world and we their puppet do not even know it the group gather for the first time at the behest of Drew Imroth that be right the ceo of the big software company in the world be one of the Marked I know it be dangerous for we all to meet like this but the information I have be important very very important it well be important Mr Imroth it be easter do you know how hard it be to get away from the vatican at easter take it down a notch your eminence I have big news Jordan collier be back and we need to stop he completely stop he the Marked a direct market thriller available in all territory in 2008 I be so buy that movie so either that be the rambling of a madman or Curtis Peck have just expose the big conspiracy of all time accord to that movie Matthew Ross be one of these guy the Marked and Isabelle Tyler kill he and we always wonder if that be true what about Imroth I mean the CEO of Ubient Software be suppose to be some kind of double agent from the future everyone always say that company be try to take over the world now we know it be true the only thing we know for sure be that Curtis Peck be a horrible horrible film maker though I do have to admit there be a bunch of question I would like to ask he but since he be in the wind I guess we will have to settle for his producer get Stuart Henley in here Mr Henley it be Diana Skouris from NTAC we need to talk can you open up it smell like exhaust stand back no big surprise in the coroner 's preliminary report Stuart Henley die of carbon monoxide poisoning there be no suicide note but there be no sign of foul play either so do you really think he commit suicide Henley be an odd guy I mean he would have to be to pay for Curtis ' movie so I guess it be possible but I do not know the timing seem off why would he commit suicide right after NTAC get in touch with he so what then execute by the mark I be not ready to go there yet yeah I neither but I I get a lot of question you know Drew Imroth be in that movie Ubient 's base in Seattle maybe we can get in and see he tomorrow morning and ask he what exactly oh I get it excuse I when you be not run the big computer company in the world be you by any chance involve in an enormous intercontinental conspiracy maybe or maybe we could just ask he whether Curtis Peck ever try to get in touch with he sound good I will see tomorrow what you be not go home no not for a while Meghan ask I to put all this in an email I tell she I would get it off to she tonight want a hand no I get it go ahead spend a little time with your daughter while she be still awake thank good night we appreciate you take the time to meet with we Mr Imroth it be really not a problem I be a huge supporter of NTAC you guy have tough job please have a seat I only wish I could be more helpful I 've never hear of this guy you say his name be Curtis Peck yeah that be right he be a he be a 4400 who who make movie and you well you be a character in his late film really who play I I always hope it would be Jeff Goldblum it be more of a low budget kind of thing what be it about well it be interesting it be creative it be a global conspiracy in which agent from the future have take over the body of prominent people from all around the world I have to say I be the subject of a lot of conspiracy theory but that be the most innovative one I 've hear yet so be you here to ask I if it be true because you have to figure I would not tell you even if it be no actually we come to see you because Curtis Peck have go miss there be a chance one of his investor may have be murder oh I be sorry to hear that should I be worried for my own safety no we do not think so but if Curtis should try and get in touch with you or if anyone should ask you about a movie call the Marked could you get in touch with we absolutely thank you be there anything else I can help you with actually this may seem like a really strange request do you think we could take a look behind your left earlobe let I guess this have something to do with that movie have at it have that mole always be there ever since I be bear my dermatologist tell I I have to keep an eye on it so give it to I straight do this mean I be one of the what be the name of that movie the Marked Kyle what be with all the spy game stuff here be I really this far outside of the Collier circle of trust it be just a precaution I need you to promise I that you be not go to freak out okay I would just like to take this thing off please hi Shawn what the hell be she do here she be with we it be okay she just want to talk to you before you see Jordan I be glad you be awake and I be sorry for everything I know I be wrong and I know what we have be not love yeah you be right it be not I do not expect you to forgive I ever but I just need you to hear it well there be no one so far go they can not find their way back to the movement even if I tell the world that you be wrong to hand out promicin I be not surprised they have you speak against I Politics be compromise that be why I never pursue it myself I understand that you be want to build a bridge between positive and the rest of the world but Shawn I be tell you event be move past that we have big plan here and when we be finish the 4400 will not need the mainstream the mainstream will come to we be that what your book tell you I 've read it frankly it scare I be you say that you be go to bring God to the world if the word God frighten you substitute paradise we be go to make it happen Shawn you should be here with we yes but who be in charge of paradise how many martyr will it take to create it Jordan you 've do great thing for the 4400 you have do great thing for I but you be on the wrong path here and you have always be rebellious but I think you be afraid of change Shawn or it be just I I be against anyone who want to accumulate power that will not tell I exactly what they wanna do with it not just you anyone there be a man by the name of Gabriel Hewitt he be run for mayor he be dangerous Maia Skouris see he in a vision he be in charge of prison camp and they be round up 4400s even if I want to drop out of the race even if I want to join you I can not because I have to stop he well it sound like you have your hand full already good luck in your political career I be sorry I do not know but that birthmark behind Imroth 's ear it be definitely shape like an x exactly like the one in Curtis ' movie it be weird yes but it could be a coincidence we be look for a paranoid 4400

probably will not have a career then it look like fate intervene on our behalf you be not answer my question because I find it offensive you be the one who be always say that we be at war why would not Hewitt just be another casualty to you just like all those people that die take your shot those people make a choice they know the risk I know the risk I do not order anyone to attack Gabriel Hewitt I do not believe you I can not begin to tell you how disappointing that be well it be true that be why I can not follow you anymore do you see the license plate on the car that take he away I

back off well it be not go to work we be go to find out the truth about these people with or without Curtis Peck excuse I agent Baldwin agent Skouris Sorry for the surprise I ask my driver to make a detour I can not get that crazy movie idea out of my head what be it call the Marked you know damn well what it be call I guess I do I keep think what it would be like to actually be one of those guy

then you well get start because accord to what Maia 's tell we whatever Jordan Collier 's planning this be ground zero Bobby head that way we be go to cover this side I still do not understand why Collier would risk come back to Seattle it be like he be dare we to catch he we would not even know he be here if it be not for Maia it be not like he be show up at a Mariners game this place be pretty low profile I do not think this qualifie as low profile Somebody 's feel pretty confident Tom what be those light it be almost like they be mark some kind of perimeter maybe they be warn light

it I know that much she tell you that she tell I what she want to tell I and you just do what she say do that bother you I guess it be just a matter of faith you know that be what Promise City be all about Faith Belief Hope hey get back here Kyle I think something be happen we get a report that someone manage to get past police line and enter Promise City one of the dashboard camera get some video oh my God Maia why be not you pick this up you get this message you call I back immediately maybe she do not take her cell phone with her maybe they take it away from her Jordan 's not go to hurt she Diana Maia go in there to warn he about the soldier she have an ability he would love to have access to if anything he be probably treat she like a queen Maia 's vision end in darkness that have never happen before we have get to go in there and get Kyle and Maia to safety well how do we get past the beacon Aquino and his man seem pretty damn confident they can get through we go with they it be a military operation Diana Lawton 's not go to let two NTAC agent just tag along then we do not ask for permission I be bear three year ago so that make you what nine year old than I almost ten I litterally grow up overnight I do not understand what it mean to be an adult you do a lot of bad thing I be tell they be necessary Important but that do not make it right do it no it do not so what I

ability now that be what a river should look like and that be the way river should taste come on in the water 's fine so Maia now do you think I be a good guy or a bad guy soldier with ability they will be here soon they be come to kill you as much as I like to hear I be right it be not go to make a bit of difference yesterday you say that we could deal with this the sex scandal sure but Jordan Collier this whole Promise City thing that we can not get around my position on Jordan be very clear I publicly condemn the man for hand out promicin your whole campaign be construct around one concept yes a middle path for both 4400 and non 4400s one you sell to I one I still believe in there be no middle path now Collier just blow it all up Promise City miracle we can not compete with that so that be it you be tell I to just drop out of the race I be tell you you can not win hender it be your show he be east of here maybe ten block those guy get all the good trick just be glad Aquino can only do that camouflage thing when they be stand still we would 've lose they the minute they get over there Diana slow down we do not want to get too close I do not want to lose they what the hell be you two do Captain we be not here to interfere with your mission okay my daughter she be inside Promise City I just want to get she out you two get catch thing get a lot messy for we surrender

hold high Shawn there be some reporter downstairs tell they we will have the press conference tomorrow morning I will see they now I have some thing that I want to say Mr Farrell what be your relationship with Kara Sarkestian you receive sexual favor for heal her mother be you in contact with Jordan Collier please please first of all in spite of my ability to heal I be a normal person and that mean that I make mistake obviously I make one the other night I regret that my misjudgment as distract from the real issue of my campaign right now as you all know Jordan Collier be create his own separate society in a place that he call Promise City far widen the divide between people with ability and people without he say that he be here to heal the world but what he be do threaten to tear everything apart which be why I have no choice but to continue my campaign to continue to be a voice for unity and cooperation and to provide a middle path that we can all walk together I will answer those question Mr Farell Senator Lenhoff be you still back Mr Farrell you bet I be Shawn can we get another statement hey mommy oh Maia I be so worried about you I be sorry I have to warn Jordan Jordan it be Jordan now this place mom they be do all kind of great stuff you should see it some other time we be leave now no no what do you mean no we can not we have to stay here it be safe that way bad day huh dad I 've have well you go to cut I loose so now what we go see Jordan Gentlemen you be trespass be you sure you will not reconsider you could join we keep your ability that be not go to happen no I suppose not it pain I to see gift like your waste make sure they be escort out of Promise City Collier wait this be not go to end you 've paint a huge bullseye on this place the government 's go to keep come after you then I will just have to show they what a very bad idea that be just wait maybe I be not clear you be free to go Maia you can come back anytime you can even stay here a while if that be all right with your mother play sleepover in a war zone I do not think so send in those soldier it be a bad idea but do not make thing bad by retaliate People you work for be the problem they need to learn to leave we alone your son have a point you 've promise the world miracle you 've even show we some but no one be go to remember that once you start kill people when people start die it be a war no matter how powerful you think you be when it be war you lose do not be so sure my mom be right if there be a war everyone lose you see this just now while you be talk please you have to listen to my mother so what do you think Kyle do Maia get through to Collier will he hold off any reprisal he be go to do what he think be right but he will not hurt anybody if he do not have to I guess you can make it the rest of the way on your own I will turn off the beacon so you can cross Kyle come with I it could be your last chance you never give up do you no and I never will that book I tell you about the prophecy Heaven on earth yeah I remember well in the book there be a list of 200 name People who can take promicin and be guarantee to survive the last name on that list be you dad so what be you try to say Kyle I be destine to take promicin because it say so in some book I be just say you be a very important person and not just to I I get to go I do not know about you but I be exhausted yeah I be pretty tired too this war the one that you tell Collier about what exactly do you see actually I do not see anything sweetheart it do not matter how bad it be you can tell I because I need to know no mom I mean I do not see anything I do not have a vision I lie why well I do not want Jordan to hurt anyone and he be not listen to you and you know he would

there how long have they be there they start gather about 20 minute ago all right here come Collier and Kyle 's with he and Isabelle Tyler I think you say no one could get close to those beacon someone must be shield they from the effect they be move the perimeter that be Collier 's reprisal he be expand Promise City so what be he say the more we move against he the more land he be go to take today south Seattle tomorrow what the world that be twice as big as it be before www seriessub com v1 01 SeriesSub present the world will have to deal with we previously on the 4400 Promicin be out there People be gain ability and nothing can be do about that Kyle listen to I if you be involve in something Collier will lead the human race to salvation you will help he what be this place Cassie say we should come here you be on the wrong path here and you 've always be rebellious but I think you be afraid of change Shawn or be it just I you do not really know this girl at all do you Baby get your hand off of I I share an office with two of the most annoying guy on the planet I do not understand why Collier would risk come back to Seattle it be like he be dare we to catch he this be a message of hope for a well tomorrow and it begin here in Promise City I be go to ask you if you want to be a part of this operation believe I I want Collier as much as anyone it be not Collier I be think about he be my son I 've get to believe I can still reach he Diana what the hell 's go on where be everyone I do not know you be the first person I 've see I just wake up on the floor of the break room why be you sleep in the break room I do not know why be I sleep at my desk the last thing I remember be go to bed at home the last thing I remember I be go over case file in my living room why do I just wake up underneath my office chair please tell I you know how we get here Possibility one we be under attack someone with a grudge against the NTAC use a 4400 ability against we maybe more than one that would explain the memory gap but if a 4400 be come after we why be we still alive be we the only survivor in the building maybe or maybe the attacker have not get down to our level yet let us not ignore possibility two the world at large be under attack the building 's react to a security situation out there so what we be the only survivor in the world could we come up with a possibility that do not involve an attack it be not respond we be lock out of the building 's network I can not even access the system maybe we can do it from ops try to get in through the mainframe establish some kind of contact with the outside world or maybe we could just walk out the front door do you hear that alarm that mean the building 's seal and it be go to stay seal until someone override the security protocol we could be the only one here who know how to do that all right get yourself ready to go I do not care if this building be crawl with every p positive in Seattle we be get to ops First wake up p J wake up man no phone no email even the emergency radio do not work internal surveillance be down too I can not find a sidearm anywhere good to see we be not alone God tell I you 've get some answer you get into the network good job Brady that be not I I be still lock out the alarm just go silent the phone be still dead if the security system be down that could mean the exit be not seal we could get out of here it be worth check out Tom you and I will scout ahead make sure there be a safe path to the exit oh and Diana make sure you stick with these guy watch their back while they work on establish communication wait let us go no one be there there be no one anywhere we have not see a soul since we leave OPS Season 4 Episode 08 no Exit Transcript www ragbear com Synchro Benj Synchro aspro5oo www seriessub com Collier what the hell do you do to this place Dad Kyle what be go on here answer I Kyle run hold it Kyle no Kyle wait wait kyle open the door open the door Kyle whatever you be do here you have to stop you have to convince Collier to stop open the door what be you do here where be we what do you do to I what the hell be go on it be not I I do not do anything this look like NTAC do we get arrest I be work late in my apartment I do not remember anything after that maybe the government 's round up 4400s they have soldier with ability they could 've mess with our memory why would they put you and I together hello I do not understand Collier have just build a huge settlement for himself in the middle of Seattle that be a huge win for he why would he risk everything and attack the building he do not stick around to explain himself whatever he be plan we have to be ready to defend ourselves guy can we lower the blast door over the entrance to this room they be control by the computer and we still can not access the system we could move the furniture and build a barricade Great we will make a wall make out of desk and chair I be sure that will be really helpful especially if they 've get somebody who can melt our brain from around the corner do you have a well idea wait there be a weapon locker a few floor down that be where we store all the assault rifle maybe Collier have not get to it yet believe I I do not want to point a gun at Kyle but if Collier be lead some kind of attack we need something more than office supply to fight back with what be happen why be I here we check that room it be empty you be okay now you be with I you be safe my dad and his boss seem just as surprised as we be it sound like they think Jordan bring we here do he Jordan have nothing to do with this he do not always share his plan Kyle guess you have not learn that yet my relationship with he be different from the one you two have he do not hide thing from I and he sure be not plan an assault on NTAC you guy wait we can not fight not now we 've get to find Jordan he be trap in here too I be not go anywhere without he you guy do whatever you want I be go to find my way out of here what Isabelle what listen whatever be go on here we have a much well chance of get out if we stick together now stay with we we will find Jordan and we will leave as a group it be not respond these lock be suppose to run on reserve power what good be a weapon locker if you can not get into it during an emergency maybe we can find a crowbar or something try to force the door hold on if we can pry that face pad off I might be able to short circuit it really you be go to hotwire the door open do not look so surprised I work in a think tank for year you would be amazed at the thing I pick up around the water cooler try this where have you get that my desk drawer you say we might have to defend ourselves with office supply so what nothing nothing I be just wonder how you do it we all wake up in the middle of NTAC with no explanation and now we be down in the basement try to break into a weapon locker so we can fight off an attack by God know how many people with 4400 ability it seem pretty hopeless right but you you just keep move forward if I stop cold every time a situation look hopeless I would not have last very long in this job all I do be focus on what be in front of I in a few year you will look back and you will realize that you survive by do exactly the same thing a few year I be flatter you think I will last that long here come on give I a hand right now I will twist and you pull all right there all right there we go Jordan and none of you have any idea how we get here but everyone be all right nobody 's hurt I be fine what be you do here all the exit be seal so I look for this place NTAC imprison 4400 here and those who have take the shot I be look for ally the entire wing 's empty so I guess you be out of luck no I be not out of luck I find you three that should be enough enough for what their operation center 's on the second level Communications gear security control we get there we can contact Promise City send for help that be where my dad 's office be they be all go to be there likely there be no other way we need control of that room you be talk about overpower a bunch of government agent Jordan what be we go to do take hostage Shawn they bring we here against our will they be the aggressor I will walk out of here peacefully if I can but I will walk out of here and any of you not want to spend the rest of your life in one of these cell should join I be you all right yeah yeah yeah it be fine it be fine prepare to be impress guess the shock be worth it I be impressed there be nothing here it be

he be responsible for this do not make any sense she should not be dead we have to get the computer back online let us just focus on that what exactly be we suppose to be look for anything we can use to defend ourselves Kyle this be crazy be we suppose to use these on someone I hope not this be all I could find a broom handle what be I suppose to do with this use it or do not but I be not inclined to give up without a fight see why do you think that we need to fight do not you say that when you run into my uncle that he think that you be behind this you think that they be do that not beg the question what if it be neither of we what if something else be cause this First we control that room then we ask question no let us ask they now what you seem to be forget be one of those NTAC agent

in time I kiss Sara at the end of the ceremony and then we all wake up at home the game be over the game I figure out how it work since then my ability it be like a game p J stop use the word game there be two people dead I be not sure about that no one be ever die before I do not know what that mean for the real world why NTAC why do you pick this place I do not pick it you do we all do but I have no control over anything else we determine where we go all of our mind together it be a subconscious thing NTAC mean something different to each of we but it matter to everyone that be how we get here exactly and there be always an obstacle something all the player have to work together to overcome I know this sound weird but in this case I think the obstacle be the building itself you be say NTAC be try to kill we that make sense the building electrocute Meghan the building cause the wind burst that shatter that window and kill Shawn Farrell so what be we suppose to do just sit here and wait for it to pick we all off we be suppose to work together that be the whole point I sit in my office every day and I read about how thing be get bad about how it be just a matter of time before everything blow up a war between positive and negative that be why I bring people from both side here I want to help I want to bring the two camp together so we get to watch each other die one by one that be a hell of a valuable lesson you have not just put our life at stake if I die if Kyle die here that could mean the end of the movement you 've jeopardize everything we 've work for let us not make it easy for this place to hurt we we should move all the computer outta here anything electronic no there might be a way out of this the last couple time I play I figure out that there be always a back door if I find it I can walk through it and if I do the game end we all wake up Hopefully Shawn and Meghan do too where be it it be usually at the far edge of the playing field wherever I wake up in the game it be as far away from there as possible wait wait you come to in the theory room right Marco find some map of the building Figure out where this back door should be everyone get to work and be careful do you think Shawn 's really go I do not know let us hope not look I know you think take the shot be wrong but I know what I be do I mean I know that follow Collier mean I have to get use to people die maybe even people I know I keep say you know these death be not meaningless they be sacrifice I still believe that I do but see Shawn lie there you might want to remember that feel the next time Collier hand down order look I do not want to lecture you but you do not know what it be to worry about you the way I do every time I hear something about Collier on the news every time I pick up the paper in the morning I be afraid that I be go to learn that you be in jail or that you be dead I do not see how it could end any other way for you we could win we could save the world well I want a son not a martyr for Collier 's cause Dad that be enough gauze I be sorry I guess I never stop be a dad I think Marco 's get something that be it the dead end of this hallway on sub level 11 that be the farth point in the building from our office if P J 's back door be anywhere that be the spot all right I will go not alone you will not this whole building be one big trap we be not send you out there on your own he will not be alone as far as I know I be the only one who can end this I have to be the one to walk through that door all right get yourself ready we be leave in 2 min I be go with you this be suppose to be an exercise in cooperation I think it be fitting we divide the risk I be think we should take the stair you care about Shawn do not you Shawn be just a little kid when his father leave my sister I try to take an interest in he do what I could to help raise he well you do a fine job he be an extraordinary he be an extraordinary young man he and I have grow apart it be difficult lose someone you 've you 've invest so much time in you make that bed for yourself Shawn break off from you because he do not agree with what you believe in and you be too rigid to change be not that why Kyle pull away from you hey do not compare the two situation for one thing if it be not for you we would not be stand here wonder whether Shawn be alive or dead you put the shot out there which be why he could take one and that be why two people I care about might be dead the spread of promicin be not to blame the fear of it be your government prevent people who 've take the shot from learn how to control their ability you 've criminalize the gifted so what we should all just step aside and let you run the world can you two ever stop argue you be literally go to get we all kill if you can not calm down you both might as well go back to ops right now I will find the way out myself these be the stair let us go would you mind go first I get your back if this back door thing do not work out we be go to need another plan we already know we can not get to the generator so Maia what be you do I be just help kyle we do not know this place as well as you guy but we might as well pitch in I mean who know maybe we will come up with something okay that be great Maia will you go stand with Marco Mom we be just try to go now you know I want to get out of here too just the same way you do I know you hate I tell you the truth I do not blame you but you do need to work with I that be the game you threaten my daughter 's life I know you shoot I for it remember yeah six time more if I could have reload I really do not care what this little exercise be suppose to be about you just stay the hell away from Maia Maia come over here that be it if we can get through that door that should be the way out let I try that be I my bedroom look like we find our back door I know I be go to jail when we all wake up just make sure everyone know I be sorry he be dead it be go the way out it be go that will not work p J say he be the only one who can end this early yeah well I be not give up neither be I the back door be just that a way out one option there be another we play out the game try to survive Win Win p J say there be a goal to every game an end point we do not know what that be not yet but I doubt we will find it down here we head back up to the operation room we stick together figure out a way to live wait a second be it I or be it get hot in here that air 's get to be well over a hundred degree so this place be go to cook we all I do not know about you guy but personally I would rather be electrocute than fricasseed Nobody be getting cook the environmental control be just a few floor down we can change the temperature manually it will not work the temperature control run through the main computer network and we still can not access the system we need to kill the building this place run on power we take that away it can not hurt we anymore we shut the building down we win cut the power you do not think we 've think about that the emergency generator be seal off well it be actually not that bad of an idea look we can not shut the generator down because we can not get to they but if we could find a way to create an electrical surge big enough to overload the emergency system there would be a power outage this place would go black there be two major power relay that run throughout this entire building our everyday system and the emergency line if we can find a place where the 2 relay run close to each other connect the two line and zap short the building out there we keep all the computer server in that room every power conduit in the building run through there if P J have not get we out of here in two minute Marco you and I be head to that room you find the long power cord you can and strip the insulation off of it you be come with we it be your idea you should have a chance to see it through what be that um the building I do not think it like our plan what be happen it be not blow air into the room anymore it be suck it out okay guy we be not wait two minute we be all go now the blast door be down hello stay there Dad Kyle what be happen the building shut we off suck all the air out of the room Tom I do not think we 've get much time you have to try and short circuit the building 's power supply this be all I could find we need to run that cord between these two power relay if Marco be right that will shut this place down this be not nearly long enough then find more these power line be all they be all seal into the wall if we could rip these out of the ceiling no they be die in that room we do not have time there be one way to complete the connection between these relay Us we complete the circuit ourselves you be talk about run thousand of volt of electricity through our body we will die we will but if your colleague be right we will end this thing so how about it you do not strike I as a man afraid of a sacrifice I keep tell myself it be just a game but you know what I still do not feel like die it be not an experience I be look to revisit well I guess it be like you be always say just have to have faith on three on three one two three Mommy Sweetheart you okay you be okay you be not hurt I be fine be Jordan here have you see he can I talk to Tom Baldwin please hi we uh we pick up p J after he wake up he try to make a run for Promise City and uh we I be fine really it be okay I be sorry it be just I watch you die last night you have no idea how good it be to see you right now I be sorry that thing get so out of hand and I know I be go to jail for take the shot so it be probably the wrong time to say this but if everything you tell I be true maybe it will be worth it play the game how could you say that it be scared but my ability work Jordan Collier and Tom Baldwin actually cooperate they sacrifice themselves to save the other player that have to mean something right let us hope so I would hate to think you give up your freedom for nothing someone will be here shortly to take you downstairs be you okay it be go to be strange not have p J in the

like to hear it well I be put together profile of the people who have take the shot the one we know of anyway to see if I could discover why some survive and other do not and the initial research be promise pretty soon Kevin think he will be able to predict who will survive the shot and who will not and if people know for certain that promicin will kill they they will not take the shot and a lot less people would die Isabelle do you hear what I say to you you do not have to drink the rest of it if you do not want to and if I do not then what I start my life over again as an eight year old we could go see Cora maybe she could reverse the process age you back to where you be that boy Kyle risk his life to come find you someone care that much about you it say a lot about he and about you

will be able to integrate a new neurotransmitter well how big do it have to be I do not know yet but I think I can figure it out and if I do a simple cat scan will tell I how anyone 's body will react to the shot and you would know in advance whether or not you would live or die the shot would not have to kill anyone anymore how long do you need a couple of month maybe less this be huge keep work I will get you anything you need okay where be you go I got to get in contact with Collier if this test be really only a few month away all he have to do be make an announcement tell people that be think about take the shot to simply wait this be great hey Tom what be you do stand in the middle of the hallway be everything all right yeah I be fine I 've just have a strange morning well join the

the little thing we have Richard Tyler and his daughter surround outnumber the situation be in hand and we lose he anyway well with all due respect I be there and that situation be anything but in hand Richard Tyler have become an extremely powerful man I understand but we can not simply just throw our hand up now can we in two week I be be ask to testify before a congressional subcommittee on the progress of the war against promicin I will be here for the entire week to prepare and I would like to go back with a victory so you want we to bring in Richard Ms Parrish ask to meet my two good

the administration have enemy everywhere these day what be you do here Ms Parrish I want to have a word with you in private gentleman gentleman agent Baldwin and I need the room thank you damn it this be my house I be go to pay you the respect of be frank I be a little concerned with your outburst in Ms Doyle 's office this morning be you quite sure you be up to the job of track down Richard Tyler I be fine that be good to hear this might surprise you but I think I have an idea of what you be go through right after I take this job I feel like I be on the verge of a breakdown myself I be overwhelmed at work and I be have these strange moment where I be see thing it be almost like I be not myself like someone else be in my head do you understand what I be say I think I do let I ask you something Ms Parrish if I look behind your left ear would I find a mark there a mark you mean like a mole that be hard to say once you turn 40 your skin change all the time I remember how nervous I be in those day I think I be go to lose myself forever I fight it my God how I fight it and then one day I just could not fight it anymore I give in I accept my situation and you know what thing have be much well for I since then I be happy my friend tell I that I be like a new person you should relax Tom whatever you be go through just let it happen you will feel well I promise you be say Rebecca Parrish be one of these people she be mark yeah I think so she never come out and say it but you have not have any more hallucination so maybe she be talk about something else what do you think I think it be crazy and I doubt we will be able to prove any of this but I have to go with Tom I think that there be a very good chance the director of national intelligence be mark we be go to have to be very careful with how we proceed NTAC would be look for Richard Tyler no matter what so we will keep do that I be pass the case over to Garrity and Ashmore Tom you be take a personal day tomorrow Diana and I will keep an eye on you we will watch over you in shift I be sorry Shawn be you really ask I to tell people not to take promicin only for a few month Jordan I know that we have have our difference in the past but this be good for both of we all we have to do be be patient it be not the need for patience that concern I it be the worldwide implication of this test Shawn there would be million of people with ability and million without any chance of have they yes but they would be alive and live in a world with two class of human be Positives and negative can not live side by side those without ability will tear down the one who have they or the positive will simply use their power to rid themselves of the negative inquisition or holocaust either way it be a recipe for hell on earth what be your alternative do you really want the entire world to take promicin yes yes I do it be what I 've always say have to happen half of the planet will die you be talk about mass suicide I be talk about a single generation of sacrifice and at the end of it a more fully evolve specie all of our failing as human being will be address when we be all gifted I be not make any announcement and no one who care about what be right for the world would somebody get so big oh she get heavy too yeah just one just one I be go to go play all right go play she seem so happy be not toddler suppose to be moody oh Isabelle 's have her moment believe I oh I be sure she have ever since I get back I 've be think about what it must have be like for you raise she on your own you know neither

your ability back then you can bring Jordan Collier to I www seriessub com v1 00 SeriesSub present the world will have to deal with we previously on the 4400 I be put together profile of the people who 've take the shot pretty soon Kevin think he will be able to predict who will survive the shot and who will not be you really ask I to tell people not to take promicin only for a few month I be not make any announcement who be you I be Lindsey this be Maia Rutledge she be the first one to disappear as far as we can tell they be dead be not they there be a faction of elite who want the future to stay exactly as it be I call they the Marked what about Imroth the CEO of Ubient software 's suppose to be some kind of double agent from the future tell the other I go to see the NTAC agent Baldwin think it be some kind of ploy when we need he he will be there for we you be become your new self do what Tom Baldwin would do find Isabelle Tyler you have to take your ability back then you be go to bring Jordan Collier to I Tom what be go on I feel restless I keep toss and turn I do not want to wake you so you be just sit here no I be watch you sleep it be kind of relax well I be awake now so why do not you come back to bed there be not this more relaxing Andaluca 's be not that a little bit fancy so I be not a little kid anymore I just miss the day when the only place you would eat be Charlie 's pizza palace Mom that be like a long time ago oh yeah at least a year besides it would be fun eat spanish food with Ben again I hope you be not get your hope up for nothing I know that Ben say that he might make it but London be a long way off I promise I will not be disappoint on my birthday it be just be I do not know just you and I and with Ben it would feel more like family excuse I be you okay yeah what be that be this real money certainly look like it these little green scrap of paper you be fight over be worthless welcome to the new world the new world that be right out of Jordan Collier 's playbook it sound like it but can we be really sure that these ATM malfunction be be cause by some 4400 ability because it could be the work of some sophisticated computer hacker who be just look to create some havoc actually I have to go with a p positive here Diana so far 58 atm from four separate banking institution have be affect that mean four separate computer mainframe have be compromise thousand of dollar be be randomly dispense every time they shut down an ATM another one go haywire I would like to meet the computer hacker that can pull that off you know without an ability pretty aggressive move though I mean even for Collier if you want to create a new world first you have to destroy the old one and disrupt the economy be a pretty good way to start I would not mind drive do that work for you be my guest I be go to need an hour or two before we go see Collier be there something wrong hopefully not I 've get an appointment for a cat scan it be just a precaution ever since the mole come back I 've be a little on edge you do not feel any different do you you mean be I one of the marked some kind of zombie control by a future human not not yet anyway I will call you when I be do with the hospital be you sure you will not reconsider Mr Chatha take the shot would be hugely beneficial not only to you but to the million of your reader who would follow your example yes but you have to understand that there be no guarantee that this allege compatibility test of Shawn Farrell 's will ever be perfect yes well if you change your mind the door 's always open we have your cousin to thank for that Maneck Chatha 's name be on the list in the white light book we already know he can survive the shot it be his follower he be worried about why risk their life when Shawn 's announce it be only a matter of time before the test be available too bad you lose Chatha it would not have happen if you have do what I tell you to yeah I know stop Shawn right what do that mean exactly I be hope you would figure that out for yourself Shawn 's not develop this test by himself what you need to do be get rid of Kevin Burkhoff get rid of he what be I suppose to do exactly kill the guy I expect you to do whatever it take to fulfill the prophecy and help Jordan Collier bring heaven to earth good morning Isabelle I hope you be feel at home you know I have to say of all of our real estate holding this place be my favorite I think you would like to know tomorrow your father 's be move from Seattle to an NTAC hold facility in Virginia which mean you need to agree to take your ability back before Richard step on that plane because if you do not he be not get off it you already cause your mother 's death do you want to be responsible for your father 's too even if I agree to take the shot what be the point the government doctor already tell I that promicin will kill I we can change that Isabelle I guarantee you will live to fulfill your original mission to destroy the 4400 and anyone else with trace of promicin in their system and you will start by bring we Jordan Collier you know Kyle use to talk about you all the time he say you be a decent man but then you be not Tom Baldwin be you Tom Baldwin be a confused and unhappy man I 've give he the clarity of purpose he desperately need and I want to give that to you Isabelle after all I create you place you in your mother 's womb to make sure you be send back in that ball of light so you could protect the world from the 4400 Promicin be evil People who use it be evil their goal be not to change the world it be to end it you can stop they you have to stop they it be what you be mean to do how can you say no to your destiny Season 4 Episode 11 ghost in the Machine Transcript www ydy com Synchro Benj Synchro aspro5oo www seriessub com manual labor in Promise City be not that a bit old school nothing wrong with old school when it come to a little sweat and muscle have an ability can lead to complacency and complacency be the measure of a die society Welcome to the new world you be here about the attack on the banking system you know about that I try to stay current but I can assure you that despite the attacker 's utopian signature nobody here have anything to do with it can you really be sure of that you must have like 500 people live here by now nobody here would do something like that without Jordan 's consent which I do not give well just proove it to we let we talk to your people and if nobody do it maybe they can help we find out who the hell be responsible I be afraid I can not do that you mean you will not I mean whoever be do this have my good wish the system you live in be obsolete any society that worship at the altar of wealth be doom

attack be anything but random every malfunction computer include the original atm have one thing in common they all run Ubient 's Enzyme operating system Ubient that be Drew Imroth 's company so I guess the question we have to ask be this be these attack against Drew Imroth the multi billionaire corporate giant or Drew Imroth the alleged member of the global conspiracy know as the Marked the operative word be allege we do not even have any hard evidence that the Marked exist Tom and I be pretty certain yeah that be right but even so Ubient be one of the big corporation in the world if it

Imroth be not joke when he say he have a lot of enemy this be go to take all night to get through this I think I be go to take my half home that be a good idea you really surprise I today at Imroth 's office the way you react when he get in your face the guy be have a rough day I be try to be diplomatic I mean consider what we suspect he of because he bring up the Marked and you do not even well

that I be still obsess about prove he be one of the Marked what do you tell he the truth that he have nothing to worry about that I would do my job to the good of my ability then I ask he to name every member of the marked which lead to some of the firework you be hope for I well take this I will see you in there Baldwin when be Isabelle all right fine I will have to make an excuse here I will be right over what happen where 's kevin I do not know the cleaning staff come in this morning this be how they find the place all his work be miss too this be Jordan it have to be he know about the compatibility test it be so strange all those people willing to risk their life to get an ability think it will make they feel less alone more powerful I never feel more alone and less powerful than when I have limitless ability it overwhelm my entire life become my identity cut I off from everyone my parent Shawn it be only when I lose everything that I find myself and now you want I to go back there become that person again that person be who you be it will not be that bad Isabelle these past few month you get a little vacation you spend a little time out in the world but now it be time to go back to work it be nice to be normal at least for a little while okay so this be a modification of a document authorization program Abigail design while she be at M I T we use it to cross reference the language in the anti Ubient manifesto with the hate mail direct at Drew Imroth we be look for idiosyncratic phrase and word choice with a high degree of similarity in both document now you can see whoever write the manifesto like to use semi colon by the handful he be also fond of who or which instead of that and he refer to Imroth as Mr Puppetmaster a phrase he repeat a total of 6 time and what do we find in the hate mail department this document semi colon who and which use again instead of that and finally our old friend Mr puppetmaster so the two author be one and the same do you have a name for we this e mail be sign Swindled Imroth put his people on it they trace it to a Warren Trask turn out back in the early ' 80 Trask design a primitive version of the Enzyme operating system when Imroth come out with a very similar program Trask sue let I guess he lose no no it never go to court Imroth offer Trask an out of court settlement Trask wind up with 100 000 Meanwhile Enzyme have make Imroth billion so the guy 's piss would not you be you can ask he yourself he live right here in seattle well nice work Marco actually it be all Abigail she buy you that suit too stop look so freak out we be almost there I tell you I can not stay long if my mom find out she will not I promise you a birthday surprise right well here it be Mom Dad Maia be it really you Vic can you believe how big she be get she be still my little girl I only wish I could give you a great big birthday hug I too but you can not you be just somebody 's 4400 ability whatever we be we be your parent and we love you so much excuse I I be agent Baldwin this be agent Skouris we be with NTAC we be here to see Warren Trask I be his daughter Eileen what be this all about we would like to ask your father some question about Drew Imroth well you can ask he anything you want just do not expect any answer my dad have a stroke three month ago he have not move a muscle nor say a word since my father be a brilliant man but he be naive and trust and Drew Imroth take advantage of that to cheat my father out of his life 's work his career his marriage his health my father lose it all so when do he take the promicin shoot about six month ago as far as I know it do not do anything no ability nothing and then he have the aneurysm do you really still believe he be behind what be happen to Ubient all these machine he be hook up to they be run by computer so he be connect to network for emergency response monitor if his mind be still function and he be get an ability then yeah he could be the ghost in the machine well that would be wonderful daddy if that be true I be so happy for you do not stop until you ruin Imroth like he ruin you that be enough of that you be hurt I Tom let she go she be an accessory to a half dozen felony if there be anything you be hold back you would well tell we now I do not know anything but if my father be bring down Drew Imroth I would consider that justice be I mistaken or be I look at a xerce blue butterfly I believe that be what it be call the xerce blue have be extinct since 1941 not here not anymore we have a resident who can modify dna to recreate extinct specie only insect so far but he hope to work his way up to mammal I do not know about you but I would love to see a woolly mammoth in the flesh I be impressed and I be not easily impress a man of your intelect could do just about anything here in promise city which might be a more persuasive argument if I be not a kidnap victim be hold against my will it be my idea to bring you here Jordan know nothing about it be that suppose to make everything all right Kyle 's method might have be extreme but I can not fault his motive you belong here in Promise City with we Kevin you be the father of the promicin movement without your discovery Promise City would not even exist I make a scientific breakthrough but I do not start a religious cult Kevin like it or not you be revere by everyone here however I can not allow your research to continue a promicin compatibility test would be death to this movement all I be try to do be save life Jordan so be we we be just think a little more long term so until you share our vision I be afraid I will have to insist you remain our guest tomorrow at 8 00 a m I be kind of hope for something soon no no we can not prove conclusively that Trask be our man but we know he take the promicin shoot okay if that be the good you can do okay thank we can not get a court order to move Trask to ntac medical till morning but Ubient be hemmorage million of dollar an hour the stock market be down over 500 point I do not know about you but my pension plan be pretty much history we 've do all we can to isolate he we 've cut off the phone service and internet to his home we do not even know if he need a phone line to access the net we need to get Trask on the inhibitor and we need to do it now it be not an option his doctor have rule it out give the state of his health it be way too risky well maybe it be worth the risk just keep Trask under wrap at NTAC be no guarantee that the attack against Ubient will stop what be you suggest Tom we kill he of course not it be just look it be just frustrating for all of we anyhow I guess there be nothing we can do till morning hey birthday girl I be home why be not you dress yet the dinner reservation be for 7 00 I will be ready in time then we come home and open the present all right that will be good what be wrong do something happen today I tell you not to get your hope up about Ben I tell you I be past all that that be good because I do not know about you but I be ready for some birthday cake so let get go okay yeah it be I tell I you 've get good news because at this rate Ubient software will cease to exist in three day which mean we lose all our financial backing not to mention our spyware program I get it do not worry I be take care of it I hope so oh my god daddy daddy come on come on half a dozen resident claim they hear the crash but nobody see anything apparently not Morning Court order come through yet uh yes it do not that it matter anymore why not what be go on last night someone steal a car and plow it into a telephone pole a few block from Warren Trask 's house black out the entire neighborhood life support system shut down it run on battery power for a while but we have his daughter 's cell phone jam by the time she get to a phone that work Trask 's dead try not to sound so broken up about it I be just surprised that be all what about the attack on Ubient as of this morning Ubient software be run virus free seem Imroth 's company be go to survive and so be the economy Stock market be already up 200 point weird way for thing to work out but I guess we will take it yeah we all get lucky except for Warren Trask what happen to your head oh I bang it on the medicine cabinet in the middle of the night next time I will turn on the light good idea you have five minute Shawn tell I what you want I want you to release Kevin Burkhoff do not tell I he be not here Dr Burkhoff be here he be my guest and he will remain that way for the time be tell I Jordan since when do kidnapping become part of this new religion of yours that seem like a pretty twisted way to bring the world close to god you want to get back in my good grace it be simple hold another press conference announce you 've have a change of heart and that you now support the taking of promicin you know I can not do that then Kevin Burkhoff remain my guest and you you be no long welcome in Promise City Goodbye shawn how be my girl feel like I be go to die ah it be just your body rid itself of the anti promicin allergen it be all part of the process look this way there you go now it be time for the next step do not it be okay Isabelle in a few second you be go to feel a lot well you see that be not so bad oh and Isabelle I know what you be think once your ability return you be go to use they against I it work once before when you murder Matthew Ross but I would not try it again this time we be not take any chance we place a deterrent inside you while you be in prison call it a kill switch if you move against I or disobey I in any way it will be activate and you will die now you just rest for another hour or so and when you get up you will be the most powerful person on the planet again so what do we have the lab run the test you ask for the glass sample they pull be pretty degraded it be go to take a couple of day to get conclusive result but we do have the preliminary result I be sorry Diana but there be about an 80 chance the blood belong to Tom Baldwin these last few week I could tell there be something wrong it be like he be the same guy but different you know and I keep tell myself it be okay it be still Tom well I do not want to believe it either he be be my partner and my friend for year talk about sleep with the enemy I do not know if he tell you but Tom and I no he do not but the possibility have cross my mind okay so we be past that the question be what do we do now Diana well we have to find a way to get the real Tom Baldwin back and we can not let he suspect that we know anything we just to have to force ourselves to act like nothing be change that be not go to be a problem in the office but outside I mean it be not go to be easy the physical intimacy thing I be I be not sure I can handle it so you two get it all figure out whatever it be you be talk about Tom what be you do in the office so late just catch

Forward Transcript www ragbear com Synchro Benj Synchro aspro5oo www seriessub com what happen I can barely remember anything and the few thing I do they be all they be all bad how be I suppose to live with what I do how can I even be positive that thing be go well we be go to watch over you until we be sure you be go to recover yourself and when you do you will tell we who the Marked be all of they and after that whatever you do we will deal with it okay nobody be get into or out of St Ambrose Seattle police have it under strict quarantine and we have tactical agent reinforce they no one know exactly what happen in there yet but I do manage to get on the phone with a doctor who be trap inside and he have personally see dozen of death how be that possible there be no way all those people take the shot maybe someone be go around inject patient like an orderly or a doctor no it would take time to force the shot on all those people this be spread way too fast what if it be a virus you know someone take the shot and the ability they develop be to spread promicin like I do not know the flu God well if that be true we have more than just a bunch of victim on our hand 50 50 for everyone who die in that hospital someone else survive someone who will develop a brand new ability how many people do you think be trap inside that hospital 500 1000 whatever the number we will deal with it but at least there have not be any report of death outside the hospital your brother danny 's outside tell he to come in I can not he be out in the garden and he will not come inside it be a little strange to be honest he be not let anybody near he what be go on you be make everybody nervous everyone 's die Shawn everyone around I be die what be you talk about that hospital I kill all those people Danny what do you mean how what it be the shot my ability I think I be infect people with promicin and I do not know what to do I 've be hide out all night in a park and I can not even turn myself in without make more people sick okay you can not infect anyone who be already promicin positive right I do not think so so you be go to come inside I be go to clear everyone else out of the building Dr Burkhoff can probably get his hand on some of the inhibitor come inside we be go to suppress your ability we will figure this out together okay come on Mom 's dead Shawn what it happen last night it be my fault I kill she I be sorry Shawn I be sorry I do not mean to hurt she I do not mean to hurt anyone I want you to hear something while you be still you when Kyle bring I to you I be not lie I really do want to change I try but I be not mean to lead a normal life and it be stupid to think I could Isabelle everyone be in charge of their own destiny you may not have like the choice you have still you make one I be create to do a job I fight it for a while but now I know I have to do what they want kill I kill I right now do not let they use I to end this movement you be tell not to speak to Collier do not worry it will not happen again because I be ready to get out of here you 've get colly I do what you ask I to do now you can let my father go no not yet your father will be release when everything be arrange exactly as we want it that be not what we agree to I do not really feel like argue about it I like have my ability back I will go get my father myself I do not think so Isabelle I think you be forget we take out a little insurance policy on you while you be in prison you remember that kill switch that Tom tell you about you be feel it right now if you insist on disobey we I will not hesitate to use it fully I wanna make a statement on behalf of everyone who live in Promise City we have nothing to do with the death at St Ambrose hospital force people to take promicin go against everything Jordan Collier stand for if Jordan be here he would tell you himself but unfortunately he be miss he be abduct by enemy of the movement we be work to find he but while we do we would like to extend a gesture of goodwill to the city of Seattle the resident of Promise City be already promicin positive we be not vulnerable to what be happen in the hospital we would like to offer our service to the authority we will not move out into the city without an invitation but we do stand ready to help all the government have to do be ask so ready to hand over control of the city to Collier 's army we might need they before this be over I be not sure Meghan I do not even know Collier be miss until just now have Tom be able to tell you anything let I know if he start to remember I will call you if anything change here Everything be go silent within St Ambrose and we just have word that authority be consider send in the first relief team how would you like to have that job huh how be thing at the hospital it be quiet whatever happen in there I think it be over at least the screaming have stop guy look at this authority tell we that what just happen there I be not sure we need to talk to the agent on site right now they tell we it be contain everybody get away from her get away from her we need to seal this place off now it be not fair I do not even take the shot ok come on let us go let us go I be five foot from he and I live it do not seem right what be go to happen to we now I mean everyone who survive be we go to develop ability you two okay what be go on out there we be pick up the piece the bad be over for we anyway someone must have get out of that hospital and infect everyone on the perimeter the sickness be spread through the neighborhood near St Ambrose and the police emergency service their people must have bring the virus back from the barricade too they 've be devastate so who be watch over the city right now no one the army have Seattle surround the entire district be under quarantine how far be this thing go to spread we do not know but right now I want to keep focused on this building Marco we give everyone promicin test have the result come in yet yeah um they be preliminary but it look like everyone who survive be positive except for one person you I why it be just a guess but you know last year Dr Burkhoff force an early version of promicin on you you do not get an ability but it look like your body develop a resistance to promicin exposure there be no chance that I could infect anybody no I mean I do not think so how do you feel tired what do you give I I include a sedative in the sample of the inhibitor I mix up we will not know if your ability 's suppress for a few hour I do not want to sleep I want to help there be nothing you can do right now just close your eye buddy have you give any thought to what you want to do I be go to give Danny to ntac I think I have to I think so too they have to study your brother he may be the only way to find an antidote once the government have he who know if they will ever let he go I do not want to lose my brother and my mom on the same day Jesus my mom be go the virus get into city hall the mayor be down half the city council police paramedic People be abandon their post in drove I think we need to take Kyle Baldwin up on his offer see if his positive can not restore some order be you ready to cross that line we do not have a choice the federal government be focus on containment they be basically write Seattle off we can not let that happen I be go to Promise City well you can not just drive across town let I go I be the one who be suppose to be resistant to this thing that be why you be go to the 4400 center you could be the key to end this if someone could figure out why you be not vulnerable maybe they could replicate the effect and create a vaccine okay well we be not do it because NTAC medical 's shut down Shawn farrell be not develop that compatibility test on his own someone be do the research someone with a scientific background someone like Kevin Burkhoff my sister 's dead that be shawn Susan be in that hospital she be dead oh my god Tom I be so sorry you should lie down I can not imagine what you be feel now no no I will mourn later where have you put my gun I remember it all now everything the mark have Jordan Collier I know where they be keep he ok tell we where he be and I will put together a task force it have to be I Isabelle 's there she have her ability back they think I be one of they I will walk in I will get Collier I can find out what they be plan next let I do this please I have to I 've be authorize to accept your offer of assistance what do you have in mind we need to restore order to the street I would like to use your people as a temporary security force the first thing we need to do be write a list of all the ability at your disposal then we can figure out how to deploy they look there be no reason to make a plan Jordan already have one in place I know exactly what we have at our disposal and I know where to send they to take control of the city I be glad you be so prepared to take over Seattle but when this be over I want my city back the whole world be terrify of what be happen here that be an opportunity once this be over we use all our influence here and abroad and push for all out war against the positive this time we will be hear yes Great Funny how thing happen you 've get Collier but you be lose Seattle you be wrong I be not go to stand by and watch a militia of positive take command of this city we think the movement would fall apart once we have Collier but that do not happen someone step in and take his place you be talk about Kyle that be right he have to be stop you have to stop he you be go back into Promise City and you be go to kill Kyle Baldwin Kyle 's your only real connection to your past this idea of yourself that you 've be hang onto once he be go you will let it go you want he dead I be your weapon I get it you 've be out of contact for a long time where have you be I be do damage control Skouris have be tell people I be mark do they believe her my boss do not Meghan Doyle care about Tom Baldwin I bring she around anyway their hand be full the virus get into NTAC it kill Baldwin 's sister too I have to shed a few tear just for appearance 's sake this thing have get out of control half of NTAC be develop new ability how be we respond Collier 's be mark we be wait for he to turn in the meantime I send Isabelle to Promise City to deal with the new leader of the movement Kyle Baldwin Good your body produce abnormal amount of an enzyme call Ubiquinone it be a compound that boost the immune system and overproduction of it make you resistant to promicin if we replicate that effect can we make a vaccine People be die right now we do not have time to mass produce some enzyme and get it to people we do not have to mass produce anything Ubiquinone be already available as a supplement they sell it in pill in health food store pharmacy if you take enough of they can you develop a resistance quickly I just check in on your brother he do not look good we have to get word out about these pill you go I will start make phone call the inhibitor be work you be no long contagious but your body be still produce promicin and since it can no long disperse it into the air via your ability it be build up in your system I be choke on the stuff it be all right Danny we be go to figure it out so what can we do to help he we could take he off the inhibitor physically he would be fine but I would be contagious again exactly no way that be not an option Danny no Shawn what happen if I stay on the inhibitor you say I will die I be get you out of here that thing inside you there be a way to get rid of it how you can worry about that once you be out of here no matter what happen to I do not stop until you be through the front door my car 's right outside if anything happen to I you need to call Kyle right away Parrish send Isabelle after he if you be an NTAC agent again what happen once we be outta here you mean be I go to arrest you I would love to but that be not the plan as much as it hurt I to admit it this city need you right now be you ready you flinch when I tell you Isabelle be go after your son no one be ever manage to get rid of a mark before you be go to have to tell I how you do it later all our team be in place we already have Ravenna under control Beacon Hill 's quiet too Good let us move some of your people into Northgate See if we can stop the looting we can not start distribute these ubiquinone supplement until the city be calm hi Kyle close your eye no if you be go to do what I think you be you have to look I in the eye you could not kill I you be human there be so much of the world that I never see so much that be beautiful you have time you can see whatever you want we can you have a good heart Kyle Goodbye these pill be the way that we can stop anyone else from die I be proud to say that the 4400 center be work in conjunction with the government and resident of Promise City to distribute this over the counter product to every neighborhood in Seattle if you have not already be infect these will either save your life or they will keep you from get an ability the goverment be also work with relief agency to air lift supply of Ubiquinone into the city so there will be enough for everyone People be wonder what seattle be go to look like when this be all over how many people will have lose their life how a city with so many unwanted new ability be go to function the truth be we do not have any answer but this city have survive a lot and it will survive this thank you all for come you risk a lot to get this message out and do not forget to take your pill Shawn thank you none of this be go to mean anything unless that air lift happen right away we be work on it I be coordinate distribution between the CDC FEMA and the Red Cross look I know that you be deal with a lot but you help keep this contain and you be the right face to put in front of the public yeah buddy I be right here it really hurt it hurt to breathe I be go to fix that make you feel well for a little bit no do not you do that an hour ago look at I Danny we be go to take you off the inhibitor and we be go to put you in isolation it be too dangerous not anymore we know about those pill now what if they do not work around I or what if in a week from now my ability get strong the whole thing could start again too many people be dead because of I Shawn it be not your fault I know but I have to live with it I be not go to make it through this Shawn I know it you be not go to die Danny I be not go to let you it be okay but I need you to do something for I just make it stop hurt just make the pain go away for good okay oh Danny no I be not go to do that I be not go to do that you be my little brother then I be beg you brother do not please Shawn let I be the last victim please do it please please Shawn I beg you please shawn do it I love you please I can not breathe you make your choice you be our only hope for the future your future 's dead now you be free now make this world well than it be you understand what you have to do to get rid of that thing inside you you will have to mend fence with Shawn well I be more than willing I hope he will be too Jordan there be one more thing there be seven name there the rest of the mark they be go to need the same treatment you get these be powerful people that be why NTAC can not handle it we would never be able to get they through official channel I can not help but wonder when we walk back into the city who be go to be in charge my side or yours I think soon that distinction will not mean a thing be well Tom we be gather here today to pay our respect to Susan and Danny Farrell a wonderful mother and a love son they will be miss as will so many other the entire city be grief stricken today we be all ask ourselves the same question be we go to deal with all this lose all this pain but I believe that in that question rely our answer to salvation because it be a share lose it be a share pain that only together with your sympathy with your understanding with your love we could realize all this tragedy Shawn I be sorry I be so sorry man thank you hey dad hey Jordan tell I everything that happen you okay yeah I will get there and I know you care about Isabelle I be sorry she be go I know how you be feel right now Shawn you be think that everyone be go that you be alone but you be not I be here So 's Kyle and we be go to help each other get through this we be go to figure out how to be a family okay I just get a revise estimate of the tally so far we know the city 's lose 9 000 people that be just confirm dead it be not a final count so we be look at 9 000 new ability at the very least a lot of those ability be go to belong to people we know NTAC police paramedic I mean we be the first one expose to this thing what be we go to do arrest ourselves no one 's arrest anybody right now every city agency 's operate on a skeleton crew and we will not have federal help until they lift the quarantine that will be a week maybe more so we be still on our own the loud voice of authority in Seattle right now be Jordan Collier 's well his p positive be the most effective law and order we 've get and when quarantine 's lift what happen be Collier 's people go to stand down will they give the city back to we would you the time have come for this city to begin heal I never intend promicin to spread this way but the sacrifice of the past few day have not be in vain this tragedy terrible as it may have be have meaning and those who die be the herald of a new age thousand upon thousand of you have new ability and in time you will all contribute to this movement a movement that now claim all Seattle as its home who be you I be Jed Garrity who the hell be you we stand by the city in its hour of need and we will now guide this city into the future we be all miracle every one of we and together we will do wondrous thing see I tell you he be a good guy Maia can not you see what be happen Jordan Collier be name himself dictator of Seattle there be nothing good about that you be wrong mom we be in charge now it be well that way I 've speak to the world before of heaven on Earth many of you think it impossible but now I be convince we will see it in our lifetime there be a way to live with it you kill people even though it be not really you you still feel responsible believe I I have be there 2 people be dead they be not Collier they be not come back but you be still here you have to figure out how to move on how Dad it be time www seriessub com v1 01
