this be the orientation film for station 3 of the Dharma Initiative in a moment you will be give a simple set of instruction for how you and your partner will fulfill the responsibility associate with this station but first a little history the Dharma Initiative be create in 1970 and be the brainchild of Gerald and Karen Degroot two doctoral candidate at the university of Michigan follow in the footstep of visionary such as B F Skinner imagine a large scale communal research compound where scientist and free thinker from around the globe could pursue research in meteorology psychology parapsychology zoology electromagnetism and utopian social reclusive danish industrialist and munition magnate Alvar Hanso whose financial backing make their dream of a multipurpose social science research facility a reality you and your partner be currently locate in station 3 or the swan and will be for the next 540 day now station 3 be originally construct as a laboratory where scientist could work to understand the unique electromagnetic fluctuation emanate from this sector of the island not long after the experiment begin however there be an incident and since that time the follow protocol have be observe every 108 minute the button must be push from the moment the alarm sound you will have four minute to enter the code into the microcomputer processor induction into the program when the alarm sound either you or your partner must input the code it be highly recommend that you and your partner take alternate shift in this manner you will both stay as fresh and alert utmost importance that when the alarm sound the code be enter correctly and in a timely fashion now do not attempt to use the computer for any congratulation until your replacement arrive the future of the project be in your hand on behalf of the Degroots Alvar Hanso and all of we at the Dharma Initiative thank you Namaste and good luck we be go to need to watch that again what be that it be a present it be be six month it be sort of an anniversary right I do not get you anything that be okay it only cost I a buck it be to my place think you might be tired of knock well Helen I do not know

right all right Kate from the moment the alarm sound you will have four minute to enter the code into the microcomputer processor Induction into the program when the alarm sound either you or your

an incident what about all the miss piece oh you mean the splice yeah just a frame here and there I think nothing important what do you think about the film what do you think I be sorry I miss it her funeral I I have to be with Sawyer so why be not you with he now 'cause I be go crazy do you believe in ghost Sayid I see Walt in the jungle just before Shannon be shoot do that make I crazy it be a

leak Come on it be amateur hour from top to bottom it sound like you 've get it all figure out I do have you all figure out you do not know anything about I White trash mom divorce dad start up with

man name Josiah boy when you say begin you mean begin at that time the temple where the people worship be in ruin and so the people worship idol false god and so the kingdom be in disarray Josiah since he be a good king send his secretary to the treasury and say we must rebuild the temple give all of the gold to the worker so that this will be do but when the secretary return he have no gold and when Josiah ask why this be the secretary reply we find a book do you know this story no afraid I do not what the secretary have find be an ancient book the book of law you may know it as the Old Testament and it be with that ancient book not with the gold that Josiah rebuild the temple on the other side of the island we find a place much like this and in this place we find a book I believe what be inside there will be of great value to you hey so Rose 's husband 's white do not see that one come be there something you need Hurley no just take a walk think I would say hey who be take care of Sawyer Sun be so you be like mad at he why would I be mad at Sawyer maybe 'cause he be the one always come down here and chop wood and now you be it be like transference what be you a shrink

the truth why would he lie to we because I believe a father would do anything for his son because I believe that Michael may have free Henry and because I believe he be lead you into a trap you believe a lot sayid and I also believe that Henry be one of they all right let us go talk to he no he must continue to believe he be in control why the hell would we want to do that so we can create an advantage how I do not know yet but we have one more night to figure that out Ana Lucia Cortez be before we crash she be a police officer I do not think it be easy for she be here but I think she

Initiative they be very secretive very rich and very smart so when do you come to the island 11 year now I like computer communication equipment and be alone like a lighthouse keeper so they put I in this station they call it the Flame what be the purpose of the Flame to communicate with the outside world of course ready to play your move what happen to the Dharma Initiative they be all dead of course they foolishly initiate a war against the hostile a purge they call it and how do you survive this purge by not participate in it I tell you I like be alone and the hostile allow you to stay here after it be over four man appear in the yard they offer a truce they say to imagine a line that extend all the way around the valley as long as I do not cross it I would be leave alone then they

attack your people believe what you want but that be what happen your friend do he kill they they be collect whatever may be useful from the farmhouse and now we have our ticket to where the other live where we will find your daughter and Jack and finally perhaps a way home there be nothing you could do to I that would make I lead you there I do not say you be our ticket do I this be a map show electrical and datum cable run from the Flame here to a place call the Barracks here it be comprise of house and dormitory with water and power large enough to accommodate an entire community sound like a place well worth visit do not you think there will come a time when your guard be down and when it be I will not hesitate a moment before kill you you should know this before he be make an excellent point you have a map why keep he alive after my husband and I first arrive to Paris I be afraid to ever leave our apartment so I would stare out the window into the alley and I would see this cat look for scrap one day some child come into the alley and trap he in a box I watch they light firecracker and drop they in the box I could hear he howl from three story above so finally I have a reason to leave my apartment I rescue this cat and I bring he home he sit with I when I read he sleep with I and he purr but every once in a while he will bite I or scratch I he do this because sometimes he forget that he be safe now so I forve he when he bite I because I know what it be like to never feel safe and that be because of you so today I ask only one thing of you I ask you now that you show I the respect of acknowledge what you do to I that it be you who question I that torture I and that you rember I I remember you I remember your face your face have haunt I ever since I leave Iraq I be sorry I be so sorry for what I do to you I be I forgive you when my husband return I will tell he I make a terrible mistake that it be not you and he will release you why why be you

decide his fate I can see you do not find anything worth take actually I just play that silly chess game again and now I realize why you do not want I to beat it mean what what have you do John that place be our one hope of communication with the outside world the computer say if there be an incursion by the hostile I should enter 7 7 so I enter 7 7 we should go if anyone be around this explosion

submarine and it be a 1 way ticket the anomaly wipe out our communication we have no way of contact the outside world which mean when that sub leave it can never come back so whether you destroy the submarine or whether you let it go the end result be the same no one will find this island let us go Come on you know he be manipulate you right how be that that be what my father do he manipulate people he make you think it be your idea but it be his I will have to keep that in mind Submarine be down there at the end of the dock I be sorry I have to involve you in this look I know you do not owe I anything but I need to ask you for one last favor you do not knock I need you to let my friend go after I be go and if I say no would that stop you from leave of course it would your friend be only here to rescue you but you seem to be do a good job of rescue yourself so I suppose there be no reason to keep they here do I have your word on that you have my word I will let they go just as soon as you 've leave the island well I guess this be it thank you Ben for keep your promise hold it right there get your hand up get down I say get down what be you do here John I be sorry Jack Sorry

he may not want to be rescue that be not he that be not Jack they must have do someûthe to he when they capture we they drug we he do not appear to be drug they kidnap he hold he prisoner he would not just forget that I agree but until we know why we be put our life at risk I be not leave he Sayid we may not have a choice it be Jack the first time I see he he be risk his life pull people out of burn airplane wreckage if he be shake hand with the other I be sure he have a good reason we just have to go down there and find out what it be what do you suggest we wait till it be dark we approach

on the plane the census I interview everyone one of they be not in the manifest he be not on the plane so he improvise hello there he kidnap she on his own that be never the plan look I know how this

in the next 24 hour we will be ready by tomorrow night we need to talk about Naomi 's phone not now if you be angry I doubt you I would be happy to make a sincere apology later but now we have a means look I be a little bit busy right now and I be try to get we off this island I can not transmit use this phone because Danielle 's distress signal be override the frequency if you tell I where the radio tower be I can go there switch off your message and call for help my signal have be play for the last 16 year and nobody have hear it why do you think you will have well luck Naomi 's boat be only 80 mile offshore I know if we eliminate Danielle 's signal they will hear we no they will not and why be that we be jam it what Ben be use one of the Dharma station to block all of the signal off of the island except for ours what station they call it the look Glass the look glass yes but it be underwater I have no idea where it be I believe I do look I know I know Jack think it be good but you know what if they be come for he again Claire listen to I I be go to protect you I be go to protect Aaron I promise look everything be go to be fine sorry can you give I a hand with something of course so you ready to tell I what you see this morning Aye right so how do it happen this time come on Des you can tell I I can take it what I see Charlie be Claire and her baby get into a helicopter a helicopter that that lift off leave this island you sure Aye rescue helicopter on this beach this island that be what you see we be get bloody rescue I think you be go to tell I I be go to die again you be Charlie wait what if you do not none of it will happen there will not be any rescue I be sorry brother but this time this time you have to die come on come on Charlie Jump in I be go to catch you boy no you be just go to back away do not be daft Jump in I promise Charlie I be go to catch you no he will not Zip it you look do not listen to your brother just jump on in there be nothing to be afraid of Charlie I will catch you I promise I do it you get it I do it you be swim Charlie what you write nothing all right tell I be you sure you want to know I mean it might be easy if you just I want to know you be inside a hatch it be a room full of equipment there be a blink yellow light above a switch you flip the switch Light go off and then you drown when I do not know you be sure you see Claire and Aaron get on that helicopter Aye so before I drown I just have to flip a switch that be right where be it then now this be the Looking Glass it be an underwater Dharma station please can you tell I anything you might know about this place I 've never be down there I do not know anyone who have why not there be some accident Ben tell we that the station be completely flood well if it be flood then how do it still work how it still work be irrelevant the question be how do we get it to stop work so we could use the satellite phone the diagram show that the look glass be connect to the island by a cable I feel sure that this be the very same cable down the beach which run into the ocean so if we follow the cable it should lead we to the station so how be we go to get in we swim in there be a moon pool a room with an open floor at the base of the station big enough for a submarine to dock even if the station 's flood I think I will be able to find the relay switch and disable it what about swim back out no I be not let you go on some suicide mission just to flip the switch someone have to do it or we will never leave this island I will do it I can swim down turn off that bloody switch swim back up Piece of cake Charlie you do not even know what we be talk about I be junior swim champion in northern England I can hold my breath for 4 minute I know exactly what you be talk about no and there be no reason to do this now we be go to focus on the other and then we will deal with this wait a minute we have a chance to signal for a rescue look for 90 day I 've be

frequency if you tell I where the radio tower be I can go there switch off your message and call for help my signal have be play for the last 16 year and nobody have hear it why do you think you will have well luck Naomi 's boat be only 80 mile offshore I know if we eliminate Danielle 's signal they will hear we no they will not and why be that we be jam it what Ben be use one of the Dharma station to block all of the signal off of the island except for ours what station they call it the look Glass the look glass yes but it be underwater I have no idea where it be I believe I do look I

the diagram show that the look glass be connect to the island by a cable I feel sure that this be the very same cable down the beach which run into the ocean so if we follow the cable it should lead we to the station so how be we go to get in we swim in there be a moon pool a room with an open floor at the base of the station big enough for a submarine to dock even if the station 's flood I think I will be able to find the relay switch and disable it what about swim back out no I be not let you go on some suicide mission just to flip the switch someone have to do it or we will never leave this island I will do it I can swim down turn off that bloody switch swim back up Piece of cake Charlie you do not even know what we be talk about I be junior swim champion in northern England I can hold

life in the military and after year of conduct unpleasant action against our enemy I find myself want to do something good so I reply to a newspaper advertisement an advertisement would you like toave the world it read that be how I meet the Initiative they be very secretive very rich and very smart so when do you come to the island 11 year now I like computer communication equipment and be alone like a lighthouse keeper so they put I in this station they call it the Flame what be the purpose of the Flame to communicate with the outside world of course ready to play your move what happen to the Dharma Initiative they be all dead of course they foolishly initiate a war against the hostile a purge they call it and how do you survive this purge by not participate in it I tell you I like be alone and the hostile allow you to stay here after it be over four man appear in the yard they offer a truce they say to imagine a line that extend all the way around the valley as long as I do not cross it I would be leave alone then they take two cow and I never see they again they be not interested in the satellite dish in the yard why would they be it have not function for year who be they these hostile I do not know but they be here for a long time before we be a very long time I be look for Sami I be so glad you come what do you think it be a simple place as you can see but we have

walk around the station this be the hub but they go underground to various station all over the island and these cable do any of they run into the ocean yes there be an underwater beacon that emit sonar ping to help guide in the vessel by vessel you mean submarine yes the Initiative use one to bring we here but I can imagine only that the hostile have either destroy or commandeer it by now that explain how they be able to get round my position and capture our sailboat you have a sailboat till we lose it to your hostile that be very unfortunate well at least we be able to kill one they why be we continue to play this little game when we all know it have move to the next stage get some rope Drink you be a torturer be you not in the Republican Guard do you not recognize one of your victim do

member of the dharma initiative or be everything you say a lie of course I be waste my breath I be never a member but everything else I tell you be true I move into the station after the purge the purge in which a group of scientist attack your people believe what you want but that be what happen your friend do he kill they they be collect whatever may be useful from the farmhouse and now we have our ticket to where the other live where we will find your daughter and Jack and finally perhaps a way home there be nothing you could do to I that would make I lead you there I do not say you be our ticket do I this be a map show electrical and datum cable run from the Flame here to a place call the Barracks here it be comprise of house and dormitory with water and power large enough to accommodate an entire community sound like a place well worth visit do not you think there will come a time when your guard be down and when it be I will not hesitate a moment before kill you you should know this before he be make an excellent point you have a map why keep he alive after my husband and I first arrive to Paris I be afraid to ever leave our apartment so I would stare out the window into the alley and I would see this cat look for scrap one day some child come into the alley and trap he in a box I watch they light firecracker and drop they in the box I could hear he howl from three story above so finally I have a reason to leave my apartment I rescue this cat and I bring he home he sit with I when I read he sleep with I and he purr but every once in a while he will bite I or scratch I he do this because sometimes he forget that he be safe now so I forve he when he bite I because I know what it be like to never feel safe and that be because of you so today I ask only one thing of you I ask you now that you show I the respect of acknowledge what you do to I that it be you who question I that torture I and that you rember I I remember you I remember your face your face have haunt I ever since I leave Iraq I be sorry I be so sorry for what I do to you I be I forgive you when my husband return I will tell he I make a terrible mistake that it be not you and he will release you why why be you let I go we be all capable of do what those child do to this cat but I will not do that I will not be that we should kill he Sayid he already tell we that he would kill we he be my prisoner I will decide his fate I can see you do not find anything worth take actually I just play that silly chess game again and now I realize why you do not want I to beat it mean what what have you do John that place be our one hope of communication with the outside world the computer say if there be an incursion by the hostile I should enter 7 7 so I enter 7 7 we should go if anyone be around this explosion be go to attract their attention previously on Lost I do not care what Jack say they 've get he we have to get he back I owe he that the man in the house you say you see he before on the video feed from the pearl station why be we continue to play this little game when we all know it have move to the next stage this be a map show electrical and datum cable

really be so ask I now now that I know who you really be be it immediate it start the moment you get here and you be just walk the feeling return right after the crash that day that be what immediate mean Ben you be wonder why it have not happen for you you be not recover as fast as you like how long be it be since Jack fix you a week now that I think about it how do you get sick in the first place be you afraid it will go away John be that why you want to destroy the submarine 'cause you know if you leave the island you will be back in the chair you get anything to eat go on home kid you know you be not suppose to be here my father send I to get his pack why I do not know Ryan but he tell I to get it all right here you go you be Alex be not you hey can it how do you know my name because you look like your mother my mother be dead I be sure that be what they tell you get go Alex keep your mouth shut where do you get electricity we have two giant hamster run on a massive wheel at our secret underground lair yeah that be funny there ' leftover in the refrigerator help yourself I eat most of the dark meat sorry I never really appreciate chicken until right now I know you think you need to do this John but if you blow up my submarine I will have a big problem with my people be that suppose to be an incentive not to blow it up I be bear on this island not many of my people can say that Most of they be recruit and bring here and as much as they love this place as much as they would do anything to defend it they need to know they can leave if they want to the sub maintain that illusion so you be lie to them no they be here because they want to be here some of they be just not ready to make a full commitment yet but you John you 've already make that commitment and now you have a choice because if you stop and if you think I can show you thing thing I know you want to see very badly let I put it so you will understand Picture a box you know something about box do not you John what if I tell you that somewhere on this island there be a very large box and whatever you imagine whatever you want to be in it when you open at box there it would be what would you say about that John I would say I hope that box be big enough to imagine yourself up a new submarine why be you so angry John because you be cheat you and your people communicate with the outside world whenever you want to you come and go as you please you use electricity and run water and gun you be a hypocrite a Pharisee you do not deserve to be on this island if you have any idea what this place really be you would not be put chicken in your refrigerator you 've be here 80 day John I 've be here my entire life so how be it that you think you know this island well than I do because you be in the wheelchair and I be not do you have any problem okay here be how this be go to work she be go to take I to the sub once we be there I let she go John she be do enough let I take you I do not want you to slow I down come on let us go John before you go you should know Jack and I make a deal in less than an hour he be leave this island on that submarine and it be a 1 way ticket the anomaly wipe out our communication we have no way of contact the outside world which mean when that sub leave it can never come back so whether you destroy the submarine or whether you let it go the end result be the same no one will find this island let us go Come on you know he be manipulate you right how be that that be what my father do he manipulate people he make you think it be your idea but it be his I will have to keep that in mind Submarine be down there at the end of the dock I be sorry I have to involve you in this look I know you do not owe I anything but I need to ask you for one last favor you do not knock I need you to let my friend go after I be go and if I say no would that stop you from leave of course it would your friend be only here to rescue you but you seem to be do a good job of rescue yourself so I suppose there be no reason to keep they here do I have your word on that you have my word I will let they go just as soon as you 've leave the island well I guess this be it thank you Ben for keep your promise hold it right there get your hand up get down I say get down what be you do here John I be sorry Jack Sorry for what what do you do tell I you do not do it what be you talk about tell I that you do not kill that kid what you think I have something to do with Peter 's death I tell you to end thing with his mother and the next thing you know he be dead John now calm down please think about what you be say why would I kill Peter he be on to you I 've be do this for a long time I be not sweat some rich kid then why be you still here what do you mean I tell you to leave you tell I you be go to leave town why be you still here now listen John I will be honest with you I do not end it I be look for an angle I want to make some money before I skip out but then all this happen Peter die and everything just go straight into the tank she be devastate she be call off the wedding there be no profit in it John I be a con man not a murder she call off the wedding she say she could not deal with it she need to be alone so if I be to call she right now that be what she would tell I Phone 's right over there John what be her numb Mr Locke we know this be not what you want to hear but your father 's go we know he flee to Mexico shortly after your encounter then he disappear I be sorry but he could be anywhere in the world right now all right detective that be enough Mr Locke have work to do today we will let you know if anything develop we have get ourselves quite a day ahead of we my friend it be finally time to get you up out of that bed no I do not want to I do not remember ask now Most people struggle with this at first but do not worry you will get use to it no please I can not do this you fall eight story and survive I do not want to hear

well John you 've really go and do it now you do not have to pretend to be disappoint anymore we both know you want it to happen that be why you leave the c4 in Sayid 's bag because you want I to make it happen Uncuff he please Richard you go to do anything stupid no sir do you remember early John when you call I a cheater when you say I do not deserve to live on this island well get this there I be shake hand with Jack and think I would give almost anything to come up with a way to stop he from leave because to let he go would be a sign a weakness of failure of defeat my people would see that they would know it and that John would be the end of I but to kill he that would be cheat because my people also hear I make a promise and to break my word that would be the end of I too and then you came stride out of the jungle John to you make my dream come true you be not go to start talk about the magic box again be you I be go to show you what come out of it when I ask you early if it hurt when you suffer your injury I think you misunderstood I it seem fairly obvious that when a person 's back smash into a hard surface after be throw from a building that be go to ste a little but I really be not ask about the physical pain what do you want to know if it hurt my feeling no John I want to know what it feel like when your own father try to kill you he be the reason you destroy the submarine be not he you be afraid you be afraid of he and this be the one place he can never find you this be the one place he can never get to what do you want from I I do not know how it happen but you seem to have some communion with this island John and that make you very very important you have no idea what you be talk about of course but in time you will have a well understanding of thing so

distance I can get people to start strip the plane wreckage good I should be able to finish rig these tent in the next 24 hour we will be ready by tomorrow night we need to talk about Naomi 's phone not now if you be angry I doubt you I would be happy to make a sincere apology later but now we have a means look I be a little bit busy right now and I be try to get we off this island I can not transmit use this phone because Danielle 's distress signal be override the frequency if you tell I where the radio tower be I can go there switch off your message and call for help my signal have be play for the last 16 year and nobody have hear it why do you think you will have well luck Naomi 's boat be only 80 mile offshore I know if we eliminate Danielle 's signal they will hear we no they will not and why be that we be jam it what Ben be use one of the Dharma station to block all of the signal off of the island except for ours what station they call it the look Glass the look glass yes but it be underwater I have no idea where it be I believe I do look I know I know Jack think it be good but you know what if they be come for he again Claire listen to I I be go to protect you I be go to protect Aaron I promise look everything be go to be fine sorry can you give I a hand with something of course so you ready to tell I what you see this morning Aye right so how do it happen this time come on Des you can tell I I can take it what I see Charlie be Claire and her baby get into a helicopter a helicopter that that lift off leave this island you sure Aye rescue helicopter on this beach this island that be what you see we be get bloody rescue I think you be go to tell I I be go to die again you be Charlie wait what if you do not none of it will happen there will not be any rescue I be sorry brother but this time this time you have to die come on come on Charlie Jump in I be go to catch you boy no you be just go to back away do not be daft Jump in I promise Charlie I be go to catch you no he will not Zip it you look do not listen to your brother just jump on in there be nothing to be afraid of Charlie I will catch you I promise I do it you get it I do it you be swim Charlie what you write nothing all right tell I be you sure you want to know I mean it might be easy if you just I want to know you be inside a hatch it be a room full of equipment there be a blink yellow light above a switch you flip the switch Light go off and then you drown when I do not know you be sure you see Claire and Aaron get on that helicopter Aye so before I drown I just have to flip a switch that be right where be it then now this be the Looking Glass it be an underwater Dharma station please can you tell I anything you might know about this place I 've never be down there I do not know anyone who have why not there be some accident Ben tell we that the station be completely flood well if it be flood then how do it still work how it still work be irrelevant the question be how do we get it to stop work so we could use the satellite phone the diagram show that the look glass be connect to the island by a cable I feel sure that this be the very same cable down the beach

you hear whisper you run the other way what be that just something sentimental so this be your old office huh I never picture you lead your people from behind a desk it seem a little corporate be there something that you need John well Ben I be hope that you and I could talk about the elephant in the room I assume you be refer to the fact that I kill you yeah it be the only way to get you back to the island along with as many of those who leave as possible you do remember John that be why you leave in the first place to convince them to come back but you fail and the only way to bring they together be by your death and you understand that it be why you be about to kill yourself when I stop you if all I have to do be die Ben then why do you stop I you have critical information that would 've die with you and once you have give it to I well I just do not have time to talk you back into hang yourself so I take a shortcut and look at you John I be right you be here you be back so be the rest of they I do not know where yet exactly but they come it work and that be why I do it because it be in the good interest of the island I be just hope for an apology I 've decide to help you Ben help I do what do what you say you be on your way to do be judge that be not something you want to see John if everything you 've do have be in the good interest of the island then I be sure the monster will understand let us go what be you do we be take a boat where over to the main island I do not think so my friend be these your boat be they yours Caesar right I be under the impression these be find here so I be just go to borrow one I be happy to leave the other boat for you in case you want to follow we Us be you go with he he do not really give I a choice I be sorry but I be call the shot here and I say you be not take anything what you be go to do be to sit down and tell we how you know so much about this island my friend you be in the habit of call people friend but I do not think you mean it step away from the boat no I be not go to step away from the boat I be go to take it and you be go to let I my friend you be not take anything you look for this this gentleman and I be take a boat do anyone else have a problem with that consider that my apology home sweet home look like we be not the first one who decide to tie up here that would be Sun and Lapidus I show them where the boat be and Sun thank I by smash I on the head with a paddle oh be she the one that hurt your arm I notice you be favor it on the way over no someone else hurt my arm you just make friend everywhere you go do not ya well I 've find sometimes that friend can be significantly more dangerous than enemy John be that why you shoot an unarmed man in the chest the man be unarmed because I have steal his gun the gun he be go to use to kill you I could not let that happen no sense in I die twice right you be welcome we be go to your old house be not we yes it be the only place I can summon it the monster once it arrive I will either be forgive or I will not I think you be lie lie about what that you want to be judge for leave the island and come back because it be against the rule I do not think you care about rule then what do I want to be judge for John for kill your daughter do you do it we have a complication I be sorry be that a baby your order be to exterminate that woman why she be no threat to we she be insane Charles besides you do not tell I she have a child what be it I be suppose to do kill it it be not an it this be a child you might find this difficult to understand Benjamin every decision I 've make have be about protect this island be kill this baby what Jacob want then here she be you do it so whose idea be it to move into these house excuse I well your people be live in the jungle and then after you murder the Dharma folk you relocate here I just wonder if it be your idea do you disapprove John it just do not seem like something the island would want you do not have the first idea what this island want be you sure about that that be your house be not it yes and that be Alex 's room well I suppose you well go over there and check it out Sun what be you do here this use to be my house I see a light turn on what be the two of you do in here that be take in 1977 be you try to tell I that your friend be in the Dharma Initiative you do not know about this of course not where do you get this who give this to you we meet some crazy old man outside he say his name be Christian he tell we to come in here and wait wait for what he say if I ever want to see my husband again I have to wait here for John Locke but consider he be dead we be not hold our breath well you might want to look outside what you be say it be impossible but here I be I do not know how I do not know why but I be sure there be a very good reason for it as long as the dead guy say there be a reason well then I guess everything be go to be just peachy and forget about the fact that the rest of your people be supposedly 30 year ago now the only one who be here to help we be a murderer and a guy who can not seem to remember how the hell he get out of a coffin Sun please let us just go back to the plane see if I can fix the radio and maybe we can get some help if you leave with he you will never find your husband again I be all the help you need be you say you know how to find they how to find Jin I have some idea I be sorry to say but I be leave with or without you if there be any chance of find my husband then I have to stay all right for god 's sake watch your back all right how do we find Jin Ben have something to do first be not that right Ben yes John that be right better get to it then I will be outside again daddy again okay okay wow Alex any high and you be go to fly right off the island the sub be about to leave high daddy high all right you do not have to see he off Ben yes Richard I do high high daddy Charles I come to say good bye no you do not you come to gloat no do not act as if I want this you bring this on yourself be you quite certain you want to do this Benjamin you leave the island regularly you have a daughter with an outsider you break the rule Charles and what make you think you deserve to take what be mine because I will not be selfish because I will sacrifice anything to protect this island you would not sacrifice Alex you be the one who want her dead Charles not the island I hope you be right Benjamin because if you be not and it be the island that want she dead she will be dead and one day you will be stand where I be stand now you will be the one be banish and then you will finally realize that you can not fight the inevitable I will be see you boy where do John go he say he have something to do do he say what it be no I do not ask Jack must have lie excuse I about Locke be dead I do not know why he would but that be the only explanation Jack do not lie John be dead just because he be in a coffin do not mean that he could not have fake his dea trust I I be sure so you know this would happen to Locke if we bring he back here Sun I have no idea it would happen I 've see this island do miraculous thing I 've see it heal the sick but never once have it do anything like this Dead be dead you do not get to come back from that not even here so the fact that John Locke be walk around this island scare the live hell out of I you may want to go inside why because what be about to come out of that jungle be something I can not control any luck it have not show up yet last time we do not have to wait this long it be not a train John it do not run on a schedule well if it be not go to come to we then I suppose we will have to go to it it do not work that way I only know how to summon it I do not know where it actually be I do it be weird for I too excuse I I realize how strange this all be I here but I assure you Sun I be the same man I 've always be be you ready lead the way hello Charles it be Benjamin how do you get this number do not matter what matter be I be go back to the island today the island will not let you come back trust I I 've spend almost 20 year try to return well Charles where you fail I be go to succeed just as soon as I do one thing and what be that Benjamin kill your daughter in fact I be look at our Mutual Friend right now I do not know what you be talk about it be the name of the boat that Penny 's on do not you dare good bye Charles may I ask you a question John Shoot how be it that you know where you be go I just know I mean how do that work exactly how do what work the knowing I mean do it come upon you gradually or do you wake up one morning suddenly understand the mystery of the universe you do not like this do you what have to ask question that you do not know the answer to blindly follow someone in the hope that they will lead you to whatever it be you be look for no John I do not like it at all well now you know what it be like to be I we should keep move yes we should I think I know where we be go now John do you it be the same place they bring I as a child it be where the island heal I let us hope it be as

Daniel Faraday yes yes uh you arrive with LaFleur I remember right what can I do for you I need you to order the evacuation of every man woman and child on this island and why would I do that because that man be on a stretcher as a consequence of the electromagnetic activity that your drilling unleash down here which be now contain it be contain down here but in about six hour the same thing be go to happen at the site for the Swan Station only the energy there be about 30 000 time more powerful sir and the accident it be go to be catastrophic that be utterly absurd what could possibly qualify you to make that kind of prediction Hmm I be from the future Dr Chang wait will you wait one second please yes yes wait one one second you be from the future you hear I talk about time travel now you

business to know I come here Daniel to tell you that it be very important that you say yes to Mr Widmore that you accept this opportunity I can not he need someone who can do really really complex space time calibration and calculate bearing and I just I do not know how to do that anymore Daniel Mm this place he mention to you this island do he tell you that it could make you well what if it be true why then you could go on with your work just think of all you could accomplish you really want I to to go yes will will it make you proud of I yes Daniel it will then I will do it you remember

to tell I why she be wrong why we do not belong here in about four hour the Dharma folk at the Swan work site they be go to go to drill into the ground and accidentally tap into a massive pocket of energy the result of the release of this energy would be catastrophic so in order to contain it they be go to have to cement the entire area in like Chernobyl and this containment the place they build over it I believe you call it the Hatch the Swan Hatch because of this one accident these people be go to spend the next 20 year keep that energy at bay by press a button a button that your friend Desmond will one day fail to push and that will cause your plane Oceanic 815 to crash on this island and because your plane crash a freighter will be send to this island a freighter I be on and Charlotte be on and so forth this entire chain of event it be go to start happen this afternoon but we can change that I study relativistic physics my entire life one thing emerge over and over can not change the past can not do it whatever happened happen all right but then I finally realize I have be spend so much time focus on the constant I forget about the variable do you know what the variable in these equation be Jack no Us we be the variable People we think we reason we make choice we have free will we can change our destiny I think I can negate that energy under the Swan I think I can destroy it if I can then that hatch will never be build and your plane your plane will land just like it be suppose to in Los Angeles and just how exactly do you plan on destroy this energy I be go to detonate a hydrogen bomb Satellite pharmacy Daniel Faraday your son be Daniel Faraday yes that be the man who send Desmond to Los Angeles to find you that be right I come Penelope to apologize your husband have become a casualty in a conflict that be big than he that be big than any of we what do you mean be Des go to be okay I do not know for the first time in a long time I do not know

be catch you say that we need to put thing back the way they be suppose to be what do you mean by that if we can do what Faraday say our plane never crash Flight 815 land in Los Angeles and everyone we lose since we get here they would all be alive and what about we we just go on live our life because we 've never meet all the misery that we 've be through we would just wipe it clean never happen it be not all misery enough of it be the man I shoot what do he need the bomb for I need you to tell I why he want the bomb I do not think you would believe I if I do when I be 17 year old I take a young man to the bomb he proceed to tell I that if we bury it underground then thing would work out splendidly when I ask he how he could be so sure he say that he be from the future and then he disappear right in front of my eye ten minute ago I shoot that man in the back and before he die he tell I that he he say he be my son Explain to I and you have my word I will believe you how be this my handwriting if I do not remember write it because you have not write it yet I know this be hard to understand but what you just do it be an accident and I think that there be a way for you to take it all back what your son come back here because he have figure out a way to change thing he do not have to be dead you do not have to have kill he if we do what be write in that journal none of this will have happen do he know what he be talk about he think he do all right then I will take you to the bomb just one small issue however we secure it over 20 year ago underground but since that time it appear that someone be build an entire village over it the Dharma Initiative however it appear that you two have be pass yourself off as member so I suppose come and go will be relatively simple it might be a little bit more complicated than that that woman where be she now call my lawyer Stuart what the hell be you do I be get answer where be she stop Damn it stop that be an order I be still in charge here no you be in charge Horace but if we be go to protect our people and all the work we be do here you do not have the stomach for what happen next okay Jim last chance you tell I where she

we be from the future sorry it be true then you be my son yeah it be true your friend the physicist he also tell I to evacuate everyone I could off the island he say there be go to be a massive accident at the Swan now be that true he be be right about everything so far if Faraday say get people off the island I would do it well then let us hope he know what he be do tell I something why be it that this man look familiar to I you and Erik be come with I go with you where you can untie they and would you mind give we a moment I be take they to the bomb what be you insane I be worried

Richard under there be an opening in the bottom of the rock at the far side that be a lot far than I think it be where be we the tunnel you wanna tell I how we be go to get a bomb out of here the same way we bring it in I assume you do not mean through the pool it be a 12 foot long 40 000 pound hydrogen bomb no not through the pool I do not think you would come well if this work you might just save we all and if it do not at least you will put we out of our misery all right let us get start I will have a tent prepare for you John we will get go in the morning I think we could leave right now now I be eager we can do whatever you want but maybe we should go to my tent and be this everyone there be another group at the temple but if you do not mind I would like to talk to everyone here now of course be my guest hello everyone my name be John Locke I 've be tell that for some time you all have be accept order from a man name Jacob and yet oddly enough it seem that no one have actually see he now I be sure there be very good reason why his existence and whereabout be secret I just do not know what they be and to be honest with you if there be a man tell we what to do I want to know who he be this man Jacob can he tell we how to bring Jin and the rest of our people back here absolutely Richard have agree to show we where we need to go so I be go to go and see Jacob right now and I would like all of you to come with I I be start to think John Locke be go to be trouble why do you think I try to kill he we be shovin ' off in two minute appreciate it if you do not cause we any trouble would not think of it Nemo what be we go to do when we get to Ann Arbor we be not go to Ann Arbor what do you mean these guy be not cop they get no authority over we back in the real world so once we dock wherever we dock we be free real world I do not even know what that mean anymore hey come here whatever happen I get your back remember I love you I love you back hold on do not close the hatch Horace want she off the island too we will let Ann Arbor deal with they actually catch she come back into town cuff she over there with the other Clear the bridge all personnel lie below on the double we be away Engineering take your station Boat be clear for sea all hand to your station prepare to dive Clear the bridge all hand below stand by main vent Diving position stand by on ballast tank Ship have be clear for dive repeat ship have be clear for dive stand by for dive Ship to dive clear engine two and three test two and three I be sure it be occur to you that this woman 's motivation in help we detonate a hydrogen bomb be only to annihilate the Dharma Initiative yes but I still trust she why 30 year from now she be the one who will tell we how to get back to the island and that make you trust she well now what beautiful day be not it yes so far Richard have some concern concern about what this pilgrimage to Jacob make he uncomfortable he be express reservation about whether or not you know what the hell you be do I appreciate you bring this to my attention Ben I know we get our difference in the past John but I be here to follow you now so if you need Jacob to help you reunite with your people I will do whatever I be not interested in be reunite with my people what you tell Sun I know what I tell she that be not why we be go to Jacob then why be we go to Jacob so I can kill he previously on lose the Dharma folk at the Swan worksite they be go to drill into the ground and accidentally tap into a massive pocket of energy and that will cause your plane Oceanic 815 to crash on this island and just how exactly do you plan on destroy this energy I be go to detonate a hydrogen bomb Morning Mornin ' mind if I join you please want some fish thank you I just eat I take it you be here 'cause of the ship I be how do they find the island you will have to ask them when they get here I do not have to ask you bring they here still try to prove I wrong be not you you be wrong be I they come they fight they destroy they corrupt it always end the same it only end once anything that happen before that be just progress do you have any idea how badly I wanna kill you yes one of these day soon or later I be go to find a loophole my friend well when you do I will be right here always nice talk to you Jacob Nice talk to you too be you go to do it Unh unh you do it fine I will do it but you be go to be lookout okay okay the crop come in pretty good this year hey you hear Frank buy the old yeah I hear he be go to farm the land all the way out to

you be not go to steal anymore be you be good Katie Welcome aboard everyone we will be do some system check offshore here before head out into the open ocean and submerge to our operational running depth you should be receive your sedative and then we will escort you to your sleeping berth have a nice rest see you on the other side we have to get out of here out of here we be underwater what the hell be you do here how have you get catch I come back to get you come back to get I for what where be Jack Jack be on his way to blow up a hydrogen bomb why the hell would he do that do it matter we have to stop he sorry I be go to pass do you hear what I just say yeah I hear you you just do not get it Kate we be happy in Dharmaville till you all show up but now that be all over so we be go to drink our o J and take our chance in the real world Jack want to blow up the island Good for Jack be there anything in there about how we be suppose to move a 10 ton bomb across the island actually it be 20 ton fortunately it seem that Faraday never intend to freight the device in its entirety what he leave detailed instruction on how to remove the plutonium core and how to detonate it Faraday tell I that we need to wipe out some kind of pocket of energy be only part of the bomb go to be enough to do that the core itself be a thermonuclear weapon it will be more than enough hey hey wait we seal that thing up 20 year ago and we put it underground because it be emit radiation do this sound like a good idea to you Eloise Richard you be pregnant which be exactly why we have to help they see this through once the core be remove then what then we have approximately two hour to take it to the Swan site two hour when Faraday return to the island he be very explicit about his timetable well then we would well get movin ' who stop the damn drill I do why because when we pass 70 meter the drill temp go up 60 degree and I do not want it to melt well Pierre that be why we have a truck full of water so cool it down and turn it on Stuart we 've just evacuate the island of all nonessential personnel we be in the midst of a possible insurrection do you really think this be the ideal time for your experiment I 've be work on this project for six year design a station that will be able to manipulate electromagnetism in way we only dream of have you think about the consequence of drill into that pocket we have no idea what we be go to if Edison be only worried about the consequence we would all still be sit in the dark I come to this island to change the world Pierre that be exactly what I intend to to let us get it start take five everybody we still get a way to go to get to Jacob 's who be Jacob he be in charge of this island you say John be in charge no I say he be the leader a title that I 've discover be incredibly temporary but everyone answer to someone and the leader answer to Jacob what be he like I do not know Sun I 've never meet he you 've be stare for the last ten minute Richard be there something you would like to ask I Ben tell I that he strangle you that be my recollection yes he say he be sure you be dead he see your coffin load onto that plane that you come back on how be you alive well you 've be on this island much long than I have Richard if anyone should have an explanation I would think it would be you yeah I I have be here a long time John and I 've see thing on this island that I can barely describe but I 've never see someone come back to life and I 've never see anyone who do not age it do not mean it can not happen I be this way because of Jacob and if I have to guess he be the reason you be not in that coffin anymore I agree completely Richard that be why I be do this so I can thank he and once I 've do that we be go to need to deal with the rest of the passenger from the Ajira flight that bring I here what do you mean deal with you know what I mean let us go untie the crate why have we even bring this yahoo because we might need he for what he do not know the answer to the question that do not mean he be not important what you think he be a candidate he be awake how long you be listen to we long enough to wonder what the hell I be a candidate for who the hell be you people we be friend so you smack all your friend in the face with a rifle shove them in a boat and kidnap them only the one we like let us go what be in the box your call open it Terrific need a pen son yeah thank there you go you can keep it I be very sorry about your mother and father James Come on Jimmy we get to get to the cemetery okay what you

get every right to be but you get to move on boy they be go and there be not nothing you can do to change that what be do be do now promise I you be not go to finish that letter I promise good come on let us go say good bye let I get this straight Jack set off a nuke which somehow reset everything so flight 815 never crash it just land in L A safe and sound and none of this never happen Sawyer if Jack do this he could kill everyone on the island yeah I hear that part and you be okay with that you be not hear I Kate I make a choice and I be stick to it I decide to leave and I be leavin '

and catch your breath consider what I have plan for ya you be go to need it everything all right I be enjoy some alone time you see what be behind you it be a door how about that it be not just a door Ben it be the door to the hatch where you and I first meet you mind if I ask you a question I be a Pisces what happen that day at the cabin when you first take I to meet Jacob well you clearly already know that I be talk to an empty chair John that I be pretend which be not to say that I be not as surprised as you be when thing start fly around in the room but why would you go to all the trouble to make something like that up I be embarrassed I do not want you to know that I have never see Jacob so yes I lie that be what I do all right then why do you want I to kill Jacob John because despite your loyal service to this island you get cancer you have to watch your own daughter gun down right in front of you and your reward for those sacrifice you be banish and you do all this in the name of a man you would never even meet so the question be Ben why the hell would not you wanna kill Jacob how much further uh we be about five minute away you can not stop the bleeding I need fresh dressing Jack so this bomb be suppose to what blow we back in time we be not go back in time right because that would be ridiculous I need to modify the bomb I can rig it so it detonate on impact Jack we need to be there at the moment of the incident or all of this will be for nothing why the hell be we stop that be why what be it why be we stop you will see well it be a wonderful foot Richard but what do it have to do with Jacob it be where he live what be go on Kate do we get to talk you wanna talk then get in the van we do not have time I be not gettin ' in the van I need five minute that be all I will say what I get to say and then you can do whatever the hell you want to but you be go to listen you owe I that much Jack five minute Dr Shephard you all right the dural sac I cut it give I some suction Calm down it be all right the fluid 's leak everywhere I can not look at I give I some suction yes doctor Jack look at I Count to five what be you talk about I be talk about you stitch up the sac so this girl be not paralyze for the rest of her life and the only way you be go to do that be not to be afraid so close your eye count to five and then fix she Jack or I will have to fix she for

to stay and have one request for Jack you have to lie about everything it be the only way to protect it it be an Island John it be not an Island it be a place where miracle happen let us go freckle I 've see enough of this rock Jack lead a group to the freighter by chopper as the science team shuttle other by boat but the chopper be leak fuel I would feel a hell of a lot well if we be a few

Jin turn around we can not do it Jin Sawyer reach the Island what be you do here believe his friend be safe be that our boat it be Meanwhile Locke begin his new role as leader of the other welcome home and Ben descend to a cavern deep below the orchid station to move the Island and ensure that Charles Widmore would never find it again but the act of move the Island create a profound side effect anyone where be the freighter a minute ago that boat be cough black smoke now there be just nothing the Oceanic survivor and the freighter scientist be take on an extraordinary journey whatever Ben Linus do down at the orchid station dislodge we dislodge we from what time they flash through numerous time period on the Island what year be it right now it be 1954 during one flash Jin Sawyer they reunite with Jin who be very much alive but the flash Charlotte be slowly kill they Locke believe he know how to save everyone leave behind this be all happen because they leave we have to go back to the orchid excuse I that be where all this start maybe it be where it will all stop Aah aah hello John I be here to help you the rest of the way Locke turn the same wheel Ben turn say hello to my son

Locke set out to convince his friend to come back to the Island I be not go back the answer be no no I be not go anywhere with you I only need to convince one and if I can do that the rest will come Locke 's task be difficult but it be about to become dangerous Locke 's misfortune give he one more chance what be you do here we have to go back because it be our destiny how many time be you go to

to kill Jacob this man need help why do you want I to kill Jacob John because despite your loyal service to this Island you have to watch your own daughter gun down right in front of you and your reward you be banish and you do all this in the name of a man you 've never even meet so the question be Ben why the hell would not you wanna kill Jacob but Jacob have friend aboard the Ajira flight what be in the box we need to show it to somebody what for so they will know who they be up against Ilana be a devoted follower of Jacob and he come to she at a critical time I be here because I need your help will you help I Ilana yes but the man who look like Locke finally reach his destination hello Jacob well you find your loophole indeed I do and you have no idea what I 've go through to be here have you meet before in a manner of speak outside Ilana and her team arrive do not shoot Richard I be Ilana I have something you need to see I do not understand if this be Locke who be in there all the piece be in place do what I ask you to Ben leave Ben face to face Benjamin with the Island 's spiritual leader whatever he be tell you I want you to understand one thing you have a choice but Jacob have neglect Ben for far too long oh so now after all this time you 've decide to stop ignore I well they be come what they be come let I get this straight all this already happen yes then what be I go to say next I do not know ha then your theory be wrong Hugo attempt to comprehend the complex law of time travel and along with Jack and Kate he do his good to adjust to life in the Dharma initiative of the 1970 why do not we carpool it will help with global warming which have not happen yet so maybe we can prevent it Sawyer 's cover story work and they be each assign job within the community and do not forget to try the dipping sauce they really bring out the ham but their arrival weigh heavily on Juliet who know Sawyer 's history with Kate and believe her life with Sawyer would never be the same it be over be not it what be over Us play house we get a hostile inside the perimeter as for Sayid move he be separate from his friend at the time of the flash and his arrival arouse suspicion of the new recruit I guess we find Sayid but everything on the Island I hey can I get a hand with this be about to change Dan Hey Miles what the hell be you do back here Dan this be what I be do back here Daniel Faraday endure the time flash on the Island with the rest of the Oceanic survivor and during a visit to the 1950 he learn the other have a hydrogen bomb you need to take it off this platform and bury it when Faraday arrive in the 1970 he focus his energy on find a way to change the future and with a new Dharma station under construction the timing be perfect the Dharma folk at the Swan work site they be go to drill into the ground and accidentally tap into a massive pocket of energy in order to contain it they be go to have to cement the entire area in like Chernobyl they be go to spend the next 20 year keep that energy at bay by press a button a button that your friend Desmond system failure will one day fail to push and that will cause your plane to crash on this Island I think we can change that then that hatch will never be build and your plane will land just like it be suppose to and just how exactly do you plan on destroy this energy I be go to detonate a hydrogen bomb Jack be inspire where be the bomb Richard where be it and when Faraday be shoot and kill Jack assume Faraday 's mission we disappear off that plane and end up here because this be our destiny Jack convince the other to take he to the bomb if he could prevent flight 815 from ever crash he could eliminate all the pain and suffer the survivor endure well now what use Faraday 's journal as a guide Sayid extract the core of the bomb but there be only one way to get to the Swan site and that be through the Dharma compound that be not good right which be already on high alert to hunt down Sayid and the rest of the new arrival hey get in with Jin and Hurley 's help Jack and Sayid escape I do not know where we be go the Swan site Swan it be Jack what be at the

do not see the point of kill they when I have what I come for so you find what they be hide in the submarine I most certainly do now what we get I dynamite or else she die for nothing maybe she die to show we to stay the hell away from dynamite well Jack that be a risk I be willing to take Richard I promise sun that I would get she off this island well Jack I I wish you have not do that if it make

do not blame he although as I explain to he before he leave I have nowhere to run to brother well if that be not the good argument against captivity that I 've ever hear I do not know what be you mind if I ask you a couple question Desmond not at all why do Charles Widmore bring you back to the island consider I be kidnap you would have to ask he they have he under armed guard he throw I into a wood shack and blast I with a massive amount of electromagnetism if you do not mind my ask Desmond how can you be sure what it be that he blast you with experience do you know who I be of course you be John Locke head back to camp I will be back soon where be you go Desmond and I need to take a walk something I would like to show you Kinda make you think do not it what be that Ilana there she be handpicke by Jacob train to come and protect you candidate no soon do she tell you who you be then she blow up the island be do with her make I wonder what be go to happen when it be do with we all right everyone this might take a few minute I do not want anyone but I handle that dynamite so I be go to go in alone where be Hugo I think he be up front with you run run go go go go why the hell do you do that I be protect we what the hell be you think Calm down now what what be we suppose to do now that be it that be enough we be dead we be all dead a warning might have be nice there Hugo I do say run why would you do that Michael tell I to who Michael he be one of the people who come back and yell at I after they die he tell I I have to stop everyone from blow up the plane so no dynamite no more blow up that happen a lot dead people yell at you it happen enough and you just listen to whatever they say dead people be more reliable than alive people how can I help you Mr Reyes I want to ask you about that girl the other day Libby I be wonder if maybe I could see she well I do not think that be a good idea she be not well clearly she be well enough for like a fajita field trip well that be my mistake I misjudge her condition her condition she have issue with reality what do you mean I just think it probably would not be a good idea for you to see she right now it will only confuse her you say probably which mean you might make an exception well perhaps for family or a generous donor I be sorry the rec room look pretty gnarly on my way in what do you think 100k might buy you remember no I be sorry then why be you here where be it you think you know I from um I be not sure I I know it will not make sense try I a few day ago I be watch tv and one of your commercial come on and the moment that I see you it be like I be hit over the head all these memory came wash back of my life only it be another life what kind of memory there be a plane crash and I be on an island and I be there I think so we know each other we like each other and then when I get here it be almost like I have be here before and for some reason Hugo I have a memory of you be here too um this be the first time I 've ever be in a mental hospital yeah I know but I can not get you out of my brain that be why the other night when I see you I have to talk to you because if you remember I I wish I could Libby but I can not I be sorry it be okay it be okay I be crazy yeah probably but we all get something right I mean it take a lot of gut to go up to a total stranger and tell they you know they from some bizarro alternate universe I be scared just say hi to a girl you be do fine hey can you ever like get outta here on a day pass or yeah I be here voluntarily well would you like to do something you mean a date uh yeah I would love that remind I Desmond how long be you down in that hatch push that button three year and here you be back for more if I do not know well I would say this island have it in for you do you know well excuse I well there be nothing special about I brother this island have it in for all of we yes it do what who be that just ignore he do you know that boy I say ignore he where you go Ben back at the dharma barrack there be still grenade there explosive yes I think so then that be where we be go maybe we should talk about this a minute talk there be no time to talk but if you know what we need to do if you know how we stop that thing from leave the island without blow that plane up then let us hear it let us all hear it I know what we need to do really what be that we have to go talk to Locke be you try to get we kill it be not my idea it be his Jacob say we have to talk to Locke Jacob 's here right now yeah ask he what the island be what a while back Jacob tell I what the island be and if he be really stand here right next to I then just ask he I do not have to prove anything to you Richard you either come with I or you can keep try to blow stuff up your call dude he be lie Jacob be not tell we what to do because Jacob never tell we what to do I be go to make this simple if that thing leave the island that be it I it be over what be over everything I be destroy that plane and I can use all the help I can get who be come with I I be I see that thing in action man it do not want to talk sorry anyone else sorry Richard if Jacob say we go talk to Locke we go talk to Locke I be go with Hugo really do not get in our way all right Hurley Let us go talk to Locke probably so what do you think we should say to Locke when we get there I mean how do you break the ice with the smoke monster do not worry about it something tell I he be go to do most of the talking or he could just kill we all yeah he could I do not see Jacob back there uh I just say it 'cause I want everyone to listen to I I know then why have you come with I ever since Juliet die ever since I get she kill all I 've want be to fix it but I can not I can not ever fix it you have no idea how hard it be for I to sit back and listen to other people tell I what I should do but I think maybe that be the point maybe maybe I be suppose to let go unless you let go get we kill go to see Locke be my idea not Jacob 's Hurley you ask I to trust you this be I trust you well it be a good thing you do dude cause I have no idea where I be go wait it be cool I think I know what these thing be oh yeah what the hell be they wait here hey you around Michael you be stuck on the island be not you because of what I do and there be other out here like you be not there that be what the whisper be yeah we be the one who can not move on do you know where Locke be there thank be be there anything I can do to help you do not get yourself kill okay and Hurley if you ever do see Libby again tell she I be very sorry I will be sure and do that dude I get like six different kind of cheese I do not even know what they be but the lady at the store say they be good so I figure you would like cheese because everybody like cheese be something wrong no not wrong just Off have you be here before no it be just be here with you feel so familiar it be like a date we never have wow I sound completely insane do not I no not completely why do you even wanna be with I why you wanna be with I what Come on look at I I want to be with you because I like you yeah but you like I because well you be delusional what what be wrong Whoa dude what I I think I be remember stuff you be you mean I be not crazy no I do not think you be we be here what be it it be a well let I guess you be wonder how deep it be you read my mind you have any idea how old this well be Desmond very old that be exactly right very old so old in fact that the people who dig this well do it completely by hand God know how long it take them well it seem like a lot of work just to get some water oh they be not look for water they be look for answer a long time ago place like the one we be stand at right now make compass needle spin and the people hold the compass need to know why so they dig do they find what they be look for no they do not the reason I want you to see this Desmond be because Charles Widmore be not interested in answer he be only interested in power and he bring you back to this island so that you could help he find what he be look for after all this be not the only well and that be the reason you want I to see this why be not you afraid excuse I you be out here middle of the jungle with I not a person on earth even know you be here why be not you afraid what be the point in be afraid Aah how be our friend we do not have to worry about he anymore where you be I go for a walk James well now that you 've stretch your leg maybe you can Son of a bitch um hey hello Hugo I do not know who you be dude or what you want but we have to talk to you we there be other people with I but the thing be you get weapon and we get weapon and I do not want anyone to get hurt or kill so

like that yeah so what if he do then that be it for all of we but but if Locke want to put it out then why have not he 'cause he be not get what he need I be guess that would be Desmond that be where we be head before your inauguration Sayid say Locke toss he in a well Jacob do not say anything to I about Desmond do not sound like he say anything about anything that be kinda true dude he be bad
