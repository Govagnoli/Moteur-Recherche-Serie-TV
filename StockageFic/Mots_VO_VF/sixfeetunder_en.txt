it be not one thing with you it be another exactly these be amazing really Amazing Claire yeah they be so cool they remind I of that guy what be his name the guy who do people in swimming pool David Hockney and he do this one thing of photograph like of the desert Pearblossom Highway yeah that but it be like you take it ten step far you make it personal Jean Baudrillard once say every possible art form have already be explore all that be leave be to deconstruct and play with the piece that be literally what you do explain the process well I would take a whole bunch of close up of someone like every inch of their face and then print those actual size and photocopy they and then papi mâchê piece over the person 's face and make an actual mask then when that dry I have they put the mask back on and then I would take a portrait in a setting that hopefully reveal something new about the person yeah there be so much depth to they exactly they be like sculpture be that what you be think I do n't know I guess I be think more emotionally like how many layer there be to a person and how we all wear mask even if that mask be our own skin but I think it be my background in sculpture that really allow we to make that leap you know when I first put the picture of Claire 's open eye over her closed eye I be think of she as sculpture so you help she with these in term of create the original concept yeah we work together I mean she be a photographer I be a sculptor somehow we combine those two element and create something new I think they turn out great you look just like your mother yeah that be what everyone say or say I be so sorry such a tragedy I still ca n't even quite it be just too much do your family have a burial plot I do n't know I doubt it cremation be a

briefly can I offer you a drink sure do you have any beer no we have vodka scotch bourbon I 'll have a little bourbon Manly but not elitist just her type down girl so where be Brenda Brenda oh Brenda 's not come tonight really she feel and I have to agree with her we would have a well chance of get to know each other if she be n't here she do tend to take center stage so to speak I wish somebody have think to tell I I be sorry I assume she do there you be David be raise in this church he be christen and confirm here he serve as an altar boy and he be president of the youth ministry in high school how old be you David I be 31 what do you do for a living I be a funeral director his father serve as a deacon for over a decade he just recently pass away so you see this as a sort of pass the torch no sir I see it as a chance to serve God well I be glad to hear you say that because that be what it be be a deacon be more than just have access to the church mailing list and pass out your business card after Mass Sir I wo n't deny that I run a business provide service to people in time of need but I would never exploit my relationship to the church for marketing purpose Frankly I consider that to be a pretty grave sin no pun intend St Bartholomew be an old church a conservative church a church that do n't need to have its boat rock which be precisely why I feel David be a good candidate how many man his age have value as strong as his I think he would be an excellent role model be you marry no sir I be engage briefly be there anything else you would like to tell I about yourself before I consider this no sir be there anything specific about I that you would like to ask no I 'll let you know my decision in a few day you impress he you think yes oh by the way one of

there be no coincidence you think she plan all this of course she be a master manipulator I love she dearly but you really ought to know what you be get into would you like another bourbon no thank can I ask you guy something as long as it do n't involve ask we for money no it do n't do the name Nathaniel have any significance to you well sure Nathaniel and Isabel Brenda adore these book as a little girl she could read by the time she be 3 what be they about two orphan who have adventure they run away from an orphanage there be a malevolent nurse who be always hunt they down but they

amoral behavior for those of you who have not yet read my book the central argument I posit in Genes out of the Bottle Evolution in Biotechnology be that genetic engineering be in and of itself the most effective argument against biological determinism why the thesis that you present so brilliantly be that though biology manifest in behavior as we can see in the instinct of human male to seek a variety of sexual partner the fact that we have the technology to modify genetic confirm the supremacy of culture over biology Excellent other thought I have a question be n't natural selection still operate though since member of the specie who have access to genetic technology be more likely to survive and procreate that kind of reasoning lead we into a very questionable ethical terrain other comment what kind of reason scientific you can call it scientific but as I discuss at great length in chapter 2 your argument be a political assertion that privilege be biologically determine I have

because truthfully East Valley be kind of a shitty school so there be that one a month ago in the bookstore then I meet this other guy at the Farmers Market that place have get so touristy and then there be this guy last week at the Rose Café who no that do n't count that be an almost one what exactly do you hope to get out of therapy Melissa give I your number because I guess I be I do n't know it be not that I be unhappy I be not unhappy I be really not but I know that what I be do be a little strange I mean most people who be engaged to someone they really love do n't have sex with stranger or maybe they do do that matter I think I like the euphoria I get from these encounter I be just have a little trouble with anxiety what do you mean I do n't know it be like I be coexist in these two separate reality there be my Nate reality and then there be this other reality and I would like to not feel so anxious about it it be not guilt it be just edginess so that be it I would like to not feel edgy that be why I be here okay so you would like to continue to have these encounter as you call they but you would like to not feel edgy ideally I know what you be think you think that I be afraid of intimacy so I be try to sabotage my relationship with my fiancé be that what I be think or be that what you be think no I just want to clarify that I do n't necessarily think that what I be do be destructive it might even be healthy how so maybe it be not good for I to totally lose myself in one person and this be a way for I to have a completely separate private area that be my own not his not ours maybe that be healthy for I listen I assume that Melissa tell you one of my specialty be sexual addiction no I do n't know how much you know of this issue but obviously it involve the sublimation of emotion that be too painful to address it be the root of all addiction really I be sorry but I do n't think I can help you because you do n't need help you have clearly evolve beyond the need for therapy I be actually in awe of you because I would be fucking stranger like a truck stop whore on crack if I be n't so inhibit by my Judeo christian upbringing it be not down here we use to have a few buddha in here I ca n't believe we ca n't find one I have read all this stuff about Buddhism but it never stay with I just know that everything be nothing be that it I think it be

pointy I wonder if anyone poke their eye out on one by accident look at all these unclaimed cremain can you imagine have a member of your family cremate and then not care enough to pick up their ashe I think sometimes it be too hard for people to acknowledge that someone they love be now just chunk of soot David Fisher hey yes I return the video did n't I say I would sure swordfish be fine whatever bye you hate swordfish I know it be funny now that Keith and I be live together I find myself try to be so fucking agreeable all the time why because if you be n't thing come up and you have no idea how big the thing 's gon na be it be like this constant negotiation you can never just relax be that just a phase or be it always go to be like that do n't ask I look I have no fucking idea maybe that be just what a relationship be constantly do thing you have absolutely no desire to do Nate Brenda come on in we have so many detail to go over before the bridal shower on Sunday be n't it

on shroom marriage be a profound experience that can deeply enrich your life and even bring you close to God but our culture have many misconception about it like marriage will cure loneliness or that most of our satisfaction in life should come from our partner or that good sex mean good marriage and the truth be that marriage be different for different people so in this and our next five session we 'll talk about what marriage mean to you I be curious have you ever be marry no I have n't but I have counsel many couple in my congregation both before during and after marriage one thing I can say without hesitation be you ca n't have a good marriage without honesty yeah that kind of go without say do n't it be you completely honest with each other you do n't have to answer that right now it be just something to think about for next week would you like some cucumber salad no thank you I make more than enough I read paper Fine take it go ahead take it I 'll be back like Terminator no what be he do he threaten you mind your own business woman can I just say that I think total honesty be not always the good thing what about privacy what about try to maintain the mystery of a relationship sometimes truth be irrelevant Brenda I do something stupid I be listen the trip to Seattle my friend Lisa I sleep with her she be pregnant I do n't even know how to respond to something like this what do you feel I do n't know what I feel I do n't feel anything I feel numb when be you plan on tell I I be tell you now what do you expect I to do with this information Christ Nate this

bad shape huh yes I think she be get a pretty airtight case I think that you guy be more or less fuck she make he show she the body I can certainly argue that point but David she be under duress and this woman be go to describe in great detail exactly what she see when she be up on the stand on top of that she be hire herself an aggressive law firm that nobody like to mess with so I think that we should try to settle how much money do you guy have I be sorry I be late where be you with Brenda we be in the middle of something pretty intense do you know how much trouble we be in because of this lawsuit I have thing I have get to deal with I have a life too I have a kid now at least I try to keep it separate from the business that you seem so hell bent on flush down the fucking toilet we be fuck Nate and you fuck we I be afraid my daughter 's suffering from depression and I do n't know what to do Most teenager suffer from mild depression at one time or another be that true true enough but I be pretty familiar with clinical depression and I do n't see Claire suffer from that you do n't look she be the kind of person that need her life to be meaningful I be sure you know this well than I do no I do n't feel as though I do and by the way who do n't need their life to be meaningful you would be surprise she have no idea how easy she be have it do you want to know what you can do to be more supportive of Claire of course that be why I be here I think this be a brochure for LAC Arts I think Claire should think about go there it be a great school for someone with her creativity you really do n't think she be depressed I do n't but can I speak candidly please I think it be possible that you might be it be I I be leave another goddamn message on your voice mail listen I really

be technique your work be safe limited cos you hold yourself back from life well call I crazy but I think an artist have a responsibility to do more than just give in to every emotional impulse because some impulse be wrong and some impulse violate the regulation of this school I check exactly how many school have you teach at you sit in such judgement of the world how do you expect to ever be a part of it I do n't wanna be part of your world a manipulative loser who fuck his student what do you wanna be an uptight puritan who be not even in her own body or a brilliant artist with blood and a heart and a cunt God you be such a fucking phoney at first you actually inspire I it take I half a semester to realise you be use we to work through your own shit when be you gon na get over the fact that you never become Picasso and now it be too late when be you go to get over the fact that if you take a chance you might fall on your face but that be the good thing that can ever happen to you as an artist and as a human being be we do absolutely get out of my office who do you think you be the Pope just because I fuck your boyfriend what a baby you need some real pain Fuck you fuck

matter of time before what before she call and tell we she be have a little car trouble or I do n't know that she be ok no one in this family ever talk about what be really go on what be that suppose

so awful well do n't Lisa be go to turn up and she be go to be fine and there 'll be a logical explanation for all of this yeah you be right and they be gon na put an end to world hunger and people'll stop kill each other and the oil company be gon na stop run everything and apologise for global warming I be sure it be just a matter of time when you talk to she she say she be at the ocean do she

cremation of course there be there be no overhead if we own our own yeah just a 340 000 mortgage no here be another number to think about 35 do you know what that number be that be the percentage of our clientele that be latino last year do you know why it be so high I be not say anything I have already be call a racist once this week because the name Diaz go up on our sign that be why we have

without they decompose that they start embalm they of course some asshole figure out a way to make money off of it there be no real reason for most of what we do we do n't need to embalm body well there be a little problem of smell so what that be a part of death and I think that be where this business go wrong we try to disguise it make it look pretty neat and someone else 's problem Nate do you actually have a proposal or be this just more of a general lecture Green funeral oh brother no casket no toxic chemical to leach into the soil and we make money on this how this be n't about make
