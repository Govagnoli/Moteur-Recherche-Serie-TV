correctly it might have save his life as it may yet save yours what do I do with they you will know when the time come and no doubt the colonial will have a plan if you do not mind I ask what be it with you two you seem tense Tense certainly not I be a serious scholar of the half life he be a boorish half wit whose arrogance be exceed only by his ignorance take they with my blessing they be all I have for you Simeon send his love whatever what do he give you the sword of righteousness and the orb of sanctity ring any bell not sure ring the mobile we will test they not now I 've get stuff to

pray be the odour of sanctity I be very glad you ask the odour of sanctity that wondrous subtle scent render by the innocent and the saintly why do the orb fume with it good question it do not say Luke what be this do not mess with it Jamie what be it I do not know exactly but I be sure you should not be mess with it Jamie Traveste demon by Gilgamel they be attract by the odour of sanctity like Anselm they replicate the scent in order to draw out the traveste into the open so the orb be what a sort of generator Correct put out the scent nothing for the average guy but it be rock and roll for the freak they can not get enough so if Gilgamel be out there the orb will pull he in Great thank you so much no problemo sweetheart you have a great day you too Jamie thank you I promise we will not trash the place good luck with the test Oi do not even think about it he be on voicemail I tell he to not switch his phone off I should not have leave he on his own no no now he be walk around with a

want I to reverse if I do I shall tell you in good time there be no need for all this Mr Rutherford please well you certainly can control the vehicle no one can accuse you of be unduly hesitant

day Mr Rutherford I can not believe you go miss I have my driving test and your point be sorry I give you a direct order who do you think you be I be the one do this goddam job boy please he want I to become the full enchilada when I can not even drive full enchilada I see and do you pass I do not really want to talk about it anyway this really weird thing happen we be drive along you have your phone switch off it be not my fault do you want to hear about it go on Luke the trunk fall on the floor and the orb start hiss and then this kid appear right in front of the car little girl about ten year old Ally Dunelm you be not surprised I be well surprised what do you do I freak good choice next thing she be on the back seat no wonder you fail at least you keep hold of the orb you do not want to go mess with that little baby be you sure you should be in here Luke let I be you sure do you want anything no I be good come on what do it do Travestes like Gilgamel feed on innocent that be why he be go after child to steal their soul it be call the gleaning of the innocent he be attract by the odour of sanctity the what the smell of saintliness we think Ally Dunelm could be follow the scent the traveste could be use she to target victim we be not big on saint these day but we still have innocent child yeah you should meet Ally 's sister or Ruby 's brother what you get a problem here have you ever see an angel who be you would you like to see an angel an angel come there be a little girl with he Luke they 've get Jamie see what happen if you do not put the job first Calm down let us think this through assume it be Ally Dunelm collect child for Gilgamel he be probably hold they somewhere how do you know he will take away their soul at one sit before he go back to the half life Father Julius call it the gleaning of the innocent do not worry we will find he you bet we will I be come with you we can find they can not we First there be the small matter of summon a 2 000 year

of year you will find a vampire myth in almost every culture Most people think vampire come from Transylvania but actually they start out in the Far East from China and Tibet they transport themselves with the trade caravan along the silk route to the Mediterranean maybe they be look for a well quality of life the Slavs seem to think that if they scatter poppy seed at their graveside vampire will stay up all night count they instead of kill people sadly that be untrue the South Americans think that aloe vera over the door will do the trick also untrue the only thing that will help against a type 12 be quick reaction Vampires move fast than a New York minute how fast be that about this fast who be side be you on I think I will be all right a bit of practice oh this be just the beginning my boy those skill will only help you if you be fight vampire not if you want to kill they I will buy a few bulb of garlic and Mum 's get a stake in the garden Fairy story only vampire can kill vampire if you want to kill a vampire you get to bring it back to life right we need a sample of Quincey 's dna you mean like a hair or something a hair a piece of clothing Fine I will just ask if I can borrow his jean we need to stake out his lair there be get to be something there More wait around in car no car this time sorry I come bear gift and information Mina be a slapper that be the crucial piece of news that will solve this whole case seriously she let Dracula suck her blood night after night after night what else she be like really old I mean like 150 underneath her clothe she must Ruby have you find out anything useful interesting not necessarily useful you be completely hopeless you know that I be not not completely be you sure you be up to this yeah just do not get too

chicken feel the same you should not have send he in there he will be fine I will be fine God damn it he be the last Van Helsing he have to fight vampire some time he be not ready nor 's Galvin that be not the problem we have cut and bruise but no DNA Hiya we will have to go back in there it be too dangerous what be up there must be another way be you sure an old fashioned stake through the heart
