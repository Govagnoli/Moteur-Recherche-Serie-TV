Charles Xavier if you remember he can control thing with the power of his mind yes make people do thing and see thing so I think what if you could do that for real I mean not in a comic book world but in the real world oh right so in my film I play a man who control the world with his mind right that be interesting yes for instance I be walk along and I see this beautiful girl and I think I would like to see she naked and so all her clothe fall off all her clothe fall off hm yes and she be scrabble around to get they back on again but even before she can get her knicker on I 've see everything you know I 've see it all okay it be a comedy be it no it be about what would happen if these thing be possible what be the story though what be the well I do other stuff like I be ride my bike in the park and this policewoman say Oi you can not ride your bike on the grass and I go oh no and her uniform fall off and she go ah and she be try to cover up but I 've see everything anyway and I get on my bike I ride off on the grass so it be mainly you sort of go around see lady ' tit mainly and I do other stuff like I go to the World Cup Final and it be Germany versus England and I wish that I be play and suddenly I be and I score the win goal they carry I into the dressing room and there be Rooney and Beckham and then Posh Spice walk in and her clothe fall off instantly sure she do not know what be happen no but I 've see see everything again good be there a narrative at all be there like a story in the film or be it just well I be a sort of James Bond figure right and I have to go to Iraq to rescue these hostage and I get there and I rescue they but they be all woman and they be naked because their clothe have rot off but I get they into the helicopter and I be fly the helicopter but I can still sneak a look in the mirror and I can see everything you know one of they be bend over two of they be kiss they 've turn lesbian because they would be in the camp so long it can happen well good luck with that I 've just write a sitcom but I wonder if you could give it to anyone you know you know yes in film or tv be there any nudity in it any any nudity in it not really oh well there could be man or woman either oh well just woman right I would need to rewrite but in the meantime if you could give it to anyone in tv or film or yes definitely I will make it so you 've see Star Trek the Next Generation I have not no your wife will not let you have it on I be not marry oh your girlfriend then I have no girlfriend I live alone you be not marry you have not get a

department who get in touch and there be a lot of buzz what the BBC have call you yeah they just say we love the script we would like to get you in and have a meeting a chat and brainstorm Brilliant who be the production company you would not have hear of they a little company call Picard Productions set up by Patrick Stewart I send it to they you send it to Patrick Stewart this be dynamite stuff recently about two month ago no you do not I give it to he on set even if I have not do anything towards this please can I still have my twelve and a half percent please yeah why not yeah thank you I mean that be sort of the way it be do so have you think about who could play the main character I be play the main character really be you sure you be a bit of a nobody I be not sure they would cast a nobody in the main role well we would insist I think the obvious choice be right under your nose Barry yeah no offence Shaun I be play the lead character be you sure 'cause he be really versatile I be sure he be I be not sure what it be you can do Barry can do all sort do your serious you do love I Janine you do I know you do yeah do your comical Pat you 've tread on my foot get off he be a singer as well Mustang Sally Loud be not it he do a gig once without a microphone there be not a microphone there he turn up for this gig there be no PA system nothing tell he they be go to cancel the gig I say you be have a laugh I do not need a microphone microphone be for wimp he say microphone be for wimp I belt it out just like that in front of what 140 odd people and they be really spread out because it be a thousand seater venue Lot of empty seat do not faze he just go for it go on do it all you want to do be ride around Sally sing it with I now Ride Sally ride what be you do just have a little sing song I be do the lead in this okay I be play the lead character that be it I do not want to discuss it be you sure yes I do not know you 've never strike I as a funny bloke sorry you

where be we I just want to find out where you see this project go BBC 1 no I do not actually BBC 3 no BBC 2 I think that be just really good for comedy I think if you come up with a new project on BBC 1 you 've get to really water it down you know I do not want a laughter track no laugh there will be laugh there will be big laugh but I just want it to be I do not want it to be a comedy aim at people without a sense of humour I want people to be able to think about it I do not want it film in front of a live studio audience unless you guy disagree with that in which case we can change all that just do whatever you want to do no no there be no need to do that what I would say though be because this be your first project I would like you to initially write with someone else he will write with anyone I will not he will not write with anyone that be a deal breaker no I would like to write it myself just because it be base on my own experience really the character be base on a boss I use to work for and I just generally think the good thing be auteure Turd no all right I be happy for you to write it yourself but I would feel happy get Damon just to work with you as script editor someone to bounce idea off just tidy up the first script I think it be a bit flabby yeah it be just a bag of idea at the moment but yeah fine I think the good thing to move this forward be to get you two together in a little room oh Shh Inappropriate at a meeting at the BBC that okay that would be great okay okay let us talk cash because as you know this script be pipe hot so we be look for big buck we do not need to talk cash now we need to talk a little bit about cash just get some money up front for you know supply pencil I could probably find you a computer you happy with a computer yes

to meet you Sir Ian please no title in the workplace good not much theatre work of late that be fine you be in good hand here how do I act so well what I do be I pretend to be the person I be portray in the film or play you be confused it be perfectly simple to case in point Lord of the Rings Peter Jackson come from New Zealand say to I Sir Ian I want you to be Gandalf the Wizard and I say to he you be aware that I be not really a wizard and he say yes I be aware of that what I want you to do be to use your act skill to portray the wizard for the duration of the film so I say okay and then I say to myself how will I do that and this be what I do I imagine what it would be like to be a wizard and then I pretend and act in that way on the day and how do I know what to say the word be write down for I in a script how do I know where to stand People tell I if we be to draw a graph of my process of my method it would be something like this Sir Ian Sir Ian Sir Ian action Wizard you shall not pass Cut j'ai beau googler lord of the ring ya rien avant you shall not pass dan le film Sir Ian Sir Ian Sir Ian okay you get it now you would be pretend to be John in this play and how would you know what to say well the word would be in the script and you would learn the word you would not have the script on the night and that go for everybody no script on the night you learn the word you will speak they as if you be say they for the first time I do not think we would have the script nobody will not because if you do it would break the illusion and the whole thing be illusion do you see you be not really John no I know you be pretend and that be act what be the what be the play about it be a new play by Charlie Charlie Haywood as I say you will do the part of John and you be in love with Fran and the whole centerpiece of the play be the emotional confrontation when the two of you address those unspoken feeling that you 've be bottle up that sound challenge I hope so and I do not know be it anything you would be int definitely yeah so let I introduce you to the team there be Fran who be your lover play by Leslie Leslie this be Andy you be Fran Fran 's a man can be 'cause
