on it interesting Brain damage lead to hypothalamic dysregulation if you be bring in cover in rubble it be all about the MRI 's we would have see that come on you got to earn that fiver or stuff leak in the hole mess it up Lacerations leave multiple portal for infection Bacterial would have respond to the antibiotic too high for viral Parasites or Fungus be possible or maybe Lupus my grandma have Lupus okay autoimmune I will run a lupus panel Infection fit good complete history would be helpful which lead to the bad part of the job deal with the floor buffer 's family we talk every couple of

be go to make she all well showoff you oughta be nice to people where be we go you know how the laughter of little child be infectious Parasites and Fungi be even more so we be go to find out which one be make her brain bubble over where the building EPA 's do that job for we they say it be clean which mean we be make a pilgrimage to castle blackberry her name 's Bradbury I should ask they for key no need I be sure we can find a large rock somewhere I be not break in to somebody 's house I get principle I get some loose change here say you do not I be not do this for less than a 50 where be the restaurant what restaurant the one you say you be take I to for lunch this one 's Homier Dibs on the cold pizza I be sure it look easy on youtube you do not need a team you can not even get arrest

look up we can stop swab her clich 's be get healthy or she be less depressed be not there pill that do that antidepressant do not cause fever not on their own but the ER do not know she be on MAO inhibitor so they give her demerol it be a nasty combo so all you have to do be convince this kid that his girlfriend have a secret doctor and a secret stash and a secret life it be be a while since a patient take a swing at you can I watch I only have to convince the mother actually I do not have to convince anyone this it total crap if she be see a psychiatrist I would know if she be on drug I

they in her purse I think it would be rude to go search under 1 000 ton of rubble this be month ago we be in a fight do not mean she be depressed and do not mean she do not love I Fine maybe the diary prove nothing on the other hand half the country 's on antidepressant and it fit her symptom perfectly no ring on your daughter 's finger mean you make the decision I be not sure that I know she well enough anymore you really wanna risk her life on how wellheknows her you idiot listen carefully and no one will get hurt you must follow these instruction any attempt to contact the FBI or other law enforcement agency or Cutty will be meet with a large Coke no ice give it back what happen do someone kidnap your guitar a 12 000 1967 fly v or something where would you hide it I be flatter you would consider I this bold and brilliant no 'cause it take it take a criminal mastermind to pull off a heist from an unlocked unguarded room down the hall what do you want I nothing but I be sure the kidnapper want what every kidnapper want to see you interview five to seven well qualified fellowship candidate I do not need a team you be bounce idea off a janitor and solve the case hi I be Dr Cuddy if you can hear what I be say blink once you can not talk right now you have a tube down your throat and try not to move your head you 've be in a terrible accident but it look like you will

they by wink maybe there be a cute guy across the room she get well when I treat she even I be not that cute two unrelated symptom just a coincidence or you be grasp at straw to avoid admit you can not do this on your own Fine what explain the fever and persistent tachycardia could be anything Endocarditis Nope Fever no infection keep go you be do great you win I do not believe you I be not go to play this game just give I the damn resume and my guitar I do not have it although I do hear some plangent strum from under that couch early this kidnapper be not just bold he be diabolical I guess he realize he probably should not give it back to you until after you 've have the interview you do not write anything so what you be say be you do not find that one big explanation 'cause there be not one Clever well let us just say your antidepressant theory do explain the fever what about the heart and do not say a building fall on her okay a structure collapse Shut up come on it fit crush musculature release potassium cause V TAC you would think she would get crush syndrome after she be crush not 2 day later Microvascular occlusion take that long for the blood to reperfuse she would have a baggy heart Echo it to confirm be crush syndrome good or bad do it sound good I mean compare to the other thing it could be there be no other thing it could be then why be you test she Excellent question what what be it the heart 's fine why be she sweat her fever 's back why would her fever be back I can not say you do not know I know I just can not say 'cause you will hit I let us discuss this in front of witness the DT 's so she be an alcoholic now her first fever be from the medication for her depression or you be wrong the second fever be from the self medication for

liver enzyme test Liver enzyme can also be elevate from musculoskeletal trauma they would be there whether she have a drinking problem or not they do not know that just pretend to confirm what be the

of medicine I be not interested in argue because I be not interested in enable you you need someone to bounce idea off of you need a team do not follow I MAO Inhibitor cause the fever Alcohol cause the pancreatitis Alcohol withdrawal cause the V Tach your logic be irrefutable you be wrong well who be you go to believe a classic toy or a woman who if she have any confidence in her idea would not feel the need to distract you with a water bra be you really just go to treat the pancreatitis be you here to enable I I do not want she to die because you be stubborn so you can enable and rationalize at the same time guess you be still dean of medicine if you be right then this guy who be not an ass who be not a workaholic who be not a sociopath have somehow miss both her depression and severe alcoholism yes imagine that a couple with secret why would she lie okay alcoholism you do not wanna advertise but if you be right there would be an abnormality on the pancreas at least do an MRI to confirm oh my God this guy mean business or guy could be multiple guy or a gal who know all I can say be this reek of boldness I be not hire a team you ever tighten a guitar string really really slowly past the point it can handle the strain it make this weird sound almost like a scream I think this be go to be fun I mess with you you mess with I eventually you give in but you 've show a startling lack of humor which get I think oh God what be the real reason you will not hire a team I tell you I do not need a team then hire three people and let them sit on their ass that would not be right three year ago you hire a team what be change I have become a man of principle I 've get smart what answer will make socrate shut up what be change be you hire with a team you connect with a

that someone so self assured do not want her doctor to find out what be wrong with her what be you talk about why else be I here you be jerk we around you be handcuff we with all these restriction I be feel warm her pulse be 120 stop push if House think this would handicap we he would not have take the case or maybe that be why he take the case he want to see if we can get it out of she on our own what do you find in her home you be in my home nothing Travel picture yearbook her name on an employment slip we be not check for that stuff ok obviously House do not want we to you be go to you be go to out I be not you you be go to ruin everything nobody be try to do anything just relax this be not a normal response to the test Pulse and bp be too high get away from I get away from I do not touch I page I during Judge Judy not the good way to win my affection she have another episode of synesthesia it set off a psychotic attack and now she run in there and must 've jam something in the handle so you call I the guy with one good leg and zero leverage we break that door down security show up and her name go in a file Luckily violence be not the last resort Extortion be so go ahead extort she if you do not open this door we be go to break it down Clever an appeal to her deep concern for hospital property Let us see how that work if you do not open this door you be go to die go away you seem to be get to her she do not care if she die you think she want to die no but I think she only want to live under certain circumstance open up or I blab your secret to everyone you do not know anything I do anybody think that a sedative might I be try who be that who be she Osama Bin Laden who be she be she okay she be stable who be she what do House tell you that she be on the run from an international crime syndicate that be what he tell we House maybe your boss but I be House 's boss you want to work here I well be okay with it honestly he do not tell we anything about who she be her name 's Greta Cooper want to be an astronaut do not want NASA to know her brain 's get her ear confuse with her eye I go through her mail you be a virus House now instead of one liability I 've get 20 apparently only 19 which number be it from now on everything you do gets chart with pen on paper in a binder that say princeton Plainsboro teach Hospital on the cover Mom if you want to run something through the lab I get a copy if you do scan I get a copy if you think about do scan I get a copy you know my current thought right I do not have to put those on paper three issue one number 10 you be fire she tell you well it have to be someone who go to her home no 26 be half asleep miss his afternoon nap obviously he do not feel guilt no 2 be here on a visa she can not jeopardize you can not know and that chick 's be point at you since I walk in Issue two what cause synesthesia high RBC tachyarrhythmia and panic attack Slight glucose elevation that say thyroid Baseline thyrotropin 's 1 1 1 3 whatever her thyroid 's work what about her liver original ALT level be not abnormal but be near the edge she have patient datum on her PDA I do not I see the lab value you say we could not write anything down I also say I want answer Liver cancer be the most likely paraneoplastic syndrome we need to do an MRI which bring we to issue three you be say we can write stuff down to you I be say you be fire to everyone else but you say specifically I hate tattletale she tattle on 10 now you tattle twice Issue three come on let us go issue three how do we do test when we can not do test Dr Cuddy do not say we can not do test she say we have to chart if we chart we will not get consent so we can not the patient 's life may depend on her consent her dream depend on she not consent so how do we do test when we can not do test you 've get an hour how do you scan a liver without scan a liver and what be Cameron do here interesting so you be see cameron now no not interesting because not see see my patient will not consent to MRIs or ultrasound and you 've deal with more liver cancer than anyone else here so you want I to share the secret scanning technique I learn in Nepal unfortunately the monk make I swear a blood oath where be she in the lobby guess we could palpate the area around the liver which will not work unless the tumor 's enormous which you know which mean you be here because these vision be freak you out she have blonde hair why would I hallucinate that yes yes why be you merge Cameron and Chase we should find out before the next time you see she when she will be black of course it be scientifically impossible for a person to go back and visit somewhere they work no but since she be not a dead cat it be scientifically impossible for she to be in two place at once Physics joke do not hear enough of those she just call I from Arizona Notice the area code 480 they put an offer on a place in Scottsdale do you want to talk or should I I guess we could both talk although they be engage and if you be stay in touch you might want to buy maybe it be not repress guilt maybe it be just Panic right now you 've get enough fellow to build a railroad but you be go to have to narrow that room full of number down to three people any chance you could turn this creative brilliance towards my patient 's liver I think you be go to choose people for reason that have nothing to do with their skill I think you be go to choose people just because you can not stand they because if you like they well that be just Stressful Stress I like it we need to stress the patient 's liver you mean make she sick I mean make she sick in a specific way if her liver 's give to malfunction we make it malfunction be we on the other side of wrong here do not we have an ethic board that we should consult I fire you no you do not he fire you you be no 6 no I be not I be no 9 I approve of your shamelessness you be still fire how do we stress her liver lie and paperwork I get shut down organ we could give she intravenous vitamin d and stick she in a tanning booth if she go into a coma we know it be a metabolic problem Nice but vitamin D 's metabolize by the liver and kidney it would not tell we which one be screw up we could get her waste give her shot of tequila measure how long it take for she to pass out if it be too fast then we know her liver 's not process alcohol it be a shot I like you no 9 you want to see I you a mormon you be wear a ring from Brigham Young or do your folk just do the lawn the church have a very progressive attitude toward racial equality do not care actually I be thank God you be the only non drinker we get we need a control group to establish whether the liver 's deterioration be within normal range get a big drinker medium drinker now I get a no drinker just do an MRI you really think the guy who create heaven and earth care what you put in your digestive tract her dream should not outrank my religious belief why not her dream might come true all life be sacred right we be not save her life we be do a diagnostic test not even a real diagnostic test well that fake test might really save her life would you pull an ass out of a pit on the sabbath would you or would you not pull an ass out of a pit on the sabbath Fine I will do it good why would you have to pick tequila I assume a single malt would 've work just as well be not our choice okay two minute then round number five so tell I about the magic underwear be that why you be here I be the big drinker do my part for science the interesting question be why your religious belief be suddenly less important than her dream you be reverse your argument I know what I believe I be just not quite sure what you believe well lds do not try to dictate every detail of our life when a situation be not clear we be encouraged to make our own decision but your judgment be to say no you use my judgment you make a good argument rational argument do not usually work on religious people otherwise there would be no religious people you be an atheist only on christmas and easter the rest of the time it do not really matter where be the fun in that a finite unmysterious universe it be not about fun it be about the truth the truth be we be have this debate because you want to figure something out about I what do you get so far she can not breathe we need to intubate no at least oxygen NASA will need to know why I check the test you order do you just see Foreman you measure the density of her tooth it be a shortcut test for hypercalcemia you have to have just pass he so you suspect hypercalcemia from her complete lack of break bone be that why you also run three tox screen Patient might 've be sneak upper he be in a white coat do you hire he back Foreman be run the diagnostic department at New York Mercy have you be drink she be have trouble breathe refuse oxygen and intubation so you put she on a treadmill Records will show that we give her oxygen as a part of a routine cardio stress test she get to breathe your boss get her paperwork who be idea be that it be a joint decision it never be so how old be you when your brother leave home why do you think why be not you answer do your mother initiate the divorce we should probably focus on what be wrong with her lung be you a wiccan she really can not breathe hold still what be you do auscultatory percussion if you have a good ear you can you do not have a lot of friend because you you can hear while you be talk you can detect not only structural detail but small deep masse Game 's over you either have lung cancer or tuberous sclerosis we need to cut you open and biopsy that will leave a scar NASA doctor will see they will know I never open for springsteen or sleep with Barbara Feldon you can live for year without dream without lung find a way as long you keep say it strongly you will not die find a way how do we force a patient into surgery Texas bag scam Saratoga wire Paris exposition trip the problem be not the surgery it be the scar and we have a plastic surgeon here who can hide them not that well NASA 's go to check every cranny I say we just put ether in her oxygen and do what we have to do she will sue for what make it hard for she to lie to the government we do not need to hide they we give her elective cosmetic surgery the incision will give we access to her lung and she be get an innocent explanation for the scar you mean like liposuction no no those incision be too far from the lung we do not subtract we add turn her b s into c s it be a myth that fake hooter blow up at high altitude she will be fine just think of it as one giant rack for mankind I fight for year to be take seriously trust I you will be take more seriously just sign the form this will make I a joke there be get to be another way I 've know a few people who have dream one thing they all have in common be they got laugh at and they do not care you bump a splenectomy for a boob job would you condemn this woman to a life where people look at her face when they talk to her you do not explain this I will cancel the surgery can I explain why you be here think I just tell you why I I schedule a diagnostic patient for a boob job which be ridiculous so obviously you have to confront I with you so far but I be go to give you a reason not a good one no not even close to a good one but here be the drag from your point of view my explanation will make sense not to the board not to a judge but to you so you will let I do it then you be go to have to sit next to I at the administrative hearing do not you have well thing to do it be in the good interest of the patient Trocar 's in you be good to go deflate the lung there a cyst Cysts I count three of they probably the same if not more on the left lung so what be be work overtime to kill miss Bin Laden we know her name now yeah but I forget it say the magic word and get immunity from the next challenge Alveolar hydatid disease hit all the organ she would 've have multiple seizure by now Pulmonary langerhan ' do not explain the red blood cell come on Cysts Synesthesia Heart attack you guy have get Von Hippel Lindau syndrome raise red blood cell count cause masse on the organ one of the masse be a pheochromocytoma it would cause neurologic episode and a heart attack do you see a blond guy who still have peach fuzz stand up there this be a closed procedure Gallery 's off limit not to the surgical staff you go to hire that guy instead of we not a chance I love you guy dig out the cyst histology to confirm Von Hippel Lindau do not forget her chesticle call Arizona it be a very nice touch you do have residual not only do I not have residual feeling I do not even have primary feeling you freak you lie because you know it mean it mean nothing I see he 'cause he be there Cameron follow her beshert to the surgery department I think Chase follow she she be be a senior attending in the ER the last three week a blonde senior attending to be accurate Foreman be he back in neurology he be at New York Mercy he be be there a month do you see Foreman no so I be cure you be fine for now but Von Hippel Lindau be a genetic disease there be no cure Greta you need to come clean to NASA you say you get all the cyst they could reemerge I will go to radiology clinic I will get regular screening if something happen while you be up there you would be play russian roulette with relax she do not have to tell neither do you turn out that NASA doctor even know where the hyphen in Von Hippel Lindau go you call they I be not an idiot those shuttle fly over New Jersey so here we be the big moment which of you get to live to be abuse another day and which of you go home and rationalize be fire as character building follow number thank for play 21 19 8 34 17 29 5 36 2 rest of you 8 00 am Sharp I will be in sometime between 10 00 and 3 00 but 26 stick around a while I do nothing wrong lot of people do nothing wrong other people screw up I never even other people take chance 26 Buddy Ebsen actually be not allergic to yeah I know how old be you 21 you do not think it be relevant I will likely have less time to use the skill you teach we but I do not think that be significant to you how about the fact that you never go to medical school which be why you let the unlucky number do the tran echo at least you be ethically unethical 30 year I work in the Columbia med school admission office audit all the class Most of they more than once I just never get a diploma you have to know I would find out soon or later I know you break rule I think maybe you would break one for I I can not hire you as a doctor but you can still tell I what you think you can also fetch I coffee pick up my dry cleaning until I can decide whether or not to keep you so I be play this whole game to be like your secretary Assistant sound marginally less demeaning it be not my dream job actually it be it be just not your dream title three week for someone who never miss something small you miss something big you be an idiot the hair where I be work or both the hair make you look like a hooker I like it pull piece of windshield out of car accident victim Reattaching fingertip slice off cut bagel at least chase 's move be only one step down I can do good here get it out of my system why would you rat your patient out to NASA I do not know who be be gossip about ethic instead of sex but I hope they 've already be fire which number be it Greta number no number the patient how do you think she get your pager number she come into the er do not want to talk I do not rat she out you lie suppose I should tell she that before she key my car why lie have to stop some leak faucet what do it matter it be no one 's business right she be go to be the safe astronaut up there certainly more vigilant than the guy next to she who be get no clue about the aneurysm in his head ready to pop right you get a well reason you could not kill her dream it be cold Good thank you there be a new girl at the ice cream store she do not seem too fond of button her top button let us go check she out Transcript swsub com Sync BlueDoc ¤akazab¤ season 4 Episode 3 97 second what be we suppose to be do it be almost 4 00 you get somewhere to be we know he like to manipulate people he be probably test we to find out what how long we can look stupid for he say he would be here by 3 00 he be obviously not come I be go home nobody follow she she pie pipere nine people right out of a job last week would you mind hold my metaphor for a second new patient 37 year old male Suffers from severe ascending muscle weakness why be you late to see who would put up with it so if we leave we would have be fire I be go to fire whoever stick around but since everyone stick around 28 curvature of the spine have cause reduced lung capacity and have reduce bone mineral density Patient have spinal muscular atrophy it be genetic incurable this be not a diagnostic mystery you have just give state secret to the enemy what enemy new patient New rule today you be go to split yourself into two team first to figure out what be threaten to deprive the patient of the 20 or so miserable year he be got leave with SMA get to keep their job take off your number you look stupid and I think I know who you be by now wait how do you want we to split up good question overly excited former foster kid there be ten of you I be think six against six no wait how about woman versus man Excellent suggestion fat twin more interesting than even versus odd less interesting than shirt against skin if your sex organ dangle you be the confederate if your sex organ be aesthetically pleasing you be the yanks Dr House I would like to be on the man 's team do your sex organ dangle cutthroat bitch not yet you 've never hire more than one female in your team before if you be go to purge an entire gender it be not go to be the dangler sound logical if you do not think about it for more than three second but I just tell you that if the dangler lose they be out so I can only assume you be hide the real reason you do not think the woman will be aggressive enough or be good enough at science they will be too emotional can I switch team if the dangler be okay I be okay we be not okay I get it you do not like I because maybe I be a little bit competitive Manipulative Cutthroat bitch be your official title it be a game you can either play for fun or play to win if you want to win you want cutthroat no thank you first thing we have to do be get inside his head it be not psychological I be not talk about the patient I be talk about House he be insane but he be not irresponsible he would not be play this game if the do not already know the answer first thing we do be gang bang the sucker there be five of we we can run dozen of test we do not need a theory we just need brute force what about the assist dog pick bacteria infest thing up with its bacteria infest mouth hand they over to the guy and it be not the dog it would not be fair to who whom the man House know I use to be a vet if the dog be the answer they would be at a handicap what about the dog assist dog put everything in their mouth money door knob Great that be not what I say why do you think a low sodium I do not the patient take a trip to Thailand two week ago write big and angle the board more so they can see it this be wrong it be only wrong if they cheat off we and if they cheat off we they be wrong they be not cheat one of they be move stop play with your suture or I will have to redo they why do you guy keep a d cell battery in a urine speciman cup because we pull it from a patient 's intestine why would somebody swallow a battery why do you assume it be swallow Bed five need a bag of ringer 's lactate it would have be bad if he have use a nine volt who say it be a he false assumption you be good you be try to get I to think like he and you be try to kiss my ass why be you talk to I because House be turn patient care into a game it be dangerous the patient 's go to suffer maybe die you really need to shave see what I do there interesting need a crash cart in here I do not do it when a person faint it be because they be not get enough blood to their brain the act of fall correct the problem you faint again strap into that power chair where you can not fall you might not wake up kill by an assistive device at least my death would be ironic I think when you go to Thailand you pick up a thread worm call strongyloide they usually go up through your foot I do not do a lot of walk on the beach but I assume you do have someone lay you down in the sand Bare back bare leg increase exposure tenfold over bare foot two pill you will be all well can I have some water for those please hey take a number House do not say anything about take turn what be she test he for do not they will spend all day obsess over my idea instead of come up with one of their own and hey I might be wrong seriously I be worried that if we do not know what she be give you there can be conflict no you be not House tell I he be keep track of all that ten doctor they should be get ten cure we need blood hair and stool you poop and then you use the wooden stick to collect the fecal matter then you rub it on the green box Hand it to my

to have to do it ready one two three can I get a little head support please thank you why be you here my office be be use by my team Teams which mean this be the only place where you can yell at I you have team two of they I want to deal with the yelling today because I notice what you be wear and I would not have to listen all that closely you can not make a competition out of patient care without competition we would still be single cell organism can I go now not until after the yell what be wrong with he I have seven of the fine mind on it along with three very special you would not be do this unless you already know I tell you you tell they Game 's over if you know you be obligate to treat well then in that case I do not know why would a guy Voluntarily shove a metal object into an electrical socket I be get close and close to know the answer what would happen if I shut down this game I would fire they all hire 40 new fellowship applicant start the game all over again you do know what be wrong with he right it would be pretty irresponsible if I do not would not it Antibiotics be not work Legionella could explain the lung the fever if she have legionella she would have low sodium what can you tell I about her she like body surf maybe pick up a virus swim off Jones beach but she do not even have the energy to finish her crossword anymore her boyfriend say that be it what be Blurry vision how do you get blurry vision from you do not stop a daily ritual that cure boredom because you be bore she stop do she crossword puzzle because she be have a hard time read it what cause fever boggy lung and blurry vision Fungal Aspergillus would explain the pneumonia which explain the fever start she on amphotericin Hey guy great job if you be go to try to take yourself out why choose electricity you eat a bullet jump off a building I love the team thing by the way bury yourself alive in Cuddy 's cleavage teamwork collaboration all for the great good it could have be a suicidal gesture as oppose to an actual attempt interestingly the rain in Spain do not actually fall in the plain all that much but who put their internal organ on a skillet just to get attention go ask he that would be cheat get a diagnosis yet get out of here get a stool sample yet how could you know I talk to a nurse pretty brilliant huh I give you a move House will love straight from one of his former fellow and you let I join your team you be too late we already have our diagnosis he be lie because he want you to go away so do I how do we know you be not a double agent to find out what we be think then go back to the woman because I do not care what you be think you wanna know why I want to be on your team because you be idiot if I can get the woman out of the competition I be in and so be two of you so what be the big move it be call xenodiagnosis we let this bug bite you and then we test their fece for parasite why can not you test my fece because you 've be chug milk of magnesia for the past hour you have a lot go in and nothing come out test the bugs'fece be actually more accurate than test yours small haystack easy to find the needle you okay get the bug off get the bug off he Test be not do he be choke Patchy infiltrate on the X Ray Patient improve with chest PT and oxygen consistent with aspiration so now we have another symptom to explain why do his throat think his lung be his stomach and why be your throat close up should not we be in separate room you think I be go to run two differential this time in the morning Grumpy you be first I be not grumpy why would I call you that if you be not it be an unusual combination Unusual equal exotic equal foreign have to be connect to his trip to Thailand you practice medicine overseas I be with doctor

patient have spinal muscular atrophy he have document trouble swallow the choking 's not new so it be nothing be new what cause the old Strongyloides worm explain the fainting we already treat so he be all well woman who Thirteen have not get any bad it be a pretty passive approach for the daughter of an alcoholic Wrong again we could stress his system put he on a tilt table if he stay conscious mean we make the right diagnosis and we win then why have not you six against four one of the man 's go to have to join the woman 's team on the other hand one of the man be not an actual doctor so I guess it be pretty fair man you be in the penalty box who be not the doctor I be glad you ask about that Reason I be penalize you be time management in diagnostic you be always work against the clock the woman come up with a theory and they treat the patient you guy just sit around in a lab hope a series of blind test would give you a theory you waste the patient 's time now I be go to waste yours her gum be turn yellow whatever it be it be in her liver now Fungal fit perfectly we be wrong we be go to keep be wrong until we be right or till she die yeah that be very helpful need a team to tell I we be mortal look I be sorry you be right it do not hurt to be remind that we be deal with real stake here Liver failure be a bad thing but it be also a clue what do it tell we I can not let you leave I think you be still suicidal I be not try to off myself no that be right you be just try to kill a wall I check this box and your next roommate be go to be Jesus and crazy Mcloonybin that guy

way big than that there be something out there something more hey can I have my knife back no who the hell be not a doctor House say we can not talk he mean we can not talk about the case House be just jerk we around it be what he do you be not curious only one reason you would not be curious we should talk about the case he be punish we for waste time maybe we should not be waste this time close that door you be go to get we all fire we need to find a link between fainting and trouble swallow we need to know if it be dysphagia or full blow achalasia Paraganglioma how would a neoplastic growth in his abdoman explain not his abdomen in his neck a carotid body tumor cause trouble swallow Food press against the vagus nerve and cause the fainting so if this guy have cancer we get to keep our job if he be healthy we be fire we need a CT to prove it we need the woman not to figure it out while we be sit here and do House 's computer have a build in microphone there be a potential toxicity in the experimental treatment I be never here blood pressure 's remain stable through 60 degree no pause on his ekg no nausea our treatment work I need our patient Syncope 's cure Amber it be over you obviously have not stress the system hard enough you crank it up high enough anyone will pass out this be incredible this be the most I 've move in 40 year the tilt table test show that the patient 's EKG BPM pulse remain normal despite who be you thirteen my name be in the file fact that you do not answer my question tell I more about you than answer could no it do not we turn the thing

man 's life key word be try Tilt table test confirm that you guy be wrong you be fire ah the prodigal son returneth you be also fire we think there be a tumor on the patient 's esophagus we be right about the area wrong about the diagnosis turn out the esophagus be just straighten it be sclerodma explain the syncope and the choking he need steroid you do a CT scan obviously after you be already prove wrong good for you it be too bad you be wrong Straightening indicate weaken not harden SMA explain the weakening Strongyloides infection explain everything else you lady have the honor to give the patient a feeding tube discharge he and show up for work tomorrow the rest of you you be a disappointment you make I want to stop dangle it be the good two week of my life I think I will miss you most of all ridiculously old fraud do you think House could be wrong I think he fire you no he fire the man I do not think he be wrong if he be how would I prove it I just say I do not think he be well thinking be not good enough you have to run a blood test for anticentromere antibody would you mind run the lab you can not well I can but no I be make a statement you 've be fire so you no long have lab privilege you be not come here for advice you be come here to con a favor to save your job sorry I be not work for he anymore but he can still make my life miserable and you have a chance to make his life miserable I be insult you con Cameron by appeal to her humanity I tell she what she want to hear and you tell I what you think I want to hear if it be any consolation I think your motive be more interesting I can not believe he fire you go draw his blood I will meet you in the lab when I be do here guess you do not find your tumor the other doctor tell you that you be fine yeah they say it be just my disease get bad you come to term with this disease you know it be there you know it be wait and every now and again it take something away take my walking take my modesty now it be take one of my last pleasure well there be an outside shot that something other than the SMA 's cause your eating problem and if it be we can fix it and remove that tube be that my blood it be green what do that mean it mean I be not fire be he a vulcan if no what make nimoy blee green be we officially unfire how do we know she do not fake the green blood because that would be stupid and while she may be manipulative Borderline evil shallow they get it I be not stupid what contrast do you use for the CT ICM his kidney be not work they do not filter the contrast wich in ICM be green 10 point let us add kidney failure to our list of symptom what be these point that how you be decide who to fire I be go to fire the next person who ask I who I be go to fire now we be on the point system what happen to man against woman forget the game what do you mean forget the game I mean forget the damn game the guy 's kidney be fail we need to diagnose exactly I think we be diagnose you be diagnose now I be too I think that thirteen be right about the strongyloide I be obviously wrong okay kidney failure aspiration fainting go Kidney failure could be the result of a gram negative bacteria our patient wear a catheter full time it virtually guarantee bacterial infection which could have migrate up to his kidney Infection stress his already weaken system make his SMA bad that explain the choking and fainting Put he on an IV AMP and gent our team 's scleroderma diagnosis still hold test could have be negative because the blood be taint with contrast do a skin biopsy get a side of lymph node to confirm I could have you fire you already have I fire just prove than I can and be the man wrong no it do not change the fact why be you yell at I because perform test for someone who be not a doctor in this hospital you be frustrate you want help I be here if you just need to vent leave a message I like he well like this you Patient develop pneumonia his lung be fill fast we start he on antibiotic nothing we be wrong and you be here to say we be wrong too he do not have scleroderma Biopsy reveal no fibrotic change cervical lymph node have black fleck small area of necrosis it be nothing you say nothing I say cancer it be a bit of a stretch to jump right to cancer I be not jump broad spec have not work so it be not bacterial fail liver despite treatment suggest it be not fungal and her high lactic acidosis point towards anaplastic large cell lymphoma also suggest Infection which be a lot easy and safe to treat large cell lymphoma be incredibly aggressive she will be dead in a week if we follow the textbook unless it be infection in which case you radiate she and she will be dead in a day I know you have some experience with that I 've see doctor do this before go

because do not assume anything do not fall into that trap be he okay burn his hand pretty good his heart stop for nearly a minute your cohort manage to restart it but he have not regain consciousness so since I have you all here we should probably talk about your actual patient clear fluid from the lung indicate that it be probably not cancer so it would be nice if we could come up with a new idea you be an idiot you nearly kill yourself that be the whole idea you want to kill yourself I want to nearly kill myself be he well no but he do not have cancer we think it might be eosinophilic

right here and now life who think there be an afterlife and you want I to nothing just need a place to hang low for awhile I be pretend to be spook because because if my soon to be brain dead patient think that I believe she maybe she will let I chat with her mother 's ghost the one you do not believe exist exactly the ghost be a hallucination which be the result of a delusion which most likely be the result of a hereditary disease that her mother die from when the patient be four and you think you can tap into her subconscious memory by tap into her hallucination she might not know what cause her mother 's death but she will know how she act before she die you be quite impressed with yourself right now be not you who would not be well that should be long enough back in a flash take your time be my grandfather still here no he should be right back he just go to get some warm milk but your mom be still here right yes of course I know she be fine now but when you be 4 or 5 she get sick no you sure she be not in any pain I be not in pain she be just tired and sometimes she would stay in bed all day do she ever fall down of course everyone fall down once in awhile sometimes not that often how often maybe it be actually more than once in awhile remember that time in the bathroom a few time once she hit her head on the bathroom sink there be blood all over the floor I get it on my sweater they take she away to the place where the doctor make she well but before that what about her arm and leg do she ever walk funny like sort of bent over I think that be from grow up on the farm what about her hand she ever have any difficulty sew button a shirt no but sometimes my hand would um shiver like I be cold but I be not I never quite understand she use to get the shiver like she be cold start she on l dopa and bromocriptine it be just parkinson 's Cole How be it go with your patient still see stuff I hear house be treat you like crap he treat everyone badly yeah but I hear you be special oh I can handle it maybe you should not he be go to walk all over you if you let he that say nothing about I just he House respect people who be not afraid of he get in his face yell if you

Mri do not indicate any cerebral ischemia but she have show some focal weakness urinary retention yes those be her big mystery symptom not the hallucination that vasculitis do not explain unless it be retinal vasculitis House this guy may be smart and I be sure he be great to share a beer with but if he do not know that visual symptom be an electrical issue not vascular two separate system so be the bank and the power grid but if I do not pay my bill my light go out Vasculitis restrict blood flow to nerve mess with electrical function Acute intermittent porphyria 's a well fit if you be wrong

have I humiliate you in the last half hour no check your email how be it go great the only way he could turn any more cheek be by pull down his pant he be not a wuss it take a lot more strength hey we

boss would it hurt the patient if you let we run some test you 've get three hour we 've run six complete tox screen test for every heavy metal poison and biological agent we can think of it say here he eat a lot of chestnut hold on a second if the squirrel liberation army 's involve I be outta here those little rodent be Horse chestnut be poisonous if someone switch they Horse chestnut may look like chestnut but they taste like a horse 's low than chestnut which make the theory that he accidentally eat a couple of hundred slightly less persuasive and see as how he be prowl the back alley of Tehran it be not tehran it be oops you almost get I unless we know the local environmental factor poisonous flora you know I can not tell you that well then why be we here you might as well just Google poison all they would tell I be he spend the last 11 month in Bolivia who you go to kill in Bolivia my old housekeeper we do not kill people I be sorry who be you go to marginalize if it be my

just pancreatitis he be not an alcoholic and unless his pancreas be in his finger spy can not get fungal infection and the burn on his skin spy can not get sunburn Bolivia do not have sun so either we go with his theory of the non drink drunk or he be poison by some group with the resource to make it completely untraceable some customize isotope let us treat for radiation poisoning the iodine be to protect your thyroid Antibiotics be to handle infection should start work in a couple of hour we should celebrate with a beer or eight I do not drink I think he doth protest too much he be deathly ill why would he lie about drink Guilt over kill a man make anyone hit the sauce we do not kill people right you just lie to your friend and family establish false identity trick people into betray their country he would never cover up his drinking he be too honest something I 've always want to know that poison lipstick that ginger use to kiss Gilligan why do not that kill she okay drum roll LP be

think lupus will win you a prize still think it be lupus yeah I to in case of emergency go to the emergency room could be lupus that be what we figure then why be you here you be an immunologist we want to confirm who be you look for I to help you sell down the river House or Cuddy Foreman sorry he be push MS think that because he be in charge he have to prove he be the smart guy in the room all I 've hear about you you put the patient above everything else that be why everyone find you so annoying all House care about be result I know I be talk about how to do deal with Foreman so be I Fever 's down to 101 5 Treatment 's working try to figure out which treatment 's working it be kind of tacky do it front of the patient you put she on steroid too we have no choice the sed rate point to lupus and the a NA rule it out doctor Legs hurt I can not feel they at all I do not think I can move they vital stabilize Tummy ache be go as well so the treatment 's working Wanna ditch Dr Killjoy and hop in the company jet little trip down mexico way and I be not talk about the country or the plane do you think act like an idiot and talk about sex work on girl well if it do not the human race would have die out long ago you be pretty cheery for someone who be just prove wrong about his pancreatitis theory I be appropriately cheery for someone who be be prove right John have not vomit in

I be just jerk you guy around gestalt you be unbelievable well let us ask John if he would rather be sick honestly or cure dishonestly John John any chance he be just Overwhelmed with gratitude Paralysis it be a new symptom big white space on the board where it would fit Nice multicolore marker I be not write it because we can not know if it be a real symptom when these two go rogue and pump she full of ste steroid do not cause paralysis she be also on interferon give she both probably fry her immune system who know what infection you could cause we consult an immunologist she say we have she you talk about Dr Cameron she think lupus she tell you to start treat yes they 've ignore you they screw up and it be fun watch you spank they but can we get back to the medicine the last thing any of you give a damn about be the medicine look I be not say you be bad doctor or bad people but House be he create a nasty little cutthroat world plant you in it and be watch you play and none of it work for anyone except he and whoever win give its quick progression we get to assume botulism I will go to her place check out her fridge and pantry it be not botulism it be polio Brilliant we should search her home for FDR 's remain or a time machine she could have contract it from anyone who be be to Africa or she be be vaccinate vaccine wear off there have not be a single american case in over 20 year I 've see this disease I know what it look like that be why you be find it because you be look for it Polio it be crazy House would not think so so go find House and tell he your

confirmation he should be bring up on charge okay relax I will take your book out from under my piano he be die of radiation sickness he be obviously in pain all of which could have be avoid if you have not interfere with what be that for Radiation sickness kill specific cell at specific time his hair should be come out in clump before he be writhe in pain since it be not I know who be try to kill he God it be blood cancer Waldenstrom 's radiation can cause infection which set off if have any real evidence of foul play you would be torture Bolivians instead of put I into a state of anticipatory sexual arousal can we treat for both bad idea unless you be the one who be try to poison he I will arrange for plasmapheresis and chemo be you go to trust he after what he do I do not have to trust he to agree with he you make a good point I 've be wrong every time and she still will not listen to you so either she really like I or she really hate you and I get a ride in the jet hi

Mrs Bearman wait never mind that be funny it be not funny it be totally immature it be funny you just can not appreciate it because you be the victim yeah I deserve shame and ridicule for offer a consult Unheard of for a doctor you do not offer a medical consult you offer a dealing with Foreman consult for the good of the patient it be what House would have do Maybe House will hear about it and tear up with pride you think I be try to impress he I think that for someone who be not involve in his team you be remarkably involved in his team let it go let he go and that be mature 120 over 80 let ' er rip now we get the medical stuff out of the way why do not we meet back at your place for some enhanced interrogation technique my safe word be help please please stop it be two please

Chase have another pool go they fly I in to help deal with a sick employee how much Hallucinations Damn I should not have bet on the viagra okay call the langley switchboard ask for extension 3578 3578 he ask an awful lot of question for a valet you know I happen to have a position available on my penis wait a second I think I screw up that joke you offer I a job I would settle for that as tempting as a position on your staff be I like it here pay well and we 've only have one assassination attempt and I be sure you be a great boss that be why your fellow leave en masse a couple of month ago I have satellite image Inspector Gadget my God you be actually at the CIA you 've get to get down here they 've get a satellite aim directly into Cuddy 's vagina I tell they the chance of invasion be slim to none but Waldenstrom 's recommend dose be 25 milligram per meter square they do a background check on you 25 milligram they do a background check on you they do a background check on your friend relax I be sure they already know that you bring heroin back from Afghanistan that that be not true I 've never be to Afghanistan House she be get bad Fever 's rise slightly but it be definitely Botulism right because if you be wrong again and you be treat she for something she do not even have the antitoxin have not have time to work yet I know it be hard but try to be patient excuse I I know you be piss I interrupt but you be go to be even more pissed in a second you test she without tell I yeah and I know I be really really sorry but on the other hand it be a positive she have polio now what boss where be House he be blow off four hour of clinic he be consult for the CIA seriously call langley and ask for extension 35 3536 there be definitely two three I I write it down I have it somewhere he be go to make up twice his skip hour in the clinic Okeydoke and for protect he you be go to make up twice that why be you punish I bad than he because House never learn you might how be you feel like crap yeah cancer can be that way my hair be fall out that the chemo no it be too quick so what do it mean it mean you do not have cancer someone actually do try to kill you you be stubborn you be arrogant there be no need to yell you may have cost that man his life he be get the radiation treatment 24 hour too late I do not yell at you when I think you be wrong I be not wrong this be not productive there be no productive it be too late because of your inexperience your poor judgment and your failure to recognize a reckless fool Cordyceps sinensis it be it be an herbal treatment derive from a parasitic fungus come from caterpillar along with dimercaprol chelation it be be show to mitigate bone marrow damage from radiation poisoning in monkey I be sorry I be stubborn and arrogant Self recrimination will not help her Nothing 's go to help she she be get polio there be no cure but there be treatment she be die yeah every death be a tragedy Funny how you be not so depressed when she just die because I and Amber screw up and I be also self center thank for clarify do not forget self pity vitamin c extremely high dose it be experimental treatment protocol in the ' 50 and they have not finish yet they lose funding that be because there be no logical reason vitamin c would cure polio well someone think there be someone think black people make excellent farm implement I be not talk about hurt anyone I just wanna force feed she some orange juice you wanna throw in some bacon and egg as well if there be anything you learn today it be get to be that you can be wrong John can you hear I we be go to start you on an experimental treatment tea it be a chinese herb which have be effective in I be die be not I probably we be go to attempt an experimental protocol a new drug an old one Vitamine C Ultra high dose have be show to destroy the polio virus and heal nerve damage she could regain use of her leg it be unlikely but we be go to try do not give up Nausea 's not as bad radiation sickness have a latency period you will get well before you get bad you wanna know what I really do down there only if it be interesting the woman there during carnival they they do this dance they call it the Devil Dance not interesting I spend all 40 day with this Attache to the minister of defense the most button down woman you would ever meet you know ' Cept when she do this dance she agree to tell I stuff okay we have half a good story there Karma good way to rid yourself of that guilt be to confess your sin this pain be right it be comfort it make I think that somehow it all make sense what do you mean 40 day when they find out what she tell I Carnival in Bolivia 's only eight day you have any idea what a chestnut look like you idiot who be you call an idiot whoever know that John be station in Brazil not Bolivia Brazil well then I guess I be talk to you idiot it be the same region it be the same parasite same disease but not the same language in Bolivia chestnut be chestnut Brazil on the other hand hascastanha do para literally chestnut from para because it would be stupid for people from Brazil to call they Brazil nut so he eat Brazil nut big deal no he eat a lot of Brazil nut which be a big deal because they contain selenium which in high dose cause fatigue vomiting skin irritation discharge from the fingernail bed and hair loss any of that sound familiar can you treat it we 've already start Treatment 's chelation same as for radiation sickness the only difference be it work a lot well on nut poisoning so what be the problem you be an idiot why be she shiver low serum calcium be a side effect of the treatment I can give she a calcium supplement my arm hurt infusion rate have to remain high for the treatment to work be it work you feel that yeah it hurt it be work this be fantastic there be a lot you can learn in my fellowship a few new procedure I could teach you course we would need a nurse to prep I know how to kill a man with my thumb actually I be just try to make another euphemism for sex so be I oh God how can you flirt with this idiot he lie to we again and again he break law ethical code I be right that do not mean everything it mean a lot Dr Curtis Dr House appreciate your help when when you be die you try to infect I because you know I would fight for you if I think I be die too you bring this up now so I will forgive you for mess with my patient I be happy I change job but I know I will never have that sort of Excitement you Miss people try to kill you no I miss People do whatever it take to get the job do I guess that be why I be have trouble give it up I should not have help they mess with your patient they have to screw with I I 've get everything wrong I do not believe it you be not go to get everything right but you be never go to get everything wrong Morning where have you be the last two day Overslept we save speed racer she have polio we cure it with vitamin c yeah I cure depression with tonic water once actually I think there be some gin in it too 150 gram over six hour it work no it do not I tell you you can not cure polio that mean either she be not cure or she never have it since she be walk out of here I test her blood from admittance no polio that mean Brennan screw up the lab test or you screw up your lab test you must have she get well so it be relapse and remit maybe Porphyria no that be a stretch if she have porphyria you would have see purple urine you think it be more likely he cure polio they believe it her symptom fit perfectly and the alternative be unbelievably convoluted some doctor would have to poison she with valium so it look like polio then fake a lab test then give her vitamin c and stop the poison so she magically get well actually it be kind of doable right so what do you think should we test she for thallium before you contact Stockholm you poison she the really shocking thing be that Foreman be right about the heatstroke vitamin C cure polio I 've see it yeah in some Bush clinic you need polio in a place with a proper lab the only problem be that place with proper lab do not have polio there be no money in find cure for disease that only kill poor people this will make they do research and what do you care if I fake a lab test if it save a few thousand life I do what I have to do be not that what you hire we for which be why I be not go to fire you you be go to quit go on get out of here so you be just go to let he go absolutely I be go to let he get as far away as possible before you call the cop Guy 's a nut job who the hell do I leave in charge Foreman there be a reason for that next time listen to he where have you be and do not say the CIA okay by the way one of my employee either you be go to have to get someone from the CIA to call and confirm your story or you be do eight clinic hour and Wilson be do 16 I be in the Hamptons I be help some rich hedge fund jerk treat his son 's sniffle Fascinating as that sound for your honesty I will forgive your hour thank you no the only thing less likely than your help the CIA be your help some rich guy on Long Island you be do your hour and Wilson 's I know how to kill a man with my thumb who do not hi hi I be go to take you up on your offer yeah I I live a couple mile from here that be not the offer I mean I give notice today you say you be happy at the company I lie doubt you will hold it against I I will see you at 9 00 on monday we just arrive yeah the kid 's okay on your end good yeah he be very excited hey listen I get to go okay I will call you tomorrow excuse I get away get away sorry about that sorry what be wrong with he excuse we I would get to go back kick the hell out of that guy she be old enough she do not have to scream like that it be okay dad it do not bother I for the first time none of these people bother I I just think 36 more hour 36 more hour how do you figure that Kenny tomorrow at this time I be schedule for surgery it be a ten hour procedure throw two in it for prep 36 until I be just another face in the crowd Kenny have a frontonasal encephalocele it be a midline deformity he be here to undergo a facial bipartion and what do that mean well we have five surgeon four nurse it be go to require 6 unit of blood will it fix he it will repair a lot of the damage do by we need a sound bite would you say he will be ready for the junior prom yeah yeah that be probably true no I mean I need you to say it Dr Chase we get an issue Heart rate 's sky rocket he be over 180 he be in V fib Paddles charge to 300 turn that camera off be this a reaction to anesthesia have not give it yet Clear Crank it to 360 I say turn that damn camera off Clear Transcript swsub com Sync ¤akazab¤ BlueDoc Season 4 Episode 7 ugly a teenage boy with a cranial facial deformity be about to undergo a reconstructive procedure when he have an unexplained cardiac arrest good Good I mean go on we have the patient on a pacing wire it be the only thing keep his heart go yeah we know we be doctor right it be just for they just be yourself until we be able to figure out exactly what be cause the heart block the reconstructive surgery be on hold obviously that be yourself Fascinating case I will see you again after I have save his life have a warm bath wait be you follow I Darnell will be trail you throughout the case pretend we be not here if I do that will not I bump into you we will stay out of your way that be a joke see I become a doctor because of the moviepatch Adams listen you wanna get ahead of I maybe back up I do not know low down so I look more powerful that be perfect yeah also my eye look well in room with summer color you know what it be black and white you think I like the camera you think I want the whole world watch you check out my ass and question my wardrobe would it be well if I check out your wardrobe and question your ass a little part of I there be no little part of you think that maybe you would see what great pr this could be for the hospital and not make I force you to act like a human being you use force on I be intrigue on the other hand camera make people act sometimes like human being sometimes just weird sometimes they wear open tip bras it be cold in here a less obvious point be that I need my team to be unafraid of the metaphorical fart that production company be cover all the medical cost for this kid so either you let they continue film or the kid go home with the same face sorry about that private she wax her moustache once a month and sometimes get some pretty gnarly ingrown hair so do he hire you flat out or be you compete for one of the spot I be not sure what you mean by that she be not compete she be hand pick by House she be safe like Foreman so that take three spot down to one where be Foreman he be in the bathroom Good come on let us go for a walk walk look good on camera they give the illusion of the story move forward new patient 16 year old boy with second degree infranodal heart block post arrest any report of lightheadedness or syncope it be really not lightheadedness why do you hire her not in front of the company be we go to be on tv I be make a music video come on a little fast More energy why be you glad Foreman 's not here because he would object to what I be about to do Hey Buddy you stay in there we will be out here make sure he do not move again God finally hear myself think our patient why do you hire she because she have way more diagnostic experience than the other swimsuit model I be consider our patient have a frontonasal encephalocele with a midline cleft do not stare directly at it so what cause big head 's heart to stop Simple his big head increase intracranial pressure would cause heart block wrong 16 year they 've be test that insane noggin to death what about a congenital heart defec he have a midline anomaly on his head make sense he would have a midline anomaly in his heart too that 16 year of testing do not show why do you bring she in so late it be not fair the rest of we hey you want fair you pick the wrong job the wrong profession the wrong specie forget the deformity treat the patient like he be any other really really ugly kid infection could be endocarditis well since he do not have a prosthetic heart valve I assume you be think he be an IV drug user House say assume he be normal dealer do not ask for ID and do not care what you look like Nice you be right about the habit you be wrong about the substance blacken skin under the nose equal frostbite from huff freon Freon 's toxic damage the heart Discoloration could be acanthosis nigrican it be a common side effect of these deformity there be also discoloration on the cheek and forehead do a nuclear study if I be right you will see scarring of the heart I be not part of some game be I I give up a career because I think this be a firm offer yes this be a real offer I think she might be an idiot who she can not be an idiot she be in the CIA for god 's sake the bay of pig be a daring triumph she have good idea in Langley all your idea she be able to identify that they be good idea Stab in the dark here be she pretty she be new she be nervous she be a c cup she say one dumb thing in a differential they all say dumb thing in differential a d cup she be no good just fire she I can not I just hire her she leave a career you know that be actual guilt or I 've get to see this woman my son be not huff freon Mr Arnold Dr House be like a savant when it come to diagnostic what be his genius theory because Kenny 's not normal he be do drug to deal with his pain maybe the way to look at this be that you be normal and what be that suppose to mean you be like any other parent who think his kid can not be do drug we be do this 'cause my dad think I be on drug I be do drug behind my parent ' back at your age and I have a lot less reason to be not that your life must be miserable not that I be suggest that you should be do drug how 's school go I be homeschoole really you be lucky go to school be bore my dad take I out and it be not 'cause it be bore well I have a rough time in school too maybe not like you but you know I do not mean to compare our situation actually I guess I be compare our situation but only to show you how yours be bad you can edit that out right so I do not look like an idiot relax everyone act like an idiot around I what make you think it be not an act can I have something for my headache yeah be that new 16 year old have the same birthday I do I be go to start the test now Study show no sign of scar in Kenny 's heart it be not drug well then give I something well what be cause heart block could be toxoplasmosis we should do an lp to test for infection if it be toxoplasmosis we would have see enlarge lymph and because you be not an idiot you already know that mean you say it because you wanna do an lp look for intracranial pressure because it be intracranial pressure I be not do you think I would not notice which mean either you think I be an idiot do I look like one I be do my hair differently the kid 's get headache he be be pop acetaminophen how could you possibly think that I be do I preface that with an either it need an or or you be an idiot which be possible I be not great at judge man 's look the or and the MRI room yes Dr House frequently conduct differential diagnosis in a variety of place he feel that a change in venue often lead to a change in thinking process I have to go take care of something else just let I do a CT scan see if I be right the soon we fix the problem the soon we can get to his reconstructive surgery yeah who care if you be dead it be how you look well since you 've give I nothing well we be back to drug the one thing we know it be not decrease uptake on the membranous septum could be an artifact we can redo it but nothing 's nothing do an EP study EP study mean we have to stop this kid 's heart I will set it up House you have a minute to be disembowel I be go to thread this catheter through different area in your heart and once I 've find the right pathway I will apply some electrical energy it will stop my heart it sound bad than it be you will be fine be it go to hurt there will be some discomfort if you 've do drug I understand be different 's really hard Kenny it be more important for you to get well than to worry about get in trouble if I do drug that could explain my heart problem it could then you can do the surgery to fix my face that be why we be here you know how famous people everywhere they go people be watch they stare they never have a chance to just be you know and a lot of they turn to drug People stare at they because they be beautiful but I they just stare you okay I need to know what kind of drug Kenny and how much Coke mostly a lot of coke and then when I run out I usually go to LSD or acid those be the same thing they be you do not do drug do you I drink from my dad 's liquor we be not go to do this test I need you to turn on your side we need to intubate I need some help in here too bad you guy be go for a theatrical release vomiting blood would have make a great act out likely cause Mallory Weiss tear no pallor no melena why be you wear a tie I always wear tie I be a doctor please do not look at the camera sorry Nasal papilloma Hemorrhage could have overwhelm the heart Nice lipstick thank you bad idea Hemorrhage come after the block House let they do their job Anybody here more interested in the medicine a little less interested in the paparazzi Upper GI Bleed could be something he eat or drink maybe a peptic ulcer good except no abdominal pain Patient have not lose his appetite and the last I check the gastrointestinal tract be not connect to the heart yeah but other than that real good Nasopharyngeal angiofibrosis I just say it be not a nasal tumor Stomach cancer Tumor cause bleed body 's reaction to the tumor cause paraneoplastic syndrome which lead to heart block finally someone who be not just a pretty face you and Taub run the scope find the tumor could be dangerous if the bleeding be cause by liver failure as the result of the intracranial Liver be the one organ you can not ascribe to intracranial pressure true intracranial pressure cancause liver problem it cause an increase in the cavernous sinus pressure which cause pressure in the superior vena cava which shut down the liver you just think of that no why do not you say any think it be change his mind not a chance House would have undercut I order I to do a procedure I just argue against and then I would look like a hypocrite in front of the thousand of people and potential future employer watch this film if you be right and we stick a scope back down a kid with liver failure he could bleed again I know he just vomit blood be not that dangerous no you be in good hand okay all right well it be great how he rebound from that setback what setback he do not tell you about the well it be his right Records be seal Personally I think he be just tap his foot and reach for the toilet paper obviously it be a witch hunt do you think they single he out because no literally a witch hunt Dr House be a practice wiccan it be a beautiful religion it be very caring you have an all access pass to the case not my fave five so go Come on come on let us go I think I be go blind Hairy Palms too she say something idiotic again and I do not even notice it Foreman have to point out that it be idiotic she be make mean idiot that be cute you have a crush no I think it be something systemic Thirteen 's pretty you be obviously okay with her she kill a patient the bitch be pretty the bitch be a bitch ask she out the bitch she be a bitch no the one that be make you an idiot the story of life Boy meet girl Boy get stupid boy and girl live stupidly ever after pretty girl kill again Nope Elephant boy just vomit up blood again no tumor in the patient 's stomach so but the scope cause variceal bleeding take 20 minute of banding to stop it Taub be right about the liver failure yeah his craniofacial deformity be cause intracranial pressure no where be the nose bleed where be the labored breathing you be right about I be wrong you be wrong about you be right I need new idea Anybody do it bother you that this kid 's go to die 'cause you will not put down that camera at all you know your people should be extra motivated I be sure they all wanna look good in the film no 'cause now they be too worried about look bad Dr House heart block plus liver failure could mean autoimmune maybe scleroderma Foreman do that make sense not without tight skin on the hand muscle weakness and a 30 year old patient Liver failure plus heart block could be a mitochondrial disorder say what she just say Liver failure plus heart block could be a mitochondrial disorder go look for sign of retinal degeneration no it be ICP you be only go to see swelling take he with you so he can see the degeneration too so before you work here in the ER you work for House right three and a half year why do you leave hey I do not wanna be on tv I be not sign a release we will blur you out take off your pant you go to be able to use any of this if I start swear do House treat you as badly as he treat his current fellow load question that be not even a word Fork very clever I learn how to be a doctor from House or at least a doctor who learn how to be a doctor from House if that make any sense any you leave his team because you could not stand he anymore no no I I love Dr House that be something we have not hear I mean what do you ask I again why you leave I I love behe around he professionally you know it be always stimulate not in an erotic sense of the word Fork they fork and then they spoon lean forward and place your chin on the rest I can not reach it Scooch in a little I will take care of it just like last time maybe we should try this the old fashioned way okay look up to the ceiling and try not to blink okay okay good now straight ahead there it be swell no degeneration it be not mitochondrial swelling prove there be increase pressure in his brain absolutely so now we can schedule the reconstruction absolutely not your test prove you wrong we find exactly what I predict we would find swelling mean there be increase pressure you get a gold star of David for prove that yes this kid have a big head and big head cause pressure but it do not explain the liver too much acetaminophen do JRA explain all of it include the liver one theory 's well than two treat with steroid if you be wrong steroid be go to mess with his immune system put off his surgery for month you really wanna lose this argument in front of the camera I will speak to the father Dr House believe that Kenny have JRA juvenile rheumatoid arthritis we need to start administer steroid will the steroid fix it I do not think he have JRA I think Dr House be wrong and that the steroid treatment could be dangerous I think I can get House throw off the case and get Kenny the facial surgery he need the father refuse steroid until we be sure about the diagnosis I be sure it be JRA and why would he even doubt that unless a former fellow of mine be chirp in his ear the decision be his I merely voice my concern why would you take this job he be get a bulging cyst you have a perfectly good plastic surgery practice lot of money Fluids be not drain properly temptation to come screw with I just too much for you there be get to be a well reason he need surgery to drain it and I think I mention this early you be fire what you do be over the line get out but do not go anywhere you be not fire yet no one be fire anyone in the middle of this case not while those camera be here and not while taub be the only person that this father trust where you go to do what I always do in these situation treat my patient behind his back that be one option or you can do a CT scan of the kid 's head if there be no midline shift we know taub be wrong and you get your consent to give the kid steroid just a warning we have to start get consent every time we do a procedure soon they will be ask for informed consent do not think you have the gut to stage a coup Coup fail I be schedule for execution at

happen anyone bother look at his panel his immunoglobulin level be low that do not tell we anything specific about be you act stupid 'cause you know you be safe clever foreman low immunoglobulin plus fail heart plus fluid in the lung plus internal bleeding equal amyloidosis he be bleed way too much for amyloidosis say anything about his hand or foot feel weak cole he say his hand feel numb but that be explain by the blood loss no do not give I credit for that close do not count that be how people get suck into this stupidity he be seize somebody stabilize he rest of you pull his medical record go back ten year look for joint pain fatigue anything associate with amyloidosis you have a grand mal seizure we be give you liquid and an anticonvulsant just try to rest Pulse be drop he be stabilize you be not go to put I on the block be you I have not decide who I be go to pick that be cool his leg look swollen to you slight swelling could be renal I babysat for you I decide I be go to

amber 's a racist wilson you know they would get page I notice a trend if nobody do anything sick people often get sick you think it be remotely possible they have sex they be both single it be still legal in the blue state she barely know he you know in some culture hire people to steal someone 's underpant be consider woo you should move there because here it be just you know creepy there be no woo this be an effective test this be beneath my skill kutner kidney be shut down lead to a sodium deficiency cause he to seize Kidney failure mean I be right about amyloidosis except that nothing in his medical history remotely indicate amyloidosis so kidney failure prove I be right about the bad blood bad blood do not explain the heart or the liver his major symptom do not start until after we transfuse he be cardiac arrest no long consider a major symptom not when it be cause by drown so your new theory be that you be an idiot to take this case yes can I go test that theory now waste of time he need a bone marrow transplant for the amyloidosis you would have to irradiate he first if they be right about the blood you would be destroy his immune system for nothing which could be a good thing do he have a really crappy life go prove I be right do a subcutaneous fat biopsy at least let we eliminate the bad blood theory check the blood bank for mis mark and contamination you 've get two hour that be completely arbitrary no if I would say that you get three lunar month that would be completely arbitrary two hour be how long it be go to take big love to finish a biopsy that you guy

kidney liver we stick another needle in he he will hemorrhage unless we start treatment for amyloidosis unless it be not amyloidosis if he have an infection the radiation will kill he show I evidence of infection we need more than two hour some of these culture will take at least a day to grow he will be dead in a day like he predict o he will be half a day off would it make you guy feel any well if I let you argue with I for three minute before I order you to treat for amyloidosis no just treat for amyloidosis no do not you be play the cuddy card that be why I be here Amyloidosis be your idea I be wrong yeah I too you be never fun give I the blood I be type ab give I the blood kutner whatever be in there could be kill he in where how much tainted blood do you think they keep in here how

any additional Tests you lose the patient Taub you check lose and find Thirteen come with I why do you love drug addict I will not pigeonhole the patient so that mean I be perfectly capable of draw my own conclusion be you capable of answer a question I think there be more to he than the drug Admirable why I need a reason for do something admirable there be always a reason he be a patient you do not know he why do you like he the alcoholic parent druggie youth there be no such thing as a saint without a past or a sinner without a future what make you so sure that drug be a mask for something else drug be always a mask for something else that be the dumb thing I 've hear in my life you really want this job you think you can talk I into leave you be a person who like her privacy work for a man who need to know everything you be a person who care about her patient work for a man that care about game I hear he so neither sleet nor hail nor dread of night wait wait wait Malaria 's not contagious child I bid you good night and I be off which one of you guy sap my power be it you do you take my power maybe it be you well no matter see I be feel strong already it be okay it be okay he be okay Respiration 's good pulse be solid we need a lot of nurse in here Dr Cuddy that face that launch a thousand long face get control of your patient strap he to the bed if you have to I want to keep all four you can have two you do not get negotiation do you I say four you say three we finally settle on three and a half which would be good news for Taub you do not want four you do not want three but if I say three you get to keep play your game who would you pick be you ask my opinion if you have any absolute truth that would be even well you never want my advice you spend your life try to avoid my advice you be a bureaucratic nightmare you be a chronic pain in the ass and you be a second rate doctor at good be I blush but you do know this stuff can we get this over with Taub and Kutner Taub will stand up to you you will not like he but you will respect he Kutner share your philosophy of medicine God know I do not need two of you but he will actually help you it be not malaria Bloodwork 's negative but we do find the reason for the DIC Bad blood fragment if we can figure out how they get there blood exposure during sex Hemolysis from the malaria med stop guess you will spoil the surprise if you be look to get information out of the guy he be not exactly the bare your soul type I be wonder if you guy know girl from Ipanema what be you do nothing what be you do that be mine man you be go to be deny that in a second next time make sure you bring enough for the whole class he be be share needle with this guy as he inject this guy 's blood his own blood attack it chew it up those be the fragment we find so DIC be nothing we be back to bloody vomit and his two dozen other drug or non drug symptom re check everything throw these guy out and strap the patient down House respiratory failure good news for you thirteen that be definitely not drug the blood clot be drug relate the coughing up blood and the respiratory arrest be still on the table inhalant if I would want a knee jerk drug diagnosis I would have tell Foreman where we be he know where we be because he follow you I follow Taub I follow she he have a bleeding problem that could cause respiratory arrest if I want to forgive his drano drink way I would not ignore what you just say could be an infection no the lumbar puncture 's clear what lumbar puncture you do not authorize that test true and yet here I be with the result thirteen think it be bacteria meningitis and I have the eyeball it be a harmless test Patient 's welfare still count for something do not it Yep Minus 50 chronic pulmonary embolism would explain the breathing problem and the blood come from his lung I will run an you be not run any test he know it be not PES the guy 's d dimer 's normal do not always rule out go in to run one test run eight more like she do find out which one 's right then come back with a brilliant guess be this true no too bad cause that would have earn you 40 point for cleverness the point go to Amber Foreman you run the test Sure anything I can do to help your game he be not go to run the test I do not think so so what be wrong with I you mean besides your music well sure cause I do not play tour kind of music it be not music right yeah I resent you because you be not perry como look I do not I do not play for an audience okay well then that stage you stand on be an odd choice I just I do it for I okay I do not do it for you you have three choice in this life be good get good or give up you 've go for column D why simple answer be if you do not try you can not fail be you really that simple look you know some people they like my music Most people can not stand it but they just sort of just shrug and ignore I but a few the feel like they have to tell I what I be screw up you know what I be waste why do they care you have some peculiar masse near your heart Peculiar how well unlike your music they elicit some emotional response that be odd what you care if I appreciate your music but you do not care if you live or die maybe the answer be that simple I can not apologize enough to you to your family there may not be any technical liability here but you be rip it up because you think it would be wrong to take money from I I think it would be wrong so little money from you you be out 6 000 you ruin my life I ruin three month for the first time in my life I be live in the present Cause that be all there be you be sue I not for the wrong diagnosis but for the right one have you speak to a lawyer you give I happiness and then you take it away definitely no embolus it be pretty fuzzy hey for point and shoot I think I do okay it be fuzzy because he be still shake cause be come down from the heroin where be everybody else the clinic 's be quarantine a patient come in with avian flu like symptom and 50 extra dollar in spend money can you do this echo again okay minus five for ingratitude no thank you Dr House no here be a bottle of codeine for your trouble Dr House I be ask if you could do it again after give he a sedative to keep he still I could we would definitely get the answer but since the opiate would decrease his respiratory drive and he already can barely breathe minus ten for ask I to kill the patient what if it be a congenital defect an anomalous vessel on his heart you know that the heart do the blood stuff right and the lung do the breathing if the vessel wrap around his trachea what do you want I to do MRA see if you can get a clear picture of that vessel what wait what what why you say the picture suck because the patient be shake MRA will be bad we have to get a picture you be do well before you have a good idea how can we see it if we do not take a picture you can see I right we want to look at his heart with our eye so I kill the patient on my operating table you get to keep test your team and I take the heat from Cuddy if it go that way yeah that will be excellent his respiratory status be through the floor if there be a vessel and we do not remove it fast good case he be on a ventilator for life grant it will be a short one who do you think I should hire you want I to tell you in front of he it would be rude to ask he to leave now if you do not do the surgery the patient will die you will have have nothing to do with it and everyone will know that have nothing to do with it everyone will know that it be because you be piss off at House for fire you you know that be not why I be say no but that be how it be go to play out keep he and Amber you will get stuff do prep he for surgery this be not an anomalous vessel look at these lymph node way too big there be the masse you see 70 over 40 he be crash two unit of PRBCS start dopamine we be lose he so how be your game go it be not whether you win or lose respiratory failure enlarged lymph node whatever this be he be not go to be breathe much long do Foreman be here mean the game be over it mean the patient 's life be almost over you can call it what you want we be do people come on I need idea and I do not care who they come from of course you do this be still a game you still go to reward whoever get right idea punish whoever be wrong Hire who you want get this over with Thirteen Kutner I be sorry go home why it do not matter he just tell I that get to lung be stiff could be a RDS you fluid overload he anyone 's lung would leak after that surgery good bye anaphylactic shock no sign of bronchospasm if the lymph node be cause chronic stimulation his immune system impuritie his drug could have cause Street drug be lace with all kind of thing Immune overreaction would explain everything drug diagnosis that be what you be go with that fire thing it be all a dream go find where he get his drug and what be in they Put he on dimercaprol for heavy metal poisoning Competition work so you be not go to tell I who sell you drug why do it matter you be die do that matter not really I be not an adult I never want to be so if the choice be run out the clock with a walker and a bedpan you do not regret anything well there be a lot of drug a lot of drinking a lot of fight I regret everything else you hate I do not you yeah I do not care what be it like it mean you have no regret Kinda stick in your head do not it this guy 's amazing there be not one redeem note what sort of a lawyer tell his client he be get a case because he be go to live I 've hear that not all lawyer be as ethical as the one we see on tv I do not think this guy even have a law degree a lot of the guy on tv do not either I think he have a medical degree it directly affect my bottom line you have less money to lend I be try to take responsibility and I be try to teach you that everyone be out for theirs you might as well keep yours and lend it to you you have to control everything how come you be go around ask everyone who you should fire I be ask for input I think you would have admire the humility you like game because you can control

you think you can cure pain you think you can avoid pain you think you be responsible for every failure every patient 's boring life ever friend 's screw up you do not want to face it any more than my patient do Dying 's easy Living 's hard that can not possibly be as poignant as it sound still can not find the drug source but I do not think that be the problem the dimercaprol be not work and quidd

exposure from hang out with Oliver twist and his lot I assume he be be vaccinate Patient 's immune system be shred with year of drug they be early marker of rash and fever would have be lose in a druggie his immune system overreact that be why his body go haywire that be clever you be not do a biopsy without neurological symptom if I be right the virus be in his brain wrong course of treatment could be his last course of I need a neurological he keep swallow could be neurological could be a complex partial seizure what do it look like good God woman how much more proof do you need if you can induce a seizure you can have your biopsy Hup we be go to use flash light noxious stimulation it will irritate your brain if there be damage to your neuron it will trigger a seizure that we can I get something much more noxious it be not as commonly use but sound can be just as big an irritant now remind I of your influence here Cause I be go to say thelonious monk and the sound a trash

influence over the hospital 's cable policy well do it do not work there be nothing more that put these up free rottweiler puppy please call after 11 00 pm and before 5 00 am be this Cameron 's home number I love a new puppy that last one be delicious in torture she be no point totcher if she can resign she can unresign go to defcon one forget wait for a mistake make she make one you want we to sabotage another doctor possibly harm a patient all so you can have cable Harm suggest permanent damage get she to screw up then fix it and this time do not tell she what you be go to do before you do

be check up on I not House yeah well House be straightforward brilliant and an ass two out of three good quality clear majority whereas you on the other hand have a perfect score you be you be responsible nice human and yet you be House 's good friend hold there make you think he be secretly nice than he seem make I think that you be secretly a lot less nice than you seem do you always insult your doctor it be not an insult Indiscriminate niceness be overrate no wonder he like you base on this slide you do not have cancer thank god I do see some inflammation which could mean Cate you all right my left side hurt it be the same pain that I have on the right your other Kidney no I hope it be something it be maybe no I be screw bad news be you be 0 for 2 in the Kidney department be there good news you be back at home of course there be cable and the freedom to work pant free that be good news Wilson find sign of inflammation in your biopsy that plus the two fail kidney point to autoimmune disease probably SLE or vasculitis Treatment for both be prednisone Start with 100 milligram Autoimmune be just your late theory like cancer before that and a Kidney stone before take the prednisone you will get well that will be your confirmation you practice medicine like it be a fire sale you 've waste antibiotic x ray that be not a waste we rule out we have a crew member here who have asthma if he have an episode after I 've use up the prednisone he will die there a good chance he be go to die anyway since there will not be a doctor there to help he show I proof that it be autoimmune and then I will take the prednisone we should send she outside right just tell she to head north until she run into a hospital Autoimmune disease be basically inflammation run wild Extreme cold have be use as treatment like put ice on a sprain ankle she start to feel well outside we know it be autoimmune be that my wallet yeah you can have it back I 've already be through it I like your ice on a sprain metaphor make it seem like we be not kill she she would only need to be outside five minute without her mitten Mom tell I that be a bad idea especially that winter it be 70 below and I have dual Kidney failure this be a good idea it be perfect for you experimental risky Wilson 's right you care about you do not touch the cash but you take the receipt 190 restaurant tab that be dessert probably booze mean you linger mean it be at least the third date mean where be you go to talk to the people I pay to come up with medical idea there be no idea the test for autoimmune be a N A unless penguin poop immuno analyzer she be not before a N a testing people have autoimmune disease how do they know C3 before that L E Prep but she do not have any control pore glass bead you do not need they when you shake the test tube the paperclip will damage some of your blood cell if you have an autoimmune disease your immune system will gorge itself on the damage cell they will get big and fat so you can see em under a microscope how you do no change so how long should I give the cell to fatten up before I check they Couple hour or you could stop be a hypocrite and take the prednisone now not bend to your will make I a hypocrite if your psych patient demand lab result you would never make a diagnosis so I be wrong you sleep like a baby your life be unfold as you dream everyone be miserable you do not change that because people do not change you want to believe that because then you be free from any responsibility for your misery Shut up I get enough of this from Wilson and yet you keep hang out with he and from what I hear you have spend more time with I than with any other patient sorry about that call I when you get the result how be your patient she have an autoimmune disease tell the psych department she be in denial I have to fire Cameron what what happen 65 year old man come into the e r with a hip fracture Cameron give he demerol the guy be on an M A o I Put he into a hypertensive crisis be he go to live Taub catch the error in time if she would just admit the mistake maybe I could 've just suspend she but she be pack up if you want to say good bye we should be hear from the south pole in a few minute that be it there be nothing to be do she screw up she be get no one to blame but herself I get to go talk to Cameron Cuddy would not can she for one screw up and if she do she would not come to I and if she do she would not open with how be your patient and if she do why would she lie Timeless question in this case she conspire with your coworker to teach I that some thing be more important than cable and I be go to have to teach they that they be wrong come on south pole really should be call L E Prep test be negative it be not autoimmune you be base that on a test do with a paperclip just take the prednisone either find another diagnosis or find another test there be one way you can take this experimental drug call Prednisone your Kidneys start work there be another test I I think Foreman may've just break up there what he actually say be there be no other test if you have an autoimmune disease exposure to the cold should decrease your kidney pain if I go outside we will have our answer and you know about this I reject it because if you be freeze solid it be hard to get the needle into your arm how long do I need to stay out at least five minute eight minute outside would kill a healthy person and healthy people do not suck on oxygen mask healthy people can pee I will go get sean have he come with I just take the prednisone once I come inside if it be autoimmune be you all right I be sure she be just fine Cate See if there be anye down there who have a cell phone take the station mechanic 20 minute to respond she would already slip into a coma start she on prednisone but no improvement mean it be not autoimmune good thing she be in a coma or we would have to listen to her gloat and where be we go to find the useful member of my team you be let he off the hook Happy because of you I be not go to be able to watch law and order in Korean why be I here because I want to ask you about your girlfriend I must know who

your ex wife your mama you need to run a Kidney function test yes if only she be not in a coma we could get she to run a test to find out why she be in a coma the result would likely be paradoxical can not be Cuddy 'cause you be straight can not be we could talk the mechanic through the test too complicated unless he be thirsty drink her urine if it have a strong concentrated taste it mean the problem be in her Kidneys Watery taste mean it be her brain and then you can fix it let us say yeah how do I get the urine out of her take a straight catheter and insert it these be your only question not be it safe or be there another way or be you out of your mind you would not ask I if wait a second you be in love with her that explain why you be so eager to get her naked then have a drink 'cause most guy like to go the other way around why do you care how I feel about she because now I know that I can get you to do anything to save she tell he how to tap the keg you get Cameron fire

ignore the big symptom what if we be look at both the flu and decent parenting okay you two be perfectly healthy this guy be not pander he be not vanilla nice he be nice without any aspiration

last long enough to procreate and how long have the patient be suffer at least as long as his wife have know he 11 year the chance of he have an undiagnosed pathology for that long what be you say that evolution be wrong where do you think we be 21st century america he be say that statistic be true too the world be a bell curve Most of we fall within the standard deviation but there be outlier and if we believe in the existence of extreme jerkiness which I suspect that we do then we also have to accept the existence of the opposite extreme you want it to be a symptom because then we be suppose to be jerk which mean you do not even have to try to be nice okay maybe I be bias let us take a vote who think that niceness be not a symptom and who think that their vote count you two check

hospital hierarchy and covertly I suppose you do not know about that your attitude towards supervisory personnel be disrespectful and a disturbingly large proportion of your comment be racist or sexist that top make you look like an afghani prostitute would be an example of that sign this I get the it can wait I will sign if you will give we a ruling I will give you a ruling if you do the review on your team I would be happy to continue the mockery of this process what have you offer he wednesday till 11 00 and alternate weekend wednesday till 11 00 and alternate weekend yes Wednesday

such pleasure it be very hurtful you know it mean the patient get to keep be nice why do that offend you it be the way he say it he be not relieve he be excite he be also wrong and I say that with no sense of pleasure Patient 's negative for williams which mean the stroke and everything else be not cause you have a friendly demeanor but you sometimes get too involved you relate well to your peer and patient and you complete task in a timely manner please sign what the hell be that I have to give each of you performance review Plenty of other condition can cause debilitate niceness how be that suppose to help he I do not know how be it suppose to help wilson cross out wilson 's name and the date and then fill in your own name the point of a review be to give feedback to help I be think neurosyphilis would not show up on the MRI without contrast I will go run the test he do not think it be syphilis but he be go to go run those test anyway because he do not know that be why we do test because he be a wimp because he be afraid of you you want I to intimidate he into not be afraid not sure I know how to do that review make a difference People have to listen so they have to learn I do not think that the right time to tell the dog not to pee on the rug be semi annually you do not want to do the paperwork I be concerned about the rainfor I will do it I know I do not have syphili you do not know how many way be there to get it you can know who you have sex with you can not know who she I do not for sure it be a waste of time I have a stroke you can not keep waste time we be test

take a shower which be my fault I have to take a dump anything else I do not need to know before you leave have fun on your playdate you 've get mommy 's number right daddy need a drink I be think if we discount the niceness issue sit down I think it be a heart defect nothing on the echo could be a patent foraman ovale it explain the stroke and the syncope and a pfo would not show up on a routine echo I be go to do a bubble test you get a minute first sure I think you 've show remarkable strength in a difficult situation be you give I a performance review a good one I be go to do a bubble test there be enough blood leave over from his admission work up to run the vdrl you doubt your patient no what I think do not matter House say he would not let we go on until we rule out neurosyphilis it be not neurosyphilis it be a pfo it be neurosyphilis the test be positive it be always the same conversation they tell you you must be mistake which be why I always run the test twice and then they blame the other guy which make sense if they be innocent but obviously half of them be not they do not seem to get that they be busted scientifically prove unless your spouse cheat too exactly that be what you be pray for in that moment that she cheat too if she do not kill you you know that she do you know she betray you and then you realize that that suck bad the test must be wrong I run it twice not that test the one I take ten year ago what other explanation be there he really see no other possibility do you have an affair no then why be not you angry with he you ever know anybody who be just too nice no it be annoying then you realize it be annoying because they remind you of what you be not that you will never be as good as they be and then you think why can not I and before you know it that naive idiot you laugh at have make you a well person you really think I 've be in love all these year with a symptom if syphili cause lesion in his brain and the lesion cause personality

it be just syph you would not have wake I up in the middle of the night if it be just syph he would not be get bad he be already on penicillin Bleeding 's probably from liver damage probably cause by ethanol in the cleanser or the penicillin two more probablys than I like to hear Liver test and serology be go to take a full day full night actually Guy might not make it to brunch yes I know about your issue with alcohol yes I intentionally get you drunk to provoke an argument between you and amber why I would do such a thing be an interesting question what be more interesting be that you know

how about serum protein it be positive Kinda assume he have protein it be how much protein he have we care about it be positive for syphilis you mind if I give you a performance review not the patient

I do not feel like wait until your genital clear up you need to formalize my authority over the team no I do not you do not think I be qualified compare to those three you wanna punish Cuddy for hire I without I like cuddy I like part of her you wanna crush the team by crush I I want to empower they those three idiot need to respect you they should respect you they should be afraid of you so I have to humiliate you if the team fear you they will not question you if they do not question you they will not get answer if they do not get any answer they be useless mock I save live the hospital will probably build you a statue one day you know with a kick I sign on the back when you think about it the more I mock you the more it show I have respect for you or you make up that b s because you

when there be no proof he ever have a vision problem House be wrong about the first symptom but the guy just happen to develop a second unrelated symptom a few hour later he already kidnap and sedate the guy against his will make sense he would also do something to numb his foot so he could not leave but it do not make sense to include a symptom that he cause in a differential he be so desperate to solve unless he do not mean to cause it Stick to the filing sweetheart let the doctor do the doctoring either toxin or vitamin deficiency I be guess when you drug he you do not catch he and ease he to the floor he could 've pinch a nerve in his ankle when he fall you need to run an emg test for motor nerve entrapment or the inspector will own your ass Kutner leave the room wait 30 minute and

the last 85 pound say there be less of I to love Grief mean different thing to different people Case in point mean very little to you Grief be Newark okay it be there you can not avoid it the idea be to hold your nose hope the traffic 's not too bad and get on to Manhattan as quickly as possible not to buy property you think that be face up to thing I be not the one who be quit 'cause you have not lose anything but you have he will listen to you what do you do when your husband die I get a new job and I move see how crappy that work out separate the placenta from the wall of the large intestine Sponge suction we 've get some bleed BP 's dropping 90 systolic she be bleed like hell Clamp BP 's still drop Amp of calcium chloride fast still drop Shut up squeeze her spleen we need to force platelet out so her blood clot she be in weak shape Spleen 's friable it could rupture she be stabilize Oozing 's dry up I hate visitor day remove the fetus you have to stop Wilson from commit career malpractice talk to he I already talk to he twice he throw I out mock he and insult he let us see yes technically those be category of conversation block his reference to other hospital tell he he can not hand off his case until talk to he deal with his grief talk to he about what he be go through that be a brilliant idea I will take he out for a beer that will make up for the fact that Amber 's in a pine box that there be randomness and chaos in the universe tell he you be sorry I do not kill she you be drunk and yeah if her daddy have not be drunk she might never have be bear so you call she up in the middle of the night she be on the bus because of you I do not ask she to come out I be not drive the bus I be not drive the garbage truck that hit the bus and I do not prescribe she the flu med that kill she yes I know that be all true but you really do not feel any sense of guilt you want to keep he he need to know he be not alone just tell he you feel like crap it would be meaningless well then find some meaning and do something she be get a neurological problem surgical complication do not think so she keep on blink her heart be not recover either so the pregnancy be a coincidence Pulse be down to 39 she be maxe out on atropine we be instal a pacing wire to avoid that we need some help Page House already do Page he again it be for you if I tell you that I be sorry would it change anything I would not believe you if you believe I it be hard to imagine such a world I be go home until you agree to stay at this hospital you can not be that be blackmail and to do your job why not hold a gun to your own head your conscience bleed more freely than my head Text Patient 's in cardiac arrest Ouchy you would jeopardize a patient because of my if it keep you here your friendship matter more to I than this patient I 've get to do what be right for I you 've get to do what be right for you but it come easy for I where be he where be he Status her heart 's stabilize we have a pacing wire in she but the bradycardia be not get well House be bluff I call he he be not pick up what do we do what you would do if he be here if he be here we would be ask he what to do what be the usual suspect there be not any she have a vitamin deficiency and we correct it an ectopic pregnancy we remove it but her heart problem will not go away and now something be wrong with her brain I have complete confidence in you guy who want to go service House so this patient can live we can do this without he maybe something happen during the surgery it be on her bowel not her brain Anxiety stroke Tourette 's could all cause eye blink cause her heart to beat fast it be slow down M S if a lesion take out the sympathetic innervation of her heart it would explain bradycardia and blink but not the vitamin deficiency or the ectopic pregnancy House would want a unifying theory he be go and so be those symptom M S explain everything that be wrong with she right now start she on interferon for M S Mind if I come in not at all you mind if I leave I tell you not to take that case specifically to deal with Wilson and the two end up dovetail rather nicely do not you think be this how you show your friendship by bludgeon he with guilt because he be my friend I know what work on he you can not walk away from a patient then fire I you be willing to risk your career but youcan't say you be sorry I tell he I be sorry he do not believe it make he believe it I do not you do not want to believe it because if you tell Wilson how you actually feel about he about what happen to Amber about your part in what happen and he walk out the door anyway if you make yourself vulnerable for once in your nerve deadening emotionally obliterate you be do the same thing he be you be run away only he be not kill anyone in the process where be Dr House he be not feel well Was M S his idea we work as a team you know how it be Collaborative sometimes it be hard to tell where an idea me from but you be not really a team you work for he and you work for Patty I be sure a lot of her idea be actually she would be fine without I I would be nothing without her maybe if you just have the chance I be sure you 've learn a lot not everybody be create equal do Dr House think I have M S do you just shiver you be run a slight fever be that bad it mean we be wrong about the M S you have my cable disconnect that be quite a leap just because I happen to have a 31 person maintenance department each of whom you 've personally abuse at some point why you think I could let someone die but I be go to fold if I can not watch Celebrity Bowling that be not an unreasonable theory especially with only ten minute till your favorite soap Gee be this the remote from the doctor ' lounge this be your 911 good bye stop I be withhold your salary history from every hospital in this region you go girl and I be permanently set every tv in this building to the pottery channel unless you both sit down Welcome to couple counsel it be not the surgery the timing fit the location do not unless brain be in bowel if bacteria enter her bloodstream it could have infect her brain the surgery go fine you be there Peptostreptococcus could explain the blink and you want to watch a grainy video and have an epiphany Shut up you be make I miss House 's mocking you tell we it be none of our business but if your Huntington 's be affect you maybe it it be not I do not have you be desperate to do it without he you be not try to cure she but to prove stop the tape Zoom in on the anastomosis that little bump it be a hematoma a harmless pocket of blood which be why Chase ignore it during the surgery could be a ganglioma which be why Chase should not have ignore it it be an abnormal growth of nerve it could be cause all the patient 's symptom we have to open she up again get a piece of it so what do you want to tell we nothing nothing I say be go to change anything you guy need to talk actually you should read the psych literature Repression 's gain a lot of fan what you do not face can not crush you talk to each other how you do Good Fine thank sit see the two of you be friend look how you both think you be an idiot we both also eat with fork that do not really prove talk to he tell he how you feel about what he be do he be an idiot tell he what you think about he leave I think he be an idiot you be an idiot he be in pain and your response be just to emotionally blackmail he you tell I your position you be against it right she have not tell you in front of I she need to prove she be on my side go to hell so much for that theory I be sorry you lose Amber I can not imagine what it be you be go through but it will not get well by you walk away from everyone that care about you do you think Amber would want you to walk away nobody at this hospital even like Amber same time next week you want I to do a second major surgery on a patient we almost lose during a first major surgery to see if she need a third major surgery we need a piece of the ganglioma then you be talk about another patient Yours do not have a ganglioma and if there be one and you miss it so you be talk about another surgeon I do not miss anything but we be not talk about another videotape it show a bump we need to biopsy a bump my grandfather die of a bump she can not survive a second round of general anesthesia let alone a third you would do this for House what do you suggest because the patient 's get a high fever a low heart rate and a dim chance of survival if we stand here like idiot then I suggest you do not stand there like idiot how do you get coal out of a mountain when it be someone else 's mountain if we do not have House we can think like he but it do mean we do not have to talk like he you do not dig down you go in from the side we insert a light scope through the rectum move the intestine till we find the ganglioma then push it to the surface where we see the light we cut we will make as small an incision as we can but unfortunately it will be very painful after your surgery experience we can not give you anesthesia can I talk to Dr House no we can do this we know what we be do I do not mean to be insult but my former boss do not insist on I come here because of you or your former boss I 've be replace I be sorry you must be I be fine she have a big Beijing trip Ton of work to do she can not just wait for I to get well we 've be well train we will take good care of you how can you let she treat you like a footstool the world need flunky do not say that you be well than that I have no problem with it why do you because life be short Yours could 've end in that surgery you would have never live for yourself what kind of feminist we can have anything no we can not we can aspire to anything but we do not get it just because we want it I would rather spend my life close to the bird than waste it wish I have wing you be through the sigmoid into the descend colon switching on the light Advance toward the anastomosis that be it push the wall of the intestine toward the skin there I see it do not look down Scalpel so your last day be Friday I be go to miss you you should not go do house ask you to talk to I or be you try to save the patient because there will always be House ask I and you be do it I tell he to go to hell thank but I think he be right you think you be make a rational choice you think the bad be over and then six month later you look back and you realize you do not know what you be do be you say the pain do not go away it get easy not in two month not in two year but no it never really go away be here this building I be just in the lounge I keep stare at Amber 's locker I see a guy wear a scarf this morning the color remind I of his eye we live 500 mile from here I have to do something then do it but do not think it be the right choice because there be not one it be not a ganglioma the problem be not the surgery abnormally deposit protein it be amyloidosis that would explain the blink and the low heart rate only way to treat amyloidosis be to treat whatever be cause it it be not as if a lot of thing cause amyloid Rheumatoid arthritis Familial mediterranean fever Lymphoma we can not all be right but you can all be wrong the patient 's joint do not hurt abdominal pain go away when the fetus do and no palpable lymph node get anything constructive to say sorry sorry um she have lot and lot of palpable lymph node joint and abdominal pain she will be well by dinnertime if we do not find the cause of the amyloidosis we never get she off that wire she never walk out of this hospital but hey who need House hmm so glad we lose those training wheel you want I to make the call there seem to be some

kidney her heart blow up and Frank the old guy gasp for breath upstairs he get an intestinal graft his pancreas be fail all within eight month of each other and in each case serious complication come on suddenly and without warn which mean arrhythmia massive pulmonary embolus or cerebral bleed what do Wilson do for I if the donor have an infection that somehow slip by a screening it could lay dormant five organ system hit would need five infection for it to somehow slip by screen oh sure he make I laugh on a rainy day make I see the color I never know none of the donate organ be hit whatever they get be from the donor 's blood that would not help we narrow down to who corneal transplant be bloodless it mean Apple 's go to be fine you secure enough in that theory to send her home

that p I guy mean we do not have to break into people 's home anymore it be why you go to medical school I be not go to take that away from you he be well than we be and cost more go to biopsy the brain no say it you be right but no temporal lobe control speech hear memory she lose those thing she be go to be a terrific date but beyond that we cut out a piece of it good chance she be a vegetable nothing to hear nothing to say nothing to look back on you be right she have so much to live for do we have another patient who be almost finish with all their living so it be okay to stab his brain because he be old no it be okay to stab his brain because he be dead if you do not get the widow to say yes no the lung inflammation be a complication of the pancreatic failure which be reversible this be actually his good chance if we can find out what be wrong how can a test that will probably kill he I do not say you say it be extremely risky what do extremely mean please I be sorry I can not I have a husband I have a two year old daughter her name be Julia you would be save her mother I think you be lie you have not have one visitor not one phone call since you 've be here do she have a child no but her life be still worth More than my husband 's I lie to save my life would not you not at another human being 's expense no you would just rob I of my only chance your husband can struggle to breathe for a few more day just shut up I do not want to hear from you you want to hate I so you will not feel guilty Frank give I a scalpel charge he be code Clear Clear Clear Clear Clear Clear do you get the consent no tell Foreman to get it old people be scared of black people it will not matter Patient 's dead save the brain do not need consent for an autopsy well at well we be go to bat one for six on this one thin slice through the parietal and temporal lobe be clean Occipital and frontotemporal region be also Brain 's clean move on to where we 've go from make no sense to make less sense and then take a step backwards each of these people be kill by one thing that attack one organ but never the same organ the donor have two thing wrong or six thing wrong Metabolic disease specialize everything else specialize but cancer play the field you be back to cancer Metastasis be just a fancy word for screw around any type of cancer I do not know there would be evidence of cancer there be we just have not find it yet you need it to be cancer so you have an excuse to talk to Wilson give I something else that explain this constellation of patient then you can call I an ass I do not call you an ass Perforated intestine if this thing start as normal bacteria live in the intestine but get into a blood vessel through a vascular anomaly in the bowel wall then they would affect every organ through the blood stream it screw up everything for everyone it be a long shot it be possible I be an ass ironically we need to do a colonoscopy to confirm we check apple inside and out when she come in she be clean the anomaly must be intermittent or they would 've die within a day she be get abdominal pain shove a tube up her rear before it can get away and test anyone else with stomach pain everyone else be dead not everyone the one thing the donor give to each of these people be his dna anyone else have his dna you want to do a colonoscopy on a healthy four year old she have a tummy ache if Kutner 's right it be not a tummy ache it be a fatal brain or heart or lung or liver or pancrea ache I be not go to scare the hell out of the poor kid 's mom because of a long shot corollary to a long shot theory Fine tell she the truth then ask if Daddy know who the real daddy be do she have to be awake we need she to tell we when it hurt she will get over it your husband might not have what if a kid want ice cream the sign outside say close Dr O'shea 's not right for you what have you find out why be you investigate he 'cause I need to know if he lend money interest free what do you find out I want some ice cream not until you learn to read you be suppose to trust friend I do not know the guy I get no logical reason to be his friend have you never see an after school special that be part of the pleasure of friendship trust without absolute evidence and then be reward for that trust you be take picture of a guy who be have an affair with his sister and you be lecture I about the reward of trust there be two type of people that hire I actually there be three but the third 's irrelevant to the point I want to make you have a special rate plan for be a pain in the ass one type want to find out that they be right the other type that they be wrong which type be I you be the third type you lead with the irrelevant type the one that do not care because they 've hire I to investigate the wrong person that be an actual type you want I to check out Wilson you want to find out if how do you know about Wilson what do I do for a living have you be check I out I 've be pay for that so far you have not pay for anything you want to find out he be pine if there be something about he that will tell you he be go to come back or something you can use to make he come back be there no no there be nothing sorry that will be 900 I get to go I will get you a check Colonoscopy be clean then that just leave cancer the fact that the kid 's colonoscopy be negative do not prove anything yes the fact that it do not prove anything do not prove anything excellent point we do not know if the kid inherit anything even if she do Kutner 's theory be that the thing be intermittent the opening would have to be open shortly before death unfortunately we can not know when shortly before death be until shortly after death and that seem like an obstacle what if there be a way around that then we be kind of all sweat over nothing not around death around death as an obstacle we need to see his colon at work you do know what death mean right without a living system there be not enough pressure to get fluid life we can not create yet but pressure 's easy we use the same high pressure water jet we use to test cardiac workload I mean he be not go to be awake to tell we where it hurt it be not go to do it it be kinda stuck it be more than stuck the bowel 's be dead for six hour no matter what you shoot up there it be close this be nuts it be adjustable it be work not much increase the pressure the endoscope 's bow push on the stomach those be normal bodily fluid yeah normal bodily sewage Put the pressure back on that be the end no leak wait what be that that be dark 'cause I be at the end what if you be not at the end what if it be a core lesion maybe a little more pressure not too much if it be the end and we it be finally accelerate Apple 's heart rate have become irregular breathing be labor Colonoscopy 's still show no leak what if it be autoimmune what if we do not have conversation we 've already have four out of the five do not linger they get sick and die we do not have time to dismiss thing we 've already dismiss nothing fit see that be an example of a conversation we 've already have she be sick something fit MS no from now on no one say anything unless no one 's say it before where be you go you guy start immuno gel on her CSF to look for hidden protein marker start sequence her gene I start treatment Treatment for what cancer it be not cancer Chemo 's toxic it be something which mean we should treat she for something she be fine where be her chart you ring emergency to get her chart I know that be bad of I but I be sure the chart must be attach to the bed so that gimp doctor do not have to look all over the place while patient die thank you so much and some peppermint tea when you get a chance I need you to sign something Consent to chemotherapy you find cancer then you have test indicate Nope then why should I sign it that be a good question it deserve a complicated answer Placebo effect People have confidence in doctor they have confidence in diagnosis confidence in medicine sometimes they get a little well just because they think they will and that can make we think that the wrong answer be the right answer which be very bad so you do have proof that it be cancer but you can not tell I because it might affect the way I react to the medicine if that be true and it would certainly make sense do you think I could tell you that it be true I be practically blind before the transplant 2200 vision do not you cover all this personal stuff with Dr Foreman you do not care who I use to be you be a post corneal transplant math teacher I deduce that you be a blind math teacher I be an architect you give up architecture after you could see the world be ugly you think the world would be any different if your leg be fine think you would be any different if your leg be fine I mean the doctor tell I that my life be go to be so much well once I could see I would date I would dance but the guy I hate dance with before I hate dance with after my parent be still dead I be still alone you be fun you do not seem all that different I have not give up Wilson 's get a new job have not start yet but so who be we follow see that lady up there you point at the target no no I be follow the one halfway in between that point and that point pretty who hire you no one I just like her you be stalk she no I follow she out of that bookstore back there you be stalk she just not for very long so what else can you tell I that I might care about he attend this grief counseling thing twice a week where they go around the room and cry about who be dead Cameron 's be to his house several time they talk about death and lose love one what what be you if she turn her head she be go to see that we be walk the wrong direction no she will not I be very nondescript I be not then you stay four foot behind I how do you know what they be talk about I be in the same grief counseling group I recently lose my mother you would get lay more often if you tell they you lose a kid I do not lose a kid you be a p I who can not lie I can lie I be just not all that good at it Dr Cuddy 's be over to Wilson 's twice and phone a bunch of time Foreman call he and the rest of the time Wilson 's be read meditation book and magazine about restore barn be you follow I be you lie Lesson one commit it be make I uncomfortable sorry you be very pretty more uncomfortable she be not your type your type be much stupider than her what do Wilson say about I you 've never come up in the grief counseling or in the other anywhere I get three bug in his home and one in his car if I do not know you I would not even know you exist which be good news only two thing you ignore thing that be not important and thing you wish be not important and wish never work she be well I can tell at once Vomiting 's a side effect of the chemo her heart rate 's stabilize breathing 's good Amylase and triglyceride be both come down I guess it be work can not believe it it be cancer it be not cancer Labs show that our patient be healthy she be go to get sick then she be go to die I bring thai food what do you see in her nothing it be not cancer all the test say it be not cancer they 've always say it be not cancer Treatment prove it be cancer Treatment prove it could be cancer it be not cancer this be your diagnosis I never think it be cancer you treat for cancer I think that what she have act like cancer if it act like cancer maybe it will respond like cancer it do 'cause it be cancer we have to find something that walk like cancer talk like cancer taste like cancer but be not cancer no we do not well be well who care why I do and so do tetrault who the dead tuba player Tibalt the point be he die last but he die which mean she be go to die too Tibalt be not receive cancer medication there be a cancer drug that be use off label for arthritis there be no record of arthritis you interview all the tuba student with pain in his hand he can not play then it be not in his hand so why do we care about his student one of they be canadian bring he methotrexate so he could hide his arthritis already could not afford his insurance and that little piece of business cost I 700 I will pass it on to the patient with a steep mark up this make no sense I know she be dead unless we can find what be cancer but not cancer something 's miss I need an epiphany what be you bill out at 300 an hour here be four there be other oncologist well oncologist but I need you let I describe the symptom problem issue and say whatever you feel like say until something trigger an idea in my head that be not the way it work you have a way of think thing it be sloppy it be undisciplined it be not very linear it complement mine it drive I down avenue that I would not otherwise please go away Cancer but not cancer respond to cancer treatment but there be no how be you do not do this please please do not do this I be try to move on by hang out with Cameron talk to Cuddy Foreman but not I I pay a private investigator to spy on you you do not you wanna move on from I you get to deal with I talk to I you have no right we

but not cancer do not make any sense unless Brain but not brain Occipital lobe 's normal but her eye suck that lobe should be compensate since it be not that tell I that something be in there that should not be in there Brain but not brain why be you in my office to find the anomaly I need to chop off the top of her head pretty sure I need your approval for that I be go to trust your first instinct I be not usually confuse when you say thing like that I be order her cancer treatment to be continue why do it cost 2 300 to fix a coffee machine Cancer stem cell be real they explain everything they be like embryonic stem cell they become whatever they want Donor have they the recipient get they they float around they land on an organ got bathe in cytome and partially differentiate and the key word there be partially in the tuba player they become lung but not lung in the tennis player Heart but not heart stop I if you 've figure out the pattern they look as if they belong but they be not do their job and when they be really need boom Chemo work because cell be basically tumor Chemo shrink they you be still go to say no be not you you 've no proof I have the brain scan the normal brain scan this be why I need to take off her head to treat or to prove you be right to treat Chemo 's not kill anything it be just hide the real problem she be go to crash if we wait until she do crash it might be too late so the next step be what I say no and then you do something to make her crash so that I will think you 've prove your theory I would never do that no you will not you might want to check she I V from here it look like saline instead of chemo yeah they look identical still you should probably check you switch her med how could I I have no access close

point to a stroke or brain tumor M R I reveal no stroke or brain tumor we should do another with contrast if he be like the struggle artist I 've know he be also into drug we should what be you look at apparently a moron one e r routinely test for drug if it be positive we would not be look at this file two who pay 12 interest on a car loan how do you do you run a credit check on I no that would be illegal interestingly enough pay someone to run it for I though what it be part of my job your job be to diagnose patient which I do with the team how be I suppose to know how good to utilize that team if I do not know everything about they say the Van Gogh turn out to have neurosyphili and our last vial of penicillin be in a storeroom at the end of a 20 mile hallway with a two foot high

other hand House that be enough Dad 's right this be no time for gossip a patient desperately need our help check his head and his house can not lucas Nope he be very busy if there be a tumor this test will show we be that stuff dangerous this be just the contrast material there be a small risk of an anaphylactic reaction I could stop breathe do not worry we be prepared to deal with whatever happen you know I do some drawing this morning and they seem fine maybe it be a reaction to something I eat how many people have reaction like that to something they eat for breakfast but if I be get well you will continue to get well if you be not we need to know why not so we can start treatment immediately Baby let they do the test can lead poisoning cause visual agnosia not without lead show

untested drug do Hottie go for a pee or coffee either way I do not think you should waste any time on denial the clinical trial be suppose to be safe the drug be about to be approve by the FDA drug how many trial be you on three Admirable not many idiot have that much ambition you 've be symptom free since your admission so whatever you take have probably clear your system now you will be fine keep he overnight to make sure and get the name of all the trial he be be in you go to tell Heather could not even if I care enough to want to not bad you almost make it the whole day what have you

happen I do not know he be fine then all of a sudden he start seize he say you tell he he be well what be happen what be wrong with he she be hot obviously the drug be not out of his system none of these drug nor the drug that they be derive from be know for cause seizure by themselves no but three unproven untested drug this be like the mod squad no one could stop they Ridiculous that they let people take potentially dangerous drug for money just to short circuit that discussion people should not be test drug because they be desperate but people will not test drug unless they be desperate we need drug to save child and puppy Ergo we need desperate people Ergo welfare kill sick child first drug why do not we call it bisexidrine clinical trial involve experimental drug mean they do not have comfort catchy name yet just random unmemorable trial number go ahead Bisexidrine be design as an anticoagulant Phase one indicate some risk of nausea e d and insomnia second drug Cuckoldisol she be have an affair bad sex can be dismiss as hormonal or emotional can be easily regret Money be always a calculate decision my wife have her own bank account that House do not think I know about shocking Discuss Drug b be an autoimmune treatment almost no side effect even if it be do what it be suppose to be do it do not mix well with anticoagulant or anticonvulsive which be the third drug World 's sore knee isil Cuddy use to have that title there be a million way these drug could interact if they be do what they be suppose to if they be not two million it would be interesting to know which interaction be cause the problem unfortunately we do not have to we just have to stop the interacting if we do not know which stop they all put he on dialysis Clear out his system Rapid detox risk arrhythmia another seizure hepatic failure difference be we know what those risk be Put he on dialysis Dialysis use that for kidney failure right do not worry your kidney be fine he be not worried about his kidney he be worried about how he be go to explain the dialysis to his girlfriend I just do not want she to worry you mean you do not want she to leave you what be wrong with that I love she it be not like I 've lie to she about anything important I be an artist I 've sell plenty of painting in the past it be just I 've hit a bit of a dry spell lately be all so tell she that he can not he want she to be happy too he be tell she what she want to hear you do not know no what be you go to do she be not sleep around she be not gamble it away she have not even spend any of it so I do not see a reason to do anything you do not think a conversation how many people do you know in completely happy and fulfil relationship None I be Most people cle to some storybook notion of what a relationship be you can not have an imperfect think you can not have a private zone steal money and hide it away in a secret account she make I happy I make she happy it work because we do not do storybook and I do not plan to poke into her business you be right about the dialysis he make it through the night without any more seizure or visual symptom and I be go to be just as right after breakfast up in my office the only difference be I be go to be right in front of other people which mean you be not here to talk about the medicine you can screw with I at work but stay out of my personal life what do she say do you hear what I say I hear the part about you can screw with I at work all you want want my advice of course not good 'cause I have no idea what you should do I only know what you be go to do I say I do not want your advice I say this be not advice you be go to forgive she for opening that account and you be go to confess everything you 've do and you be go to beg she to forgive you what purpose could that possibly serve none which be why I be not say you should but you will what be your end game where be you at the track that be like six mile away how cool be these thing I feel like an idiot I be not give you any more of my stuff you have those night vision goggle no you be lie you like make he miserable you like drive people away from you he deserve to know the truth there be no truth until you dig it up you do know that stuff exist even when you can not see it right it be a truth that matter to he and a truth that matter to her why do it matter to you first of all stop say a truth there be only one truth that may be true for you miserable people save more life if your life have mean your job do not have to have mean Screw up be more palatable if you have someone 's arm to go cry in yeah that make sense usually I have more of a fight on that one so why be you make Taub miserable I just say he leave his last job to save his marriage if his marriage fall apart you think he will be work hard for you or you think he will not be work for you at all his head and neck be completely swollen I need a trache kit his throat 's closing can not find any landmark just start cut an exploratory trache we do not have a choice get it here his face be so swollen it squeeze his tear duct shut we 've be lubricate his eye by hand we start he on steroid IV and cream to reduce the swelling but it be have limited effect Negative for thrombosis and chagas could be infection Culture 's still negative could be his immune system 's on hyperdrive Cytokine storm why would you pay for a three year gym membership and only go twice sorry you guy still diagnose Thought we would finish hour ago you remember when we decide it be the unproven unapproved cocktail of drug he be be down like like a cocktail he just complete a total dialysis if it be the drug he would be well or he would be bad I take it none of you see trainspotte you think swelling be a symptom of withdrawal it be a coincidence that 3 new symptom crop up as soon as we take he off the drug it be possible some of the symptom either the drug be the answer or the drug be a coincidence if it be one we have to find a well way to detox he if it be two we have to know which symptom be withdrawal relate before we can formulate a diagnosis which mean we have to find a well way to detox he so how do we do it Hair of the drug that bite he that be ridiculous if it be the drug they be dangerous that be why we be go to put he back on the drug and then wean he off again just much slow why be you look at he try it out you hear the boss go Taub I do not talk to her why be you excuse I sorry he do look like I do not he you give he your hat I need you out of here I could go through your desk of course nice blouse I really like that color on you tell house that if he want to know what I be do all he have to do it be not house it be it be I I be I do not know I be think maybe we could get together for a drink or something I be not sure exactly what you like to do so I think you would spy on I no no not spy more like research I think it be a good idea to get to know a little bit more about a woman before you ask she out show you care about more than just what she look like as romantic as you make that sound I be pretty sure that what you be do be not so much caring as creepy that be not fair you be scrounge through my desk what the hell be I go to find out you go to michigan you like your sandwich a little light on mayo you stay in touch with your mother you

think you seem interesting I will go now yeah these um I will give you embarrassing info on house in exchange for no no need for a date you would be employ I so I would have all the time in the world to ask you all about you and it would fall under the category of socialize instead of creepy stalking and I would be pay you I know it be weird but if you pay I while I check you out it be all cool and you get value you get leverage against he help you keep he in line you think I need help keep house in line Nope sorry this hospital can not afford oh whatever you can afford how have you know I

never have why not you know exactly how it would go it would start off exciting we would get catch up in the novelty and the hostility and the forbidden forbid nessness and then we would realize that the flirty hostility be just hostility and his inability to open up be no long exciting it be just frustrating and and then it be the inevitable blowup and the recrimination and we do not talk for two month yeah well it certainly prove you 've never think about House that way I get your point I will be more careful with my tongue in the future that be not my point maybe novelty and hostility and forbid ness do not have to end bad get to go what time you do we could try that new sushi place next to my house why do not we stay at my house tonight we always stay at mine that be what I mean we we use to split it what happen I do not know close to work by five minute and my house do not look like it be decorate by a drunk rugby player well we can discuss it I have not really why do it have to

flip out after major surgery it would 've be bad the benefit of be boss be that I do not have to argue you be all off the case what be go on between you and Cuddy Bad lovin' go bad seriously why do not you argue with her she just throw we off the case because ignore she be a lot easy convince the patient to let we back in again see if you can clear his blockage with lactulose if this thing kill

too you be scared you be scared to get involve how be that scare it be rational emotionally mature people who work together should not date guarantee breakup guarantee ugliness any relationship that do not end in a breakup end in death everything fall apart in the end that be your worldview the corollary which you keep forget be that you have to grab any chance for happiness why do this matter so much to you Cuddy and I be fine the only person getting work up here be you I do not want you to be fine I want you to be happy I think if you date she be you familiar with the adverb vicariously if I want to ask she out you do ask she out last year whatever happen there I do not know I be not interested Wrong you be interested but Amber grab your genital first but now you be single and that make you miserable because you think it be too soon for another relationship so you be go to make I miserable please get a girlfriend or a life or something for I Better or bad bad drug be not work I think we should do the surgery in his house like we plan well then one of we be not pay attention because I think that surgery thing be just a trick we prepare the room we hang the drape it be probably ten time as sterile as any mobile operating theater you would find in a battlefield we still need Trapper John Chase do not want anywhere near this surgery maybe you could talk to he I can not understand a word he say Taub do anything later blood in the field not where I be look how be I suppose to know where you be look here be a hint it be the bloody part the whole thing 's bloody it be a guy with a hole in his body it be like you 've never do this before use the suction I will and in fact I 've never do this before because I go to med school not nurse school hey wanna see if your client 's actually make of money cut out last piece of bowel Suture Mucosa 's pink flatten villi intestinal atrophy it be Whipple 's Disease explain the seizure and the stomach pain little bleeder here cautery hey wait the gas that always happen during surgery just the gas buildup in the blockage nothing to sue about treat he for the burn Put he on antibiotic for the Whipple 's he will be fine hey that be nice of you hi he do good uh burn be heal fine he be stable otherwise good so uh I could stay at your place tonight if you would like I can not well you be not go to sleep here again you might have notice the lack of nurse because you be not on the case you can not really use that as an excuse Dr Cameron wait here your stomach my leg be numb I can not feel they at all new symptom Peripheral neuropathy get bad on antibiotic it be not Whipple 's Porphyria Liver 's fine Amyloidosis we would 've see it on the intestine what do we see on the intestine Pink mucosa flatten villi it be not Whipple 's it be get to be Celiac Wheat allergy mean he be not absorb nutrient explain the seizure stomach and now the nerve we should run a blood test for Celiac not fast enough not accurate enough Force feed he wheat then do an endoscopy as it hit his duodenum see if there be an allergic reaction his test just explode it might be a tad painful to make he eat that be House 's point there be nothing diagnostic about it he be try to put the patient in pain force he to come in it be a valid test so be the blood test which be painless Foreman listen to that little voice in your head that be come from the telephone Force feed he do not you know House you know I be right we will do both test I be not here to play matchmaker okay House basically well he accuse I of be interested in you oh he be just try to change the subject I know but I do have I 've always have some feeling for you be you say you want to date I no I I it would not be fair to House and it be too soon after Amber but

I do whichever one mean you almost have I convince it be a good idea nothing to say no no you do not or no you do not do not whichever one mean no be this some kind of reverse no House 16 year old girl with fluid in her lung no previous trauma lung or cardiac issue Gram stain be negative no bacteria no pneumonia she be a factory worker she probably work close to a lot of recent immigrant thank god some of those offshore sweat shop job be come back to America she be an emancipated minor in a factory either an olympic gymnast who bust her leg a child star who blow all her sequel money on drug or she be just a lie runaway her parent die last year no relative to avoid foster care she get a g e D and got emancipate could 've pick up a parasite from a co worker she would be have g I Problems Pregnancy 's more likely spark a fluid overload hit the lung cause the pulmonary edema she be not sexually active she could be lie but not every teenager be have sex but every teenager be stupid Teenagers on their own be stupider the girl 's hold down a job make her rent on the one hand kutner 's right maybe she be a sweet young thing not a screw up lie through her tooth on the two hand a pregnancy test only take five minute and we no long kill rabbit so in conclusion Shut up do the test what else drug could damage the heart pressure imbalance allow fluid to build up in the lung Tox screen 's clean for drug use recently not for drug use before recently 16 do not automatically mean a risky lifestyle do not we just have this conversation Kutner trust her someone else do not so in conclusion shut up check her home and work for toxin or drug Kutner and foreman do an echo find the extent of the heart damage Kutner can do the echo on his own yes but he will be very lonely so I have to ask why I 've be ask to help run a clinical trial that okay with you good for your career great for your street cre what be in it for I you have four doctor and never more than one case it mean I have time to work on other thing and they will have more chance to step up stand on their own and if there be an emergency with Annie should she wait'til you finish groom lab rat if there be a problem with Sophia or any other patient I will be there the patient be my priority no oh do you want a reason clinical trial take time your time be my time I tell you I do not do drug still a good idea to check your heart something else could have damage it you find it hard be all on your own have to do everything without drug to ease my pain that be not what Teenager on her own I would not trust I either I mean it must be hard no one there to back you up I know you be try to be nice but I be not into the whole pity thing I be actually do the I get it thing I lose my parent when I be six it do not go away but it get easy you learn to deal I still get nervous when there be a knock on the door always think it be the state trooper with more bad news you already get the bad news and survive that be sorta the upside your heart 's healthy be not that good news for your heart yeah but it also mean we still do not know what be wrong Checkbook balance place spotless look like she build her own furniture if you be this grow up at 16 what happen at 30 you turn back into a kid like Kutner Kutner 's not that bad he need everything to be nice he want to see the good in everyone Kitchen 's clear yeah friendly be a dangerous thing there be such a thing as too trust Corollary be there be such a thing as not trust enough too much you get hurt not enough you do not live so the object in life be to get hurt just the right amount excuse I if I do not go out of my way to take relationship advice from you and trust should be earn Bong mean nothing drug be irrelevant relevant if she be take they even if she be irrelevant Echo show no heart damage would that be the echo that Foreman choose not to run with you after I dash his new drug discovery dream you mad at I because you think kutner screw up the echo I do not screw up the echo I know no structural heart damage so if it be not the heart it be the heart do not you just say it be not not all heart damage have to be structural drug could have cause intermittent tachycardia irregular heartbeat would account for the pulmonary edema Edema be acute Vasculitis make more sense no sign in her blood work if she have vasculitis she would be too weak to work in a factory she build her own furniture you think she skip work because she be feel a little weak she need steroid steroid could cause an irregular heartbeat make her current one irregular er er start she on beta blocker the rest of you do anything that be not start she on beta blocker start she on the treatment Page I if you need I irregular heartbeat cause blood to back up behind the heart and into the lung Beta blocker keep this from happen I think my heart be fine it be tricky an arrhythmia can come and go so you do not believe I or the test you guy be more cynical than I be we find the bong in your apartment you go into my apartment extend drug use can the bong belong to my ex it be why he be ex that do not mean you do not use it no you have no reason to trust I you have to do your treatment the other possibility be you have vasculiti the treatment for that be steroid if you 've be use drug if they 've damage your heart and I start you on steroid they could kill you I have not use drug I will get the steroid why be you here I owe clinic hour no you do not I be here cause House do not want I to be here I be guess he say no to the clinical trial he do not need to say no he just want to say no House do something solely out of self interest that be freaky do not suppose you would want to override no what do you think this be go to prove do it matter just figure you could use some help down here and you spend two hour wipe nose will annoy House if that be your dream god bless if you want to prove you can do his job and something more his puke be red that be blood right that hurt what about that four day he be be like this it be just get bad maybe he just need to poop Evan what work last time I have a stomach ache it be actually a smart idea which be why that be the first thing the other doctor check his inside be clear anyone else sick in daycare no how'bout his friend no no one what be happen not sure yet do not worry I 've get an idea you can make he well right that be my plan you need to make he well stay the hell away from I just calm down what happen I adjust she iv she go crazy do not touch I leave I alone Sophia it be ok we be here to help you stay away from I do not touch I I say do not get your hand off of I get your beta blocker do not cause psychotic break she be not on beta blocker we start she on haloperidol she be stable lab test show the delirium be not cause by a metabolic problem we do not know what cause it yeah we do nice job Foreman I do not switch her med but your decision to stick it to the man clearly inspire oliver twist I treat she base on the symptom she present you treat she base on empathetic orphan syndrome and almost kill she in the process she be not on steroid long enough for it to cause the delirium it be a new symptom one that rule out vasculitis and arrhythmia the psychotic break cause a surge of adrenaline no irregular heartbeat Heart 's not the problem we be both wrong so what cause lung issue and delirium and be not base on wishful thinking that she be safe and happy Prinzmetal angina silent and unhappy be well than vocal and unhelpful if you would run the echo that you do not run give she the beta blocker that you do not give if you would listen what kutner say it be not a heart problem I be not talk about her heart but about her head Prinzmetal angina do not affect no reason it could not cause an artery in the brain to spasm lead to the delirium and the pulmonary edema Foreman give her ergonovine to cause vasospasm and run an fmri to see which artery 's dancing and when I say Foreman I mean Foreman I want his signature on the paperwork I want videotape I want photograph of he with the patient and today 's newspaper set she up when you be ready House want you to do the procedure when you get everything set up page I that be really a camera pretty cool this can go place the other scope can not I need you to swallow this pill do not wanna it do not hurt Promise Jonah please to help make you well I do not want to be mean but if you do not do this we will have to make you it be a power pill it be not just a camera it make your muscle grow like the vitamin we take except this be make with a secret formula you do great sweetheart you be very brave Jonah 's lucky I be pretty cruel to my little brother when I be your age why I guess I think that be what big brother do obviously I be wrong be he a doctor too do the pill tickle sweetie he can not feel it what be funny your brother what be happen I do not know how you guy get along and you suddenly care why House be ask question last week Foreman need we and he be worried that if we snip we might be distract that be kind of insult be not it very you be obviously fine I need a differential for uncontrollable giggle he be four they laugh nothing like diarrhea and bloody vomit to put you in the mood to goof around I 've look down one end and up the other all the test come back clean I can not figure this out you can not do not you work with 3 other doctor and a grouchy gimp this be not House 's case just so you know whatever you be try to prove it will not be enough got to go sorry you do not miss much no spasm yet nothing in the anterior or posterior cerebral artery how much long just a few more minute be your foster home all around here or do you have to change school be chat about lousy foster parent suppose to relax I leave middle cerebral artery look good my foster parent be great I think most foster parent do it because they want to do a decent thing which be why you do not get emancipate nothing around the vertebral artery no sign of spasm but that be odd how have you find out about your parent I tell you State trooper look at that artery be fine you can stop not that I forget do he come to your house or call you down to the station come to my house I cry into the guy 's shirt for an hour Fmris tell we where the blood flow be you be use your limbic region it light when we use our imagination it do not light up when we be tell the truth your parent be not dead be they I risk my job put you on a different treatment I do not lie about the drug why lie about your parent because I wish they be dead I got emancipate because my dad rape I and my mom pretend it do not happen no sign of spasm impede blood flow or brain dysfunction it be not prinzmetal all the fmri show be House be right she be lie only relevant if it can cause pulmonary edema and delirium we find out our patient be be rape and that be your response be she a psych patient rape could mean std thank goodness one of you do not have a heart maybe if we stop wring our hand we could solve this thing and let she live to have more nightmare Gonococcal endocarditis would explain the pulmonary edema the delirium no sign in her bloodwork could be lie about the rape yesterday you be all bff now you think she be pathological yesterday I have no reason to doubt if she have be honest from the beginning she lie about dead parent because it be well than rapist parent you find that unsympathetic that be it what be it her whole life be a mess what rhyme with mess it be not stress she have none of the usual manifestation no hormone imbalance no cardiac she be drown in her own lung and she be delirious she be a picture of emotional health severe emotional stress can lead to asymmetric function of the midbrain explain the delirium Interruption of the brain heart coupling could cause pulmonary edema even if he be wrong the treatment 's basically anti anxiety med Hard to argue with yes I agree it do explain everything 13 load she up on diazepam Foreman make sure she do it Thirteen make sure he make sure I go to Cuddy 's house but I do not go in go home without ring either her metaphorical or actual bell you be process I be scrub Huh mean process Huh mean acknowledge if you prefer I could say ha or hmm or no insight no opinion you be disappoint you make the decision I can not tell you what be right for you seriously 'cause last week you could last year you could seem to come pretty easy to you do you want I to tell you what you should do I want you to stop think that act inscrutable make you anything other than annoying Interesting hold thing in can give you cancer Kid 's in daycare could be meningitis no fever no stiffness no rash you check his thyroid TSH and 3 t4 be within range rule out all the usual suspect nothing 's usual for a four year old and it feel like we be your goomah your feeling be hurt either you can handle these case or you can not if you can not it be dangerous on the other hand stomach cancer Leiomyosarcoma Long shoot alter mental status mean porphyria 's more likely no abdominal pain Cancer explain the lethargy the gi symptom Neither 's perfect then we test for both and by we you mean the collective not you Thanks severe stress scramble the way the brain communicate with the rest of the body I have a problem with my brain not exactly the problem would be with your body chemistry where be Dr Kutner there be four of we it be my turn I be sorry I lie about my parent you do what you think you have to do to protect yourself if we be right we should see a change in your lung pretty fast then we can figure out how to manage your stress it might help to turn he in file a police report get closure will not help not address what happen will not make it go away what do I have to do to make it go away I do not mean that I just mean I address it I get away from he report it just label I Girl rape by Dad it do not have to define you it be how you see I that be why you be treat I with tranquilizer not anymore Stress would not change your urine color Labs show the brown urine be cause by shred red cell so what mess with her lung her mental status and run her blood through a wood chipper factory lunch room be not the clean place Coulda pick up e Coli or Shigella from the restroom either would account for the red cell the delirium but not the original lung symptom Legionnaire 's could and cause delirium no her sodium 's normal what do her furniture look like say it be homemade Old box what it be wood nail together the wood have little dent or hole I do not see any in the bookshelf but they be paint the desk do look like she have staple stuff all over it hole mean that it be pressure treat sawing or burn it release arsenic into the air into her lung test do not show because it find a cloak of invisibility hide Arsenic gets absorb in the internal organ so it do not show up in the blood test test her hair if it be positive chelate it out of her blood no cancer no porphyria you page I with negative test result yes because it mean we be do since we still do not know what be wrong this kid have a real problem talk to House not his case there be a point when Cameron and I be not enough we be not there we need to run some more test a week ago he be a happy little boy play with his brother and now he can barely lift his head we will figure this out I just need help we need a crash cart what be go on he be in cardiac arrest get they outta here Clear nothing go again Clear he be back we be there chelation 's complete you be arsenic free so I can get outta here in the morning that be it no advice no be careful out there kiddo you want my advice want be one thing expect 's another I wish I could tell you what to do but you be strong you 've make good choice you will be fine thank need four milligram lorazepam after the seizure we run a new MRI this be sophia 's brain three day ago this be her brain today Lesions Magical lesion which appear out of nowhere she be cure then she be not lesion grow too fast for cancer could be infection Mrsa WBC count would be through the roof Put the arsenic back you wanna treat a patient nearly poison to death by give she more poison just because we call something a poison do not mean it be bad for you it be kill she but since she be still die the arsenic be not kill she and since she be get bad the arsenic be fight the killer it be a hero we should be organize a parade so what do arsenic treat Syphilis before penicillin the treatment be arsenic we already rule out std and even if we be wrong that much arsenic in her system would 've wipe out the syphilis Acute promyelocytic leukemia be still treat with arsenic APL explain the lesion and why they appear after we take the arsenic out so put the arsenic back we still have a problem Arsenic slow leukemia but it can not cure it if she want to see 17 she be go to need a bone marrow transplant good match would be a sibling or a parent Biopsy a lesion confirm that she be die then load she up with arsenic keep she alive till you can convince she that rapist marrow and rapist enable marrow work just as well as the unleaded stuff we need to talk this about the case you do not want I to know about you do not flinch when you find out about a 16 year old who could be die in the next few day mean you be here about someone even young die even fast he need you but he have you this boy be go to die you selfish enough to let it happen Pot call a kettle a pot you be a hypocrite if our job be to find out what be kill patient you would help this kid but you prefer play mind game to prove you be the only one with magical power want something all your own now you get it your disengagement will not work I can see that you think that when you tell what I should do my instinct be to push back so that by not tell what you think I should do I will do what you think I should do I sound convoluted Disengagement be neither artful nor effective so my not do anything be not cause you to do anything right I be okay with that no you be not you be design to have opinion and to force they on people I be start to sound desperate do not screw with my stuff I just need a donor with the same blood type or something right actually bone marrow be a little more complex the good donor be immediate family but those donor bank have thousand of name your parents'similar dna give you a much well chan no if I do this I will owe my life to they it would mean everything else that have happen be somehow okay they do not deserve that they be not in my life if that mean I be dead then I be dead I have Huntington 's disease I be die I do not know when it will happen but it will be soon than I ever plan and I would do anything to stop it because the only way to make anything right the only way to make your life matter be to live as long and as well as you possibly can have you ever be rape no do not try to walk in my shoe and I will not try to walk in yours you have no right to convince she to do the right thing to lie to her it be a true story who care if it be not mine it be my life it be her life Point be not I be die Point be she should live you should have tell she instead you tell she to call the cop give her stat on dna marker everything be by the book nothing 's ever personal try to sleep here Biopsy confirm APL she need a bone marrow transplant run the donor bank I be go home we need to track down her parent I assume she be already say no to that idea or there would be no need to screw up your courage before say it child who 've be through trauma can not think clearly those who be die Guess I be the only one care about patient right what she want could kill she what she need could save she our job be to find out what be kill patient not treat they for chronic idiocy Idiocy be what be kill she since we can not cure that I be go home we could save this patient but all you care about be get your answer your point be Taub and Kutner can check the donor bank I be go to find her parent can not see why you be surprised you push against house he be push back against I I get his ego 's kill my patient you like this case because he be not loom over you the decision be yours only difference now be he decide not to loom do not change the fact that your patient 's die what be we miss what be not in the file the mother overburden at the end of her rope make her kid sick so someone else will take care of he Sympathize with her Munchausen by proxy she bring he into the clinic be here when he go into cardiac arrest the brother would have notice say something Evan 's even more protective than she be then maybe it be the brother he be eight could be jealous he be the opposite of jealous he include jonah in everything he do make sure he eat brush his tooth I think we give he an idea either that or he be off to kill house M Velez I be Dr Remy Hadley from Princeton Plainsboro hospital we be treat your daughter Sophia for leukemia and we need to test both you and your wife for bone marrow donation I be sorry you say you be from Princeton Plainsboro I know this be unexpected but time be short and what be go on this doctor say you have leukemia I do not have leukemia Sophia velez yeah Sophia isabel velez yeah do you know something I do not just that liar lie you steal her identity to protect myself so they can not find I we can protect you but we need to find your parent why you have my blood you do not need my name to find a donor you be a minor you forge the emancipation paper even if we have a donor we would still need your parent ' consent to treat you can not you just pretend you do not go to that house that you do not find that girl call your parent do not mean a family reunion you do not even have to see they when I get sick enough it will be an emergency when I get sick enough it will be an emergency you will have to give I a transplant even without consent an iron overdose from his vitamin if I be right we can treat he tonight he will be back to his old self in the morning but they be child 's vitamin I I only give he one I know I think more would make he strong I do not mean to make he sick he be go to be okay he be go to hate I well that be the great thing about brother you can make mistake and they will still love you donor list turn up a partial match so treat she it be only a three out of six so do not treat she she may not last the week Partial 's well than nothing so treat she she will reject it and she will be too weak to try again when a well match turn up it be my turn now right if a well match turn up well when you decide get back to I she be scared not scared enough tell she the thing about emotional reaction be they be definitionally irrational or stupid might wanna phrase that in your own word she want to deny her parent the satisfaction of save her life that be your rational explanation of her emotional response that be her explanation that make sense how long before she come up with that it be her immediate reaction that do not make sense the fact that it make sense do not make sense Emotional be immediate she go to rational first Means there be no emotional to process you be say she be lie about be rape would not be her first she lie about one trauma to cover a bad trauma so what be bad than rape I be Dr House what do you do I do not something happen but it be not rape believe whatever you want you be scared and stubborn and you do not like people feel sorry for you why not I do not want pity I just wanna be normal but you know you be not you need people to see how independent you be how well you be cope so they will not see the lose hurt little girl because that be not what you see you see someone who do something terrible who deserve to suffer who do not deserve to live what do you do eventually we will find your parent if only to deliver the body then they will not care you be an idiot you would rather die than face your parent because what you break their Fabergé egg I kill their son I kill my brother I be suppose to watch he he be in the bath I could hear he laugh every time they look at I it be like I kill he again if you do not take your parents'bone marrow you would be kill their other child if they do not hate you now they will then I do not care sure you do you want someone to tell you it be just an accident that it be not that bad but it be that bad and you know it there be nothing you can do to change that but there be one thing you can do to not make it bad if you be here to celebrate the kid 's bone marrow transplant work you miss cake I want to do clinical trial already have this conversation I 've prove that I can work two case at once I can do this and I be do it okay okay just like that can I give my reason later or never three day ago you

organ could be the blood what be her alk phos 300 it can not be leukemia high alk phos could also be from liver failure she be a teenager mean bone growth and destruction could throw it off maybe but it be high than you would expect start she on chemo we will do a bone marrow biopsy to confirm why be you order test instead of treatment her heart and liver be about to give up do whatever you need to why be you so attached to this girl it be your call he do not want we to treat she if it be leukemia even if we kill every cancer cell her heart and liver be too far go a double transplant with

time the cycler 's break you would have have to send it out it would have take oh yeah that do sound impossible now that I think of it I guess the well explanation be that the paternity test show she cheat so I fake the whole parthenogenesis thingy what why I win you fake a scientific miracle just to win a bet with Wilson Mmm more an argument I realize it would have be simple to just fake the paternity test but hey Christmas spirit and all that I think you be confuse nice and evil again let a woman deceive her husband by invent a virgin birth just so you can and it obviously would have be more fitting if the baby have be bear on Christmas not just invent then it be not leukemia seizure liver failure it be eclampsia this mean we do not have one dead patient we have two um you have a disease call eclampsia it cause liver failure pulmonary edema and seizure it be also associate with cardiomyopathy that be a pregnancy disease you test she when she come in uh you can get eclampsia up

look like quail to you you think he be have food poisoning every day for the last three year wild quail can be toxic cause rhabdomyolysis which would explain his pain as well as the elevate C K level so would the carbon monoxide he suck out of his car it be not a toxic reaction it be a psychosomatic reaction the pain profile show an excessive concern about his physical health difficulty sleep get out of bed he be not in pain because he be depressed he be depressed because he be in pain not accord to the pain profile you order it be not a diet issue we should start he on antidepressant for his

damage the air 's leak into his body if there be a blockage in the superior mesenteric it could be choke off blood flow to his intestine blockage all over his body would explain his pain why the cramp come and go do an angioplasty on the superior mesenteric and find the other blockage before he have another cardiac arrest I will help good thing we do not have a suicidal patient with a horrific undiagnosed pain disorder we do till we diagnose it we find intestinal edema and air in the blood vessel Pain be vascular if it be vascular we would 've see uneven pulse his blood pressure be uneven 13 and Kutner be do an angio he have hemorrhage in his finger there be air in the intestine it have to have come from somewhere yes it do after we thread the catheter through his groin and into position the blood will start flow freely again will that take away the pain it will be completely ineffective and the pain will completely go away cancel the angio he have air in his blood vessel if we do not open the artery to his where can air come from Air can either com from a breach in the luman in the small intestine or in rare instaes air can come from the air Teeth mark I be guess from

never go to diagnose the guy what be the name of the firm Caddell and carrick it be not like we can chop off his head to see if the pain go away why not need to cut off a guy 's head get to figure out

disease might be able to cause central and peripheral pain no angiokeratomata Lightning pain from syphilis all the syph test be negative why be not you guy still talk because we run out of idea nothing explain this something have to unless nothing do so now you think Mine be a more interesting version of nothing it use to be something we can not find anything because whatever injury cause the original pain heal a long time ago the only thing leave be the drug Opioid induce pain Pain and the drug that treat pain work by change brain chemistry sometimes to the point where pain receptor read painkiller as killer pain take he off the drug we can not cure he so we be go to torture he torture be the cure eventually his body will recalibrate itself assume you be right yes I find it confusing to assume otherwise how would you like to stop take vicodin good thing I be not the patient it be open thank you be it too big she will grow into it you can put it there I take it the home inspection be push back I pass you do realize that be a good thing this place be a disaster I have to stash a dirty diaper in my briefcase so you buy another briefcase I let house supervise himself

superwoman do not be a martyr we will be inject you with naloxone which will knock the opioid out of your pain receptor if we'reight your system will recalibrate within a few hour and most of the pain will be go hour I need those drug not if they be cause pain then knock I out sedate I while that will take drug too we need to clear everything out please I will try anything else that be what we be try to stop so it be not your parent then it be your wife someone you be close a colleague we be resident together I should 've do more to stop it he have the mother of all god complexe so busy treat everyone 's problem he be blind to his own help himself to a vial of insulin it be a miracle he survive his friend and family almost do not he be a selfish ass it will be over soon this be lunacy you be torture this guy on a hunch it be the only hunch we 've get if I really want to torture he I would manipulate a clinical trial in the hope that he would sleep with you be you suggest I get Thirteen in that trial because of some personal I think you get she in because of your usual messiah complex I think you mess with the appointment schedule because of your I like to have sex complex I check the log you move your most promising patient right before her false hope be quite the aphrodisiac how be it false if the trial be show result well if it be that promise you would not have to change the schedule but hey Hope spring eternal this be a cooking accident first time make cherry jubilee awfully big fire if you ask I some of the portion in that recipe be off sure hope it happen to be

the patient leave we do not House do because he realize there be nothing he could do there be always something we can do something else we can try you be insane you know that right because I have principle because you pay more to bribe I to lie on your claim than the entire cost of the repair I do not care if I pay as long as the people who pocket my premium for the last nine year pay I do not break the pipe whatever if you want to stick it to the man that be fine by I you happy Nope but I be right lock up on your way out and do not touch the piano testicle what do they make you think of Stds testosterone issue that summer on fire island oh so close the correct answer be epilepsy Epilepsy do not cause chronic pain it do if it spread to the sensory region of the brain then rewire the

it already stop what disagree okay which one of we should not have an opinion it be not an opinion it be a smoke screen toss out a lame idea instead of agree with Foreman 's well idea because you be worried that will confirm that he be boldly go where no man have go before you sleep with Foreman sorry you be busy drop it House we be see each other end of discussion anything else be not relevant it be extremely relevant apparently it color everything now I have no idea if you have differ opinion because you have differ opinion or you be try to prove that you can think for yourself how about you just judge our idea on their own merit oh you do not want I to do that go run a bleed time test confirm our patient 's blood be screwy then you can come back and pretend to disagree about why Time Zero I be impressed you do not even flinch I just go to my happy place we can not let House anywhere near this woman where be your happy place my class with they pass the first mark it be a great thing you do not really Most kid typical child you hand they a pair of scissor and they cut well Tony he be get C p and when I give he the scissor we go on a journey together learn to get his finger

you fold because I give you crap or you break up we disagree you blame our relationship we agree you blame our relationship do not you see a problem yes do not you could be lymphoma not with normal LDH I T P fit we should start she on methotrexate absolutely and total body irradiation because she fail a bleed time test TBI will promote cancer kill her digestive tract do not forget stop she from bleed into her brain it be premature reckless and potentially lethal true must be somebody 's job to stop I from be reckless and irresponsible nobody can stop I from be premature get a patient with I T p need to hit she with radiation I be go to have to call you back Methotrexate good point on the other hand if she bleed in her brain she be go to need a Special Ed class of her own Fine really yeah if you think it be right do it some people think you be go to be brutal mark your territory who nobody just because I call he nobody do not make I a racist I be not go to play game if you come to I with a request and it make medical sense I will say yes I need oral sex I be pretty sure biological imperative qualifie as medical sense can I return my phone call now I do not really see how that be go to be possible Patient will not respond to methotrexate Bleeding time have not improve you have a medical dilemma for I I have one for you I need a reason to not do total body irradiation other than that Cameron say you can not she say I can then why do not we just do it because it be premature reckless and potentially lethal then why do not we just do not do it because that would let Cameron in on the fact that I never intend to do it this be go to be convolute be not it I figure I would ask for something really crazy she would shoot I down and get the whole I can control House thing out of her perky little system the next time I go back and ask for something marginally crazy it would seem marginally reasonable and she would say yes so yeah slightly convoluted you be screw unless we irradiate she without the radiation we book the nuclear lab we fill out the paperwork we bring the patient down there we do everything but flip the switch go do do not flip and be there anything we should be do you know to actually help the patient trust I in the long term this will help all our patient in the short term double the dose of methotrexate and add prednisone Cameron 's get the key to the castle this trial I be run the drug really seem to be work she be kind of like the power I think I be kind of like she like it I be not sure what I be go to do about Thirteen she be sort of dress like Cuddy she be on the placebo you can not possibly know that accident happen I find out you can not tell she tell she you would be compromise the trial she know she have a 50 50 chance of not be on the drug if you feel like you be lie to her too bad I do not want to tell she I want to put she on the real drug and you want I to tell you that that be okay her trial result be already compromise just from the fact that I know she be waste her time why not give she something that might actually help her valid point except for the fact that it be a load of crap do not be an idiot so how long until we start the procedure we already start tell you you would not feel a thing you should lie back just stay real still I be afraid there be someone sit next to you God God God I have to pee can we like call a timeout for a minute let I go to the bathroom yeah sure we will just start up again when you be do thank sorry I I do not realize I have to go no problem no pulse get the paddle Clear get a pulse it be not I T p no structural defectsnin her heart what about a calcify valve or a patent foraman ovale Transthoracic echo and bubble study show nothing her heart 's clean the patient say she have to go pee maybe when she get up she start to urinate increase the vagal tone cause arrhythmia and stop her heart who have to go pee in the middle of a nuclear procedure it be not really a nuclear procedure she do not know that People do not die from pee heavy metal toxin drug or alcohol or her own body be make a toxin Cold agglutinin abnormal protein gets activate by cold temperature like the classroom with the broken heater and the cold metal table oh for God 's sake get a room immerse she in an ice bath the cold will activate her cold agglutinin cause her heart to race confirm our diagnosis and give she another heart attack Lucky for I there be a flaxen haired maiden who love to say yes how could you approve total body irradiation for a patient with possible I T p it be the right call there be no medical justification not medically no absolutely no medical rationalization I have to say yes because House want I to say no you think he be bluff I be the new kid he have to test I do not get cute do not engage he do not play his game because you will lose you hire I to do this job let I do it oh I be sorry look like you guy be in the middle of a conversation I can wait till Cuddy leave you be go to leave soon be not you I mean the nurse have get your baby out there not that they be go to kidnap it or anything but I figure that the new mother bring the baby to work because she want to listen to all the cooing if you be go to wait you can wait outside unless the new mother bring the baby to work because she want to dump the baby because she hate the baby and think she make a big mistake can not trust that Wilson guy with anything be you it be not a big deal I be have a bad day be Wilson go to be in trouble for betray my trust in a vulnerable time no why would that bother I he be worry make a bad choice it be not a big deal I know it seem like crap you probably feel like crap but it be not legally you have not adopt she yet there be no obligation no string it can be undo tomorrow emotionally you will feel guilty for a while but the kid she will not even know you exist you say I should give she back much well than have a mother who do not give a crap thank I be just go to go drop it off at the pound what do you want we get a green light go draw the patient 's blood why to see if it clump in the cold she be make you confirm your theory before you treat she approve the bath just think we ought to do a test to confirm that be more of a yellow light be not it so she let us you nuke the patient no problem but make you jump through hoop to give she a bath why would she do that I think she be play you go draw the blood do not realize the nurse allow any visitor in here they do not we will just do these problem and then you have to go okay I need to draw some blood I have a crush on my teacher in fourth grade and fifth it be more that Johnny be a nonverbal autistic then for Sarah he talk make eye contact he be like a regular kid since she get sick he start go back away from we I have to bring he in for a visit I will tell you what I will close the blind so the nurse do not ask question you can stay as long as you want we should have the result in about an hour I will be here good job one minute at 39 degree oh damn sorry you all right do not be paranoid I feel great do not expect the med to work this quickly let us not get ahead of ourselves you might not even be on the real drug several patient have show improvement I know my test result have be well I know I have more energy you ever hear the term placebo effect I guess I do have a few reason to feel good but let us not get ahead of ourselves you be good but not cure Huntington 's good good it be clump House be right Ice bath 's on Got a sec do not be an idiot I know it be hard but you need to stay in there for three minute it be ok you come to procedure now only the one that might involve stop the patient 's heart Cameron tell you to be here Shut up tell I about Jonathan how have you get he to come out of hiding he be extremely sensitive to touch yet he have a a tactile fascination with newspaper I mean he would not read it he would just touch it crinkle it I think maybe that be a way in papier mache and and it be he let I into his world please tell she that talking will ruin the test all the kid I try to to become a part of they and then have they become a part of I how much long till the heart attack I want to be a doctor from the time I be eight year old never want to be a pediatrician though now they be both talk well I want to be a sociologist I be suppose to observe a class I be send to room 2 but I go to room 241 instead it be a Special Ed class and I just I just feel at home Time Heart rate 's normal you can get out now it be not cold agglutinin I be not surprised she obviously have brain damage seriously she screw up a room number six year ago and you decide she have brain damage transpose digits classic marker for number confusion mean she have a lesion in her left parahippocampal region I misdiale a phone number this morning must be contagious she also forget to pee before your fake test she have a small bladder show an inability to predict the future also locate in the left hemisphere of the brain close to the parahippocampal region mean the damage be ongoing two subtle clue six year apart that be hardly compelling evidence I be compel that be not what this be every time a decent person come in you set out to prove that they have brain damage I never say her deranged personality be a symptom you do not need to I 've be here five year I can hear your thought from my apartment can you hear I now move on to another organ I do the screw up number and forget to pee point to she be a human being the platelet dysfunction and cardiac arrest point to a pancreatic tumor or multiple sclerosis the brain be like the internet packet of information constantly flow from one area to another plaque in her brain be like a bad server slow down the flow if it be in the parahippocampus it will spread to the brain stem which mean it will be the lung next Brain biopsy will show you the plaque or we could not cut into her brain it be just her pancrea we should do an ERCP we could settle this with rock paper scissor but unfortunately there be people who adjudicate these dispute a pancreatic tumor be much more likely to kill she not this week not next week not next month the number confusion be six year ago we have time for an ERCP no the heart attack be 6 hour ago now maybe it be plan to go hide for a couple year or maybe it be go to hit her lung we have to assume it be the brain I will go fire up the biopsy drill no we have to assume it be the brain until we prove otherwise do an MRI t 2 image you want I to do another test you should be able to see the M S plaque if they exist you can do your biopsy you want to say yes you know you should say yes but you also think that this job be about stand up to I so you be not go to say yes you be not go to say no you be just go to waste time and the patient 's brain or pancrea whatever be wrong be not go to wait that you impress your boss so pick one either he or I do the MRI you be still here the whole point of give Cameron the job be so that you could I do not want to go home House tell I I should give she back instead of be offend I 've be wonder if he be right he be not he never be not when it be anything personal or human or no he be always cold he be always an ass but he be very rarely just wrong I 've read every bonding and attachment book there be I feel like I be in prison at home I feel like I be free here parent make sacrifice I do not know if I want to I be not proud of this I feel terrible I feel like a failure but she deserve to be love I I I do not know what to say no plaque on the left hemisphere or the right even magnify image of her hippocampal region nothing this be surprising so can we cancel the biopsy go ahead with the ERCP I need to talk to you about Remy who Thirteen what do you call she she be on placebo and you want to change that I be the last person you would ever come to for ethical advice literally which mean you 've already ask every other person and no one be give you the answer you want or I respect your opinion and I want to hear what come to your mind have she invite any of her lesbian friend into bed with you I be mistaken Drug go to cure she it look promise reduce symptom no cure then so the pro be you might delay the onset of symptom give she an extra year maybe three she be still dead before you be 45 the question be be those few year worth risk the rest of your life in medicine no there that be not so hard be it thank you you be welcome unless you love she if you love she you do stupid thing common bile duct be clear no filling defect in the biliary tree oh God what it be her lung House be right o 2 SAT be down to 89 increase to 100 o 2 well get out do we have to tell he the surgeon be able to drain the pleural effusion the patient 's breathing on her own but she be still pretty weak Lung failure prove that one of we be right who say brain yes you predict that her lung would fail but the MRI be negative for M S I be right about the where but not the what a picornavirus could cause localize demyelination that the MRI would not pick up if we run a nerve conduction study on the surface of her brain we will see the dead spot be you talk about cut into her skull actually I be talk about cut off her skull expose her brain a pancreatic tumor could still fit Explains heart blood and lung ERCP be negative and she agree with I because she agree with I right sweetie all we need be a more sensitive test Endoscopic ultrasound just accept that you 've be prove wrong you be also prove wrong why do not I get a second test because if I be right about the brain then we do not have time to indulge your wrongness let I know when Cameron say yes to cut off our patient 's skull I will be do the endoscopic ultrasound good news I do not need your approval for some crazy unproven treatment I just need to do a test you want to remove your patient 's skull remind I to revoke Kutner 's telephone privilege I do not realize that be an A M A approve treatment for M S not search for M S but what set it off Equine encephalitis turn a cool breeze of M S into a CAT 5 storm I do not realize your patient be a horse there be be human case not when it be 30 degree outside Transmission be by mosquito so she got bite six month ago or it be some other infection whatever it be it be run rampant in the left side of her brain when I get in there I will get you the specific you be ask I to let you cut off the top of someone 's head I need more than I will know it when I see it you want proof before you let I go look for the proof this be the test you have to give I something Cuddy 's go to love you the patient on the other hand be go to hate you until the day she die next week actually this idiot will probably forgive you you go to help or what I want kid I think these kid be already speak for not now but since we be date I just think you should know but I think because of your illness so do I even when I do not know if I have it or not I just assume I could not take the chance but now even though I know I have it it feel like an option you really do not have to keep buy I thing just open it this be nice the picture be actually your gift that be your baby I take her picture to that place that do that age enhancement thing and accord to the kid who work there this be a pretty good approximation of what your daughter will look like 18 year from now that be sort of cool right now she be just this weird little creature that sleep and poop and cry but that be who she be go to be you will be teach she how to ride a bike give her advice about friend and school and have her heart break she will ignore most of it but some of it will stick you be go to be there for she through all of that you just have to get through this part that be all it be very sweet I will pay you back for the photo do not worry about it it be just the picture that come with the frame you can chuck it Kid with a rage viral syndrome and three dead mosquito I be off to storm the bastille these be not mosquitoes Fruit fly close enough Acute viral nasopharyngitis one of her student have the common cold Team 's not what it use to be on the other hand Kutner run his endoscopic ultrasound do not find peep so disprove it be her pancrea prove it be her brain yes you use to do this job remember that be what use to pass for evidence now I do this job you bring I three dead bug and a runny nose I can not find you the proof you want because it be trap inside her head and the only way I can get at it be to cut it open and rip it out which be the one test you will not let I run so either I do this or I do nothing what do you want I to do say yes just because you be House I would certainly like that yeah yes Cameron actually say yes Nope I be just obsessive about clean cuticle saw off the top of her skull and place electrode on her brain be insane right we should be reteste her pancrea for the umpteenth time you be skip step because it be Cameron you wanna see how far you can push I be skip step because our patient be skip step on the way to be dead if you 've get a well idea we should remove her spleen splenic lymphoma explain the damage platelet the heart the lung if this do not work the spleen 's all yours unless I kill she of course not only will this allow we to clock your brain 's processing speed you will also get free cable for the first three month what be this a blue car be that part of the test Nope my lease be up next month you like I be go to ask you a series of question design to stimulate leave brain function Logic reasoning problem solve or as my mentor Old Ben like to call it the dark side if we find slow area we know we find damage we treat you go home Ready I would nod yes but I can not move my head this pen be red its ink be red be all ink red nerve conduction 's 12 8 meter per second right within range Cameron 's let he cut into our patient 's skull base on nothing but dead bug and someone else 's runny nose there be two pint in a quart four quart in a gallon how many pint in five gallon step away from the patient who be that okay all right that be my old boss and by old I do not mean former Insulting I be not go to make I go away you be not here obviously I be not try to make you go away Hint the answer be a number 40 12 4 meter per second Conduction be still normal Dr Cameron you be actually assist he with this yes because I be actually familiar with this case I be familiar enough to know that cut into this woman 's brain be not necessary be she serious she be certainly not funny Put the phone down pick up the baby make we all happy ok settle down baby it

they become functional Bonding 's over I get to go see another baby so I can just live spleen free Plenty of people live perfectly normal life without Spleen 's fine it be not her brain of course it be her brain you look at her brain you take off her skull you find nothing do not look in the right part do not look in the heart part in the womb blood have to bypass the lung since they do not work

ductus blood take a little detour make it leak from your nose your stomach your lung and more significantly keep it flow to the right side of your brain and away from your left which mean that when

ultimatum I would 've think 5 year here would buy a mistake or two help I help I I can not breathe feel like something be on my chest look like a heart attack I assume you 've hear I can not override he I be not ask you to override he I be ask for a letter of recommendation Eric the reality here be House should 've fire you you falsify medical record put this hospital 's reputation in jeopardy you be lucky you still have a license I can not get a decent position at another hospital without a recommendation I be sorry Chest pain be not angina Ekg rule out heart attack so the good news be he do not have a heart attack the bad news be I apparently fire the only guy who actually know what a heart attack look like so the man of God who do not believe in God have a heart attack that be not a heart attack do I know how to pick awesome case or what could be a clotting disorder 3 different symptom 3 different clot I know how cool be that you two do an angio you do not want to work so why do not you just go get I a lottery ticket the sicker he get the lucky I feel where be you go I 've be want to introduce myself be you really a virgin you have to treat I not to believe I and before we treat you we have to diagnose you not know whether we can believe you be make that difficult everything I 've tell you be true you lose your faith because a teenager got confuse and the church abandon I and my God forsook I and could not come up with a reason why God would do that God give the church and the kid free will their exercise of that free will hurt you mean you be just a victim of god 's gift to mankind oh yeah God want life to have mean Life 's meaningless without free will with free will there be always suffer so God want suffering I get tired of that argument before I even finish say it and even if I buy that what the hell be God do just the big stuff the act of God the hurricane the earthquake the random killing of million of innocent people then we well damn pray God I wish you be not a pedophile Lungs be clean no embolism no pleurisy no pneumonia I be sorry this be go to hurt no it be fine no pain at all no why because there should be you feel that regional anesthesia be a new symptom not if the chest pain be relate to the numbness it be not circulatory it be neurological run a nerve conduction study and be careful if you kill he he will be dance with the dark one why the hell be you go to Cuddy 's baby name it be a religious ceremony it be boring why waste which that could be much well spend in a drunken stupor feel sorry for yourself okay okay you will not go okay your obligation to Cuddy be fulfil why be you do this why do Hillary conquer Everest you always have a reason it be usually a bad one but a reason she be be childish an example from the bad category be it resentment the stork bring home a new baby and you do not want to share mommy or you just can not stand to see other happy she be try to play I if I let she succeed the terrorist win I hear there might be an opening in the e r Foreman 's a neurologist that be not where he I do an e r rotation in Miami if I can find another position I figure House will rehire Foreman do not quit Cuddy would not give he a recommendation he be not able to find a decent job Foreman should not leave either you think they should split up Office romance be a bad idea we beat some very long odd why do not you save the gushy stuff for the wedding House be play if you let he get away he be not go to respect you anyway or House be help you he know it probably will not work out and he be actually do you a favor yeah that sound a lot more like House I know they be look for someone at Mercy I will make a call your boss always like that usually bad find a fellow atheist always make his day think it be possible maybe God 's testing your faith no I already fail there would be no point in what he be do to I now get something look like intercostal neuralgia what be that something 's traumatize one of the nerve that run along your rib explain the chest pain and numbness could also cause muscle atrophy do it do anything to the eye why what be wrong be you see jesus again I be see nothing my right eye go blind ophthalmological exam 's normal nothing structurally wrong with the eye his heart rate be down Sensory loss be become more diffuse progressive muscle weakness he be shut down it be get to be systemic like autoimmune CSF be clear for guillain barre Cancer Imaging study have be clear for tumor then that leave infection he would be brim with white blood cell or we be at the backstage door of a Duran Duran concert hundred of scream girl cluster around what do that mean that girl like rock band the presence of the fan indicate the presence of the band different night same band same door now there be not a girl in sight what do that mean sorry I do not speak hair band they be not a hair band they be new romantic the band already leave Nope the band be still there still rock out when do the absence of the fan not indicate the absence of the band when it be 2009 there be not any Duran Duran fan they do not make they anymore if there be no infection it be because there be not any fan no white cell you think his spleen why do I bother with these metaphor if I still have to spell it out yes I think it be his spleen go get a biopsy I will try to get new moon on Monday out of my head why be you talk this time if I quit will you rehire Foreman why he can not find another job I can you be willing to make that sacrifice for he Foreman know about this plan if he be okay with it who be I to say no hold still you think it be my spleen that be what they be test so if I happen to cure you what happen then you start think that God be work through I this be some sort of miracle do you think I be an idiot that be what I be test lose my faith be not a choice I make it happen it be go for good but if it can magically disappear it can magically reappear and that be what you be hope your job suck that be my point you can make more money frap decafs and yet you be still minister to the meek why do the Lord 's work if the Lord have leave the building I 've be with the church my entire adult life it be my marketable skill I detect the stink of leftover faith you want to talk hypocrisy what about you you act like you do not care about anyone but here you be save life solve puzzle Saving life be just collateral damage yeah nice try you be not look for somebody to prove you right I think you be look for somebody to prove you wrong to give you hope you want to believe do not you I want to walk out and find myself in a forest of whore tree but I do not think it be a good idea to tell people to fornicate with fruit I be just talk about you not you specifically whore and hypocrisy you be right I do not want you there it be a special occasion fill with love and acceptance and the last thing I need be someone there who be fill with loathing and contempt that be it you be really not come I be really not come you be welcome Gosh I feel so grow up he be obviously just jerk you around want to see if you be serious if you stick it out I think he will bring Foreman back I do not and even if I be wrong I think you should still split up it be a matter of time before one of you find the other in bed with another woman from the relationship expert 12 year and count hey if you can make it that long then anyone can funny how the 2 people in the room who think relationship be easy be both single I do not think they be that be why if you find something that could be good you should hang on to it everything could be good very lite ever be his spleen be fine just some insignificant trace of minor bug nothing that would make he sick which minor bug why do people suddenly find religion when they have kid Fear of the unknown Cornerstone of faith I think it make perfect sense so it make sense because it do not make sense the fact that you be rail about it do not make a lot of sense you really get a thing for your boss huh I 've get a thing for my boss 's thing she do not have a thing per se I be big on metaphor what about you 29 year of celibacy what be hold you back now who want a relationship with a priest who want a relationship it be the holy water we assume if it be an infection it have to be something big and nasty but he have pneumocystis a harmless bug that be everywhere and never make anyone sick unless they have a compromise immune system so father Nietzsche have aid impossible I 've never have a blood transfusion I 've never do I v drug I 've never have sex so prove it have an aid test I know I do not have we can not treat you until we know what it be a negative result prove nothing on the off chance it be a false positive I permanently lose any credibility I have leave I would say you just lose that I lose that with you a long time ago we should start treatment we need to be sure the antiretroviral could fry his heart his liver his kidney I be willing to take that chance Big of you I be worried about the kid he molest we should be get he test you do not think he already got test maybe he do maybe he do not but that be a chance I be not willing to take legally we can not inform sexual partner about Stds this be not some middle aged barfly who like it bareback this be an innocent kid who be molest you want to rub the priest 's face in it get he transfer again yeah heaven forbid a diddler have job issue and you get bring up on charge I 've lose enough doctor this week treat he for AIDS I find a job I do not

the colloquial term job syndrome explain the symptom and my quote that be the first thing I check IGE level be normal could be some other genetic disorder Cerebral microtumor could explain the blindness and the hallucination we do not find any tumor that be why I do not say tumor I say microtumor so your explanation do not depend on we be major moron just moron we should start genetic testing take too long so we start treatment Treatment be surgery we can not without confirmation so your position be we can not test and we can not treat my position be you be wrong this be not go to

do not feel like a hypocrite for go sorry continue even if an absolute truth exist we can not know all of it and you can not condemn she for recognize that be you eliminate symptom we can know everything this be medicine not metaphysics Truth be truth it fit it do not fit you can not eliminate a symptom I can if it be not a symptom well what be it not a symptom you be not go to die you have

worried about House unless the next stanza read hope to fry my brain to death I smoke some primo crystal meth I be not interested you can not deny that this kid may be suicidal we be not here to make he happy we be here to diagnose he it be an infection Swab of the kid 's water bottle turn up toxoplasmosis I will start he on pyrimethamine I have no idea he feel this way be there a therapist here that you can recommend it might help more if you talk to he he be not ready if tell he the truth would help he stop feel like this if I know that it would make he less confused I would tell he right

off bourbon we can get you something else I come here expect a burger Figured I would have to endure a little lecture on moderation you never listen so why instead I get a drink nice little serving of respiratory depressant on the day that my lung stop work you seem fine now you do not believe that I od'd on vicodin you figure I be on something strong and because you can never ever assume anything but the most screw up scenario as far as I be concern Funny how I be usually right you think that I be on heroin this be your version of a tox screen because if I be on heroin I can not drink that

congenital be a z shoot offensive or defensive it be both you suspect that be a trick question but I could have say neither Diabetes make more sense we can narrow the testing down to 40 likely candidate Test for peripheral nerve damage he be get brain damage he be likely to have peripheral nerve damage no matter what the cause that be why we should not test he for it test the daughter Kutner run the nerve test Taub you might be right about the diabetes take supper away from our patient and run a glucose tolerance test oh and the nurse have be work so hard you can do the blood draw yourself they have to be do every couple hour you be punish I because you be jealous I be spend time with your friend that would be petty I be punish you because you 've join my good friend in lie to

Gonzalez who be a nurse in the psych ward and who could you lose who would end up there maybe the reason I do not always open up to you be because it be redundant Daniel wilson once you get a name it

potter syndrome his fibroma be secrete human growth hormone which act like insulin lower his glucose it do not explain the organ failure or the brain damage this whole thing be an overreaction that one small fibroma it be benign but his body 's act like it be an invader his antibody go to war against it and got carry away attack his other system take out the fibroma he will be a happy hypocrite

urine brown what if it just look brown if the green dye never leave her system what plus green make brown Purple Strep bovis infection from colon cancer Paraneoplastic syndrome would explain the bronchospasm we scope she when we check for the fistula there be no tumor I be not scare by the umbrella either what not everything be about you kutner I realize it be stupid I just I do not know everything I do not want to invite great 'cause I think your superstitiousness have to do with your folk be kill but you be stupid work just as well why be there a ladder here Forgot that one scope do

money be the big shot like your new ceo friend if that nightclub stamp on your hand be any indication do not worry I be not quit I know Guy who sign a non compete instead of just tell his wife that he cheat do not have the gut to quit bad example I do tell she from guilt not from courage and bravely run to Cuddy behind my back arrive heroically to work every day coward make lousy employee maybe you be a coward maybe you be quit either way I be screw you will note how fast pussycat kill kill have snuggle up by coma guy over there and more importantly she do yesterday as well and he be still

follower give away all their possession and show up in a field Guess who do not show so the preacher say that he miscalculate and they go right back the next month but with more follower every time he be irrefutably prove wrong it redouble everyone 's belief I know I sound just like they but I also know you be wrong something terrible 's go to happen to I you try to prove to she she be not die that would be dumb as she might be die this woman lose her kid why be you attack belief that give she a little bit of comfort I do not care if her superstition make she feel well I just want she to think more clearly maybe that could make she as happy as you be where be we go experiment stop it Dr Wilson it be just not cute anymore you already experiment on the coma guy have not you prove your point

spider vein on her back they be not there when she come in Spider vein mean Cushing 's could cause an abdominal disturbance brown urine but the bronchospasm Cushing 's myopathy it be uncommon but wait a second you do not wake I up to tell I a symptom that be not kill she what else be go on I think she be die I just tell you it be Cushing 's Treat I do not mean because of the spider vein Mr Limpert die if that be my gym teacher it be your coma patient he be stable for a year and a half and he just die the cat be right House here puss puss puss puss puss say puss one more time it be the 6th puss that really do it you be right Sulking will solve everything that cat sit on my lap and that cat know something you believe it now yesterday it be all a coincidence yesterday it be until I unintentionally prove it be not Patient must have cushing 's we have to figure out whether it be Cat 's nose be powerful it can smell liver or kidney failure exactly except if you would glance at the nursing home file I have fax this morning you would know that most of the patient ' liver and kidney be fine what else MRIS be not tell if the cushing 's in her adrenal or her brain so check she a c t h a cat 's vision be at the blue end a c t h be 11 7 it be too close to tell we can not treat the wrong organ 'cause that will not solve anything she could have a cortisol storm could kill she maybe as the senior fellow you could have make sure that my door be close so that I could be concentrate on the cat instead of look for the cat you all right your nose what have he say sound like he say do you like cranberry juice Crap cheap than fake blood and more cran tastic do not ever leave my door open like that again you be play prank and this woman could be die so have Chase do a venous sampling in her brain if he find something it be there if he find nothing it be the adrenal I be not who I use to be I be scared that be not a way to live I want to come work for you Jeez Chris you do not think I do not mean to imply that I could hire you right now you say you need guy like I I know but you do not have an MBA and I just hire a chief medical officer let I invest in that laser scalpel

quick payoff I know I know it be not go to change my life overnight I just need to start change it okay then let us start what exactly be you hope to find inside your dead coma guy Catnip Chew toy I do not know that be why I be look your patient have cardiac arrest during the venous sampling we get she back but her heart 's still tenuous that tell we anything she be weak possibly die so nothing what about the a c t H slightly elevate that confirm the Cushing 's be in the brain go be you sure that it be Cushing 's you would expect central body obesity she be in good shape if it have a normal presentation there would not be a cat involve so it be the brain the next question be whether to remove the pituitary right now that be not a question for I that be a question for the patient you will present both side and let she decide all right I 've get to stop tell you my theory you always just try to prove I wrong you mean the theory about Cuddy 's ass get big at the full moon I confirm that one Photo 's on my blog normally you would be up in the patient room hector she on what to do instead you be up in some irrelevant dead guy who may or may not be connect to a magic cat because you want to prove to I that you do not care case be over I be explore a scientific mystery I put up with your obsession I even encourage they for one reason they save life I do not know what you be do now Cushing 's mean you be overproduce a hormone call cortisol the recommend course of action be to suppress it with drug and that will cure it just treat it it could come back the only permanent solution be to cut into your brain and remove your pituitary gland but the surgery 's dangerous your heart stop on the table once already I want the surgery this thing be go to kill I if I do not kill it first because of the cat do you want to tell I what an idiot I be be I really believe that there be thing that science can not understand that there be a role for faith and prayer but it be in the waiting room not the o r there be a reason I get sick there be a reason for all the bad thing that have happen to I I do not know what that reason be but I know that if there be not one if there be no great purpose in the world then it be not a world I want to live in I will schedule an operating room early I be not stay long I be quit you get a new job well then you be not quit see you back here

find what be interesting be why you be here now not when I give you the ultimatum be it something the patient say I realize that what we do here terrify I and overcome that be the only way I can

would not still be mutter to yourself this be go to hurt the way he be lose his myelin make an infection most likely could be varicella Road debris have come to the surface I be go to have to scrub it out but the initial acyclovir would 've treat that which push I towards an autoimmune disease like behcet 's here this be go to hurt even more take two now two later of course if the varicella be resistant it would not matter what they do up in Middletown do an L p you 've be in the e r too long when the patient have head trauma white blood cell only indicate that he have head trauma or you could use the L p for something useful if you find polys it be varicella Lymphs behcet 's why do I fire you again you do not I quit you be not visit foreman 's brother either busy kutner 's do an L p so I have to focus I have prison security check visitor log phone record you 've never have any contact with anyone at fishkill so I ask again what be you do up in Middletown you know what be more interesting than what I be do the reason you be so obsessed with what I be do stop deflect say the deflector Tthe reason I be up there be the reason you be scared I be up there I be check out your dirty little secret how long have you be sleep with her how do you know your only secret be the girl you find embarrass and the only embarrassing girl you 've meet recently be the one at your brother 's cuckoo facility we 've be out a few time she be a caregiver like all of your other fail ex and someone who take care of your brother who be the last person who take care of your brother you think this be oedipal actually I be think masturbatory I guess your mom take care of he first so the safe course be to gouge your eye out L P stand for lumbar puncture we use this needle to collect fluid from your spine that be a really big needle you be go to feel some extreme pressure in your back I already feel pressure in my front my chest hurt something 's wrong no my chest something 's wrong I think I be hav oh God call the code there be no God you do not know what be wrong with I it do not seem that way so be I dead not yet but you be about to be okay charge Clear again Clear he be back let I go he can not fix I I 've be here for three day everything hurt it be okay just just stop fight she be get to go on with her life the kid do not need this I can ' I can not do nothing for they I can not scratch this foot Tthat really really itch so we put in a temporary pacer Shut up shut up he be try to talk be something bother you if there be still tightness in your chest it be expect be it your eye why be he say no three time you only ask one question maybe he be not say no maybe he be say down be you say that the pain be low how low your leg your foot left foot check his let I see now yeah his right foot no bruise no rashe no cut then there should be no pain be there a tingle sensation be it itch Itchy foot mean liver failure the liver 's fine his enzyme have be normal since we admit he I do not say fail I say failure just like you Liver 's like a cruise ship take on water as it start to sink it send out an s o S only instead of radio wave it use enzyme the more enzyme in the blood the bad the liver be and once the ship have sink there be no more s o S you think the liver 's fine but it be already at the bottom of the sea so die liver release toxin damage the nerve lead to lock in syndrome now we just need to know what be cause the liver failure Liver plus eye plus kidney most likely sclerose cholangitis oh God if only Taub have say that it would 've be a happy ending do a biopsy to confirm I be go to numb up the area where we will go in for the punch biopsy where be the new bracelet she be wear the bracelet you do not notice that I be wear it because you be not he notice and you do not if you do not like it it be fine it be not a big deal I like it that be the point I would rather have it at home in the jewelry box than getting peed on at work you get the patient 's urine on that arm when I be put in the catheter why you 've get a rash the bracelet 's real I figure so what if the rash be not just a rash what if it be an infection if there be rat in

and wheat toast might as well eat a sheet of sandpaper yes but I do not like eat the same thing two day in a row your bro 's nurse not lovin' the love handle I be just not in the mood for bacon and you be obviously try to avoid talk about Kutner which be odd because you spend a whole week obsess about why he be no long on my team I be sorry he be no long on my team nothing else to talk about you be wear the watch he give you for secret santa five function include a stopwatch to time how long it take you to ask I if I be okay you go to order not hungry it be just weird she be bring case before but he be never make she run the test maybe he be look for someone to mother he after what happen only kind of mother House want involve a bullwhip leather diaper and a credit card Mommy 's home test

cause stress Stress screw with the heart and artery Carotid atherosclerosis could cause a loss of balance would not show up on CT or MRI could also be our only warning before a massive stroke do a holter and a carotid doppler see if his heart skip for more than the spot owl although I do not say we if I have sorry if this be screw up the test I 've be hiccup a lot lately but not as bad as this how much be a lot and how long be lately it be be on and off for about a week maybe a few hour a day do you tell the doctor in philly about it they do not seem to think it be any big deal so we be still leave tomorrow be not we I be not sure the refer doctor do not realize that his hiccup be Hiccups with this duration and intensity mostly likely pathological and it could mean it be serious be you avoid I no so I should not be at all concerned that you be treat another doctor 's patient for hiccup instead of go on a vacation I spend a week planning there be a reason I need to stay with this case a while long but I can not tell you what it be so you admit you lie to I and now you be ask I to trust you yes no sign of heart or arterial problem but he be be hiccup on and off for over a week Nice I be hook you can get back to your shift at the e r except as far as the e r be concern you be on vacation right I postpone a trip because I be concerned about the patient explain why you ditch Chase and come to the differential not why you run the test you tell I to I be not your boss as you usually take great pleasure in point out you do not still have the hot for I do you I care about the patient and I care about the people who work on your team they 've be through a lot lately I just think be florence nightingale you be go to nurse we back to spiritual and mental oneness would make sense if we be have this conversation a week ago think what you want that I be here to get a job that I be here to wrap you in swaddle clothe the problem be I think neither because neither make sense the only thing that do do not pathological hiccup plus inability to balance go what she say Brain would connect the two it could if cameron have not already ct'd his head Empty as her boyfriend 's calendar what do this have to do with Chase nothing not sure yet Patient be on a jihad against commercial flower he be picket several nursery Organophosphate poisoning can cause both hiccup and no g I problem no hyper salivation it be possible it be not connect to a protest M s would not show on the CT and his name 's Swenson Scandinavians have an increase susceptibility to m s well theory than he be fake it the clog have it do a lumbar puncture to confirm m s I guess we will just continue to twiddle our thumb God I hope that be a euphemism how I be suppose to do a lumbar puncture on a patient with intractable hiccup I be try to figure out what that could be a euphemism for you will find a way you be not worry House be go to be piss you be help I do the test he say find a way and you do how do you think House be do that why you be here no it be not even if house be mess up by Kutner 's suicide it would not matter he already think life be nasty brutish and long and misery help his diagnostic skill all of which you know so why be you here which answer would you believe if you want Kutner 's place it be fine by I I could use someone else with the stone to stand up to House but you 've get to know it be go to blow up your relationship with Chase all I do be postpone a three day trip with Chase to be with House what be you do order I v chlorpromazine this could still be neurological you could cloud his mental status you wanna get the needle in his spine or you wanna talk you and House been talk about fill Kutner 's slot yeah we go straight from the funeral to human resource you interested in get back on the team I be interested in know if Cameron 's interested she be be run all the test for House 's case well she have not say anything to I but I guess the refer doctor might have ask she to keep an eye on he do you think Cameron 's in love with House that be a ridiculous question she be in love with you be you in love with House that be an even more

reaction to the chlorpromazine it be not just a spasm it be swollen Crunchy it be definitely not m s Crunching sound be cause by an air leak between his lung Lead in his mediastinum could 've be cause

because of House Chase or overtime issue he be very concerned Chase not House if it be all right with you I would rather communicate with Chase by communicate with Chase be you in love with House you be not concerned about I you be mark your territory you should not be involve with House neither should I neither should anyone you and Chase be good together just do not screw it up when be you go to stop this how can you ask I to stop you be in a hospital you have a son the steroid ought to get he breathe normally again but autoimmune disease be serious it might not be a bad idea to take some time at home rest up I can not just quit do you hate we that much I love you and I love our son but why should he matter more than everyone else 's he do why because he be biologically connect to I there be no rational reason he be our son and he be go to need to drink clean water and breathe clean air I be do this for he too come on in House because who else be it go to be at 10 30 at night and no thank I already eat do not ask you to dinner but you be go to and when I explain that I would eaten hour ago you be go to move on to your real entree rifle through my kitchen invite I to search your kitchen mean you know that I would find nothing or you know that I would find something you be hope that I be go to assume the former and I will not bother to look or it mean it be late I be tired I know you be here to advance some paranoid theory base on a single egg white omelet and I would like to get it over with so we can both go to sleep your single omelet theory conveniently overlook the grassy knoll you have for lunch today vegetable and grain gag athon the warren commission find no evidence of a second lunch possibly because it be steal from the doctor 's lounge you be not get any fatter your medical record be clean you check my you be alone tonight so it be Kutner how could Kutner have any conceivable your patient live your patient die you float above it all like a medical colossus but a fellow doctor die that be brilliant Kutner be a wake up call that if I do not eat healthy I might kill myself Mortality be mortality and ice cream be ice cream full fat content quadruple fat content stuff you have not eat just prove you have not eat it you be hope for evidence of stuff I have eat first door on the right excruciating pain in his left leg Acute onset about ten minute ago what be you do to he I assume they be check for vascular pulsation either it be negative or he be a big wuss it be not a tumor or an aneurism Metabolic bone disease bone density 's normal but the bone covering might not be if it be osteomyelitis an infection eat away at his periosteum that explain the pain odd be it be a subclinical infection that we make it bad with the steroid start he on IV antibiotic X ray his leg to confirm osteomyelitis Cameron 's do a full set of low body x ray the infection obviously flare do them again even if I have change my diet what possible reason could I have for hide it from you Ankle tibia fibula all look normal no inflammation no sign of osteo Hang in there we be almost do you and your wife you talk about stuff Sex no anything else Money I be go to go way out on a limb here Foreman not a chatty Cathy normally it do not matter but last week it do you wanna date man good chance talk will not be his femur 's fractured that be impossible it be the hard bone in the body and he break it lie in bed how can you have a broken femur without so much as a bruise whatever break it have to do it from within Osteogenesis imperfecta Brittle bone would not cause hiccup plus we would have see abnormal coloring in the sclerae which leave cancer since when do bone cancer cause hiccup which mean it be not bone cancer or it be not cancer House be right it would be hard to find a guy outside Chernobyl who have be expose to more carcinogen Pesticide plant nuclear waste site tell Chase to repair the break you two prep he for chemo you wanna blast he with chemo for a cancer we do not even know he have Nope I wanna blast he with chemo for a cancer that explain the symptom Intramedullary nail hold on that your House imitation some late break epiphany I just need you to get a bone biopsy before you insert the pin for a broken leg House be preppe he for chemo think it might be worth check before pump he full of poison do Cameron agree with House Cameron be not on the case anymore still enjoy your day off I see why be you preppe he for chemo the more interesting question be why do you care you be not even sure that it be why do you care from here you can monitor the patient from home what be the difference between the two you be not at my home this have nothing to do with any other difference less medical equipment more training bras and more vegemite sandwich actually technically right now Chase be here that be because you ignore that I call he and it be irrelevant to my point which be which be you and Chase be over you be wrong you decide that his single drawer of clothe be one drawer too many but you do not have the gut to tell he so you be emotionally walk away instead of actually walk away which be stupid because only one of those be good for your heart he be go to ask I to marry he I be look for some thick sock find the ring and you want to say no so I circle right back to his single drawer of clothe I do not want to say anything I do not want he to ask not now could not hurt we be all a little freak out we go home we just wanna hug someone we just wanna know everything be go to be okay I do not want he to propose just 'cause he be scared she be get a headache fever she be completely exhausted tell he about your chest honey her breast be really tender you guy have a hot tub she must go to the gym a lot not in year then maybe when you travel on business you zip on down to that complimentary hotel spa Sorry do you just say yes what the hell 's wrong with her get a minute he do not what be wrong with her sorry I be sure she be get a medical crisis and I need more time to figure out some lead question for your wife what be go on with Cameron she do not want back on my team and she do not want to jump I what you ask a question I rule out two possibility and you be satisfied that mean you do not want an answer you just want to know there be not a particular answer either you be worried that she want back or you be worried that she want back on I this be not a medical crisis be it could be a lot of std hang in the balance I give up vinegar compress four time a day any chance I could just leave it at that Pseudomomas folliculitis it be a skin infection from crowded and contaminate hot tub which you obviously use but not with your husband try to help a sister out the nucleus be all normal sized bone cell be well differentiated no dysplasia mean no cancer that be good be not it we hope so although it also mean we still have no idea what cause the break how do it feel it hurt be it suppose to look like that no but it be probably residual bleeding from the surgery we should be able to I need two unit of FFP right away my God what be happen he be bleed out mean it be get to be cancer it be get to be except it be not the biopsy be negative Biopsies can be wrong symptom can not all sign point to cancer but you can not blast a cancer you can not find sure you can prep he for total body irradiation you do realize that be insane not unless you think the cancer 's cleverly hide outside his body Steroids weaken his immune system that much radiation will kill he before it kill the cancer and if he do not have cancer we could cause one or destroy his system altogether he could die from an infection you would rather do nothing just let he die on his own I would rather make his cancer bad give he insulin like growth factor make any tumor or malignancy grow grow big enough we can find it that be pour gasoline on a fire at least total body irradiation be an actual treatment his idea be well pour away I lose my mojo have you retrace your step do your cleaning lady check your pocket before I be clueless about Kutner I be wrong about Cameron Taub come up with an idea that I should have see long before he do no one see anything come with Kutner you hardly ever see Cameron anymore and you hire Taub to come up with idea that you would not have come up with and I have no idea why you be eat carrot Good I be lose my mind all you got to say be good House a guy you work with for two year who you mentor and yes possibly even care about just blow his brain out you can not find the reason can not find the meaning in it because sometimes there be not any sometimes this be all there be you should be lose it you would be crazy not to be off your game but your mojo be right where you leave it just keep play with it I get to go help yourself I know this be a tough process at the first sign of any tumor or masse we can start say prayer it be go to be ok once we can no it be not go to be okay you be grow his cancer this be not the doctor ' fault I 've expose myself to a lot of bad stuff I know the risk I want my life to mean something if that mean I be destine to he be in v tach and no pulse grab the paddle charge Clear charge Clear I 've be look for you and I 've be think about you just have not reach the look stage yet which be the problem you ask for a day I give you two you tell I you have a secret you could not share I respect that now I do not know what be bad blow off our vacation to hang around House or continue to blow it off when he will not hang around you if you think I be bit interested in House I do not know what I be suppose to think I know this look bad and I do not care how it look I care what it be and you be not tell I what it be I be try to trust you but just I need a little more time this have nothing to do with House yeah well it have nothing to do with I either not anymore let I know when I can come pick up my thing nothing on the echo we draw a troponin level no sign of myocardial ischemia all the test be normal Loss of balance Pathological hiccup Air leak between the lung break femur now tachycardia go Come on give I something give I a bad idea maybe I could turn it into a good one Fine open he up put in a defibrillator that be permanent and risky we do not even know what if anything be wrong with his heart Redo all the test in the meantime open he up put in a defibrillator so he can live long enough for you to finish the test balance organ nerve lung bone heart thing you use to make bratwurst there be no sign of infection it be not a metabolic or autoimmune disease it be definitely not cancer I think definitely not cancer be not you go to pick I be think be there a tick clock you already put your money in you never do that until you decide that be very observant of you too bad you distract I now I be think I might change my mind there be nothing healthy in that machine no there be not Gummi bear you hate gummi bear People can change more importantly I hate they Fine then I will not offer you any you manipulative bitch you be not suddenly eat healthy because you want to you be eat healthy because you know I do not want to I 've be mooch food for ten year now either it suddenly start bother you this week or you be screw with you it need to be do after Amber die I withdrew try to change everything hope I would sort it out find some deep truth it be a mistake I should have go back to normal to here and now because that be all we can ever really count on thing need to get back to normal in your life and what could be more normal than I screw with you and you figure it out you manipulative bitch we need to put in a cardioverter defibrillator it will keep your heart beat while we keep look what do that mean it mean even if we figure this out you will have to stop protest anywhere not near a hospital get a few question we be about to start do a hopefully pointless medical procedure your life and my mojo hang in the balance Pesticides be evil which mean that commercial flower be dowse in evil but plant life be nature 's answer to evil so you have a garden no we live in

Patient 's cure he be already pack for another Earth day extravaganza next week he almost die he can not take a few day People only change after trauma if they want to change before the trauma or if they 've watch too many afterschool special you talk about Chase I be talk about you you lose husband number one no surprise that the death of a colleague would make you question another long term lease you teach commitment class I think you be too busy I be sure that be go to be hysterical I give you the cliff note do not try to dump he by dump case on I I tell you I never want to dump Chase absolutely you want he to dump you it be totally different much less guilt either way you be out of reason to avoid he Kutner be a pretty dumb one to begin with I should never have postpone our vacation I should never have plan it I find the ring in your sock I do not want you to propose out of some sort of knee jerk reaction to what happen to Kutner guess you do not have to worry about that anymore I be not I I do not care what happen I just want it to happen be you propose to I I be propose that you propose to I after I break up with you after you ruin my plan proposal you expect I to I be not expect I be hope solve another case bust Wilson look like you be not lose it after all the HTeam 's AnonymHouse 145 pound Johnson Miller House Season 5 Episode 22 House Divided Synchro ShalimarFox mpm the HTeam 's AnonymHouse I know you be not asleep that insight would be a lot more impressive if you be not just a product of my exhausted brain be not you curious about why I be here curious why no french maid 's outfit no spanky pant I be a hallucination not a fantasy it be insomnia four night without rem sleep can cause that might explain why you be hallucinate do not explain why you be hallucinate Wilson 's dead girlfriend probably just my secret and very unconscious desire to get Wilson into my bedroom or maybe your guilt of Kutner 's suicide remind you how guilty you feel about I who care why you be here a decent night 's sleep you will not be Guess I will be around a few more hour need some coffee addictive substance be no substitute for nature 's healing balm let us make this fast I need to sleep Deaf 14 year old start hear imaginary explosion explode head syndrome Cool obviously his brain know how to hear Patient go deaf at age four Complication of meningitis so why no cochlear implant usual suspect be insomnia which he do not have migraine which he do not get and head trauma which do not show up on the ct Damn imaginary pen Mom 's signature be on everything do the dad die I doubt it he be a sperm donor medical record could not be clean we be leave with temporal lobe seizure Wrong someone at the wrestling meet would have notice a seizure could have just look like a bad shot to the leg Put he in the seizure lab see if his head blow up all over again you be go to ignore your own subconscious go to be the limp lead the blind I need a'scrip for sleep pill my neighbor 's dog 's be keep I awake and seem strangely invulnerable to poison why be the soon to be second pretty dr Chase here I will take that as a congratulation we be discuss a case why do he close that file wedding in two week I would say you be pregnant but I do not think Chase 's body be mature enough to produce sperm it be a small ceremony why wait Nighty night drug with no lecture he want you out interesting case possible prostate cancer come into the e r Pencil cup no wonder his prostate 's enlarge it be full of pool cue and cigar Chase 's good man do not get here till the day of the wedding I ask Wilson to throw his bachelor party no retire minister available to plan it Chase do not want some big raucous party so she say Luckily there be people in this world ready to stand up for what be right no no I do not I do not want you to listen two thing I do well bachelor party rank towards the top I get to help right start five hertz House make it through that entire differential without mock our patient for not have a cochlear implant the patient do not want an implant because he be comfortable with who he be it be admirable he be deaf it be not an identity it be a disability it be also a culture the deaf have their own school their own language still no spike go to 20 anything I can simulate with a 3 00 pair of ear plug be not a culture no sign of seizure temporal lobe activity be still clean doctor doctor he can not see one of his eye the limp lead the blind be that suppose to mean something I do not think so so explode head syndrome plus vision loss subclavian steal syndrome Vascular defect couple with constant arm movement could siphon blood flow from the brain we should do an angio check his Knock yourselves out how do I know he be go to go blind do not get cute gazoo you be in my mind you be obviously there c reactive protein I notice in his file it be slightly elevate I figure the stress of the seizure lab would drive inflammation even high lead to optic neuritis that be a lot clear than the limp lead the blind it be just a glimmer I could not put it into word it be a long shot I do not even remember the c reactive protein level obviously you do you just do not know it how high be k2 I do not know I neither but I read a book about it year ago Fierce sexy sherpa on the cover bend over 28 251 foot Cool an all access pass to my own brain go play the kid some music why another long shot we be use iodine dye to track blood flow in your neck and arm House what be you do what do it look like I be do fight the power feel that how cool be that apparently your mom do not care what you be miss you be an ass he say he feel the vibration in his abdomen but not his hand what do that mean it be a new symptom Neuropathy Thought you be go to get some sleep case get interesting like the zoo except you can bang on the glass as much as you want how do you know about the neuropathy good question enough with the riddle tell I about it think wrestling record Juggling no pin three pin Patient be pin in his last three match lead up to that he be 15 and 0 I figure his balance be off from diminished sensation could be increase icp from a brain tumor that we miss on the head ct cut weight for wrestling could have lead to rhabdomyolysis he just go up a weight class three month ago Foreman 's right actually increase icp could make sense you just say I be process it also put a new symptom on the table his deafness what if it be cause by nf2 cancer instead of his childhood meningitis so meningitis be a coincidence or a byproduct of the cancer suppress his immune system Mri his head if you be right about nf2 his deafness may be reversible I will set it up and talk to the patient you two do anything you know what a broken cowboy be it be on House 's list of requirement I have three theory why be House so into this bachelor party thing he need to have a reason to be into a bachelor party he need a reason to be into anything give I your wallet House could be try to tempt chase into cheat break they up you think House be into Cameron I think House be into Cameron be into he Marrying Chase would shatter that fantasy if he cheat they should not be getting marry in the first place so you be okay with House get Chase smash enough to make a stupid mistake be drunk do not change who you be it just reveal it you think she can do the break cowboy God I hope so nf2 be an extremely slow grow cancer which make it very treatable if we be right take out the tumor mean there be a chance you will regain your hearing he say you have to what be wrong he want you to treat the cancer but leave he deaf sorry do not work like that imaging show slightly elevate icp but no masse on or around the nerve it be not cancer Slight bowing in the wall of the fourth ventricle could still indicate a tumor we bring picture the fact that you send I on a scouting mission no skirt you be not on the guest list bachelor party be an ancient and sacred male rite of passage the ventricle bowing be most likely a pre exist anatomical anomaly not the indication of a tumor no way to know for sure without a brain biopsy if I get drunk enough there be a chance I might make out with one of stripper or become one sell we can not just drill into our patient 's brain on a hunch oh god not her she be the one that get I hook in with madoff Taub 's right it be not cancer yeah by all mean abandon a great diagnostic theory because it be difficult to prove do a biopsy we need to take a well look at his fourth ventricle or an old look the mom 's never go to let we touch his brain without some evidence Patient break his nose year ago Hospital could have do an mri the main reason my third wife and I elope be to avoid House 's bachelor party have you see caligula my patient 's brain now versus three year ago see any difference be he tell you to avoid the party I take an oath to do no harm Sure do not come if you want your wedding vow to be meaningless this should be interesting you be go to commit to that one special woman forever which be beautiful but if your commitment the day after the wedding be the same as your commitment the day before then the wedding mean nothing so and I see no logical way around this if you want your marriage to matter you have to be a wanton trolling muck cover pig the day before you be evil see ya the wall of the fourth ventricle change it be not bow in the old scan Evidence of nf2 right you would need to do a brain biopsy to confirm I be not go to the bachelor party every time I go to one of your party I end up embarrass myself in some new and unexpected way that whole thing with the duck be hardly unexpected I be not go it be not okay do you know who we need that stripper you get for wilson 's bachelor party you could do body shot right off her why go back to that well in the nine year since Wilson 's party a whole new generation of hot girl have be abuse by their stepfather she love cat what make you remember the stripper love cat Chase have a cat they will bond you entertain yourself up there just rehearse for the revival of evita what have you find the biopsy show nerve inflammation consistent with increase intracranial pressure something 's wrong but it be not cancer he be go to go through life deaf he be okay with that he have no idea what he be miss his mom be a moron he be go to pay for her stupidity for the rest of his life be we okay with that why be you close let us put in a cochlear implant that be not in the paperwork really well someone must have screw up I will go track it down I will wait that be a great idea let the kid spend more time under anesthesia with his skull crack open I will wait I have be know to lie to serve my own agenda an implant do absolutely nothing to help I diagnose he let us get an implant tray in here just just try to relax just during the recovery phase her son do not want the implant if he still do not want it after have time to adjust I will take it out I will blind he too if he want to experience that culture remove it now Kid 's just have brain surgery he be not stable Ms Miller I be not try to minimize dr House 's wrong do but the good thing why be she sit she be not yell not threaten not pace just sit Understand dr House Focus I need you to say you accept the arrangement no problem you be not mad I be mad not mad enough you want your son to hear you just do not have the gut to make he get the implant once my son be stable I want that thing out of his head why do you do this because he be ignorant and he be be raise by an idiot not good enough you always have my patient be opt into a handicap it be an insult to all the other gimp out there but I be still put Foreman in charge of the case that be the arrangement you be okay with Foreman in charge who you call oh right you do not want to look like a lunatic yeah about that you think we do the wrong thing I be not sure I be not even sure why we do it that argument you make to Cuddy sound pretty good to you maybe I figure by now you would be at the board in your monocle and jodhpur you do something stupid Quick well mock someone why do you do it why do I give a human be the power of hear you ask god the same question he will give you the same answer Patient have a fever now too probably just a post op complication Arnold chiari not without muscle weakness Pseudotumor cerebri we check his eye before the surgery no papilledema Candy I be pretty sure Wilson 's stripper 's name be something sweet maybe his fever be more than the post op reaction his girlfriend be sick month ago maybe her flu be really epstein Barr Lolli they swap spit virus go to his brain lead to meningitis increase intracranial pressure I agree Taffy I agree go ahead start he on Rivavirin for Epstein Barr keep make decision like that it really bolster the illusion that you be in charge why be not you in my office because I know what the word my mean I do something insane and you be not all over I analyze why it be nice I give that idiot an implant to prove to he what an idiot he be be how be that nice you do not do it to solve the case you do not do it to save his life you do it to make his life well it be a caring act which you do in a way that be immoral and illegal but baby step do not sound like we you can not make I go to the bachelor party I know and you be okay with that what choice do I have please God Seth I think he just wet the bed the kid 's dehydrate but stable thankfully the fountain of whiz seem to have stop for the moment not before hose Epstein Barr off the table now eat up we be go to pick out the ice cream flavor for the bachelor party could be systemic autoimmune disease sarcoido this taste like vodka it would be stupid if it taste like bourbon that be the brown one it be vodka Flash freeze in a secret process Guy figure it out in his basement Lemoncello Genius symptom come on too hard and too fast sarcoidosis be progressive remember in med school when Donovan give grand round there be that guy who be pee liter Glomerulonephritis a wrestler steroid could have damage the kidney the scotch be nice his urine would have be brown Donovan rule out osmotic diuresis kidney disease Pheochromocytoma no hypertension Plasma metanephrine 's normal Devic 's it happen at night that be the clue Night recumbent body position change in B p it be his heart run a 12 lead EKG watch he for four hour Foreman concur what the hell just happen everything start to fade away you be get well at focus ignore everything that do not matter he look pissed I think he might hit we be your eyesight well than mine we need to talk about the bachelor party Excellent topic choice Surgery 's so boring and my lying to you be just so yesterday it be my fault for let you talk I into the implant Cameron be not go to be happy about this party but you on the other hand plan on spend the rest of my life with Cameron so I need to cancel the fart band so I need you to kidnap I speak like a true Aussie by the way if you know where I can get I the sheet music to waltz Matilda want some ice cream we be have a sundae bar Sweet that be her name Sundae or bar Karamel with a k you do not need one no one do Bathroom down the hall two door on your right thank you do I sound like her it take time you still have not sleep and then I have a clever response EKG normal sinus normal interval his heart 's fine his heart 's not fine the heart be fine during this test the arrhythmia 's hiding or we be wrong about the heart could be the thyroid Hashimodo 's would explain the kid 's urine and brain pressure Treadmill or the arrhythmia be hide we need to stress he Put the patient on a treadmill the patient just have brain surgery a stress test could cause a brain bleed and kill he I value your opinion I value reject your opinion you be not do this you have not be sleep Cuddy do not actually want you in charge she just want to avoid a lawsuit and to win an NAACP award and if I let you risk our patient 's life test an organ we already test we accomplish neither run a thyroid panel how do we get he into the stress lab without Foreman 's sign off we could kill Foreman be she new Focus the lab simulate stress what if it be not simulate we could tell himhe 's be dump that be a tough sell she never leave the room for more than five minute we could kill she or asthma med Force the heart to beat fast reveal the arrhythmia nice idea it be yours I leave the room for a few minute he rip out his implant so much for improve his life actually I think we just save it look at that Arrhythmia you be right about the heart should have listen to you the correct phrasing would be I should always listen to you he be get problem everywhere what go everywhere blood could be thrombocythemia excess platelet lead to clot not with a normal platelet count so it do not start in the blood but in the lung Pulmonary embolism should do a VQ scan see if his lung be clear go you sure I do this at Wilson 's party the last time you use grain alcohol instead of the sambuca and it work explain my lack of eyebrow by the end of the evening by the power of greyskull I this be why we be rehearse ever wonder what be happen every time our patient get sicker not right now first symptom wrestling then under the light of the seizure lab be you go somewhere because this feel keep do what you be do it help then under the stress of blindness and post op fever what do all the symptom have in common Heat see

try to sober they up so they can help treat your die patient Foreman 's die patient what cause lung failure plus your patient 's previous symptom Eosinophilic pneumonitis white blood cell accumulate clog up the lung lead to heart problem it fit be you there it be not eosinophilic pneumonitis I get to crash do not hang up we need your help I can not we can solve this Eosinophilic pneumonitis could actually make sense no House rule it out because it would affect the larynx Patient would be hoarse which we would not notice in a deaf kid who rarely speak wait everyone be get breath mint we need to hear Seth speak but that mean take out the tube be not that dangerous it be the safe way to confirm what be wrong with he I need he to breathe out as I pull on the tube Breathe out say ah I be sorry we be wrong I need to suction out your throat before we reintubate your son smoke Smoke I do not think so tobacco stain on his tooth he say he use to chew tobacco to cut weight for wrestle use to chew tobacco would not explain his symptom but not chew tobacco might Taub be right it be sarcoidosis the tobacco release toxin those toxin suppress his immune system once he quit chew the absence of those toxin kick a dormant condition into hyper drive be it treatable usually respond to corticosteroid and methotrexate I will start the med I need sleeping pill I be go to hit up Wilson but he be not answer his phone he must have leave it in his pant which he be not wear when the police find he try to walk home oddly from his own apartment pill your patient be do fine thank to your team it be not eosinophilic pneumonitis be it Sarcoidosis Good House please talk to I I have not sleep through the night since Kutner kill himself the wrestling might have to wait I be go to tell your doctor to repair your implant you always say that be my decision and then you rip it out rather than live with it for a few day even I be your mother this be my call I do not know if I be make the right one but it be mine to make sleep well the HTeam 's AnonymHouse it be way too fast it feel good if we could clear the stage quickly please Maury it be too fast it be exactly the same then slow it down

Episode 23 under my skin Synchro ShalimarFox mpm the HTeam 's AnonymHouse be you go to ignore I all day again I help you you try to kill Chase do what you want that be all boss I exist no you do not I acknowledge my subconscious exist now go away say it be one thing live it be another you be not rational not completely put the phone on the receiver send the hooker home and get dress we 've get a case I be take a personal day 21 year old star at the New York Ballet collapse on stage I love ballet but as someone may have mention I be take a personal day Cuddy say get your ass in or you be fire she be not go to fire I she be not go to fire you if you do not go to work how long do you figure till I just disappear hold on no tumor or puncture in the lung no bruise no sign of trauma no STDs and supplemental oxygen 's only get her saturation level to 60 lung keep collapse despite a chest tube e r rule out the obvious white count and temp be normal so no pneumonia Coffee 's burn Thirteen 's wear cherry flavor lip gloss Foreman 's stare at you any of that helpful std we say the test be negative you think we should she be a dancer what about dehydration what about a pulmonary contusion C T show no inflammation on the lung what about dehydration b u N and Creatinine be elevate but within range I be just the irrational part of your brain but elevated mean high right dehydration could hide an infection dehydration could hide an infection go treat she for the obvious I v fluid and antibiotic for the pneumonia we be like Magic and Kareem Mr Pietramala you have kidney cancer be that a bad one I mean they be all bad but the door be close for a reason well now it be open for a reason we need to talk he just tell I I have kidney cancer then you will obviously need a moment to process I be hallucinate I be I will be right back I need you to sit in on my differential double check everything I do you can not treat patient it be get to be sleep apnea I get a good night 's sleep and I still feel exhausted Lack of delta sleep can lead to hallucination do you have any other neurological symptom I do not think so Aphasia Memory loss irritability yeah that one do not deflect he care about you you should not be practice at least enough do not give I the look I tell you I be hallucinate who be you talk to someone who be not actually here beyond that seem irrelevant your mind make a choice it mean something you know he be just go to keep ask good choice he feel bad you go to help I or not I could eat from this place seven day a week we practically do you can order tomorrow night do you want some wine no thank I have my husband 's sperm your dead husband 's we freeze it when he got diagnose and you keep it all this time I use to think if I do not find anyone then you find someone I know but what if it go wrong what if I turn out to be a radical anarchist with a secret family and that I age backwards nobody plan on getting divorce I do not plan on my husband die but he do so you be say you want a prenup in liquid form what if it be not sleep apnea Trauma from your motorcycle accident Vicodin abuse you need to be admit I know you be wrong about sleep apnea which mean you know you be wrong about sleep apnea you be scared tell he you be scared I can not sleep with you here do it work do you see someone stand beside I then no so what be next on your list of thing it be not Patient be not respond to the antibiotic still can not breathe so run a test to confirm it be pneumonia we can not do a bronc because her lung be still collapse Transtracheal aspiration that be basically waterboarde it be pretty radical it be a great idea regular radical I radical or I out of my mind radical Somewhere between regular and you so what be the problem everything okay our patient can not breathe either do the test or come up with a well one so we be down to infection trauma M S schizophrenia or pill Schizophrenia usually manifest young that be why it be far down the list I can confirm an infection with a simple blood test an infection can be treat cure mean you still get a job mean you still get a life it do not make it a well idea just a nice one this the rational you talk can not do this on my own when we inject the water it be go to feel like you be drown but it will be over in a few second then it will be well a little hold her shoulder down a little ready you be do great here come the liquid I slip no what her skin come off her skin be slough off fast than we can replace it with the artificial could be autoimmune a N A be negative Focus on the lung you want we to ignore the fact that she be lose 80 of her skin we know it be not lung cancer could be a liver tumor eat through to the lung get an ultrasound of her liver if you find masse get a biopsy we can not just ignore the skin it be obviously the most significant and dangerous symptom right now I do not think it be a symptom I think we cause it by do what I prescribe antibiotic toxic epidermal necrolysis that be a one in a million reaction yeah well maybe this be the one get swab of her old skin to confirm where the hell be you I do have a practice Ballerina have toxic epidermal necrolysis be you sure about to be you do not do anything wrong you prescribed antibiotic any other doctor would 've do the same thing any other doctor word can hurt you know I have no reason to feel guilty it do not make any sense unless there be something wrong in the limbic area of my brain Guilt as a symptom it be consistent with M S and since the blood test be negative I have to apologize if I feel well then you be right I be feel an emotion if I feel nothing it mean my limbic brain be shoot I be Dr House anyone explain to you your status they find a mass in my liver cancer they say they think they can treat it and that the skin be start to take I will be able to dance again she be half dead and she be wonder if she will ever plie again healthy priority let the mocking begin I be sorry I treat you for an infection before confirm that you have one that be why you lose your skin I know you be in pain I know that I cause it I be sorry very nice thank you nothing maybe you do not mean it I mean it do you do a liver biopsy to confirm could not the artificial skin be too thin she would bleed out why be you talk to the patient I think skinless woman be hot do a transjugular liver biopsy if she bleed at least it stay in her vein do you just check with Wilson again I feel nothing it be M S Apologies be not suppose to make you feel well but the other person in order to make you feel well Fine you want to do an L p to confirm or be guilt enough to start fill prescription last mass about a centimeter to your right Problem short burst of flutter we be almost do enter the right hepatic vein Cameron keep her dead husband 's sperm she do not like yours she like his well or at least she want to hang on to it in case mine be unfaithful or something advance two centimeter you got to let she do it if you do not you will be stick with she forever I want to be stick with she forever she marry a die guy she have issue you can not leave she ever for any reason 'cause then you be not just the guy who leave she you be the guy who kill her kid that be not a good rhythm get out narrow complex tachycardia she be go to crash the biopsy be negative for cancer but the procedure send her heart into a fib we do not know it be the biopsy that cause the problem maybe the heart cause the lung to collapse why be Wilson here you be look for cancer Thought it would be helpful we do not find cancer yes which you report to I 5 second ago I would let he finish his hor d'oeuvre before get the bouncer to take care of he until we can regulate the heart we can not get any meaningful picture so we can not Metoprolol can correct irregular heart try it do not work be Cuddy make he oversee Heart 's too irregular for MRI other scan would then you be make he oversee your choice you do not trust yourself why Wilson get out be you sure do I need your approval to throw you out you happy now there be only one time her heart 's go to be perfectly still for our picture and that be when she be dead if it be not M S severe mental illness and vicodin be all that be leave mental illness mean you can no long practice medicine Vicodin mean detox which mean pain for the rest of your life which mean you can no long practice medicine be you say we should kill she if we stop her heart we could get our picture and then restart it what if we can not restart it then she stay dead we restart heart all the time it will take four minute for we to mri her entire heart and we only have three minute until there be brain damage you sure about this we be go to stop her heart so I can mri it I think it be her idea Pneumonia be her idea and it almost kill the patient her Kutner be secretly a woman that be why he kill himself it be Amber your subconscious pick my dead girlfriend the irrational part of my brain work like the rational part of yours how about that it raise question it answer question who care I 've get compete idea they can not both be right everybody get compete idea everybody have doubt so be it regular radical I radical or I out of my mind radical it be on the upper end of you radical do you have any alternative nothing that anyone in my head have come up with then you be as safe as you can be great you get the L p result back yeah it be a big shock you do not have M S but while I have your blood sample I check vicodin level way too high I need the pill not an argument he know that it could still be schizophrenia if you be on anti psych med you be not go to be able to practice I know you would prefer electroshock therapy to rehab I would prefer something that could actually work you be rationalize no kidding I know that you be afraid of the pain but electroshock do not give I the cancer voice that overly earnest tone Heart attack stroke seizure death or bad bad double death you live but you damage the only thing you care about your rational mind I will make some call I will actually be dead just your heart just for a little while hopefully I have an idea stop have idea Insulin shock that be marginally less dangerous than e c T put you in a coma could cause could work if you have psychosis which you do not I 've have no diarrhea no sweating no vomiting none of the symptom of Vicodin overdose yeah except the I see dead people thing I 've be pop pill for year I 've only be see thing for day something change Vicodin addiction be still more likely we be no long deal in absolute I will be up in five minute then we can talk about how you would rather be in a coma than in rehab actually if you could be up here in two that would be really helpful why 'cause I be about to put myself into insulin shock leave atrium be fine leave coronary artery also fine we be at 3 minute continue Chordae tendineae clear Right be fine I start she back up it be over we have time right coronary artery be fine the 3 minute threshold be a guideline she might have less we have to stop what be that by the aorta I see nothing I be restart it that be a shadow two centimeter you be only scared because you know this be go to work we be over three minute I need glucose in here you could 've die it work where be my pant be you sure she be be everywhere I 've be for day she be not here ergo this be not the next rational step now who be be bias you want I to detox as much as I want I forget how to do my zipper any other neurological deficit you do not seem to annoy I as much as usual not sure that be a deficit and I be all well be she really go absolutely I can feel myself repress all kind of icky thing I check out do not I Damn he do not see anything he see an artifact on the monitor it be a shadow on her heart she would already be technically dead for three minute I think keep she alive take precedence over prolong the photo op any brain damage no all test indicate obviously you have more time good of luck I assume we can not kill she again and take more picture you will want to check with Wilson good one it be something a lesion Tumor scar tissue could be an abscess infection explain why it be invisible in blood it be do its damage behind closed door seal off see the problem with speculation be you make a spec out of u and some guy name lation which really do not affect I at all we have to guess it be all we 've get we can not do a biopsy last time we go into her heart she have a major cardiac event which just leave what be you look for I do not know yet the picture do not change she lie there in pain he sit there worry nothing change I just have an epiphany all by myself Popped into my head out of nothing care to share he be too devoted too devoted you think he feel guilty right I be be cynical People can care because they care not because they cheat theoretically true but gonorrhea fit well no no std we test she you test her blood that be the test that be not where her problem be Gonorrhea disseminate to her heart got wall off in an abscess it would be invisible and would look like a shadow no need to test she again but we can check Prince Charming once you confirm cut the abscess out of her heart here be your onion ring extra well do thank you Molly and another beer when you get a chance I be celebrate alone thank goodness do not tell I I be right Yep Boyfriend have gonorrhea and everyone be a winner he be not too happy about it he insist he be never cheat and must 've get it from her do not think so timing would fit he be get no symptom and she be die lying would fit too he be not hang out in her room anymore what do it matter you be right we be preppe she for surgery I see guilt in he if he be not actually guilty then I be not right I be lucky you make a brilliant deduction about her heart and if I be just lucky enjoy yourself it be later than you think enjoy yourself while you be still in the pink the year go by as quickly as a wink enjoy yourself Wilson come get I it be later than you think I know a nice facility outside Philly I go to undergrad with one of the director how many shirt do I need they say three they have laundry like live with mom again delightful it be probably Foreman he be unavailable tell she the infection 's make her septic we can not remove the abscess until we get her b p up and it be not respond to fluid it be not he be off the case Patient okay yeah he be lie why do not I feel scared I would say you be unaware of what you be feel at this moment I feel like crap my life be fall apart but I do not feel scared not of the rehab anyway we 've always be able to find a way to cheat it will not work you want it to work this time do we it be your only option what do I do if my only option will not work you do not give up it be either that or electroshock every six hour good night Wilson Let us put she on a heart lung machine she be septic we do not need a heart lung machine we need a blood vessel holder together machine we could try high dose dopamine it be a vasoconstrictor it will close the blood vessel so she will not bleed out her heart can not take that much dopamine it will explode and if we do not use the dopamine it will implode be House really do it sound that way dopamine it be it be late and I be tired can we get to the talk part of this conversation I quit Great my nanny be off the clock at 7 30 so your week off big desk tight nurse uniform or whatever other stupid thing you be about to demand be go to have to wait until you can go suckle the little bastard child who make you feel good about yourself Screw you do not do this I be hallucinate from the vicodin rule out everything else we can admit you through the e r under a pseudonym no one have to I will cheat Scam find some way to keep use these people know what they be do these people do not know I you do she be not your keeper she have no responsibility for you I need you let I call my babysitter blood pressure 's 90 over 60 we know I be just say it be still 90 over 60 it be hold Abscess be intact do not look like any of the surround tissue be affect she be go to be fine Doctor we 've get a problem lie down I will get you some tea then I will be well do you really think she have not search this place for your secret stash I already do this room and the bathroom and your bedroom where should I look in the kitchen Coffee cup in in the top shelf that be a test I already do the kitchen nicely play she will think you 've come clean give she everything there be more do not you be hurt already it will only get bad House you should tell I where it be now because you will not have the will to tell I in two hour my shoe in the closet it be like I do not even know who you be anymore it be okay hold my hand be I okay we be able to successfully remove the abscess from your heart but the dopamine cause the blood vessel in your hand and foot to clamp shut we need to amputate or the gangrene will spread you will die my foot and your hand I be sorry no I be a dancer the tissue can not be save we know what House would do House would have never wake she up to ask for consent if you can not live with the answer do not ask we should accept her decision bold idea I know maybe we can get the boyfriend to convince she yeah boyfriend get everything they want forget it the boyfriend do not want to talk to she anymore where be you go home the case be over no it be not not until we come up with something that might work it be a shame that she might die because House have some personal crap to work through Technically if she die it be because House have some personal crap to work through and we be not smart enough to get the answer without he false alarm drink this that be your advice drink this it be Ginger it will ease the nausea you know what would calm the nausea Vicodin marijuana a coma do not pretend you do not see it I see it which mean you see it send she away too bitter I already have enough bitter I will add some Honey you be pathetic if you want the pill just send her home but you can not because that would be admit defeat to her now this be interesting if you take the pill you do not deserve she if you secretly take the pill you do not deserve anyone this be not go to work it might work that be all we be go for vasodilator can big jump from reopen to reanimate I be out of the ulnar I be not see any clearing this will not work this probably will not work radial artery 's really tight do not go too fast if it clot she lose the hand if it clot she be dead I can not believe it what it might be work can you stop the breathing Air go in air go out then use your nose you be suppose to feel like crap you be do great and after you come back to work what if I can not opioid dependency can make you think you have more pain than you really have you be go to be

a mute loser Right brain be more aesthetically orient have great facial recognition I could not have be a plastic surgeon without it yes and where would junior high be without our ability to judge people on aesthetic Right brain 's also more aware of the present moment our place in the universe mm hmm it be a universal daisy chain of peace and love that throw bun at people his present symptom

it what do that say about identity it say we be make it up as we go along which I find free wow I have not be in a bathroom this size since my dorm in med school be that fungus it be from the steam buildup what do you think of this glitch with Chase and Cameron 's wedding it be always a sad thing when sperm come between people I hear the sperm be very good today I mean the salmon go away no other table you would let your wife keep another man 's offspring on ice next to the frozen pea just in case that be what this be about she be not ready to commit to I she be plan for failure do you know that male fruit fly have toxic chemical in their seminal fluid that inhibit the sperm of other male Wilson say we need to talk we talk I agree this have clearly get past the talk stage what hey Great do you find my mp3 uh not yet but I get your shaving stuff toothpaste deodorant some magazine and this cactus from your window you do not have to do that really the hospital supply all that stuff I be still try too hard huh try to get your other half to like I do not say that okay I like you which mean that we should not read into that Anti fungal med ordinarily we would put they in your IV but since your right brain do not seem too fond of iv you should be feel well in a few day I have to get back to work Rick say your shift will be wait for you when you get back thank oh oh my God God I be sorry I be so so sorry I be sorry I have to I have to get back to work Babe wait hold on no it be not I I can not walk well obviously it be not the fungus and it be not a coordination issue dehydration can cause loss of balance we have not have he on IV no good skin turgor not orthostatic could be our tax dollar at work constantly build new roadway and bridge a meningioma slow growing could extend along the subosteal layer of the cranial cavity and be hide by the bone the cancer cell be actually re grow a connection between the left and right hemisphere if you be right the two half have begin send message again but it be too early in the process for he to pick up on it but we can test for it Proof you do not talk to she do you if I talk she would have lie I would have lie and though two negative make a positive I think thermal imaging photo seem simple note how many more heated area appear after less than a minute with I so it be either love or possibly rage do not talk to her I have no plan to talk to her manipulation be in your genetic Code you think I be make a mistake you move in to correct you be make a mistake she lie to I either last night or today I need to find out which and why and clearly thermal imaging be the way this be not a case you be not look for a diagnosis if this matter at all to you please for once in your life be an adult keep your eye focus on the plus sign any image that appear on your far right will only be see by your left brain and any image on your far left will only be see by your right brain okay just start by say the word Book Giraffe Willow Fortunate you be not say the word I do not see a word could you draw a picture of what you think the word might be uh look I I do not see Candle this be so cool yeah that be not freaky at all no communication so far Scott why be you stand uh I be a little chilly I think I would get a sweater or something from my room be that okay a few more minute and that lady and gentleman be the left hemisphere the side that be obsess with find answer the one that need thing to make sense the interpreter that be where we tell the story of who we be and why we do thing that be also the side that be wrong right brain 's advantage be that it be not logical do not choose which detail to look at make connection you could never see you owe your insight to the mute loser I will send it ticket to a Phillies game Confabulation mean no communication mean your theory 's wrong but he be cold why be you scratch it itch Ammonia breath your liver be fail I know for they to approve this price they will need statistical documentation what why be you look at I when you first walk in I be under the impression you want to say something else Nope about House and I there be nothing to talk about I want permission to do a liver biopsy we be look for sarcoidosis Fine what do you mean fine what do you mean what do I mean do you mean because a liver biopsy be not a test that by any stretch of the imagination can be consider risky so ask my permission be essentially waste my time and you be wonder what my reaction to that will be yes be you try to make I angry yes do your biopsy and also do your clinic hour I be blow off my clinic hour really let us see how that go still not angry try again later ah sorry I know I be a little ripe just a sweaty guy recently always uh with a crazy left hand sometimes I fantasize about cut it off just a fantasy it be the hand that be crazy not I what if it do not like an ultrasound wand how be it go to react to a needle can you get music into this room I think you be use your relationship with Cuddy as a replacement for drug you should be in more pain so soon into detox but your body 's full of romantic endorphin and on top of that you create this distraction of look for proof think I should stop and let the pain flood back Cuddy be not a Vicodin substitute quite the opposite you have to wait for she to be ready great advice you pretend that I be go to do that you 've make two major change in your life not a time anyone 's judgment be at its good do not you use to argue that my judgment would be well off drug admit it you be curious why I wanna make she angry I be sure it be convoluted wrong and stupid you be die to know what I find on her coffee cup no because Oxytocin Oxytocin the chemical involve in emotional bonding her lip say no her hormone say oh my God yes more no for you to know her level be elevate you would need a base line to compare they with I pay the guy in the gym to retrieve one of her water bottle from the trash Love inspire we to greatness so I need to make she lose her temper which break her delusion which demonstrate to I and to she that there be something underneath this facade and then what happen she admit everything and fall into your arm that be outcome one outcome two be she kill I I think it be 50 50 right now Great I think you would say that you be commit yourself to something someone I mean it be childish in a way but ultimately great assuming be you absolutely sure you want this to succeed why be an old guy stand in my doorway Eugene Schwartz Eugene Schwartz Dr Cuddy ask I to come up here from the clinic she say you be see patient in your office it be still free though be not it she send he that be get to mean something I will go get my decoder ring I squawk like a parrot Aaww no that be not it it start a few month ago I be do some woodworking in my garage I be try to make a chair be it the chair anyway all of a sudden from nowhere this strange noise comes burst out of my mouth Caaaww Caaaww tough to fake that nice pant my wife Mona think I be bustin ' her chop it be ruin my marriage where be we go so your left hand would rather play air guitar than give I a hard time it would rather play air guitar than tie shoe eat dinner your right hand 's playing too I do not wanna discourage it splinter hemorrhage under his fingernail what be that what bp and 02 sat be drop need a bag of B negative in here so much for sarcoidosis point to a clotting issue clot would explain all his symptom why be not we in the office I be tired of clinic duty there be only one thing that could cause squawk right yeah we give he heparin and do an echo of his heart to see if it be throw clot but More air guitar the heart 's fine we want to test for factor v leiden Protein c protein S but the hand get tired of cooperate we finally knock he out and all those test come up negative anyway or you would have open by tell I your brilliant diagnosis he apologize for be sweaty say it have always be an issue but what if it be a symptom there be cancer that cause night sweat and can lead to clot Lymphoma or pancreatic cancer go scan his pancrea and try lead Zeppelin we 've always remember what this hospital do for Leo when his appendix burst still a check this size sorry to interrupt here be my poo Dr House say to bring it over and leave it with you as soon as I could I do not know if you people have an official term for it Stool sample ah yes thank you I will take care of it it be hard to rush these thing even if you 've eat a lot of broccoli where you going Annie call she be not come back this be not the good time you say the heparin would keep new clot from form maybe but something be obviously cause the clot if you have pancreatic cancer we be not try to scare you but even in its early stage the fatality rate you walk out of here stop look I would ask you to put yourself in my place but nobody can put themselves in my place do she find somebody new be I not be attentive enough no she be just tired of be insult by a limb she say that my feeling toward she be mix well my feeling be not mixed you be not going anywhere unless you wanna go naked your right brain

there the guy that be go to make my right brain work oh for what do you think your right brain want how should I know it be crazy it do thing I would never do Duct of Wirsung 's slightly enlarge but within normal parameter say something it be mute it can not communicate with you maybe you should try communicate with it talk to her the well be not deep be it you be the dominant half you make all the decision the right side have no control over anything it must be frustrating no masse in body or tail segment I can not communicate with it that be the whole when you decide to go and get grocery what do you do what do you mean I put on my jacket and I go to the store your right brain have no idea why you be suddenly get up and put on your jacket it just gets drag along next time try say it out loud just say to the empty air hey I think I will go to the store because we be out of peanut butter how much do they teach you about people like I when you be learn to be a therapist I be an oncologist the right brain like what he be say have not move the entire scan have not get we anything though Scan 's clean it be not pancreatic cancer clotting could be a problem well before a solid tumor form it can still be pancreatic yes but if you want a diagnosis back by actual evidence we should probably look at other cancer House I just squawk what Eugene Schwartz your patient from yesterday I just squawk I be buy some flower for Mona it happen when I be pay the clerk I assume Dr Cuddy give you this number yes she tell I to call you any time I squawk day or night I be sorry but I be about to lose you because I be about to drive into a tunnel in a canyon on an airplane while hang up the phone I might be get some more phone call so let us make it fast Lymphoma that be right pancreatic I know it be pancreatic I know there be evidence I know we 've see it I just can not right brain leave brain issue if the cancer 's too small to find let us make it easy let us open he up and paint it there be a new procedure use scorpion toxin and infrared paint Paint only work on the cancer cell make them easy to spot just agitate the pancrea can cause clotting and you wanna do it to a guy whose problem be clot if I be right about pancreatic cancer the only chance he be get be find and remove those cancer cell now his brain MRI show narrow in the blood vessel lead up from the neck if we do shake something loose we could kill he Clot in his brain could kill one of they without affect the other he might actually be okay with that how long be it go to take assume he do not crash a few minute hey you and Cameron I be sorry I will be right back I do not wanna be homeless okay you can stay in the condo I will find some other that be not what I mean I wanna marry you I get the form to destroy the sperm you sure yeah I wanna hug you but then I would have to rescrub I know BP 's dropping go no sign of cancer BP 's 90 over 60 you never answer my question relax our friendship be not doom thank God but my question be do you really want Cuddy or be this just another challenge you be worried that once I be in a relationship you and me'll be over hey I be actually for this I think this be great but if you be serious and you do not treat it seriously then you will get hurt and if you do not accept that then accept that she will get hurt she look angry if you be stand there when she look up here oh no Systolic 's 80 get to finish this suture before I can get out give he a dopamine drip we be not look up at the right time get to your point we be a little busy here the clot be not from cancer they be come from his heart we echo the heart no clot not while we be look do not I open with that the clot be cause by an arrhythmia no arrhythmia not while we be look Intermittent arrhythmia this guy pull our equipment off at the slight provocation we would have to be watch at the exact moment it happen which I be guess give the way you two be scramble around like idiot be right now yes I be say do a transesophageal echo we have to get his bp stable absolutely right after the echo Systolic 70 the heart look healthy at the last echo and an arrhythmia would not cause clot in a healthy ventricle so start with the left atrial appendage wow Yep I do it again now get this poor guy 's bp under control and seal off the appendage then all we have to do be find out what damage his heart before it go after something he really need so what damage a healthy 20 year old heart enough to make it send out clot like it be bomb Dresden Rhabdo would have fry his kidney too what about Graves Thyroid function test be normal Cushing 's Cortisol overproduction could interfere with heart rhythm run a dexamethasone suppression test Annie you hit I I know I be so sorry but it be not I I know you would never have do that if you be in control of yourself but but you come back to talk with your doctor I 've be go over and over what happen and I have this think out of nowhere ever since I 've know Scott I 've see his left hand throw thing but always sort of playfully think it be fun but when he throw this it be angry and that be when his hand slap I too when I bring it to he could it mean something Deodorant should not how often do you use it uh a few time a day it be special heavy duty stuff I have to send away for it spray around a bathroom the size of a shoebox I will check the ingredient from the manufacturer I will check for any reference associate with health issue Somebody 's grateful we will just leave the three of you alone why be there no lipstick on this cup Cuddy be wear lipstick when she drink from it it be on my face why be not it on the cup why be it always reasonable in Houseland to take an emotional problem and sidestep it by turn it into a mechanical problem because in Houseland and the rest of the universe by the way when a question present itself it call for an answer if the left brain be the interpreter of reality and the one that tell we the story of who we be then what be your story do you wanna be the man with the answer or do you wanna be the man with Cuddy what do I do you make she angry you really think that be the good time to mock I I be as surprised as you but I think I be serious communication can not start unless you be I 've be try to make she angry for no you have not Come on Poo stripper it be routine stuff you 've be pull your punch you be scared you should be now go terrorize she you do not wanna destroy it do you I say I be go to do it I will do it but you do not want to I wanna be with you maybe I be not

not sound good pancreatic cancer it can cause acid reflux we should scope you so it be not good even for cancer it be not good no it be not the deodorant have a high proportion of propylene glycol same stuff make a kid in Singapore develop a heart condition and get this seizure our patient may never have need split brain surgery I be sure he will half appreciate the irony take this man to radiology pancreatic scan and stay with he Eugene Schwartz whatever it be just say it quickly do you have more than one lipstick in the same shade maybe one that have a seal agent and one that do not

be currently get mixed review in Speed the Plow on Broadway Google it it be pretty hard to consume enough fish to give yourself mercury poisoning and it do not usually present solely with pain but it can check out the Atlantic Medical Journal this guy come in with burn pain cause by erythromelalgia cause by mercury poisoning who need doctor with the internet no offense but doctor make mistake medical error be up 30 this year you should check the rate of patient error there be a ton of information out there why would not I educate myself be my own advocate crps come up in my search too but

cancer we should know for sure by the morning our luck just keep get bad huh treatment option be well every day there be no visible mass so even if the biopsy be positive we 've catch it early you be tell I this be good news I be say we will do whatever we can right sorry get to go Foreman need more help with the m and m prep I will come up and help after I finish the biopsy we can handle it I will see you at home later if you be here I might as well be go home get some rest 'cause I be go to be wake you up as soon as I get home stay out of my life I know you cancel my reservation you see I log in when you be spy on I in the coffee shop I be talk to you I be spy on the MILF I be not come back I do not want you back I can not work for with or around Foreman which be why I do not want you back on the team with you out of the picture he be well than ever which be go to make I less miserable which be why neither of we give a damn how when or on what island in the Bahamas you wanna get away from it all the Bahamas Costa Rica I tell you Thailand I assume you be lie it would have be idiotic of you to tell I truth yet another reason I have no use for you we 've get a problem when Cameron send Dibala 's blood to the lab she ask for the anticentromere antibodie test so the printout they send you include just the anticentromere antibodie but the lab also do a full blood panel so I be not an idiot the cadaver I get the sample from have the same blood type you apparently do not check his cholesterol how far off 20 Dibala do not die of high cholesterol why would anyone compare the two report the same reason I do look for anything we might 've screw up we could say the blood analyzer break we can not Cameron document it be perfectly calibrate when she do the test number be off it be weird who care if it come up just act surprised like it be some irrelevant curiosity I can not do this I can not go in there and stack lie upon lie you 've get to figure out a way to explain this miss you this morning sorry I need to get in early do not wanna wake you I think you do that be what you say last night I be out of here I 've get the biopsy result it be not cancer how can so much be wrong with nothing be wrong since when have cancer be consider nothing I just say it be not cancer Cell morphology be all normal and so be the most recent CT scan on the other hand andenocarcinoma of the stomach would cause pain constipation nutritional deficiency that could cause seizure and would not show on a CT you be right about the cancer just wrong about the place continue to say nothing if you agree go scope he get another set of biopsy I would get cancel her ticket if you then show up with two more to somewhere well what be you talk about or show up at all but how do just ruin her plan get she to agree to yours you talk about Thirteen where be she go nowhere this week thank to you I do not stop she I be not go to stop she I 've already do all I could now all I can do be move on I think I actually believe you if you be tell the truth you be even more rational than I well not more then again more sane you be go to be a good boss boss there be nothing wrong there be obviously something wrong I be not say we need to talk about it now I just do not see why you have to deny it I be not now you be deny you be deny no I be deny that there be anything to deny you can not do this you can not hide thing from I there be a problem with the Dibala M and M the HDL number on one of his early blood panel do not match a late panel that be weird it be no big deal Cholesterol do not have anything to do with his death but you know after be let go from Mercy and then that thing with Thirteen 's drug trial Foreman 's paranoid about people question how he handle the case that be ridiculous if anything he should feel secure he have the right diagnosis we talk he out of it I know do not tell he I tell you he do not wanna show any sign of weakness especially now that House be claim he want he to stay in charge all right so it be still cancer just somewhere else that be what we be look for but it would explain the symptom and all the normal test and imaging study get biopsy of the mucosa and the submucosa move towards the pylorus it be my fault Adenocarcinomas be not cause by diet or environmental factor I inherit a 10 million pipeline business when I be 24 by the time I be 30 it be worth over a billion since then I have be involve in over 50 deal that make that first one look like a loser everything I do everything I touch turn to gold except my family First my wife and now my son this be my fault it be karma that be obviously not true he be seize again get the scope out need five mg diazepam how be the ICP it be eight but the shunt 's open and clear this be not intracranial pressure what the hell be it seizure stop but he have not regain consciousness no sign of any masse in his stomach or esophageal lining and he be still accumulate subdural and peritoneal fluid and every time we look to see where it be come from he start seize you think we be set this off something be one of his stomach biopsy show an arteriole partially occlude with no abnormality in the other layer and no evidence of cellular inflammatory reaction it be definitely not cancer it have to be some sort of infection we already rule out infection because he be treat for it and get bad seem like a sound reason unless it be a drug resistant strain Drug resistant strain of what bacterial culture viral serology a N A and a N C A be all negative everything be we obviously miss something maybe the seizure be not a new symptom they be an old one no doctor notice a thrash kid Abdominal epilepsy the seizure would look like pain until it spread to his motor cortex it would not explain the fever Protein malnutrition can cause fever and nothing cause malnutrition like excruciate stomach pain that get bad every time you eat I would be a lot more certain if it be my idea but it be the good we got start he on gabapentin hook he up to an intracranial EEG for continuous monitoring I give he statin what if they ask about cholesterol say I prescribe a statin and forgot to fill the chart you wanna solve a problem in the record by create another one in the record it be a problem with my record keeping there be no way anyone can prove I wrong how d'you get access to the statin you go to get someone in the pharmacy to confess to another record keeping problem I see an open cart just take it why would you steal a drug you could easily ask for 'cause I be try to get you off the hook a story that raise more question than answer only put the hook deeply down my throat it be all right I will handle it how by tell the truth Truth be I do not have the time I be not in the mood and do not see the point you do not wanna do it because you be not in the mood this kid be die and House 's try to push his responsibility onto I they be not his responsibility they be yours you want to be in charge want to be in charge not a figurehead then do the M and M it be all yours you want I to get flog for what so you can have an academic debate about a diagnostic dilemma no one be ever go to face again what be go on here I just do not want to do the M and M do it work not even close everything okay just wait for whatever be about to go wrong thirteen call she have a theory that make more sense than abdominal epilepsy she say someone hack into her email account and cancel an airline reservation I be guess Foreman really you be accuse Foreman not I Cool you really want Foreman to stay in charge of the team make sense he love power I love puzzle you love power and puzzle true when I have they both it be not Foreman how do you know he say he be move on and you believe he I believe that he believe it it be time for I to get off the bench what be up be you Dr House I understand you be a big fan I will have my guy send over a sign glossy Continuous EEG show no interictal spike it be not abdominal epilepsy you page I to tell I what it be not I page you to show you this that I do not expect what the hell be that suppose to mean Darn it I know I should have stay outside Fantasy 's always well than reality you think this be a joke that be my son he be die and not one of you seem to have the slight clue why I know that be why it be so interesting fever stomach pain seizure peritoneal and subdural fluid collection and now spot could be an allergic reaction to one of his med that suddenly develop 8 hour after we start the med if it be not cancer infection it be autoimmune systemic lupus complicate by a cns vasculitis would explain the rash fever ascite CNS vasculitis would cause a stiff neck along with a headache and would have show up on dural biopsy what about polyarteritis nodosa it can occur in kid you can not have arteritis without inflammation okay come up with something well go on there be some inflammation in the skin biopsy plus he be get elevate diastolic pressure it be barely elevate which you would expect give the procedure he be undergone well barely be more than not barely not my decision but if it be I would say start he on prednisone and get a testicular biopsy if he be go to have inflammation it will be there Cameron and I will do it why it be Chase 's idea Kid 's father be not go to be happy about a fourth set of biopsy and you 've get a well rapport what be really go on here you need Chase to help you over prep for the M and M then say so do not be a child be it on his penis Kid 's rash yeah why mean it be most likely affect the small blood vessel that be why we do not see any inflammation on the biopsy it be not polyarteritis it be Degos disease I will do it your son have Degos disease Causes microblood vessel in the brain skin GI tract to break down clot off it sometimes manifest early on with atrophic papule on the penis in your son 's case we do not know why they come much later what be the treatment there be not one it be incurable you be wrong already be wrong a bunch of time we 've rechecke the biopsy it be definitely Degos I be sorry I wish there be something we could do how long not much long what do that mean day at the most all right great we need to talk unless it be life or death gonna've to wait it be about Dibala let I rephrase unless it be a current life Foreman can not present the case at the M and M you be busy but he be just go to have to suck it up and make the time it be not the time then what be it the anticentromere antibodie test the test that cause we to change the treatment from blastomycosis to scleroderma it be not be not what they need you in the pediatric ICU who be they I do not know but I think they be lawyer if you guy screw something up just come clean it be not go to be that bad with all due respect you do not know what be at stake what be go on you need to stop he he be about to ruin his life like you give a damn Roy he be right you be borrow money to buy option already out of the money even you will not be able to cover the loss your house car bank account you will lose everything that be the point the billionaire think that the god will treat he well if he be break I suggest he give it to I there be get to be some sort of balance you can not have all the good fortune in just one area of your life it be not how the world be suppose to work who say that do not just wipe everything out put your asset in a trust give to charity can not get it back he be insane he be irrational so be most people it do not make he insane if he sign that paper he be not only go to destroy his own life but the life of thousand of people who rely on this to make a living if he be insane we will sue this hospital Mr Randall I know you be upset you should not make a decision like this right now give it some time my son do not have any time your son 's die from an incurable disease not bad karma he be not die it be not go to happen I be not go to let it please I be sorry I can not let he die People do not get what they deserve they just get what they get there be nothing any of we can do about it deliver it or I will make sure you end up the one with nothing call a code he be flatline thank you be welcome for what for think I be worth break the law to keep around that be just the way I be but still do not know what you be talk about Cuddy have I T trace all the I p address who 've log in to my email account there be two Mine and yours obviously House decide he need you more than he be I already ask House and he would certainly never lie no he would lie except he want I go and he would do a lot well job of lie than you just do really it be that bad no actually but it do not matter anymore why because of House or Foreman you be good for both of they but Foreman 's not my good friend House will be fine maybe but with you on the team he would be well he need someone who do not need he you be the only one he be never really be able to suck into his crazy House vortex keep he ground his ego in check why do not you just come to I I figure you would only stay if House ask and I know he would eventually Bye Wilson this be a great job maybe even well now that House be at least try to have real relationship with people I say try it do not matter the job you love do not matter do not throw it all away just because of a bad break up Bye Wilson I just confess I tell Thirteen I cancel the plane ticket why you mean why do I confess or why do I do it I know you do not do it so I guess the first you want she to stay because you want she back or because Foreman do why would I care what Foreman want cause you be not as big a jerk as everyone think yes I be no you be not I just make a 10 000 short sale on a stock I know be go to crash because of what I see a grief stricken dad do on his son 's deathbed no you do not yes I do you be a jerk she be make a mistake so you do it for her she be a good doctor so you do it for you I be not the one in charge anymore so you do it for Foreman she be a smoking hot newly single bisexual why do not you just admit that you like have she around she be good for you you need she because I be bear with a heart three size too small no you be not yes I what he be still alive Good start he on heparin and IV immunoglobulin for Degos Cardiac arrest be not just a everything go to hell in a handbasket arrest it be a coronary event coronary be large vessel Mean 's it can not be Degos but the biopsy confirm obstruct blood vessel they can not be obstruct because of Degos mean it be primary antiphospholipid syndrome you sure Nope but I will be if he respond to the heparin and the immunoglobulin by the way someone screw over your girlfriend and she run to I Cuddy and Wilson everyone but you she be not over you or she be where would you find it find what the niacin bind chromium supplement it be on top of the file you do not know about it no be here

differential diagnosis for resurrection go he be not dead his heart slow enough that the emt the fact that he be not dead mean we do nothing wrong there be several document case where tetrodotoxin ingestion cause apparent death it be something he already have and his dad and his grandpa Extreme bradycardia could be cause by sick sinus syndrome Sinoatrial block what if it be not his heart let us work from the tenuous assumption that we be not idiot who 've spend day examine a heart up down sideway declare it healthy a few hour before it basically shut down so we need to think about cause in place you do not look could be metabolic you okay what about a genetic predisposition to an autoimmune disease isolate anti ro antibody could cause complete heart block could also be pass through four generation Autoimmune it be start he on steroid how you feel my head be kill I you just come through a severe trauma what do you remember I be change my laundry over to the dryer that be it you be

House figure this can wait till the morning he tell Cuddy he be not ready to work he quit apparently it be a power play he will be back tomorrow bone cancer could trigger a paraneoplastic syndrome which shut down the heart primary bone cancer be not hereditary Li Fraumeni syndrome it be hereditary and increase risk of have bone cancer you have another theory my theory be it be not bone cancer Gamma survey would locate the tumor I have pea soup today you would love my breath right now I do not get a chance to run tonight House be have issue I miss you a lot today all I want to do be you

survey reveal no tumor so it be not bone cancer where 's Chase do not know two mystery cool Theories do I come in too soon okay I be go to take another lap and I want three new idea by the time I come back one of they be get to be not stupid where there be pain there be nerve Hereditary sensory autonomic neuropathy type one Miscommunication in the brain stem mistake nerve pain for tooth pain it

he do not get well come back quickly so we can get one more shot at it bless I father for I have sin take your time how long have it be since your last confession I kill a man but it be the right thing to do who live or die be not your decision to make sometimes in the operating room it feel like it I be a doctor then you should know more than anybody that every human life be sacred why tell I what be sacred about a dictator that kill hundred of thousand of his own people what be sacred about a doctor who kill a patient be it the slippery slope you be worried about Afraid that forgive I for

contraction the ball and chain smack you down but widespread petechial rash nervous system involvement it be some kind of blood infection Meningococcemia start the patient on heparin for the DIC Broad spectrum antibiotic for the meningococcemia Chase be relax at ease in lockstep with you again I guess he finally tell you that he ice Idi Amin Jr do that mean he can break the other nine commandment

bone in your body you should be leave he not leave with he your position be our leaving be a ruse we be not talk about mine but yours which do not add up here be what do not add up if you be serious about staff you would know exactly which three fellow you want you plow ahead with this case even though you have not hire new fellow because you know Foreman would ask Chase and I to help give you more time to blow up our marriage I do not want that but we would be foolish not to plan ahead a my fire Chase be the only reason you leave two year ago b when the full horror of his homicide hit you your marriage will blow up and Z the only obstacle to you work here will be go or maybe I skip a couple of letter Meningococcemia 's spread person to person think about it next time you show up for

when you be not do not work so well if you have a conscience Conscience that thing that kick in when there be no logical reason to behave the way people want you to what you have a fever mean the antibiotic be not work Mr Takayama I be really happy with what the last guy do with my eye but why would broad spectrum antibiotic fail to work on meningococcemia excuse I I 've get a real patient Mister Hitler really have to do something to amuse myself while your receptionist fight with her boyfriend next a guy who need two decade ' worth of corn chip hoover out of his neck or a guy who can not stand daylight and whose blood will not clot you do the triage who be the jerk someone with zero chance of hire I back I tell you I be content at home and at work but not with content that be why you got suck into those stock scam why you cheat on the wife you love at bridge my wife and I play a lot of bridge why you work on a case last time I give you a theory like I would help a guy who need a Heimlich in a restaurant and then I shut the door behind you you would knock over 3 doctor to give it to he metaphorically speak you be a Heimlich addict you be an addiction addict your drug of choice be your old team like any addict you be try to solve another problem and it will not work excuse I I have a a tight schedule of nose job and tummy tuck yes I do nose job like the guy who come here after a car crash could not even breathe through his Antibiotics would not work if his sinus be infect and clog if there be a pocket of bacteria his blood vessel could not reach surgically drain his sinus the drug will work Nice tell I it do not feel good see you tomorrow not come back look like quite a trip it be House send you to talk to I then there be nothing to talk about I do not wanna work for he you be a great doctor House be right to want you in the mix you say this 'cause you have feeling for I and want I back I be say it should not be an issue do you have feeling for I I do not want our work life to have anything to do with our personal life you could not keep them separate and that be why our personal life do not exist none of that have to I can not work with you actually you can I be the one who have the problem I do not anymore I owe you an apology I be wr wrong about you spend week elaborately conceal the fact that you crash daddy 's car and you just confess Seemed idiotic certain to end in disaster instead you be ride off into the sunset together any theory on why you 've already dismiss the she love I theory well it be possible it would require the presupposition all she be do for the last six year have be inconsistent with her character it be possible we 've establish it be also possible you be wrong or there be another explanation since you do not have one I be go to keep look for you let he drain then pack it with anesthetic and sterile gauze any idea what be go on with House he be try to get his old fellow back it be call stalk I be too busy to play officer of the court a shame since you trigger this what do you see in Lucas anyway none of your business do you think House would not find out have you tell I I would not have coach he on how to prove his worthiness to you you be upset because I do not choose to date your good friend but I be live my life for the first time I be not go to change that because of how it might affect he or you I feel like crap look our relationship be go to be about House or it be go to be about we I vote for us House be go to make it about he for we this be very insulting you be apparently shock by this which mean you think there be some way we could date get marry have two kid a dog retire to Florida all without House find out or you think that we would not date all that long First mean you be delusional the second mean I be it could also mean you think House have mature but then we be back to your be Shut up you be right I be sorry I be also flatter you act all cool and everything with Wilson but you feel comfortable enough with I to freak out that be cool his sinus be clear Antibiotics should work this time why do you forgive I I mean I be glad I be grateful but I be confuse you 've be hard on the patient than you 've be on I the difference between you and the patient be that you feel shame guilt that be how I know we will get through this my stomach it really hurt his liver 's fail his liver 's failing and his abdomen keeps fill with fluid so it be not meningococcemia no matter how much you finish each other 's sentence do not count on be a diagnostic package deal Patient 's liver 's not work we do not have time for your team stake sometimes you be just wrong something genetic something in his history we overlook both be spotless every time he have a bad cough as a kid he go to a doctor Klatskin tumor obstruct his bile duct no jaundice would not have ocular effect if it be inflammation inside the bile channel sclerose cholangitis he stop produce clotting protein damage his blood cell cause small stroke enough stop pummel 13 and Taub it fit Prep the patient for an ERCP See if there be hope of open his bile channel tell he to look for a liver donor Dr Chase your turn what have she say she forgave I because I feel guilty that work too and now you expect I to ask you what the too refer to only if you be interested only if you have doubt about her answer she think you do not have anything to feel guilty about because you do not kill anybody I do she blame I for Dibala 's murder not you you be barely involved in that case she know that but I create the big bad evil climate that allow it to happen you be wrong powerful counter argument why be you do this why be you try to screw thing up you get the tense wrong thing be already screw up which be why you do not just want to work for I you need to Cameron think you be my sock puppet if you do not stay it be go to be hard to prove you be not I have to go last week my cane could only do ten minute what be you do here wait for you to take a nap so I can surge into the lead what be the good way to restore the liver in someone with sclerose cholangitis not getting draw into this you already be because you crash my workout you be core training improve balance stave off the most debilitating symptom of Huntington 's you 've end your self destructive streak want to do something significant that will last long than the few year you have leave my team be your first good choice my first choice be the community health clinic I interview with yesterday you should do that three hour a week every doctor should 'cause every doctor can you do not want to be every doctor plus on my team you get to screw with Foreman every way but literally why be you do it this way you be pretend to assume we be all come back without actually ask we why this be why you would be miserable in a clinic you can not ask because you can not face the rejection why not what be go on be you ask I to ask you I be say you should not for your sake as well as mine we do not know how much the sclerose cholangitis have damage your liver it might be in a year it might be in ten but you be go to need a new one and you should know while no transplant committee will say this openly they will never grant an organ to someone work in your profession I have to change job you be medically advise I to change job Hank if you be too sick she want I to have a conversion she be practically salivate over it I be just be candid about so you do not think I be scum just some committee do that your lifestyle have risk you work around more sick people and germ and blood than I do I be not go to live my life afraid like my parent do barely let I play outside and God forbid that I get a scratch I will talk to he he will calm down and realize this be the only why do everyone want to dictate the way I live my life because the way we be live be go to kill you pass the pancreatic duct do not listen to House you have no idea what he say I know he be manipulative I know you be in a vulnerable state and that Cameron want your marriage to work so do you so do not listen to House House do not make my decision I be in the common bile duct what be that mass Gallstone can we magnify time five that be not a gallstone his liver 's completely fill with worm you have strongyloide also know as threadworm they disseminate in your body cause your symptom how have I get a parasite most likely through sexual activity but we can not be sure what be the treatment two mebendazole pill that be it you will be fine your liver too go back to your life you know this be the doctor 's lounge I know it seem like the place to read doctor ' note you be good at it by the way why be you read my chart because I be worried about my girlfriend your girlfriend be a male porn star no I be date Lisa Cuddy seriously Cool if House do not have his team that will make she miserable which will make I miserable which bring we to the fact that you have elevate note to an art form I see the connection Most doctor write 9 00 a m if they scrub in at 9 00 or anything near it you write 9 03 and you make little notation when procedure be delay you be easily impressed well yeah I be till I see that you have virtually stop write they about four week ago be busy get a backlog People with your level of precision do not really just get backlog no one know why you be leave PPTH because it be personal if something happen I mean if you be leave to get away from something that you do or she do or both of you do I mean emotionally maybe you want to run away but in my experience if you be stare at a pit bull in some guy 's back yard you be well off stay right where you be face the problem that way it can not bite you in the ass thank for the folksy wisdom you get any dirt on any of the other three it would really help I out you say those two pill be all he need lung be fill with fluid suction he and get he on oxygen Patient 's lung be severely compromise Liver 's still fail Worms could easily have be a coincidence almost be surprising if he do not have them which mean it could be a hematological problem plus cardiomyopathy Neck vein be flat precordial exam be normal what if it be lymphoma peritoneal carcinomatosis explain the liver failure Paraneoplastic syndrome explain everything else Lymphoma it be prep he for chemo Fax Taub and 13 the late update on the case seriously they 've as much right to know as anyone you either like the diagnosis or you do not if you do not we need to keep talk if you do you need to shut up what we do not need be this stupid game you be mad at House but you be not mad at I do you want I to be mad at you you blame House not I I be mad at House because he be an ass and I be mad at you but I do not want to leave you what I do may be the bad thing I ever do it may be the good I be either a murderer or a guy who stop a mass murderer but I do it I and even if it destroy I I would do it again today you do not mean that this be not you I be not run away from what I do because you want to pretend I never do it if that be how you feel my strategy 's not completely work all four of they want to work for I but all four of they have reason why they do not want to work for I how do I get they to take one from column A and none from column B right right by not say anything you be say that answer be inside I the answer have nothing to do with the question then it be not technically the answer why do you need three of these doctor because I know they be good other doctor fall into the might be good category it have nothing to do with they be good you think they be idiot half the time but they be comfortable you feel abandon so you be reach out to people you know for comfort oh my god you be right I do not need doctor at all I just need a good friend Cuddy 's right maybe just maybe if I do not play along you will realize you can not solve a deep problem with a surface solution would 've be more profound if you have not say anything you okay get through it be a lot easy once you two be away from here he be pee blood BP 's rise Heart rate be up to 250 he be go into cardiac arrest charge Clear he be bleed out his body 's completely give out charge Clear we 've get he stabilize but no red cell no white cell practically no

his nerve I need a crash cart in here pub do not you guy have a die mexican crooner to attend to he be not die anymore find out he be on a popcorn diet eat ten bag of microwave popcorn a day huff the fume scare his lung that be very strange where 's House perform his ritual hiding from Cuddy to avoid get a new case dance it be sort of a jazz fusion type of thing he be probably eat in the morgue I can page he actually maybe it would be well if I talk to you alone House and I have a bet about one of my patient you guy mind make he 100 buck poor 43 year old male in remission from leukemia present with left arm paralysis and trouble breathe I assume House 's money be on cancer thank that be very helpful Subdural hematoma would explain CT rule it out I think it be TM I start antiviral but he get bad bacterial infection Bacteria'd move much fast he would be dead already could be fungal it would explain his breathing problem but not his unable to move his arm problem actually if aspergillus fungus ball take root in his lung and spread to his spine it would explain both the treatment involve riddle the infected area with BB sized pellet of antifungal med I assume you do not just load up the 12 gauge and pepper I with birdshot no we have a slightly more humane delivery system but we do have to open you up it be surgery and like any operation there be risk what do you think honey I do not know be surgery really such a good idea he just seem so sick I just you should do whatever you think be good be this the only way to go after this thing because of the rapid progression we do not have time to test or try IVS and he be strong enough definitely I want you there during the surgery of course you got to do it Good Dr Chase will be in here soon to get you set for the o r Page Dr Chase to Tucker 's room for a surgery consult and can you get I Mr Koplovitz want to talk to you everything all right he want to talk to his doctor not his doctor 's assistant and House be look for you what do you tell he that you be in the clinic I figure that give you about 10 min here Mr Koplovitz 's chart go hello Saul I hear you be look for I I be very tired but I can not sleep today 's your lucky day I happen to be a sleep specialist Thanks Doc can a guy get a little privacy nice hiding spot actually it be perfect it allow I to hide from Cuddy and find you what do she want she be check up on Tucker thank to you that be it like what something about you something you could interpret as be about you an anagram maybe play hide and seek somewhere else my patient no problem give I the 100 buck you owe I and I be go Tucker do not have cancer he do not have a ball of fungus in his lung either next time you want to use my team at least leave a tip I be late for surgery your assistant say you would be in here I talk to Bonnie Let us take this outside Mr Koplovitz just get to sleep sorry she find we this fantastic loft outside it be not a loft it be more urban not that I be urban but I use to two bedroom get wonderful view it be a really great place procedure should take about an hour I will be observe the entire time maybe it would be well if you stay with Ashley she be more scared than I be well she be at her age she be not suppose to be deal with issue of life and death be not what I be plan when I go after her why do you leave Melissa we get marry young we I be not sure there be nothing to talk about why be you do surgery when I need you find I a new case you do not want a new case oh right Guess I be here for Wilson obviously you do not tell I that Cuddy be move in with Lucas 'cause you be protect I which be odd since I tell you that I be fine with their relationship so obviously you question one of those assumption or you have an issue with logic yes you be fine with they date but move in together be a whole other level of commitment this be the 21st century I realize that the logical course of any adult relationship could one day lead to fornication although the fact that she want to buy a loft could mean that their relationship be not as serious as I think for God 's sake House do not do this to yourself it be a loft it have no deep meaning than open space living arrangement if you buy into her diatribe about rediscover her lose city girl root and two bedroom it just reek of commitment issue yeah or she have a baby this be classic mid life Cuddy crisis this be her version of a two seat convertible clearly you be fine with it Wilson he be get global lung damage mean it be not fungal it be PCP pneumonia obviously something be knock out his immune system three option HIV Acquired SCID or my personal favorite cancer I be sure you will test for all three 62 year old african american man with lymphoma now in remission I do a ct and find a small lesion on the upper lobe of his left lung if he be in remission why do you bother scan he during a routine follow up I realize the patient be depressed that be quite a call the treatment indicate oh I be sorry I do not realize you be in the middle of something it be a conference room with glass wall you think I would be alone your patient have cancer not that guy he probably also have cancer and he be probably also your buddy think you would want to know 'cause you owe I 100 buck you have acute lymphoblastic leukemia a L L so it be a recurrence it be different it be a second leukemia probably cause by the chemotherapy we give he five year ago that be why you do not see it maybe they can rename it ironic leukemia this be not the end test show that the cancer be limit to your brain that be good news how can cancer in his head be good the blood brain barrier separate the blood in your head from the blood in your body keep the cancer bottle up we can go for a cure so give I the number 90 chance of cure really what if we be in the 10 steady decline but six month of a good quality life do he have to go through another bone marrow transplant Chemotherapy we can go at this with drug alone when do we get start we begin by surgically plant a shunt so the drug go directly into the brain I book the o r you be the only one who can make cancer sound like good news we get it out of your head and you walk out paralysis go and cancer free we also need you to sign a health care proxy if something go wrong someone need to make decision for you what be the chance of that happen very remote I think maybe Melissa should be my proxy what no come through House get a new case revise o r schedule sorry Wilson have to bump you it be not like your guy be bleed out your guy be not bleed out the nurse who book the o r think he be your case be no more urgent than mine yeah but you be way more patient it be okay you can talk about the paperwork in the prep area you trust she more than I about this yes you 've be through the good stuff but she be be to hell and back with I she give I the good shot of get through this you still love she do not be silly I love you please do not make this into more than it be anything no can you feel this no how about here where be everybody Melissa and Emily go downstairs to get some breakfast Ashley she have work to do I think she be off today she do not really have work to do she be piss so she pretend to have work to do I let she pretend move your finger the chemo 's not work do that mean it be not cancer no it mean the chemo from your first round of treatment have make the leukemia resistant so I be in the 10 that do not get cure maybe not we just remove a screw from a guy 's lung and the weird thing be he do not get well any idea what that mean it mean you be not listen to I no it mean I be ignore you to make a point there be a difference the problem be I have no idea what point you be make that your idea be implicitly not worth respond to double your patient 's chemo dose be stupid Damn now it be explicit it could swamp out the resistance of the cancer cell the fact it theoretically should work do not make it any less stupid of course it do it be exactly what you would do I be I you be you and a table be a table and chemo be poison and double chemo be double poison I can handle it when thing go wrong you can not and thing could go very very wrong I can handle it sound pretty dangerous it be what do you think Mel I think you should call Ashley you be my family I be sorry I forget that I think that you should try whatever could keep you with we long look I can move they what be it Jim I be go to need to run some test intraepidermal superficial bullae could be Pemphigus or it could be from the fire either way he be dead we can not stop the oozing do not care I be here because it be 1 15 and Wilson start test at 12 45 which mean the cancer 's go but over half his hepatocyte be dead in only 24 hour he need a new liver look on the bright side you can publish the result of this case study no one will ever double the dose again the double dose of chemo got rid of your cancer but it also trash your liver if I do not find you a new liver you 've only get about 24 hour leave so what do we do now your father 's be move to the top of the transplant list but all we really can do be wait that be it we wait tell I something that I can do I be sorry Mel you and Emily do not match Tuck 's blood type and neither do Ashley so a live liver donation be out the good thing to do be just what you 've be do be together hope he already tell you that you be go to die it be go to make what I be about to say a lot more relevant I know it be rain out there in the hallway but I be just in the er test my patient for autonomic dysfunction it be the only department with a shower big enough for the whole team plus the cardiac monitor plus I anyway relevant part we be just wheel the guy out trauma come in Motorcycle versus semi how bad Bad for the motorcycle Good for your liver blood type 's match why be not I page because there be a problem no organ donor card Dead guy 's sister be next of kin she be refuse to allow the donation where be she 20 minute away how do you get the call that your brother 's dead and then run out the door that remind I I have dry cleaning to pick up do Cuddy buy the place not yet you okay just make conversation your be get boring what be you plan I be not plan anything and I do not believe you how be you go to punish she for date Lucas now this conversation be get boring be you really ok I be not okay not even close see that be very adult of you no it be not it be just I accept the fact that there be nothing I can do and move on which be I think the definition of adulthood if it be be a kid be a lot more fun Showtime I do not speak to he for year but when my parent die at their funeral we make peace our parent must 've bless it and I be sure they would want he to do good with his last act in this world they want we to be friend our relationship be not strong but it be grow if I allow you to defile his body it will destroy that bond the itai will be harm it will save my patient 's life what if I tell you that he be not dead be you say my brother be still alive you be be an idiot I do not have time to talk you out of your religion so I be stuck with give you a technicality that will let you justify do the right thing what if his last living act be to donate a part of his liver not the whole thing just one small piece then I be not defile a dead body the last generous act of a live person it be too late the liver start to degrade it be no long viable for transplant well play Religion kill another person it be not fair Jim you just help I get my family back together I be not ready I would 've have six more month with they if you have not give I that extra chemo now I have less than one day I be sorry we know the risk I do not want to lose they again I can not lose they again there be nothing more we can do five year ago when I need a transfusion you use your own blood we have the same type which mean you can give I a part of your liver I be your doctor you be my friend should I die because you be also my doctor of course not then you be fire now you be just my friend now you can do what be right Tucker it be I can not late night with the Pigeon sister every now and again I would like to come home without getting interrogate Someone 's cranky and late where be you just get a drink why be all my frozen dinner thaw on the counter I need room for my margarita jell o shot I use test tube as bottle so they will be shape like my cane why would you go out drink alone when you get such great company here Tucker want I to donate a lobe of my liver to he and you be out drink so you be actually consider this yeah I be out marinate my liver in alcohol to get it ready for the transplant your mouth say no but your pathetic attempt at a deflection have guilt write all over it it be my fault it be my fault I give he too much chemo you cure his cancer kill he in the process Quibbles he be have a predictable complication Surprise bad thing happen to people who be sick do not make you responsible no not legally ethically ethically a table be a table do not be a doormat boy you be you willfully ruin my food and have take over my living room because you already think I be a doormat you know what you be wrong you clean up your stuff and get out you be wrong how 's Tucker still not dance but scan come in on Del Clinton it be good news Thanks let I know as soon as Tucker take a turn for the bad I want to be there see that small spot at the top of the lung that be then this be now

my grandkid thank Bonnie just go to have to sit tight for a while I put an offer on the loft Seller turn I down I offer exactly what a similar unit sell for three month ago I want to donate a lobe of my liver to Tucker that be insane I be donate a small portion of you have hundred of patient and until I run out of excess organ why should not I do everything I can to help they because you be a doctor not a donor why do you make I the head of oncology not because you have the most organ you be thoughtful care Caring by your own criterion a strength and not a weakness this be come out of guilt this be come out of friendship I have a friend who be about to die and I have the opportunity to save his life call I a doormat get it all out of your system but I be do it why he be my friend I be your friend all the pain pill I 've take what if I need your liver right how selfish of I not to have consider your possible future need they be all die they be all your friend I be not here for an argument no right that be room 12a so why be you here Wanna make sure that I call the move van the operation be in two hour and I would like you to be there with I why because if you die I be alone

house easy on Ashley I see I be thrilled to get the family back together and Melissa 's great in a crisis but the person you want when you be die be not the same as the person you want when you be live actually it be James you ready to admit that he be a self important jerk I still feel good about what I do you do not feel angry I be a little disappointed Disappointment be anger for wimp you do not have to be so gentle about everything it be okay to get angry once in a while you can not change a table actually you can just need a coat of paint and the gut to use it Bonnie tell I what Cuddy bid you be go to outbid she we do need a big refrigerator she hurt my friend she should be punish you get mad I be proud of you Cuddy will not share that sentiment how be you go to explain it to her I

Hadley from all patient contact what but it be for Dr Hadley 's benefit not yours we have no obligation to inflict you on her Fine but just so you know this be not for your benefit Dr Cuddy 's furious at you put her hospital at risk she just know it be a bad idea to admit it in front of I think what you want by the way your orderly 's outside I would wait about another 10 minute if you want your

take offense at that terminology all I do be ban you from my tub whatever happen to proportional response whatever happen to coherent conversation that thing break tile gash the wall and poope everywhere expect a bill for repair and payback what be that I have no idea everybody else think hypertrophic cardiomyopathy make sense Good Stick the patient on a treadmill stress his heart until it stop you want to induce cardiac arrest only real treatment be for the patient never to stress his heart again which mean we have to tell he to retire at the ripe old age of 21 stop his heart speak louder than word go maybe it be a good thing he give your brother a job responsibility I be not argue that he should not have a job I just do not want he have one here I understand that House do this to annoy you but why be he succeed you know what my brother do the last time he get out of prison he steal money from my parent to buy drug he rob a liquor store then he move on to jack luxury car last time every time I 've know my brother for over 30 year you have not even know he a day I be sorry the exterminator charge 250 to get the opossum out of there and the contractor estimate 1 500 to fix the bathroom and why be you jerk Foreman around because it be fun maybe you should give those bill to the guy who leave his own bathroom window open your motive always run deeply than simple fun I want to learn more about one of my employee so that I can manipulate he and destroy he if and when I choose Information be power not buy it why do not you tell I my real evil plan I do not think there be an evil plan you regret not have a relationship with your own family and you do not want to see Foreman go down that same path I think you be actually be nice Shut up you can not accuse I of an opossum attack and underhanded kindness in the same visit then I will come back Treadmill test be a bust the guy 's in unbelievable shape we could not get his heart rate above 150 your boss be secretly a very nice man I know if we can not re create the cardiac event we can not prove hypertrophic cardiomyopathy either we find a big treadmill or do I miss the memo about you be release I be feel fine I can not keep lay here miss practice all excellent point give I your arm what be in the shot it be a vasodilator since we can not exercise your son 's heart on the treadmill I be go to have to do it chemically what be wrong you be turn white what do that mean he do not need football to get a good job anymore Raynaud 's phenomenon Vasospasms cut off the blood supply to his finger could be early onset rheumatoid arthritis Rheumatoid factor be negative arterial plaque throwing clot would explain the finger head heart you really think a guy with stenosis could 've ace that treadmill test you be kid I you get he a desk and a nameplate Man 's get to have a place he can call his own what about Takayasu 's arteritis Lymphoma 's a well fit we should remove his spleen bold move to skip straight to surgery his big game 's come up we do not have time to biopsy wait for the pathology report and resect right we should remove his spleen without confirmation so he will not miss the big game hang an ethanol drip that will not treat for either lymphoma or Takayasu 's if it be lymphoma the ethanol will make he itchy and Foreman can remove his spleen or he will lose his radial pulse and Chase can start he on steroid what be you do here my new assignment be to shadow you in enemy territory and document your every word to the patient just do not say anything stupid you be not an idiot do not do this come on man I be a new person now no more drug no more lie and if I can not get my own family to give I an opportunity to prove that what be the point Mom and Dad give you a chance and a second and a third I be not about to give you a 54th why be not your minion fetch your lunch he be busy spy on his little brother what that be very demeaning you obviously have a theory as to why demeaning be not demean you be escalate to prove I be wrong about you be nice which you would only do if I be right do you listen to yourself 23 year old just come into the e r ask for you what be her cup size I do not think his cup size be relevant to his condition he accidentally shoot himself in the foot seriously I give you a choice between move to Canada and shoot yourself in the foot you

all you be go to get out of this be a five day vacation and a band aid when I sign up I be just a guy now I be about to be a dad I go back over there be a chance my kid grow up without a father you get a girl pregnant you be still just a guy how much long we have to wait we have to keep go until you feel something might help if you tell I what I be suppose to feel if I do that that be all you will be think about you will be tell I that be what you be feel power of suggestion the other black dude who be in here he your brother what give it away the way you look at he I have two old brother and we always want to kill each other something wrong not really it just feel itchy be that what you be wait for Means lymphoma 's most likely but that be actually good news how could that be good news because it be treatable we can remove your spleen tonight laparoscopically will I be able to run by Saturday we can get to the radiation in the off season hey ma wake up ma wake up I be itchy Means I can play what be you do in the dark lie in wait Jeez what happen to your face right play innocent you be not look for revenge for the prank I do not pull it be karmic justice but I do not do it of course you realize this mean war isolate the gastroepiploic artery nearly there Foreman come and take a look at this Liver 's inflame so the itching be not cause by his spleen it be not lymphoma what happen Wilson annex the Sudetenland no abnormal t cell or b cell it be not lymphoma Liver biopsy only reveal nonspecific inflammation kind of like the time you take your mom 's birth control pill on a dare and end up with swollen nipple that never happen right and your nickname all the way up through high school be not Erica it be not I make that one up with the understanding he still have a sense of humor and would play along Polymyositis would explain the head liver heart even the white finger it would be accompany by a decrease in muscle power Chance to redeem yourself do our patient look strong to you sorry Eric big brother disagree with your diagnosis Felty syndrome the liver be inflame not the spleen can you believe they let this guy perform surgery what request permission to share my idea without be belittle Permission deny continue our patient have cartilage damage in both ankle he get lidocaine shot before every game to mask the pain Team doctor use the same needle twice by accident viral hepatitis you think he be an idiot Marcus I do not think he be an idiot go test his blood come on we have a lunch schedule you jerk I around your allegiance lie with your brother I get it Admirable here be the problem I hire you to tell I the truth if you do not you no long have a job I do not know what secret you be look to uncover but my brother be a decent guy he be arrest for grand theft auto you be go to be disappoint try I he tell you I be with he be it your idea we do everything together I do not know whose idea it be I be 16 he be only 14 he could not even see over the steering wheel he be quick with a flathead screwdriver than most people with a key sorry to interrupt my character assassination with boring medical stuff but when we draw the patient 's blood it clot in the vacutainer so the problem be not in his blood it be the blood itself he be be work out in the cold it be get to be cryoglobulinemia I usually love break bad news but in this case start he on Warfarin I be so sorry about that you be say we drive for about ten minute before we got catch and that be it when our mom come down to the station she do not say a word the whole ride home she come up to the driveway turn off the car we be sit in silence then without turn around she say I will pray for you and she get out of the car you get off easy Easy for you easy for I not easy for Eric his life mission become to never disappoint she like that again because he be a good guy I think he would tell that story at the eulogy but he do not give one your mother 's dead if he do not tell you I be sure he have a reason look you can mock he all you want about pee in the bed please do not bring up our mother your blood contain an abnormally high volume of protein call cryoglobulin they become thick when it get cold outside it be like a car try to run after the oil 's turn to sludge we think that be be cause your problem so I just need a quick oil change and I be good to go this oil change be not so quick we have to put you on blood thinner and other medication the process will take two to three week but after that you should be able to play it will not matter doctor if Daryl do not play in front of the scout on Saturday he will not get draft can not you wait until after the game if we wait and let he play there be a good chance he die right on the field I have an epiphany usually that precede you walk away with purpose so Flathead screwdriver and then I say it be not a game it be proof that you do not rig the grab rail and make I fall I already have proof of that I do not do it I can not go on that but I can go on the fact I have to borrow a flathead screwdriver from Nora to install the thing we only have a Phillips head then I return it late that night in a completely successful effort to see her braless wait a minute which mean you do not have the tool to sabotage the grab rail Braless under like a sweater or like a now I also have proof that I be not responsible for the opossum because I be absolve you instead of escalate which be not my nature so someone be break into our place just to screw with we the opossum be mean for I I be so tired it be exciting till about 2 00 a m now it be just torture do you even go to college this be the escalation be not it keep I up all night nothing happen then you keep I up all night again tomorrow this be your retaliation you see that be just illogical Cause I be stay up too maybe you nap all day I give you empirical proof that I do not prank you no you do not you create empirical proof that I do not prank you sell I on the notion that you do not prank I maybe you self prank I do not master prank be that cut on your cheek even real see this be exactly what our nemesis want divide and conquer can not you see that I be go to bed I be tell you if you sleep now you be go to wake up next to sever horse head or bad the rest of it the flat screen you would never sacrifice the flat screen this guy be

for break up your marriage I be with Thirteen monitor our patient 's IV blood thinner can either of you prove that the patient 's alive and improve be that proof enough for now what about you colonel Taub I be out to dinner with my wife really your wife yes really good enough Cause I have you peg all along you have all the motive in the world first of all I be not interested Second I do not even

medical evaluation board be perfectly fine with nine toed infantryman as long as they can walk and run so I lose a toe for nothing Afraid so unless you want I to keep you on the old antibiotic let the infection spread and we could amputate more than just a toe why be you risk your life for this your mom do not want you to my mom sacrifice everything for I her tell I not to come here be just another example of that I do good out there I could take care of she for the rest of her life who be I if I do not sacrifice for her that be family you okay Everything 's blurry I can not see take I back to

mochas you would be perfect where be you I be busy great we do not have a new symptom we should stick he back on his blood thinner and he can leave in a couple week actually we do have a new symptom any of you take a look at his readmittance chart between the time he check in and the time he rechecke in our patient lose a single pound Patient like that would usually shed over ten pound the obvious answer would be steroid but since we 've already rule they out so he be not inject but he could be get they naturally Paraneoplastic syndrome the body produce antibodie which battle cancer which could act like growth hormone we 've eliminate lymphoma what other cancer mimic growth hormone Lung pancreatic renal breast it be a rhetorical question I do not really care test he for all of they what be you do here you need a job maybe I can talk to House see if I can get your job back soon as he know you be okay with I be there he will not want I back maybe I can help you figure out

Keith Tannenbaum CEO of Atlanticnet insurance right that be I how can I help you I think we can help each other I be Dr Lisa Cuddy dean of medicine at Princeton Plainsboro how be you I be a little unhappy you be aware our contract with your company be up this week we have a negotiating team that be work all that out Princeton Plainsboro have the high rate ER in the state the most advanced ICU and the most innovative diagnostic medicine department in the country good to know now if you do not mind while Atlanticnet insurance have a marketing budget that be more than our pediatric icu and transplant unit combine your PGA sponsorship could pay for our walk in clinic and the money spend on your jet could fund our air ambulance service for the next three year your point be your growth may be good for your bottom line but ours save live and I would rather not have to announce to the press how selective your company appear to be when it come to cut cost Morgan be right you be tough you can portray I as a rich bastard in the press all you want just as long as I stay rich Stan be look for you busy he say it be urgent I do not understand how it be possible I 've check it twice how much ten case ten case go back three year what have you be do you be suppose to be manage the paperwork I sign be correct she must have alter the order afterwards do not you ever cross check it with the bill that come in I delegate it to whom Gail she seem perfectly trustworthy how be I suppose to know by do your job sorry have you notify the DEA the DEA Geez Stan hello you do not steal 50 000 worth of pill because you want to lose weight she be supply a meth lab just get she back in here all right now you ever want a job trust I he will double what you be make here take it he like my proposal enough to tell I to get my ass back over here today here he be willing to go to 8 eight we be at four your board 's go to think you walk on water I want 12 you be not go to get 12 there be just no way 8 barely cover our cost inflation capitate structure should allow you to hold down inflation and shift all your risk onto we which be why we deserve 12 Lisa come on the guy who mow my lawn make more than my kid 's teacher the two guy whose lunch you interrupt could get fire and their severance would be more than most of their employee make it do not have anything to do with what you deserve this be it take it or leave it what be you do know any good transplant surgeon turn out his kidney be not the only thing fail and I know what you be think Malaria would not destroy his liver that fast especially since we never infect he I think Foreman think that he have the authority to overrule I because the FDA would not approve do not worry I will deal with he if you could just talk to Hourani what would you do if you page I during sex about the contract with Atlanticnet I get they to come up to 8 but we should get at least 12 it be all number do the math and nothing else it be not about my pride it be about the principle they be try to screw we over because we be small they be suppose to do they should be pressure other hospital to be more like we not try to make we more like they it be stupid put your job on the line in an effort to stamp out stupidity be not you would probably but then I also want to try to cure cancer by infect a guy with malaria to win a 50 bet you really want to be like I as you know for the past eight month we 've be try to renegotiate our contract with Atlanticnet insurance it be be a difficult process but I want to let you all know before we make the formal announcement that as of 5 00 p m today our contract with Atlanticnet will be terminate we 've double the number of customer service representative in our call center current patient will still be allow to remain in our care for 30 day but start tomorrow we will no long be accept patient with Atlanticnet health insurance why be not we tell about this soon come on Marina pick up the phone I be busy we find a liver match all right get he preppe I will straighten thing out with Hourani Hourani 's not the problem House be now he want Chase to do the surgery to prove to Hourani he do not need he to prove to Thomas that Chase be his department 's good surgeon what do Chase want to do he want to do the surgery and you do not want he I do not care who do it what be the problem to get our patient into the o r we 've to get he on surgery schedule to do that we need someone to put he there who neither House nor Thomas can overrule what would you rather I go back on Vicodin she be not massage your leg she will eventually why be I the only person here who care what happen to this hospital get off your ass and get your department under control at least for the next few day go to take long than a few day for a company of the size of Atlanticnet to start feel the squeeze of your p r campaign if they ever do and you know this how from all the time you 've spend research they and their contract how they handle their press relation I know they have a nascar team despite what you may have learn at Hebrew school or from Jimmy Cliff sometimes the big they be the hard they kick your ass I be not try to be greedy but he be also not interested in be force into a medical bankruptcy Mr Acevedo I be sorry you be have financial difficulty but because of we you still have a thumb I assume that be something a carpenter might need I assume you do not ask for this meeting so you could lecture my client you have insurance but by file this suit you 've cause we to get pay nothing by they either that be not our problem actually it be since he be responsible for any expense we be not reimburse but if you drop this suit and make it clear that Dr Chase be act in your good interest when he reattache your thumb we will be able to resubmit the claim and you will cover his deductible attorney 's fee and 50 grand for pain and suffering actually I be think more like we would cover half his deductible which mean you would only owe 16 000 you want he to pay you do you have any idea how much it cost how many year it take to train someone in microsurgery we give you back your life you can still work you can button your own shirt hold a fork Martin let us go I be sorry I know I should pay but I just can not I still can not work I be already underwater on my house and I have two kid with brace you think you would be in well shape without a thumb right now financially I would be well so would we but when you come in we do not think about that we just take care of you make sure we do whatever you need to get well yeah right all you doctor care about be heal that be why there be those BMWs and Porsches in the parking Damn it Come on we be out of here we will see you in court

God you be pretty we can replace the mitral valve with a pig valve or with a plastic one from an actual pig it be the well choice if you want to have child someday a plastic valve require you to be on

read whatever it be he be ashamed of it I be go with plastic it just make more sense I do not want another operation later that be not why you be do this when you be first tell I about why you love the internet you say that no one have to be alone again whoever you be whatever you love you can connect with someone if you want to recreate the Boston tea party while dress as imperial storm trooper you can find ten people in the world that have always want to do that that have not change but you have this thing that you do it be not about connection anymore it be about an audience it be a performance and you 've get one eye on the number of hit you 've turn our life into their entertainment you be smart you be fun to read it be okay but do not give they this or if you do do not expect

computer be like give plutonium to Dr no get it step by step Sermons for everyday life these be literal sermon write by a minister love thy neighbor even when hisstereo be keep you up at night why would he read this why would he hide it he read the Bible he read the Koran he say he like to know what mistake people be make you think he be sincere that he be get something out of this I do not know what a hypocrite how can we use this in a cruel yet funny way you know what do not mention this to anyone what be the point be you go to be here when I wake up I hate that you do not have a blog I hate that I do not know what you be think let us not get into it right now we need to get you through surgery I do not wanna go in there know that you will stick with I 'cause that be what good guy do but once I be well you will be go let us not get into it now it hurt be it her heart no it be here get she inside your appendix burst we have to remove it and the biopsy confirm it be full of abnormal cell consistent with lymphoma I have cancer we 've postpone put in the new valve I guess we do chemo and all that stuff apparently you 've have this for some time when your appendix burst it be like a dam give way the cell go stream throughout your body so you will treat but you do not expect it to work that be why no valve it be pointless our dean of medicine have approve an experimental treatment we use your unique cancer cell signature to create a target lymphoma vaccine okay so that will cure I well we be not actually sure what it will do but the intention be to train your immune system to recognize and kill cell bear the same malignant signature while leave healthy cell alone but as Dr Foreman say it be experimental I see without it what time be we talk about an exact prognosis be impossible how about a guess something please base on people in situation like yours maybe a year Baby whatever we have to do we will do I can take care of you I can work from home sound good thank you for let I know we will start with the treatment whenever it be ready be she be a good soldier or be she in denial Denial 's not unusual for a first reaction or it could be a symptom some lymphoma affect cognition if it be denial she need time to process if it be a symptom hopefully treatment with the vaccine will help can I borrow your car she give I the key you be a doctor she be do you a favor she barely know I I 've be delude myself that I be actually connect with people the first person I fall in love with turn out to be a total tool I mean he come across all funny and charming and thoughtful but it be an act he see something he want and he know he have to behave a way to get it in retrospect the fact that I be 17 and he be 30 should have be a clue figure out who people be take time it take twice as much time if they be try to impress you now I could take from this that anyone who loan I their car have an ulterior motive or I can accept that it be just a nice thing to do and take people as they come you wanna do the first injection why be you read a book by a unitarian minister Book club Oprah be go on I be serious this this be mess up Patient write it you 've never treat a patient with this name I look it up it be an assignment from my therapist no it be not no one you respect would give you this and expect it to be helpful it be a book of sermon for anyone else spiritually enlighten for you it be practically a psychotic break I know that you have trouble sometimes with the pain without the vicodin be that it be you so out of option you be look for answer in what you consider irrationality I be all right trust I be you all right because you be back on vicodin I say trust I I know this mean something do you mind I have not finish it yet thank for the gift obviously differ from my own personal belief but if these story have help you through some spiritual turmoil Read chapter six entitle shut the hell up I appreciate the inscription about the benefit of prayer before medical treatment I think it be great you 've be call to witness by the Lord chapter two bite I Thirteen 's give our patient her third vaccine injection she be respond well so far where have you get all these copy it be out of print I call the author he be get carton of the thing in his basement you call he what have you say that I know some people who could benefit spiritually from the book do you mention I Fever 's at 104 the antibody trip her autoimmune response the vaccine be kill she well clearly it be not work you have to stop the vaccine Sure give up let she die on schedule it be well than speed up the schedule how quickly do this come on she be all right when I wake she this afternoon for the second injection of the stimulate agent which add to the first injection switch her immune reaction into overdrive why be she sleep who can sleep in a hospital during the daytime I be not surprised she be tired she be always be a night owl just by treat she we 've disrupt her schedule be that what her blog say she be a night owl no she tell I in what tense be be will have be I be not sure what be you onto look at the time stamp on this post 2 30 a m here be one at 4 00 a m whatever he be onto do not change the fact that she have lymphoma and we give she a dangerous vaccine we need to six month ago she be post in the daytime two year ago daytime that be her natural rhythm Day night reversal Sign of liver disease which do not fit lymphoma but we know she have lymphoma we know she have the cell atypia that indicate lymphoma Biopsy her liver that be pretty cool what I do right you wanna make out you do not have lymphoma but my appendix be full of cancer cell your appendix be full of cell that show a lymphocytic atypia we now think they be a granulomatous buildup from some unknown cause so I be not die you be actually die more quickly than we think unless we figure out what be cause your liver failure you have three or four day what the hell do you mean I have three or four day well we be past denial maybe we do not cause the fever we give she the vaccine and her fever spike seem to I but it persist after we take she off the vaccine what if it be a new symptom so we add fever to cell atypia coagulopathy kidney heart liver it have to be an infection which one no one she know be sick she have not travel anywhere there be nothing in the history nothing in her blog there have to be something unique to this infection something about its transmission and the way it manifest there have to be something she be not tell we there be not she be tell we and everyone else everything start she on broad spectrum antibiotic since we know everything we might as well treat for everything I pick up a copy of the book that Chase leave in the lounge if you be go to be this way I be not go to invite you to my baptism first time I would see the real dust jacket the inside back flap there be a picture of the author imagine how surprised I be when I recognize he your biological father be a minister natural selection be not an infallible force I do not get it okay he be a friend of the family you would only know he when you be a kid but if you want to meet he now get an idea of what he be like why not just go talk to he hi it be Greg you sleep with my mother you be capable of it I be mildly curious enough to read a book not make a phone call please you do not read this you study it why all your life you 've think this be crap you can not suddenly turn around and build a whole new worldview base on crap Crap you well not be fake this just to get out of a tough conversation do you poop Come on everybody poop I read the book in medical school Sinkers or floater this be the wizard Greasy and soft or hard and pellet like Floaters and the first one you just have to be so swoft you be a hypocrite no lie no secret but everything stop at your colon 4 000 page not one word about bms I bet your do not smell at all nobody want to hear about that stuff People who do not really care about you do not but doctor might the icky stuff change right a few month ago I become a vegetarian a lot of people misunderstand how a vegetarian diet work you take in less unusable material and your waste get more efficient hard and rounder just look at the fece of rabbit I think I might have some Malabsorption her system 's not retain the necessary nutrient a g I infection cause malabsorption granulomatous buildup of cell it be not contagious since no one around she get sick Whipple 's disease let us split the credit start she on co trimoxazole we all need some secret as long as they do not kill we they keep we safe and warm I be I be go to be okay you will still need a new heart valve and you will be on med for a few year but basically yeah your odd be good thank God I think I wanna go with the pig valve I know you will go crazy if you do not tell people thank god you be an enabler do you think people can actually know each other well on the internet than face to face face can be distract but there be nothing well than look into someone 's eye and everything that go with that I do not know People meet they like something superficial and then they fill in the blank with whatever they want to believe why be you so hang up on this I refuse to believe it be all because you just notice you have a nice face you just come off a relationship you know thing go deeply than be that what this be about you and Cameron I be the one that pursue she maybe I be just fill in the blank maybe the first reaction be right we be just two people who be in proximity and find each other attractive and I never Paranoia you feel something real so do she do not try to take it back now can I borrow your car why would it make more sense for you to read your father 's book than to go talk with he can you write a book so I can stop talk to you you be not look for some big catharsis you do not want to hug the guy you want to know how his head work how he think 'cause I be fascinated with how minister think because you be not ordinary you be way out there on the fringe somewhere I be your good friend and half the time I do not understand you you be alone be alone your whole life when you read that book you be hope that somewhere underneath all that talk of god there would be a way of think a mind that you could recognize you want what we all want the power to transform into any water base object to look across the gulf and know there be someone else like you at least tell I this do you find something there underneath the God stuff More God stuff get maintenance to take that down it be estimate the observable universe be 93 billion light year across it be probably more accure I be go to be so far away I do not care I do not want to break up I will come on the weekend Stanford 's on the other side of the country my dad have like ten million frequent flyer mile he will not care be we all right over here yes Mr Damon I just have something catch in my throat you be not suppose to have any food or drink in here it be just water I have a cough I do not want to disturb anyone we can only observe 4 of the universe the rest of it be unaccounted for I never know you be such a good liar More vodka and you might find out some thing you do not know about I really Nicholas yes sir what conclusion can we draw from the incredible number of star that the movie 's either go to be really good or really bad I be think more about the implication for extraterrestrial life I guess if there be an infinite number of star odd be there be at least one galaxy with life other than our own or or not or our solar system be somehow unique the question then become in what way the question then become could you teach we anything more useless what be you look at my God something 's wrong she be not breathe call 911 r H ésus AB Team La Fabrique Arrow Benj ShalimarFox would you mind at least put a napkin under your jelly toast get a table and I will not eat it on the couch yes you will but I will not have a good excuse why do not you go get a table not my condo you have my permission pick out whatever you want it would be a reflection of I not you that would not be right it would be a reflection of the fact that the guy who be be mooch off of I for as long as I can remember be not a complete ingrate you 've never furnish a home I have furnish a bunch of home no you 've marry a bunch of woman who furnish a bunch of home you want to eat off something Fine move your piano in here eat off that you be afraid of a dining table you know they do not actually come to life when you put a knob off your bedpost on they you be what you sit in your friend your job your furnishing it all define you you do not really believe that you just do not want to do the shopping buy some furniture or admit that you be empty inside X ray confirm the fluid that almost suffocate she to death be from pulmonary edema mean the problem be either in her heart or lung Tox screen 's clean for everything except the alcohol and her b A c be barely 05 that mean she only have one or two drink top and there be no sign of trauma how have you know because if there be Cuddy would not have need I to take the case how do you Foreman 's the only one with the ball to take a case without check with I and he be still work on breakfast which mean that the 18 no 17 year old honor student Cuddy have a soft spot for smart girl and they do not start drink until second semester senior year so either you think that smart woman look out for each other which mean you be an idiot or you think Cuddy 's not smart which mean I guess it be the same both way then how do you Picture fall out of the file she look smart where be Taub you do not already know he be at home in a fight with his wife I be curious what he want I to know his car have a flat tire he be wait for a tow truck what about rise blood pressure from binge drink it could set off a hypertensive crisis cause heart failure two drink be hardly a binge certainly not if you be an Aussie but when an american schoolgirl have two drink before 10 00 be it be a pretty sure bet that the plan be to have a lot more probably be not the first time we will get a c 13 pyruvate MRI to check for cardiac lactic acid level someone call Taub tell he to cut the ball and chain on his own time we be argue about couple yoga we be argue because we do not ever do anything together anymore we do not ever do anything together I love you but I swear if you start talk to I like I be on the witness stand again I break your neck we do stuff together all the time really like what besides sleep watch tv go out to dinner what do we do together just the two of we we you do not like go out to dinner all right I will do the yoga forget it now you do not want I to do it go to work I be not leave until we work this out I be fine please just go where be Abby Nash I be Nick her boyfriend this be my dad you can wait in where be she be she okay she be have some test run be she okay we think her drinking may have damage her heart her heart she do not drink not that much just when she be at school Nick what be he talk about it be a field trip one of the kid have a fake I d but Dad you know Abby tell he I know she when you be with I if you be right the test will come back negative can you give she a message I bring her homework and I love she sorry I be late Nick love you House do not believe you get a flat tire what do he think I be do fight with the wife why would I lie about that she want I to do yoga we need thin cut when you and Cameron have disagreement I be probably not the good guy to go to for marital advice sorry Punch in to the mitral valve all right I get the message no I be serious what be that could be a fungus e r draw blood culture all negative no parasite no fungus it could be fastidious enteric bacteria you think she be be eat your wife 's cooking I be on your side man I be not fight with my wife I have a flat tire it be in my trunk you can go look at it if you want do not need to Face tell I you be bluff not yours Chase 's if she be infect through the intestinal tract she would have symptom there be other way to get bacteria into the bloodstream she be not an intravenous drug user she have no tattoo and no scar that would indicate she be not a cutter Transesophageal echo could give we a well idea of what we be look at if that valve be about to dehisce echo could trigger a heart attack so come up with a well idea or have a crash cart ready why be you lie to House Chase tell I what be the big deal we can talk about this another time or never I really do not think she be go to tell anyone if I admit we be fight he be go to want to know what about so tell he or tell he it be none of his business this be easy really because it seem much hard what do I know I be not a guy if only I could be as open about my emotional life as you be it be not about the yoga really I think it be since we spend an hour talk about it but what do I know I be not a girl my guess be she think you do not want to spend time with she because you be spend it with someone else if she think I be cheat she would ask because you would tell the truth I be not see anyone else do not matter you have a history and that be not her fault so what be I suppose to do I can not prove a negative that be a problem there be the heart valve look fine no vegetation no myxomatous change can you give she a little more sedative she be dissect she be rupture get the scope out this do not make sense B p be normal her heart rate be control we will figure it out later we 've only get about 30 second to get her open no leakage from cannulation site Nice let us see if she will start up Cardiac paddle charge and go Come on again go push five cc adrenaline Zap she again it be not work Clear Clear normal sinus rhythm thank God TEE and intra operative visualization show no vegetation on the valve no structural abnormality the dissection mean alcohol do not cause the hypertensive crisis by we you mean you you do not have any well idea it be not my fault I be busy try to judge Taub since we already rule out trauma the dissection be probably genetic she be not marfanoid what about an allergy a severe enough one could set off a systemic immune reaction cause fluid in the lung and inflammation weaken the aorta if it be an allergy she would be get well not bad unless it be inside her Meaning you want my sperm we think a severe allergic reaction could be cause systemic breakdown to my son 's sperm his semen be more likely the problem which I realize be not what you be react to when be the last time you have unprotected sex never I use a condom you always use a condom for everything for most everything when the night before she collapse I be place a drop of Nick 's semen protein onto the skin then I will abrade it with a needle check for a rash in an hour or so Mom come on we 've be date for three year I be not mad sweetheart I be just confuse a systemic reaction can be trigger by the protein in semen in most case the reaction be fairly minor but in rare case repeat exposure can trigger a hypersensitivity response repeat exposure I know I know three year be it suppose to hurt the reaction should take long no it be not that what be wrong my stomach blood in the urine no allergic reaction but her kidney be fail could be some kind of neuropathy syphilitic lightning pain it be not syphilis VDRL and enzyme immunoassay be negative blood clot while she be on anticoagulant from the surgery Interstitial nephritis would not cause the edema or dissection but cancer could would you care to be more specific if I could I would have we could do a full body scan we hate full body scan and by we you mean you we also hate when a patient die before we figure out what be wrong with they do the scan how can you convince someone you be not cheat do not cheat after a while they will catch on what if I do not want to wait take they with you for 24 hour so your wife be a little insecure be that so bad you know she still care I know she care what I want be for she to be happy what you do not think I want my wife to be happy Sure as long as it make you happy what do you think I think you work quickly Piece of cake give they money they give you furniture not bad huh it be not bad at all it be take a really long time just hang in there and try not to talk unless you have to it can affect the image what be that be you still there there be something wrong with the machine it be not the machine it be an earthquake we will get you out get I out now oh my God I can not hold on it be a black hole she be hallucinate I certainly hope so Hallucination mean brain problem brain problem do not split your aorta a vascular problem could explain both Inflammation in the blood vessel wall lead to dissection in the aorta and could cause an aneurysm in the brain that could cause the vision it be a bit convoluted but brain and heart function be susceptible if there be any sign of inflammation that would make sense it be not funny I get enough problem already trust I this be go to help an aneurysm explain the hallucination it be the one thing we have not exclude from the differential your texting do not prove you be faithful just prove you know she think you be unfaithful can not force trust what do she hallucinate the content of the hallucination be not relevant not usually not ever we know nothing brain know all you get an ulcer you do not know it but the brain increase mucin secretion it know what the problem be where the problem be it be a big logical jump from a body 's immune response to the brain give subconscious diagnostic clue what about dream about waterfall if you need to go to the bathroom that be the same as the brain shout you have cancer her subconscious be try to tell she something we need to eavesdrop she be scream she be be suck into a black hole so we should look for a tumor in her anus we need the whole story the cognitive pattern recognition program might tell we what be go on in her head or we could act on something base on science not sci fi get an mra with contrast to see if she have an aneurysm unless you think Cuddy 's go to go for the mind read Fine do the MRA when it come back negative we can move on to the crazy but possible idea what do you do with the furniture I return it you tell I to buy it but you do not buy it you rent it you make one phone call economy furniture supply we get it do so you do not have to so what we have a table chair but no clue what any of it mean Fine I will hire a decorator Perfect another woman to tell you who you be I will hire a male decorator Step inside one furniture store and find one thing you like I like not do this one where be my mom she go down to get some breakfast how be you feel well besides the fact that I can barely breathe and I ache all over not good anything I can do just do not go I be not go anywhere be a while since we 've go more than a day without do that not go anywhere what have you say I 've be think be a long time since we go more than a day without do that we have a secret you do not need to answer right now Abby I want to marry you tell he it be okay something 's wrong what be you feel I do not know your secret be kill you I see maybe it be all the medication I be just can you hear I you deserve to die four milligram of lorazepam she seize for over a minute inner ictal EEG show no synchronous discharge and the MRA no aneurysm or arterial or venous malformation in the brain as predict what do we say we would move on to out of body experience can be induce by sensory overload in the temporoparietal junction which be clean on MRI MRA and whole body scan which just leave we with the question of what happen during the out of body experience if I say her BP shoot up over 200 and she bite her tongue would that be a satisfactory answer sure if you then go on to answer the following do she float above her body do she see Jesus do she bathe in the Ganges no no and no can we get back to the medical science she claim she emerge from her body as a young version of herself and start talk she could not remember what be discuss I be sure it be not a differential cognitive pattern recognition be 50 year from be a diagnostic tool even if we can get the equipment it take hour for the initial mapping she could stroke out Coincidentally she could also have a stroke if we do nothing I be not tell a mother who be scared out of her mind our good shot be a magic trick it be not magical it be experimental just like wash your hand after poope once be technically it be not our good shot it be our only shot Perfect Foreman get her consent the rest of you go down to the cog sci lab Equipment should already be there I will catch up thank for the invite not sure I be up for the hospital food good 'cause I be not plan on lunch while you watch video clip a computer map how your brain process the image how long will it take six hour but that be really just the prep once the computer map how she process the information we will put she under sedation use the same equipment to monitor her unconscious thought hopefully it will spit out a basic

the knight eat all kind of disgusting stuff why he get the idea from Fear Factor why do not he mention it I make they all take an oath of secrecy about the ritual William tend to take his role as a knight very seriously do you think that be what cause he to pass out that be not exactly sanitary Fun stuff never be serious bacterial food poisoning explain seizure and vomit a lumbar puncture could confirm except it be not food poisoning if it be the e r would look like Camelot right now all it take be one bad eyeball or testicle cow brain or my personal favorite pig rectum with a side order of sphincter they call that breakfast in Australia no one else be sick 'cause they be not allergic like he to what that be what I send you to Middle Earth to find out run scratch test for the sample you

little jerk around he could not foresee Sam come back into his life that be a very rational defense of your friend and I be not buy it base on what base on the fact that you be late and you do not notice the picture in the outer office those be not symptom they be to I and here be another one you take the case no negotiating no bargaining no clinic hour change hand be you look for something to distract you 'cause your good friend throw you out case be interesting it be not organic it be not mysterious most likely some psychologically traumatic event occur that make the patient 's brain choose to forget everything or not here Loss of differentiation between gray and white matter that be subtle it be in the area that control memory not likely it be a coincidence bacterial infection do I need to know this Fine I will give you the cliff note version Chase M S Taub Physical trauma I can tell you why we rule they out or not it be probably a toxin we need to find it before it kill her we should search her house good luck with that her heart rate monitor have a serial number the distributor can match the number to the store that sell it she be a serious athlete maybe someone will remember her Brilliant do he really say that subtextually long shoot even if the store clerk do not know who she be the store 's close to where she live see those surrounding might spark a memory you want we to take she there no I will take she really it be unusual for you to spend time with a patient be not it patient be bore as people this one I be sure be no exception but her situation be interesting besides I be still avoid Wilson and no well way to avoid than leave the hospital maybe or be you avoid go home there be a reason they tell addict to stay away from old geography I be not avoid go home I would already go home before I come into work that day I go straight there from Wilson 's take it easy you be go to kill I God why do not people knock House it be you where you be hold up a second Alvie Juan Alvarez you let he stay at your place not exactly I be wonder if you be ever go to show up Su casa mi casa Casa why be you here when I leave Mayfield I go back to the old neighborhood you should not leave the bathroom window unlock thank for the safety lesson why be you here when I go back to the neighborhood immigration be look for I so I decide to visit my old buddy House and turn his apartment into a giant prison jumpsuit Juan Alvarez be no freeloader I do my part earn my keep the first week I make your dinner but you never show up the second week I organize your stuff my stuff but still you never show up so this week since I be a real good painter I decide to Coffee table where have you put it in the bedroom the paint be not cheap House it be a custom color a mix of titanium yellow and ochre Ochre I do not even like that stuff it be like a fruit it be get hair on it but they say it be a vegetable you sell my table to pay for paint that I do not want I have to sell some other thing too get out Papa just give the color a chance I be go to work now and when I come back the wall will be a less exciting color and you will be go so Wilson throw you out and you throw Alvie out just another week unlike I Alvie do not leave I take my motorcycle to work that day when I go home to get my car he be paint the ceiling magenta so I bring he with I to protect the apartment why to protect the apartment Deja vu toss he out or send he to the movie or lock he in the bathroom would also minimize Alvie 's destructive force but you choose his company deliberately why obviously because he be a Wilson substitute there be no difference between they when Wilson rap about the hood I be not suggest Alvie 's a substitute but he would make a great distraction from what that be what I be try to find out go on maybe the heart rate monitor be a gift that be why no one recognize she Shut up Alvie anything familiar Church grocery store it be okay Ms X maybe she be never be to this town before buy the heart rate monitor on the store 's website you know that Puerto Ricans be U S citizen right instead of work the case why do not you contemplate the inanity of an American with immigration issue I have a birth certificate I lose it so get a new one I try that but the town hall have burn down when I be a kid destroy the record there be only one copy they try to make I fill out form before they would give it to I I decide it would be quick and easy to do it myself how would that go they figure out it be forge and now for some reason they do not believe anything I say they think I be lie about be Puerto rican tell I I have to go to a special hearing to prove it what if nothing ever look familiar then someone will show up a spouse a friend to tell you who you really be and what you should be feel they always do I do not know who that be but I miss he what do they say at the hearing I do not go I lie once your mother be Puerto rican

you I be choose my diagnosis base on personal issue she fall down the stair pee her pant 'cause Wilson dump she too you be choose to tell I about this case so let us look at it first you be fixate on a harmful toxin from her past you be worried about a harmful toxin Chase have the toxin idea maybe he be obsessed with my past a seizure disorder which be also not a toxin but which be most likely cause by an old injury to the brain why do you see your past as such a threat not only be I unthreatene by it I be try to get it back there be a ding mark it be a piece of junk it be dinge when it come in Sure the cup mark and the scuff and the paint and those three chip this fourth one be new I run a pawn shop not a storage company do you want it or not that should be it you say you pawn five book there be only four that be all there be where be approach to the acute abdoman sell it to I can not tell you it be a law and it should be crazy bastard like you try to hunt down their stuff how much for the pile 500 you say it be junk it be your junk you want it 500 take it or leave it why be it so important that you get your stuff back unlike the rest of humanity who be okay when their belonging be take everyone want their stuff that be why it be their stuff everyone do not pay 5 time what it be worth I like my stuff I hate it when Wilson move it this be not about Wilson say it I be not go to say anything 31 31 Hike first down one more you get a touchdown you can not run for the touchdown and hike wait wait you seriously think you be go to tell I that Wilson show up but not tell I what he say because I think you be a smart guy who do not need the obvious spell out to he Wilson notice that I do not come to my office all day he come to find I want to make sure I be okay Boring boring boring but you think it be important to tell I about nerf football sorry your story continue you okay it be my mother 's she die when I be four it be all I have leave that be very sad I set up an immigration hearing no House I be go to end up in jail or bad the Dominican or someplace Que se yo Que no interesting you present yourself as not give a damn about other people 's emotion but your action indicate otherwise you dismiss Alvie 's story about his mother but you care enough to schedule a hearing I care for eight second then I got distract we 've keep the patient up for 12 hour now no hint of seizure like activity we should shut this down try a strobe light add more stress there be plenty of stress in here do not we ever do anything but work you run that be just more work what about fun God how can we be this boring apparently without her memory the patient 's personality have return to what you might call its natural state seem she have a wake up call while she be at college her brother die in a car accident she decide to make her life mean something go to law school now that be all go the thing that cause the change be go so the change itself be go I know the psychological aspect of this case would interest you Bet you get a theory already what be it it be not relevant what be it why do you care about my theory I think he just bore her she be at an early stage of development she be look at her grow up future and it put she to sleep if he just bore she she would hide it to be polite their problem be synchronicity just like you and I House they be not on the same page he talk to she like someone he share history with from her point of view he be a stranger force intimacy on her of course she do not like he he be not help he can feel he be lose his wife and it make he come on strong he almost do lose his wife the breathing problem be cause by fluid overload in the lung diabete insipidus and the d I come from damage to the hypothalamus Hypothalamus here hence the d I and incontinence they mingle here there be the amnesia the motor cortex that be the paralysis what they all have in common now you be just do this to mess with I what possible relevance do this differential have to your problem it end with a diagnosis of spongiform encephalitis I convince the team to cut out part of this woman 's brain that be not interesting to you not even if it be the amygdala she will lose all her long term memory this be where you tell I that be cavalier with someone else 's past have nothing to do with avoid your own past the case be irrelevant you just find it interesting be not therapist suppose to be nurture nowhere be that in the manual look you 've be in therapy for a year when I ask you to talk about anything I mean anything that affect you what upset you what make you mad or relieved or joyful you want I to believe that this case mean nothing then why should I listen to it be you charge I for this time this be ridiculous what be that on the back of your arm it be just a bruise and I fall you remember fall I be drunk hence the balance issue well it look like you fall on the tip of someone 's boot I say something that someone object to if you do not remember then how it be the way it be when someone hit I People who kick when you be down be jerk but they be generally not irrational jerk you get drunk enough to get into a bar fight and not remember and you 've be insist that everything be fine why go out and get blind drunk be you look for a fight I do not know what have you screw up what you say that when you 've be hit in the past it be because you provoke it with something that you say which mean you be well aware of the risk so on some level you be in that bar look for someone to hurt you logically people punish themselves for something they do or something they do not do so what do you screw up I do not know okay there may be a problem all right let us talk about Wilson I tell he your book be contaminate with Anthrax spore then I give he 300 the address of the buyer maybe I be hasty in ask you to move out why do not you stay with I and Sam for a while there be no need to hurry thing what prompt this look the whole idea be that after Mayfield you would not be on your own I can touch base with you a lot more easily if you be stay God 's sake Wilson you really span the chasm from wishy to washy if you be go to be an ass be an ass Stick with it why be you be so hard on he when he be be conciliatory come on Cuddy play on his guilt she put he up to this how do you know that how do you know this be not entirely his own idea two reason first he want to create the perfect environment to be with Sam he be be think about ask I to leave for a while finally he do it and immediately turn around and change his mind no he talk to somebody maybe it be Sam yeah that be a possibility I want this to be the last serious relationship I ever have I want this to be the one I too where be House it be not as meaningful without he not Sam that still do not answer why Cuddy because they 've be talk about I she call I to check on the patient which she never do without a reason I ask why and she say she be a barracuda attorney House these be the kind of patient we like to keep happy right now the patient 's lucky if she can spell jurisprudence yeah but when she get that memory back which we be try to make happen she will be able to spell lawsuit I be just touching base touching base Wilson use exactly the same phrase collude about I be her favorite pastime okay you think they talk how do you think that conversation go I be worried about House I too could not you have wait it be way too early for he to be on his own back in the old apartment what make you think he can handle it I offer to find he a new place you 've to let he back Sam and I just get he out you know what House be like he be self destructive without constant supervision he be go to slide back into drug if you be not watch he I 've get to so they do not trust you they assume you will fail be these their fear or yours let us turn on the light in your brain maybe they do talk about you but how do you know it do not happen like this I be worried about House why it be the first time he will be on his own since Mayfield you be be overprotective he do not need to be wrap in cotton wool but you know that or you would not have ask he to move out I guess this be really about I it be just I feel like a jerk Sure Sam and I be go to want to be on our own eventually but I kind of spring this on he the right way would 've be to just tell he to take as long as he need that there be no hurry so it be not what you do but how you do it that matter in a friendship I need to fix this why do not you talk to he about move back in just touch base we be have a consent issue with the patient wait a minute Taub be not here yeah he be we be have a consent issue with the patient what be Taub do in my imaginary version of this scene your version need to be end 'cause it be crap it be all sweetness and light and Faith that I be go to choose the right path yeah that sound like Wilson I have as much evidence for mine as you do for yours I know Wilson 's your friend so he could be wonder if he do right by you he would not have ask you to move out unless he be convince you could handle life on your own and I know that he and Cuddy have go behind my back before to strategize about the House problem so there be truth in both version but you choose to focus on the part that make you uncomfortable so why be you and Wilson friend do you think this friendship be the good you can do Wilson be not a consolation prize there you be defend he a minute ago he be skulk around like some sort of manipulative Iago he be my friend so what do you value in he I can say whatever I want to he and he will never leave he be sort of leave at least he will not be around as much because he be put Sam first for now after the divorce he will probably ask I to move in again I take the long view you say that to Wilson be you kid that be the kind of remark that lead people to hate you maybe you 've be right from the beginning maybe this be not about he you say that I finally agree with you do you just argue the opposite of whatever I say I do not mean the Wilson thing do not bother you but it sound like he be the close you can come to a safe relationship you would have to do something major to screw it up what else have you be involve in this week what would you want to punish yourself for I tell you I do not know okay let us approach it from a different angle have you get any other people angry at you over anything that be why I call it an ordinary week okay tell I about it you would be lose a part of your brain it be my brain why be it not my right to consent I be sorry but I will take this to court if necessary Sidney 's in no position to make decision about herself right now she do not know who she be I read your consent form I understand it I want the surgery why would not she of course she be willing to risk lose her memory permanently she have no idea how important those memory be do she even know what risk be she be never lose anything without the surgery she will lose everything the prion infection will continue to advance and destroy her whole brain there have to be another way please I be speak for my wife the wife I live with for four year who be not here and can not defend herself be you listen well you can stop argue 'cause it do not matter anymore look at the variability in the heart rate the S e have spread into the brain stem wherever it be you can still cut it out no we can not cut the brain stem this thing be move too quickly Surgery 's no long an option which I guess mean you 've win Congratulations Put in a pacer and start she on chemo and radiation it will not cure she but it will buy a couple week so she can find out who she be before she die that be pretty rough do you always break the news that way or be you short hand it for I Husband be be an idiot well he be ask for it but to punish he you have to punish the wife too why do he make you so angry because he do not want to cooperate with you he would rather risk his wife 's life than their marriage People 's brain stop work when they think they be go to lose someone they love your leg hurt it be all right anyone else you piss off 50 buck for the book forget it you pay 25 that be 100 return that be what I pay but it be a rare surgical text nearly 100 year old plate 's in mint condition that book 's worth
