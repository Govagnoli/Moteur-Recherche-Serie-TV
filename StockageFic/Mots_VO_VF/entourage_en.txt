del vo on September the 3rd 2006 a completely independently finance movie crew set out into the hill of Colombia to make a movie about one of the most fear drug lord in history a young director first time producer and an up and come movie star all have one goal to make something special People people I be invite along to document the ride Gather around Gather around everyone take a moment Breath in the air Focus on your surrounding this be now your home everything you leave behind be behind you whether it be your wife your child or your fucking cocker spaniel name Lucy none of they matter the only thing that matter be what you can see thank you I know go into this that Billy be go to be a handful it be my job to handle he and bring the movie in on budget but you have no experience no none

producer because why take a chance Vinnie really want to do this movie and there be no stop he but then when he want to put up his own money I think that be crazy because look most movie lose money it be my job as a talent representative to make sure that even if a movie lose all of its money my client still see all of his I 've never hear you mention this problem before make no difference I be tell you now make sure a crane can pull right through there get it have you hear it I have not hear it you do not disagree no I do not do you I do not know 'cause I have not hear what the problem be

walk out of the theater shake their fucking head in disgust we be suppose to shoot in three day the guy suddenly tell we that he hate the ending so what do you do shoot yourself in the head with a large caliber bullet I say we shut down for a week no we work on the end it will cost we a little money but if we start shoot and then have to shut down it will be disastrous we will have something to shoot I be ready to roll I do not want to slow down so we be in agreement it be up to E do not worry suit I promise we will have something to shoot I will write it and it will be brilliant I promise

year I 've develop a foolproof system for judge the merit of an agency you 've have practice see how often you 've be drop never officially drop one do move without tell I so what be your system I judge an agency on four category Decor service amenity and ambience give up to ten point for each category the agency with the high overall score win I devise it for my visit to day spa but it be perfectly applicable I be sure there be a direct correlation between Vince 's career and your anti age regiman I give them a six for decor I mean what kind of self respect agency have fake plant in their lobby they be not fake there be a girl water they maybe the water 's fake hi Vince I be Vanessa Gene 's assistant I love the decor hi and you must be Eric hi how be you I be Turtle how you do and you be not for sale honey everyone be wait at the conference room if you gentleman would like to follow I we will be out soon do not even offer we a drink Zero for service yeah but still I would

I defy anyone to define where life stop and the film start del vo or vice versa del vo on September the 3rd 2006 a completely independently finance movie crew set out into the hill of Colombia to make a movie about one of the most fear drug lord in history a young director first time producer and an up and come movie star all have one goal to make something special People people I be invite along to document the ride Gather around Gather around everyone take a moment Breath in the air Focus on your surrounding this be now your home everything you leave behind be behind you whether it be your wife your child or your fucking cocker spaniel name Lucy none of they matter the only thing that matter be what you can see thank you I know go into this that Billy be go to be a handful it be my job to handle he and bring the movie in on budget but you have no experience no none actually in fact four year ago I be run a pizza place and now they put you in charge of a 30 million budget only in

I always try to steer my client away from work with inexperienced director and producer because why take a chance Vinnie really want to do this movie and there be no stop he but then when he want to put up his own money I think that be crazy because look most movie lose money it be my job as a talent representative to make sure that even if a movie lose all of its money my client still see all of his I 've never hear you mention this problem before make no difference I be tell you now make sure a crane can pull right through there get it have you hear it I have not hear it you do not disagree

genius film that people be love turn they on a dime against we and have they walk out of the theater shake their fucking head in disgust we be suppose to shoot in three day the guy suddenly tell we that he hate the ending so what do you do shoot yourself in the head with a large caliber bullet I say we shut down for a week no we work on the end it will cost we a little money but if we start shoot and then have to shut down it will be disastrous we will have something to shoot I be ready to roll I do not want to slow down so we be in agreement it be up to E do not worry suit I promise we will have something to shoot I will write it and it will be brilliant I promise okay okay all right you do not get on a set get ready to shoot and then ask for rewrite studio do this crap all the time

not see Salma Hayek when that girl just read have some fucking imagination suit Makeup wardrobe she can be more plain as you say but her essence be something special Agreed Vince yeah agree e okay makeup any shot she will have a nude scene in the film Bill well I do not see it personally but what I do believe be that Billy know exactly what he want so it be my job to support he as long as he get it all do and the ending have he get that do not yet so what do you do I support he for now eight week later del vo October the 27th the first day of production have arrive the set be all up why be that door red I think it pop it pop how be I go to see blood splatter on a red door Fuckwad Change it the actor be all cast show some fucking fire as soon as I get this on vinnie we will put that

that happen he be good he be good too you take he away you be not trouble by it no when I get Jason to agree to do this I know that I be hire an actor that be very fiery and volatile but also capable of a brilliant performance so what then so it mean I have to pick my battle or I might lose they altogether what about I you Vincent you be stable I do not have to worry about lose you do I I be just
