for we what be we go to do two day later we want to do everything we can to uphold the contract but what if we be unable to conceive oh well that be highly unlikely give your combine genetic but you would be in default you would lose the house any equity your credit would be damage for year it would be unpleasant what if we have a miscarriage or we just want to move sorry no that be all cover in your agreement so basically we be trap here expect to mate on demand no you make it sound like it be a zoo you be say that every couple for the last 20 year have Spit out baby on your schedule and live happily ever after it be a delicate biosocial balance we have single we have couple without child we 've never ask anyone to conceive who be not already plan on do so now in the application that you sign you state that you want to become pregnant within 6 month I can show you if do not remember that be ok we 've be do this a long time we be very good at choose our neighbor we have faith in you yeah I be look at this contract why would you sign this why do not you call I first be it legal it be a legal document it be a ridiculous breach of civil liberty but you sign it I just want some control move I mean there would be consequence no we can not tracy do not want to go she do not know I be do this but if we have a baby we be stuck in this place tell I what you want I to do help I
