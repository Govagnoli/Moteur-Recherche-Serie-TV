Projet SG 1 00 all right get out get out of the way this be Scott slow down the evac we be come in too hot Colonel come in my God where be we what be this place get they off the gate where be we what be this why do not we come through to Earth there be no time to explain off to the side what be go on this be Scott come in Colonel come in I need a medic over here can you move your finger no I think my arm 's break okay just hold your arm there and we will put it in a sling okay keep calm keep calm Clear this area there could still be more incoming be you okay yeah oh God move move where the hell be we where be Colonel Young he be right behind I move move move Quiet stay calm excuse I keep it down move move Colonel Colonel do not move where be we I do not know sir be you Sir you be in charge all right yes sir I be come Clear the crowd people come through let us go move move be he okay I do not know what be this place look I just do what Rush tell I to where be he I do not know he go through Eli help I find he well I what in the hell be that I do not know Sergeant I need you to get these people settle and you find out who and what we 've get nobody leave this room yes sir Eli now the core of the planet be the power source you have to channel it into the weapon to destroy the ship can not do it dude doing it it be a programmer 's joke a problem unsolvable already solve it no you do not just shut up and watch this what the hell what happen nothing happen I be back at the beginning you be so full of yourself no it work the firing code lock in whatever that be extremely unsatisfying Eli Wallace actually Eli 's not here right now okay whatever you guy think that I do I swear you 've get the wrong guy do I look like someone who would be stand here if I do not already know everything there be to know about you yeah not really right who be you Dr Nicholas Rush may we come in why you 've spend a great deal of time recently play an online fantasy game call Prometheus big brother 's get nothing well to do last night you solve the Dakara weapon puzzle yeah a month of my life go into that you know what happen when you solve that thing nothing we be here that happen to complete that particular puzzle you have to solve a millennia old mathematical proof write in another language for that you 've win something of a prize well whatever it be I will take the cash equivalent there be not one it be a non disclosure agreement Non disclosure so you guy really embed a top secret problem into a game hope someone like I would solve it so what do you need I for now I assure you it will be worth your while to sign it and if I do not we will beam you up to our spaceship right I think I want my lawyer to look over it first and by lawyer I assume you mean mother so we will just agree then that I will call you what the welcome aboard the Hammond Eli yes that be the planet Earth and yes you be on a spaceship we need your help Eli to be honest I do not know how long it be go to take I should call my mom tell she where I be that be probably not go to work up right you can speak to she on the way there be a cover story to follow I be sorry on the way to to another planet 21 light year from here I can not go I I have thing that we know about your mother 's condition you just know everything do not you we also know you be currently unemployed and that your mother 's medical coverage be an ongoing issue we will see she get the good care while you be go and if I do not sign what you be go to erase my memory something like that can I get some pant hello I be Dr Daniel Jackson and behind I be a Stargate it be originally build millennium ago by an alien race who we call the ancient over the next few hour we will be touch on some there be 39 symbol represent star constellation as see from Earth when a connection be make between two Stargates an unstable energy vortex emerge from the gate and settle into the event horizon or puddle as we like to call it later it be discover that use an eighth symbol would actually dial another galaxy in hundred of thousand of light year via an interstellar wormhole it be believe an unprecedented amount of power be require mysterious ninth chevron the first six symbol Icarus base be establish on a planet discover two year ago the entire purpose of the project be to hopefully one day dial the nine chevron address find in the ancient database hi I be Dr Daniel Jackson now you 've hear the term hyperspace for year where be you it be top secret I be serious ma I can not say anything more than that I do not understand why could you not at least tell I you be leave I be sorry but do you get the letter from yeah the Air Force I get it be you in a plane now you sound like you be in an airplane no it be nothing like that I want you to know that they be go to look after you you do not have to do this this be good really it be the kind of thing I always dream of hi you mind no go ahead thank you first time on a spaceship too I I 've be on lot of various Eli Wallace I know you 've hear of I I have that almost never happen and you be Chloe I work for Alan Armstrong Senator of California yeah yeah I have hear of California my last job be in the burger and fry field how have you line that up I be a political science major at Harvard so I hear it be a good school for a while there I be at MIT I know really what else have they tell you about I what I 've see this writing before in the game yeah we be on a ship the design be clearly ancient in the true sense of the word launch hundred of thousand of year ago fast than light yet not through hyperspace what be you do who know how far it be travel we 've get a lot of wounded we need to get home Lt Scott come in go ahead we 've get a problem one of the air vent just shut down in here copy that yeah the air 's get pretty thin in here too what do that mean that the life support system be fail we should probably do something about that well it be always just one more year it be a command where it be a lot safe than other place you 've put your time in Everett when this tour be over I promise you know what never mind do not bother you always end up choose somewhere other than here I be not choose my job over you how you can even say that to I I love you but I can not wait anymore be you okay sweetheart baby look at I Colonel oh my God can not you do something he be have a seizure there be nothing I can do Scott this be Colonel Young come in please our guest have arrive a few minute early what be your position no not yet Lieutenant drop whatever you be do and get your ass up here I be on my way sir Bye Holy Senator it be my honor to welcome you to Icarus base this be my executive assistant Chloe it be a pleasure to meet you sir the pleasure 's mine she be also my daughter you must be the Contest winner yeah that be a big gun Rail gun 500 round per minute this be Lieutenant Scott he be be assign to you Mr Wallace shall we go inside Unbelievable yeah it be it be weird how fast you can start to take something like this for grant so if a Stargate can instantly transport you to another planet why do we fly here on a spaceship something to do with how this one be tie into the planet for power apparently it be be modify to only dial out because incoming wormhole be too dangerous you be the genius you can probably tell I well all I do be solve a puzzle in a video game you figure out something doctor Rush have be try for month which by the way a lot of people be glad to see you know Colonel Telford Ready for this Colonel you just give the word sir I give it quite a while ago Colonel I be just here to see how my 1 6 billion be be spend very good thank you everyone dismiss now as you know up until now we have be unable to channel the precise amount of power necessary to unlock the Stargate 's ninth and final chevron however thank to some ingenuity from young Mr Wallace here that problem have finally be solve we 've hear that before this time we be sure that be what I figure out I embed the mathematical problem we have to solve into the game I then engineer your solution into a practical workable application what say we get on with it absolutely Sergeant Riley Chevron 1 encode Sir we be dial now a test to see if we can connect Chevron one lock if we do we will send an automate reconnaissance drone through we will see what be on the other side Chevron 2 lock and then they will go no first we close down again assess the datum we receive and then perhaps send the away team if it work Chevron 4 lock until then they be just interested observer like we Chevron 5 lock Chevron 6 encode Chevron 6 lock Chevron 7 encode Chevron 7 lock Chevron 8 encode Chevron 8 lock Chevron 9 encode what be go on I do not know we never get this far before Chevron 9 Chevron 9 will not lock we match the power requirement down to the EMU it must work Power level in the gate capacitor be go into the red shut it down no wait we 've fluctuation from the core Shut it down now it should have work well it do not and draw power from the core be dangerous we be aware regardless of what be be spend my first priority be to ensure the safety of the people on this base of course of course we would well run through your equation again you will excuse I you be not seriously put this on I not my fault People you have to calm down seriously you have to calm down we get power can I have everybody 's attention please all right please listen listen up what be go on we be on an ancient spaceship what that be all I 've get now what that mean be it mean we need to use the Stargate to get we all back home that be definitely on the list of thing to do but right now it be an order we be work on it I need to speak to the person responsible for this where be Dr Rush just shut up for a second how dare you talk to I Dad Dad please Water over here sit down my pill look I be sorry I be just try to explain the situation we be on a ship but we have no idea where we be in relation to Earth now with respect sir the reason you might be have a hard time breathing right now be because the ship 's life support system be not function properly Dr Rush be work on that right now Brody and Park here here okay good you two be with I but these console just come on no nobody touch anything yet Dr Rush need your help everybody else just stay calm stay put please stay put what do you mean you be just go like that there have to be a mistake in here somewhere seriously who use a whiteboard anymore you have computer like everywhere around here Power flow be in the target range why would not the address connect wrong address there be only one find in the ancient database on Atlantis with no other instruction no but that be not the issue it have to be your proof my proof work you know how I know that it do because you say so gentleman how be it come what be you do start from the beginning wait Save save Mr Wallace I would like you to join I for dinner in the officer 's mess we be quite close to a breakthrough actually I would like Eli to keep work well we 've be here for six month it can wait a few more hour thank you you be welcome so Colonel you really have no idea where this ninth chevron Stargate address be go to send you no idea at all but the Ancients build the Stargate with nine chevron it be get to go somewhere we 've also know for some time the only way to unlock the ninth chevron be to solve the power issue well if anyone be go to solve it I think Eli will that be right it be true I be Mathboy I would like to propose a toast no that be really not necessary not to you when the proposal for this project first cross my desk I do not want to approve it it seem clear to I at the time there be enough terrestrial matter of importance that need that money now be a proud father of a beautiful young woman be one thing have that young woman exceed every possible expectation be quite another it be my daughter Chloe who remind I that there be no great endeavor than seek an understanding of who we be and the mystery of the universe not in those exact word it be also her idea to embed the ancient proof in a medium that would give we access to brilliant young mind that we would have overlook and so to all the brave man and woman who have volunteer what be that this be Young the base be under attack all non combatant personnel report to your designate area everyone else to your battle station this be not a drill Senator I need you and your daughter to go with Lieutenant Scott Eli you as well what be go on in here the life support system be on but for some reason it be not work properly I be attempt to reset it he have no idea what he be do step away from that thing that screen say what you be do eli please be that what it say or not you know what it say in this screen because I embed a rudimentary version of the ancient language into the game this be not a game do not touch it Rush when the oxygen aboard this ship fall below critical level it will become increasingly difficult to concentrate what you be do could blow the whole ship be you sure back off now or I will shoot lower your weapon he already screw we once I be not go to let he do it again I need to get through people stand aside we be under attack do not know who do not know why consider the charge drop go take your anger out on they yes sir what do we get lucian alliance that would be my guess they have not introduce themselves they start shoot the minute they come out of hyperspace our shield be hold but we be not the target what be head our way a full squadron of glider and a troop transport we cut they down some but the rest will be on your doorstep in 3 minute do you copy if we can get to the transport before they land their troop we stand a chance I be go to press that button it be go to fix the life support and then you and I and everyone else will be able to breathe and think much well do not do it look I know we be in a tough situation here but I be give you an order lower your weapon so I suppose that would have be too simple apparently that do nothing this may take a little more time TJ Hang in there Copy do Colonel Young know about this he know two week ago you tell I that this be the good experience of your life something must have happen the scholarship come in I guess I 've just be too afraid to admit what I really want you do not tell I you have even apply there be nothing else go on you know I would tell you unless you be protect someone I be not like I say I just have not make up my mind I be read a dangerous energy spike in the core I need your help with what the ninth chevron what we need to get the hell out of here it take we 2 year to find this site the property be unique this may be our last chance if this bombardment continue the radioactive core 's go to go critical you mean the planet it be go to explode if my math work we can not assume that I say if then if it work then it be not a power supply issue it be the gate address we 've know the first eight symbol the ninth have to be the point of origin what if we be not on the planet you be suppose to be dial from this be where we be what if we be not suppose to be here Icarus base Telford we can not hold them back let us go go Sergeant Riley dial the Stargate to Earth take cover Chevron one lock follow I the symbol on the Stargate be constellation as see from Earth that be what you say what if Earth be suppose to be the point of origin the only viable power source be here light year away what if that do not matter what if it be the only combination that will work like a code a code Chevron four encode stop the dialing sequence I have my order get out of my way get out of the way we can not risk dial Earth come on let us go Dad Dad my father there could still be people trap on the other side all right let us go people you need to move it to the gateroom this be Scott I get about a dozen or so people cut off from the gateroom south east corridor Dammit be that Dr Simms stay with I he be help pull people back from the surface Simms can you hear I no come on we get to go that be impressive Power 's fluctuating at critical level Colonel I be detect a massive build up of energy from the planet recall our fighter Radio Colonel Telford he be get 2 minute to get his people aboard before we jump to hyperspace what be everybody do I order an evacuation he do not dial Earth it be the ninth chevron address what the attack start a chain reaction in the planet 's core there be no way of stop that and any blast could easily translate through an open wormhole it be too dangerous to dial Earth you could have dial somewhere else this be our only chance shut it down we can not it be too late system be not respond I need to save these people we have a way out we do not know what be on the other side can not be bad than here can it nobody move await further instruction what be that it do not look like life support I realize that what be we look at it be a star map that be the Milky Way I believe it be a visual log of the ship 's journey this be where we be now no that be where the ship originally embark from Earth it be leave the galaxy it do long ago that be Pegasus so those point be more star no they be galaxy where the hell be we several billion light year from home stand clear you could take down the roof with it no time for argue I need you to lead the evacue you need to go with he no I be stay here until I know my father 's okay make sure everyone carry as much of the expedition supply as they can why you be not go to Earth Rush dial the ninth chevron go go once I be through follow one at a time on a three count you good okay let us go if you can hear I stand back okay get down Fire in the hole Dad Dad Put your weight on I keep calm everybody I get you please everybody stay calm do not push Dad careful careful you be okay sir be you okay I be the last one I be all right go I be right behind you Hammond this be Young come in Hammond this be Young Come in let us go let us go come on people let us do it let us do it Sir go we 've get Colonel Carter on screen General we barely get away the planet be destroy we manage to beam most of our people off the surface before jump to hyperspace we also believe that the enemy force be destroy any word on how they gain intel on our base no what about casualty 12 80 plus MIA the bunker shield technology prevent we from beam out anyone inside how many people make it through the gate to Earth none none our sensor indicate that the Stargate be active for a full six minute before the core go critical they do not come through here then where have they go okay listen up everybody who be able we be go to search this ship top to bottom Teams of three weapon 23 include handgun one per group yeah Flashlights radio only when necessary once those battery be dead they be dead regular check in with Dr Rush in the control room every 10 minute and keep in mind as far as we know this bucket be really freakin ' old and there may be area of damage where life support be unstable look be smart okay do not touch anything that look like it might be dangerous how be we suppose to know what be dangerous Becker right yes sir I work in the mess I mean I do well do not touch just look you be James right yes Lieutenant you and Riley be with I Subtle man subtle if it be okay with you sir it might be well give your obvious skill if you could hang back here help keep the rest of these people calm do not patronize I son no sir be you all right I be solid Lieutenant I be train for this look I do not mean look not now rush this be Scott come in Rush this be Scott come in hello this be Eli where be Rush Bathroom if he find it I be at what look like a bulkhead door it will not open I be hope Rush could open it from there should I find he no here give I a hand what happen to be smart this could be the engine room we get to at least open a few door do we do we really Hang on no keep do what you be do I think I find where you be the door be flash red can you open it Red be usually bad be not it maybe the door be stick just try it you should probably step back not good not good more red close it close it now I be try okay we establish why that hatch be close a lot of other be close for the same reason we be only occupy a fraction of the ship right now it go on forever but if there be damage area that be not seal that could be our problem good timing we just find really this be Dr Rush meet I in the gateroom immediately everyone what be go on in this case be five ancient communication stone they work over vast distance in real time we can talk to the people on Earth yes you physically take control of an individual at the other end I bring these with we in the event we end up somewhere out of range of normal communication so let us use they I already have be they send help no why why be they not send help the only mean of dial this gate from our galaxy be destroy in the attack we be cut off I want to use one of those stone now I have speak with General O'Neill I be a United States Senator I 've explain our situation clearly in light of my knowledge and experience he have place I in charge he do what I have faith in our ability to repair the ship and to work together but if we be to survive this we need leadership and a clear chain of command we only have a few hour of air leave I want to speak to the General please give it to he Dad Dad excuse I okay okay he be still breathe oh my God I see he take some pill Warfarin for his heart blood thinner be the last thing he need if he be bleed internally please do something I tell you I be just a medic everyone please there be no need for we all to congregate in the one place Ms Johansen please find adequate accommodation for the injure and everyone else no I do not recognize your authority as an IOA representative I think you much more comfortable please go there and stay there until you be ask to do something useful something useful we do not want to settle in we want to get back right we should be work on get home exactly I be not sure if that be even possible what you have not even try maybe you should actually do something instead of stand around talk about be in charge if that be even true everybody everyone calm down now the fact be Colonel Young put I in charge and I expect all SG personnel to follow my order as for the rest of you you get out of line we will lock you down now Dr Rush be right about a couple thing first off we all have to work together and second of all we do not all have to stay here so let us move out come on move it be okay you hear he I think we need you so I 've get your back for now but if I be you I would find some way to dial that gate back to Earth I 've get some testing equipment over here look broken we will get back to that what about all these ancient crate if it be not ours do not touch it do no one think of label anything every case have a bar code all right anyone find a bar code reader Guess that got leave behind along with the food and water we get food yeah protein bar and this powdered stuff look everybody Seeds Volker you 've get to be kid I get a case of blank paper we should start a suggestion box what be you stare at you be in detention for good reason what do you want he to do leave I there of course not I be just wonder what to do about it now that be not up to you we will see no no do not do it I need you to help check for any open bulkhead door that lead to damage part of the ship Rush will direct you copy there should be an elevator directly ahead copy that be you there yet this be Scott Radio silence please what be go on we almost lose you you be throw clear across the room where be we where be we we be on a ship it be ancient Rush say it be thousand of year old and we be pretty far off into the universe what be he do to get we home he say he be work on it but we have big problem the life support system be not work properly if we can not get it fix there be not much time you should also know that he use the communication stone and he say General O'Neill put he in charge I do not think so I do not think Sir you should not be try to get up just yet okay I do not think I have a choice TJ I can not feel my leg Jeez what be that thing come here I will show you it be a camera it be a fly camera I be call it a kino you know after the russian I figure maybe we can use it to check out the damage area that be good yeah that be good where be it go now I do not know it be just do its thing but there be lot more of them yeah it be cool yeah do you want one it be not a gumball machine Eli okay so you figure out where they keep the kinos what else have you figure out give I a break man this be my second spaceship and my first be yesterday I know Icarus be my first SGC assignment after train I have not be at this much long than you have do they beam you out of your house no you get I there get any food on you no Tylenol Headache yeah I too Neuroproaxia be a temporary paralysis that can follow a concussive injury you do not know you would need an MRI and a qualified doctor who know how to read it to know for sure if there be spinal damage we do not have either hopefully it be just the nerve in shock Best I can do be insist that you remain still your tour be over two week ago you should be in some classroom in San Diego Seattle that be where my scholarship be I be sorry that part be not your fault tell Rush I want to see he yes sir what be that flying camera ball I be call it a kino do not ask that be marvellous it come with a remote I think we could use to look around what do you have it be not so good really these processing node be scrubber responsible for clean CO2 from the air here here and here it be indicate malfunction other be fail Greer this be Scott I be head for the gateroom meet I there look I be just say that she well stay out of my face I will remind she of your personal space issue next chance I get Col Young want to see you there should be a kind of grate cover the node what do you see a problem we see a very big problem what happen you collapse we bring you here what be go on I be not sure I 've be here with you you need to know what be happen this be important Dad I be worried about you and I be scared one step at a time honey one step at a time my pill no daddy you can not take any more of those your rib be badly bruise you will bleed internally if I do not take those pill a bruise be go to be the least of my problem I know do not worry about I find out what be go on out there no I want to be here with you and I want you here but right now I want to know what be go on just a little bit more I will be here when you get back what be go on I do not know the air filter 's full of crap come on they want we to keep look let us go all right okay Alkaline everyone 's heart rate be elevate people be report headache what the use up residue of whatever magic compound the ancient use to scrub CO2 from the air so now we have two big problem relate to the life support our first priority must be to seal off any of the leak if we can manage that then we can maybe buy ourselves a day or so before the build up of CO2 kill we as it stand how much time do we have I do not know Couple of hour at most Awesome Brody there be some medical grade soda lime in the supply manifest it never make it that be a pity in a ship this old there be bind to be system past their design life okay let us say we find the leak can you fix this I doubt this stuff can be cook off perhaps if there be store of this substance in a clean form or something else capable of CO2 sequestration calcium carbonate lithium hydroxide then yes if that be not go to matter because you be go to get the gate dial back to Earth before this become an issue rush right that be the thing you be teach to say in officer train presumably for the benefit of those that do not know any well please what make you think I will not try I find what look like a shuttle look like there be two shuttle attach to individual docking sleeve we be all go to die Shut up Franklin I be just say what everyone be get to be think I say shut up or else you be go to be first this the door yeah yeah that be it can you close it it will not close we can not close it from here either there be something wrong with the mechanism I think I find the leak there be another door on the back of the shuttle but there be no control then maybe we can close it off locally the shield keep the air inside be obviously not 100 effective it probably be not design to compensate for the amount of damage the ship have sustain be there a way of boost it at least in the area we need it we have not find a way yet it seem to be operate at maximum capability open the door that be not good that be very good a very good sign I do not have time for this do I two problem we be vent atmosphere from a damage shuttle and even if we could seal it off the life support system in this ship be past its expiration date we will build up CO2 to lethal level within a day that explain the headache you already have one they will find a way it be what they do Most of these people be not even suppose to be here how do the ship get damage we do not know it seem it be be through a battle at least the part we can access we be still cut off from most of the ship it be huge they try jam something into the shuttle doorway to keep it open long enough to let the person inside get out but it just open again some sort of safety mechanism like an elevator Rush say he can not override it how long do we have right now as it stand Rush say if we do not get it close we 've get just over an hour Bad air 's well than no air guess a day 's well than an hour someone 's get to go in there and close this door my head be pound Heartbeat have accelerate it be get hard and hard to breathe as our very life be be vent out into space that be go to get old very fast this need to be document no one be go to see that how do you know we make it here someone else could too if we die maybe this can help they to find out what happen to we but we be not dead yet I be start to have slightly blur vision what so how be we go to decide who I assume we be not go to get any volunteer what be another day go to buy we Time to find a way to survive may I see the list I mark the name of anyone injure right we have to find out people ' skill background experience do not take any special skill to die from asphyxiation look what I be say be it should not be someone with potentially valuable knowledge or ability we might need to help we survive beyond this be you really suggest what I think Doc half the people on this ship already want to kill you I do not care you can not ask someone to sacrifice themselves period politician ask military personnel to sacrifice themselves for the good of other all the time if someone do not go in there and close that door we be all go to die Period Franklin be still work at the airlock control locally but it do not look good sir Camile 's explae the situation to everyone else on board I will do it Sir this be not the kind of thing I can ask somebody else to volunteer for if we be go to make it past this we be go to need you sir I do not know about that you be do a pretty good job Lieutenant Look at the mess we be in if that be not proof that we need you I be not sure anyone should do it I do not want someone sacrifice for I I say we figure this out together while we have time or we all die try listen to I it need to be do and I be do it look sir you can barely stand help I the paralysis be temporary you know that now you will recover I need your help no it be an order I know you can have I court martialle when we get home but I be not go to help you kill yourself my father be not in his room we will find he he do not leave this room he can not have get far I tell he what be go on Greer this be Scott come in Greer do you read Senator Armstrong be miss he may be head your way he be here he be get a gun I do not want to shoot you I do not think you want to shoot I get out of the way just give I a little more time let I try and fix this I do not have much guy I be not see any change whatever you just try it be not work the problem 's obviously mechanical you can not fix it tell I what to do Dad no wait open the door open the door I can not please open the door he be dead on his foot Dad no I love you please open the door not he there be nothing I can do for he here help he open the door please he can not leave I at least he buy we a day you you do this you kill he you 've kill all of we stop little help here relax just get away from I all of you Miss Armstrong you be in shock believe I I understand everyone deal with tragedy in different way you be look for someone to blame I be not look I be sorry about your father I truly be he be a good man and he certainly would not have be my choice but you must realize none of this be my fault I do not create the situation that force we here there be no other way Miss Armstrong I know you do not want to hear this just now but this ship this ship could be the most important discovery mankind have make since the Stargate itself you know the Icarus project be something your father truly believe in enough to risk his career to support what difference do it make if we all die a number of people die during the attack on the base some of they I know very well I be sure some have more value than other as human being all of they be invaluable my point be I promise you I will do everything I can to make sure no one give their life in vain no one please give I a chance Colonel we 've lose Senator Armstrong oh my God he be buy we some time to do what we be work on it first up be try to dial the gate back home should you even be on your foot no I be on my foot and right now we be try to get home Camile I need your help you know these people I need you to spread the word try to keep thing as positive as you can I can do that Good I can not believe my dad be go I watch he die and I still just can not accept it tell I about he why Man die so I could live I would like to know a little more about he no matter how tired he be or how long he have work or what be go on in his life he always have time to listen to I I would go on and on he never preach he never tell I what to do even though sometimes I wish he would he would just listen and then he would tell I that he love I the good part be if I would have a fight with my mom he never take side oh God my mom he be her whole life she probably think we be both dead all I know be that he want you to go on I know I get to get back to the search you go to be okay I do not know Fair enough what what be you do just watch a man die do not you even care of course I do and I be also try to learn as much as I can as quickly as I can that be in addition to run nine separate search in the database in the hope of solve our life support issue right find anything Destiny as in ours the name of the ship translate from Ancient I 've also discover that they be never here I think his be an ancient ship it be but they send it out unmanned planning to use the gate to get here when it be far enough out at the end of the universe but they probably learn to ascend before that time learn to what ascension it be a process where by consciousness convert to energy that no long require physical form that be not in the video well there be more than one video we should get back to work sorry I think I get it it be not even that hard to find it be right here in the dialing program you be sure yes it be an eight symbol address you mean you can dial this thing back to Earth there be no point of origin indicate there be only 36 symbol on this gate I be assume the ninth symbol represent some x factor distance equation well I do not care Start dialing do not we want to bring Dr Rush in on this well you say this be not that hard to find no then he probably already know and do not tell we no no no what Someone 's dialing the gate Colonel Young you be up nice to see you too rush I do order you to report to I yes what be you do we be try to dial Earth that would be a mistake Riley think he be find the address his understanding of ancient be marginal at well with respect Doctor I know enough to recognize a reference to Earth he say the address be not that hard to find rush no no this be a complete waste of power we may need we have the address back all we need be the right point of origin and we 've get 36 try we barely have enough power to operate the main system this ship simply do not have the capability to dial Earth you see that be news to I he do not tell I that either I 've only just learn myself you know what I be do even if it do not work the people aboard this ship need to see we at least try so what you be go to drain what little power we have for the sake of morale how ridiculous what be that anyone near the observation deck Colonel it look like we 've drop out of FTL because we be drain power no no if I be right the gate should begin to dial any moment how do you know that the ship detect a Stargate on a planet within range that may have what need what how the hell be there even Stargates out here the Ancients send out a number of unmanned ship ahead of this one they be program to gather datum resource to manufacture Stargates and deposit they in habitable world any relevant information be relay back here to help plot the course you be tell I that this ship know we be in trouble yes because I tell it we be essentially we be fly on auto pilot this ship may have stop when it be within range of a Stargate regardless of our need but I have reason to believe so what we need be on the other side of that wormhole an educate guess yes there be only one way to find out Sir you can not do that we have no idea what be on the other side we can use the kino to find out I expect that be the purpose of this device I be get reading over here what have we get Temperature gravity atmosphere composition barometric pressure Oxygen nitrogen very little CO2 extremely low humidity habitable but just barely good enough look like four other address come up here too they could be other planet within range maybe we should think about dial they up no they be lock out the ship choose this one the Stargate be open all we have to do be step through what we have to do be put a team together look like our time might be limit what be it it be a countdown just over 12 hour leave what happen then I suspect we jump back into FTL Palmer be a geologist obviously she should go Franklin and Brody be the good of the rest of what we have thank for the ring endorsement he do not even mention I Franklin go the other stay we be still go to need people work on the problem from this end I would like to go really if I can help then Colonel Young please what you do not think I can handle it he be go I 've be off world before you have make a habit out of pull our ass out of the fire Eli you want to go you be go the only one I be question right now be you Dr Rush well besides Palmer I be the only one who know what we be look for we have 12 hour to find what we need and get back on the ship sure you can not stop it we be just along for the ride then we may all be well off on the planet that be another reason why I should go someone to assess whether long term survival there be even an option all right I want everyone clear that Scott be in charge of this mission let us gear up let us find whatever supply we have and move out about Eli he volunteer he be not train for this like a lot of the people we get here I be go to need to know what they be make of he will slow we down if he do you send he back to the gate listen if we be go to make it and I be not talk the next few hour we be go to need everyone on board to step up keep an eye on Rush we will be back sir good luck Destiny the design be clearly ancient launch hundred of thousand of year ago where the hell be we several billion light year from home we be on a ship but we have no idea where we be in relation to Earth this ship could be the most important discovery mankind have make since the Stargate itself these be the wrong people in the wrong place we 've got wound and we need to get home we barely have enough power to operate the main system this ship simply do not have the capability to dial Earth we 've get a problem when one of the air vent shut down our first priority must be to seal off any of the leak we can maybe buy ourselves a day or so before the build up of CO2 kill we we can not ask someone to sacrifice themselves period Dad no wait look like we 've drop out of FTL the ship detect a Stargate on a planet within range that may have what we need what we need ' on the other side of that wormhole Hot Cool make sure we can dial back already on it look like gypsum that would be good why we be look for calcium carbonate Calcite Gypsum be calcium sulphate which be 36 calcium carbonate it dissolve can we use this sand to fix the scrubber that would be convenient no it be a fair indication that the component may exist nearby for the sake of portability and efficiency I be hope to find high concentration granular limestone we be look for the dry lake bed or salt water body all this sand come from it be a desert Lime be form mostly from the remain of marine organism be you say there be life here not likely anything we 've see before the water may be go now but this desert be form by H2O evaporate on a playa floor cause gypsum to be deposit in a fine crystalline form call selenite where be you go high ground what be suppose to happen if this sand be high enough in calcite concentration the solution would absorb the acid right the liquid would turn clear it be not we be good this be Scott unfortunately there be nothing useful in the immediate vicinity of the gate you have 12 hour lieutenant make them count copy that we be move out too bad we can not just use this sand there certainly be enough of it Projet SG 1 00 I be fine no you be not and neither be I but we be we be still alive because of what he do for what it be worth it be worth a lot and as long as we be still here I promise you Colonel I 've edit lot of my father 's speech to know what you be go to say you do not have a clue because I do not we bring along an ancient device communication stone they allow we to I know what they be good I be about to use one of they to report to my superior on Earth tell they our situation I want to tell she myself you 've be sit here since he make contact let somebody take a shift I be not leave this chair I 've be on this for the last 6 month and I will be damn if I Colonel this be strange Dr Rush be that you it be Colonel Young and I need you to put I in a room with General O'Neill and I be go to need you too Sir I tell you not to get up what do he do to himself he be get crack rib more bruise than I can count and a concussion that result in neuropraxia that be just great Dr Mehta can you help I please I have some of my favorite argument with your father be you say you win some depend on who you ask Major Green'll be escort you to see your mother please give she my condolence thank you so how be it go out there really I do not know what Rush have tell you we may not have much time leave the ship 's very old fall apart fix it we be try even if we can get the life support work we do not have much food and water go get some we be not suppose to be there sir these be the wrong people in the wrong place and as a group they be just not qualified please I be not qualified to lead that first team through the Stargate I understand that sir in the past dozen year or so we 've send hundred of team through that thing and the bottom line be none of we be qualified I just think we be go to get to a point very soon where everyone on board should get a chance to say goodbye Understood save it that be not very smart temperature like these the human body need Walk do not talk just FYI he be right about the whole human body and water Walk do not right look More sand this be pointless we should go back we just get here I still think we should be check out the other planet in range of the ship I still think you be wrong the solution be here I know it be a mirage but when we be walk over that last dune I think I see the statue of Liberty stick half out of the sand just for a second there I be all ready to yell Damn you damn you all to hell come on that be funny be it because it would mean we be really on Earth but in the future and the ape have take over and then bury the statue of Liberty for some reason have a drink Greer hold up hold up it be not go to work not if we keep stop I be say we need to split up Fine with I I agree you should come with I no no you be with I and Greer Sun 's be move that way we will call it west Eli Franklin Palmer and curtis you head that way we will test every 20 minute or so after two hour you head south east that should take you back to the gate wait a second do we really think that split up be the good idea I say we head straight back there be no point in cross over the same territory we 've just cross or we could just stick together look Matt I be sorry I just have this really really sick feeling that you be go to go that way and we be go to go this way Eli I need someone that I can trust to lead the second team okay that be you Curtis be a good soldier a tough guy he be not go to let anything happen to you Truth be I be slow you down you want to get rid of I I be do what I think will well accomplish this mission you ask to come I be tell you how you can help I now suck it up okay guy we be go this way move out Radio if you find the lake bed we will double back when you see the statue of Liberty you know what to say right right now we can make some time she be here right now yes ma'am but as I 've explain Mrs Armstrong I know I look different and I sound different but it be I Mom please I have something to tell you Mom stop I be sorry it be just the thought that you be actually on some ship so far away I can not even imagine Mom just tell I you be come home I do not know Mom please the ship be old and damaged we be lose air and somebody have to he be dead he be dead be not he where be everyone able body be search the ship for anything that might have CO2 sequestration property and the rest be in crew quarter Colonel we be able to dial out to the planet again Colonel Young and Chloe be use the communication stone this be Colonel Telford Dr Mehta right okay do you make radio contact with the off world team yes nothing to report yet they 've split up how much time before the ship jump back to FTL roughly nine hour dial out every 20 minute maintain regular contact we do have power issue to be aware of Dialing the gate be a significant drain on what seem to be limit resource at this point the away mission be priority one right now Sir I be fine I understand that there be other Stargates in range four other address come up in the system but we seem to be lock out have you try work around it rush think that be not a good idea it make sense to know what our option be do what you can there be a reason why these address be be disqualify if I be not be clear I be give you an order if there be good reason find out exactly what they be let us keep move I want to see more you should rest Sir Colonel Young 's body need time to recover give I something for the pain the body feel pain for a reason I would rather not mask it just do it from the sound of thing you need my help here all right come on let us go you well save some of that we need to slow down we need to cover more ground it be go to be impossible to maintain this pace on the way back maybe for you how tedious little boy play soldier I 've no interest in play that game I be not play I be try to save the life of everyone on this ship if you continue at this pace we be go to die then maybe we will light year away from the admire eye of your father or your drill Sergeant or whoever be approval it be you so desperately seek how dare you get up and move do you see that what I do not know nothing Let us move one hour one hour and then we start circle back all right fine just hold that there thank you what do you that be suppose to be for the pain what do you give to he a strong sedative which we be desperately short on and I should not have have to use so that Col Young can return to a body in working condition you be out of line Lieutenant disregard the health of another human being be out of line I be well within my right as ranking medical officer he will be out an hour or two what be I suppose to do I do not care I have other patient to attend to something wrong no I be fine good a place as any to stop and test I take it that be not good no hey guy another negative over here I will radio Scott and tell he we be move on yeah but that be not what be go down it be not no there be four other viable address in this thing I think I find an override that will allow we to dial from here but look around this planet be a dead zone we should 've be try to dial these other planet Rush say we do not care what Rush say we do not trust he Rush do not want we all to die that do not mean we trust he to make the right decision you too what about the lake bed it could be hundred of mile from here we could be blow our only chance of find a place to evac maybe the ship do bring we here because there be lime on this planet for all we know the Ancients have a way of locate it that we do not for that matter they could 've stop the ship for long than 12 hour to find it and recover it with the proper tool the fact be the Ancients would not have let the life support system get that screw up in the first place Rush be set on fix the ship he be deaf to any other logic we need to find a planet we can survive on this might be our last chance got to keep going here take it I have my own no no I can not go on I be never go to make it back I know it be here you have to find it take it we be go to leave he here I will make my way back to the gate go with he I be not leave you here alone make sure he get back alive what difference do it make because if I do not find what we need he be go to be the one to find some other way to save his own ass and yours along with it you be lose it I will be okay this be Eli come in if you can hear I please respond this be Scott what be up we have a problem Franklin Curtis Palmer have give up and be head back to the gate to try dial the other address in the remote they have the kino they do not think we be go to find the lime here they want to look for another planet that will support life they will get themselves kill we need that remote to get back to the ship that be not the point a few hour be nowhere near enough time to determine whether a planet be even safe let alone viable for sustain life the ship the ship be our only real hope of ever get home stop they if you can I will turn back when I have to yes sir go you lead I be sorry excuse I Miss Armstrong we 've get to get go soon you get my daughter home everyone be do the good they can I assure you that be not good enough Mom it be not his fault I be a personal friend of the President and of the first lady you tell your superior that if anything happen to her I will go public with what I know Mom I be sorry she be upset my husband give his life for my daughter you get she back to I or the whole world be go to know what have be go on these past year I need water we be almost there I think since I give Scott my canteen we would share and you be wrong about that I should 've know you think you know I pretty well do not you I help choose the personnel for Icarus base I read your file and neither you nor Captain Marvel be on my list I can tell you you think I care give I some water keep walkin ' you think just because you be bear poor that it give you the right to be angry at the world how pathetic you think that be why I be angry if it be not for the army you would be in jail or bad that be what all you rich people think Rich my father work in a shipyard in Glasgow I earn a scholarship to Oxford while I be work two job I have get a right to make decision without explain myself to you or anyone else you give I some of that water keep walkin ' give I some of that do not you ever touch I give I some and you do that again and I be go to put a bullet in your face really I do not think so you need I otherwise you would have gladly do it by now right now I pray to the God above that dehydration will shut you up Walk or die here it be your choice mister decision maker look like it be worth a shot to I let us do it wait stop look it be not perfect but it be well than here Vegetation water air it be not too late to come with we do not go we will dial back when we know it be safe to evacuate everyone you will never get back home you do not know that maybe there be a way to use the gate system to connect the dot there have to be a reason the ship lock out those address do not please shoot he why do you do that he tell I to we save his life by shoot he he will live you just strand they we will send they another remote I be not take any chance where be Scott still look for limestone it be almost half time we only have six hour before the ship leave Lieutenant this be Greer Come in I hope he be turn back by now Lieutenant Come in you must keep go my boy do not give up I do not need you to tell I that I be not go to let anyone else down the way I let you down you really do not have to follow I around to remind I he have his plan for all of we he be either out of radio range or he be lie face down in the sand dead or soon to be I be go back for he well that be great suicide I be not leave he out here I will go with you you be go to slow I down this man have to get back he need medical attention Dial he can take Franklin back you wait here for I you have five hour to find he and get back here it have not be a pleasure know you what do I need that for just in case in case what I do not even know how to fire this thing you would well be here I will I have a gun why do I feel like I 've be drug good to have you back sir Son of a what the hell be Telford do you be go to need this there they be hurry up come on help he what happen Greer shoot he Water that be my ration for the day what be go on we 've have a lovely day at the beach how about you I have sin father I

be 16 we barely even know each other what be you go to do I do not know about anything I think he be my call but now I be sorry why I be the one who be weak it be my fault it be not it be not yours this be Scott Come in I find it I find the lake bed I 've get the lime oh my God if you can hear I wait just wait I be come which way move out Drink come on Scott come on take the bag there be no time you have to take it yes you can no I can not make it get the hell up come on I can not make it I can not carry you and this get your weak ass up come on come on soldier Less than three minute before the ship jump again income I will stay it be okay I get it sorry sir you do your good Less than one minute I see they they be carry something we 've get it do not go we 've get it they 've get the lime and they be not go to make it 40 second give I the radio I want you to stick your arm into the event horizon of the puddle seriously be you sure no but I be bet there be some kind of a safety protocol prevent someone be cut off while en route but what if there be not 20 second Eli do it now come on come on five four three two one thank you Scott look at I Lieutenant look at I look at I well do Eli well do look I bring you some water I still have some you really need to drink it I be fine everyone appreciate what you do Rush say how long it will last he be not sure how be you my parent die in a car crash when I be four year old I be sorry the priest who raise I he pretty much drink himself to death when I be 16 my God I be sorry I be not try to diminish what you be go through I know I think my point be there be just some thing you never get over that be just the way it be you go on though the good that you can Destiny the design be clearly ancient launch hundred of thousand of year ago where the hell be we several billion light year from home we be on a ship but we have no idea where we be in relation to Earth this ship could be the most important discovery mankind have make since the Stargate itself these be the wrong people in the wrong place we 've got wound we need to get home we barely have enough power to operate the main system this ship simply do not have the capability to dial Earth even if we can get the life support we do not have much food and water then go get some little boy play soldier I be sorry I 've no interest in play I be try to save the life of everyone aboard that ship we do have power issue to be aware of if I be not be clear I be give you an order Dr Rush I be wonder if not now what be you do good morning Young ask we to figure out these system be off for a reason they need to stay off do not know whether the ship have electrolyze it to produce oxygen but you can see there be not much leave in there we do some calculation base on our estimate of the water depth and tank dimension and just over 90 000 liter 91 046 Ish go math boy sound like a lot it would not fill a swimming pool still it be enough to loosen the ration restriction be not it I think I know where you be go with this and believe I when I say that I too could use a shower I do not think the shower use water they just spray a sort of mist that you kind of stand in and it sorta bead up there be one in the crew quarter how do you know if you have not try it how do you know I have not try it we know thank you Lieutenant Rosegarden he be right you be bad than he be you can tell they apart we also identify a recycling system for liquid waste so once we get that system up and run okay folk let us have a well day than yesterday thank you your ration sir thank you I order you here 20 minute ago I 've be work throughout the night actually try to find out why our power reserve be so low I be quite concerned so should you be okay how bad be it I have not be able to access any of the main system yet so I do not know you look exhausted maybe you should take a break get the information we need and make some informed decision and we report could you stop people run around activate every bloody system they can get their hand on I will that be delicious thank you very much that man be a lot of work Let us bring in the next one please Doctor I be very sorry to bother you I know you be busy but I really need your what do I say Projet SG 1 00 come on it do not have to be profound just who you be and something you want to say like I be Eli Wallace I be 25 year old I be currently unemployed and just for posterity 's sake I would like to say take your stink paw off I you damn dirty ape I be not really go to say that try it say something it could be that Rush be just start a fire so he can put it out or it could be that he be so far ahead of we he can see problem that none of we can see what do you want we to do help he the man like to work alone with the way he be be treat you can hardly blame he I can blame he all day long it be pretty hard not to consider this be not helpful it be the truth we be stuck with Rush for now Scott be check out the other shuttle see if it be operational he ask that you two join he when we be do here so off you go dismiss please tell I that be everyone we still have the question of what to do with the senator 's body we will get to he he be not go anywhere I would appreciate a file on everyone by sometime tomorrow nothing fancy my assignment sir Recipes Becker for the love of god recipe 2nd Lieutenant Vanessa James 26 Air Force Special Forces all I have to say be I do not want to die out here I think we be do there be still dozen of human resource issue we need to talk about pick one the matter of Lieutenant Johansen resign her commission consider she reactivate I do not know if that be up up to I yeah it be we need a medic I do not even know why she resign in the first place that be none of my business Colonel look what we figure out we be call it a recharge plate we 've tweak it so it work with Earth technology we have to be careful not to leave they on the plate or it fry the battery not bad it be great turn it off why Rush say we have power issue we 've get they to recharge but as soon as he give the go ahead you kid can go crazy for now help I pass the word to stop push button it be cool guy this one 's secure you can fly this thing I can fly an F 302 yeah in a simulator this be a real spaceship man yes it be so Pretty screw up yeah pretty screw up they be go to work it out we be pretty freakin ' far from home I do not know not today you should have ship out week ago T J it be not right it be not right at all I be here so what do you want we to do help I figure out what kind of bird we get here I just radio Brody to come down help translate the control take I half an hour just to find the on switch maybe we can take a little joyride oh joy you do not have to follow I around what do you mean I mean that I be okay you say something I think you be follow I and it be about to get awkward I do not mind the company I just do not want to keep you from anything important I be do with important I be take the day off from important you should so should you I I do not even know what to do with myself Eli I be the last person who should be here I be second to last you be underestimate yourself so be you can you show I how to use that shower you be talk about yes I can Scott 's check out the shuttle see if it be operational everyone else 's hold the work ' til you give the green light thank you look I want you to know that I be well aware that in the field of ancient technology or any other subject I can think of you be the good I 've get but we can not be work at cross purpose all I ask be that you check with I before issue order check with you no you see you get it backwards if you be do something I want to know what it be and this be not a request do I will tell you everything if there be an issue that affect everybody on this ship like we be run out of power I think I already tell you that I be not here to snap you back or piss you off but if we be go to be on this ship for any length of time we need to be on the same page I think our length of time together on Destiny may be short than you think I get it who can I bring in to help honestly it may take long than we 've get to bring someone else up to speed volker it be perfect terrific you can tell he to sit on his hand if you want to Spencer Sergeant I be 31 all I want to say be I never ask for this all I want be to get off this ship what be it feel like what what be it feel like on your bare skin it be really warm I be just stand guard Anybody could walk in what whatever I need to talk to you alone it be important I be so tear Chloe I be go to take Eli for a minute that all right with you I will check back with you later ok hear you could use a helper you hear wrong Young say not to take no for an answer if he want to be helpful he would have send Eli instead well thank you for that but Eli 's a kid really and I be an astrophysicist I neither need nor want your help all right look he be just go to drag I right back in here and you know it come on right I be concerned that Destiny be on the verge of lose power look for yourself this ship be be fly around for a million year I know so I do not understand why all of a sudden we show up and start do thing how about that like what dial back to Earth for one come on we have to try look out a window man we be fly fast than the speed of light be we close to the end of our rope you be obviously not capable of see the sign well speak of sign when be the last time you sleep if you know what you be look for there be clear indication power be be channel into life support how can you know that we be still lock out of the core system out okay forget I say anything now I will work quietly it be too late for that I tell he you would be a waste of time that we can ill afford if you can not see the sign stare you in the face then you be no good to I get out look we just want to talk you say alone how else be I suppose to get you out of there what be go on Eli you mean right now do not be an idiot you must be get to know I because I respond really well to that we can not get a straight answer from anybody about whether or not we be go to make it back to Earth I do not think anybody know they do not know or will not tell we I be pretty sure if they know they would tell you they would tell you I be you serious yeah we be Eli you be on the inside rush need you the Colonel 's look out for you tell you what if they tell I then I will tell you that be all we ask that be it Great this have be good I think as a group we 've bond you got to be kid I I know you be in there 5 minute he kick I out what be the matter with you you be a grown man I know that but he say out what the hell do you say to the man nothing I be just try to figure out what his problem be it be our problem Volker it be not just his I need you to get back in there I be tell you he be go crazy we already know that go this be not the old crazy this be a whole new crazy would you like I to hold your hand be that what you need I to do Colonel I be try all right here we go let us do this I will take you there myself and for God 's sake if you people can not stand up to the son of a bitch do you do that Rush be that what you think no I do not but I have be stand here for the past few minute watch system fail all over the ship and there be nothing that I could do to stop that the FTL drive be amongst the last to go we could be in range of a Stargate you see what I mean no there be no countdown there be get to be emergency reserve I do not think you seem to understand what be go on here Colonel our reserve be go all of our power be go Dr Dale Volker I be 34 year old and despite what you may or may not have hear from a certain scottish person I like to think that I be a pretty fine astrophysicist they do not send you to work on solve the mystery of the universe on other planet if you be a hack right so that be all I have to say and we can not all be mozart right some of we be Salieris not that there be anything wrong with that I like Salieri I find his music be it be soothe I be not suggest that he be Mozart either although Mozart do go a little nut do not he all right I be do he be maybe a Schubert at well or an Elgar I be do Eli the light go off in my compartment it be the same all over why why do everybody think that I know everything not funny Eli it be not I we have a power failure or something I be on my way to go well I be freeze and I can not see wait here let I help sorry sorry everything just stop and go pitch black I completely freak yeah we hear how be the shower Fine thank for ask look just go find out what be go on I be okay here here it be something anyway do not make any long distance phone call thank wait for I Sure turn around Sure so it be not anything you do since I arrive I have be unable to access any of the core system power navigation or propulsion why do not you bring somebody else in because I be the only qualified person this be what I be talk about maybe it be like a lantian device you need the ancient gene to access Destiny predate that technology you know that for a fact yes Colonel I know many many thing for a fact I know you ask Gorman to poke around in the weapon system for a fact I know you have order team of people all over the ship to do thing that they know nothing about for a fact you think all those thing add up to this rush do that make sense to you look look no you be right you be right it be your reckless pointless attempt to dial Earth that rob I of the time I need to solve this problem maybe we be miss something yes the opportunity of a lifetime because you would not listen to I t J this be Young we could use a medic in the gate room Nobody 's blame you I run out of time we can fix this Fix this what do you think just because you give the order that it be possible there be no more power Destiny save every last ounce of its reserve for life support and I 've see it happen I 've see it be sequester away from I I try to I try to stop it I try to stop it but I could not in a few day ' time this this ship will go dark it will go dark and cold T J now I be Sergeant Hunter Riley I be one day short of my 30th birthday I grow up on a farm I have relative who 've never even leave the state and here I be halfway across the universe so no regret so Rush be right everything but life support be dead why now why just when we show up because we just show up there be the Stargate it be a power hog and we have it on all day yesterday there be still some power and the shield be still work to some degree again that be to keep we alive for how long we be go to have to wait for Rush to wake up for an answer t J say he be not go to be up for a while so where do that leave we Dead Dead not right away yeah we have day maybe a lot of day but if there be no Stargate in range and there be not we do not have the power anyway so it be a race between food water and life support I do not buy that we can not do anything without access to the ship 's system I mean I could stand here all day I put a kino into search mode and send it into un pressurized area of the ship look for an active console somewhere nothing yet also I be look into if there be any way we could integrate the shuttle 's power with the ship 's system so you be work the problem do the computer hack dropout have to save our ass the dropout be still here or be you go to get your head out of yours the shuttle idea 's pretty good yeah there might be a work around let us do that thank you Eli by the way it be MIT dropout you want a gold star for that no I just do something I be go to be go for a few hour go to report this mess if you need I yank I back Lieutenant Matthew Scott I be 26 year old and I would like to say a prayer for all of we if that be okay sure yeah whatever you want the lord be my shepherd I shall not want he maketh I to lie down in green pasture he leadeth I to still water I will take it from here Peter again what can I say I be a glutton for punishment okay what be go on Sergeant actually I be come to ask you Colonel Young go back to report I be Colonel Telford I would like to speak with Dr Rush immediately he be have a nervous breakdown sir what but I can take you to Lt Scott he be in the shuttle that be quick it do not take very long to say we be screw I be sorry sir I wish there be something we could do there be I will shout down when she be ready to see you Lieutenant Tamara Johansen I be a paramedic I actually quit my job a few week ago I should not even be here to think I could have miss all of this Emily no do not I say that you could come in but that be all Scott Johansen a word please there be no power except for the shuttle Sir you already know that Matt this be Colonel Telford that be right would either of you two officer care to explain how Colonel Young manage to let thing fall apart so fast there be no way of know this be you be say Rush do not see it come that be what I think I want to know what be really go on aboard this ship it be just it be ridiculous it be true let us say that it be why why be you put I through this because I want to say I be sorry I do not choose my job over you it be not just about the job I know I love you I be guess that do not go well Sir how do this change anything what do you mean let us say that I believe all of this I do not really but even if I do you do choose and you choose to go I do not choose this you know there be a chance you would not be come back I be come back no you would not be here like this to say goodbye if you really think there be a chance listen I be do everything that I can I be go I be go to do everything that I can I want nothing more than to get back here to be with you and I want nothing more than for you to be here for I when I do get home I be just say I do not know when that will be please you make your choice Everett and I make mine nothing 's change and I really I really do hope that you be go to be okay do not do not please Emily please Emily just let I go I give you a direct order Sir I understand you give I a direct order and I respectfully suggest it would be a complete waste of time I be tell you the ship come here for a reason Sir the ship come here for what reason Colonel Young yeah what the hell be Telford just order you to do use the communication stone to report that you need to be replace he be probably right about that so the ship come here for what reason the odd of come out of ftl on the outer edge of a star system be astronomical throw in the fact that there be three potentially habitable planet plus a gas giant to act as a comet catcher on the outside of the system we be talk miraculous so there be a chance now that we be go to live though our definition of habitable just mean the surface temperature range allow for the presence of liquid water and since the primary 's a red dwarf the planet must have a relatively short orbital radius just to fall within that range which mean there be a likelihood at least one or two of they will be tidally lock mean one side will always be face the star which increase the prospect of geological instability due to tidal stress and I can not stand earthquake I be in one when I be 13 and I cut both my foot on broken glass but it might be nice hey how be you how do I get here you be not that heavy you pass out for a little while how long about 10 hour it be probably the first real sleep you 've have since we arrive here have anything happen not since we lose power no you have not miss a thing how do you feel embarrassed do not be well you be not there your head 's pound right how many cup of coffee do you normally drink a day four five you be in caffeine withdrawal so be a dozen other people on board it can make you pretty crazy you should see the smoker you be look at one double whammy I be go to let you sleep it off but Young want you to see something if you do not do one they be not go to know who you be Eli I have nothing to say People be go to find this they be go to want to know who we be look I will do your slate okay this be Dr Nicholas Rush he be the lead scientist of the Icarus project now just say what you feel Come on in orbital insertion trajectory that be my first thought I think your first thought be we be go fly into the damn thing but no sir I be guess we will get close enough to kiss but not enough for capture an aerobraking maneuver the math be over my head but we should come out of a slingshot somewhere in system where there be habitable planet I do not tell he no but you be all smile we be still too far out to know if they be anything more than rock but we find three candidate before Big Bertha fill up the sky so this trajectory be no accident then the man 's quick we will know once we be clear that will be in six minute who translate this you know it be completely backwards well pull up a chair sir this will be a show you do not want to miss so we be clear my definition of habitable include a sandy beach a tropical there be go to be severe turbulence when we contact the atmosphere we will pass the word about our previous conversation rush no need to apologize I be not about to I be suffer from withdrawal symptom yeah I know I know all about it a lot of work hello there Adam Brody be my name can I start again my name 's Adam Brody as I say early hello cut Adam Brody engineer I like football and what dude this be not for a date service I do not know why that come out I do not know why I be so nervous no it be all good what do we get we have your name we have your job what else be there you be 40 something so 36 we get that now we will fix that in edit all that be leave be what you want to say for posterity I always know I be go to die in space from the moment I step through the Stargate I I mean I do not expect this but I know something Awful be go to happen I just know it this be Young we be expect atmospheric turbulence in a few minute find a secure place and plunk your ass down do not shoot it be I you can talk through that thing I can talk through this thing Riley ask I how to I ask he how the kino work we take a wrong turn I can and will kick your ass let us do that later we be go to pass close to a gas giant it be go to be a bumpy ride we be short on radio help I spread the word yes sir thank you wrong turn really you go to stick to that story go help now 90 second to contact come on come on I be come we do not have much time you 've see planet from space how could you let yourself get jade to this stuff so fast I be not jade I 've just get other stuff on my mind we be just pass through the atmosphere of a gas giant on the far side of the universe in an ancient spaceship I be sure there will be other gas giant ok let us go can we please slow down trust I it will be worth it I guess everybody have the same idea it be beautiful 30 second to contact Hang on no no I need everyone away from the wall away from the wall the turbulence could break your back sit down Hell of a ride Guess it be let us find these planet you be talk about there they be dead ahead we should be able to analyze the atmosphere of the near planet within a few hour be we clear yes sir do you catch any of that I could not get back in time this be unbelievable Lieutenant look at this you sure miss a great show please everyone be quiet our trajectory have change change the planet have alter Destiny 's course more than we hope what be you talk about Rush Lieutenant what the hell be he talk about Destiny the design be clearly ancient launch hundred of thousand of year ago where the hell be we several billion light year from home we be on a ship but we have no idea where we be in relation to Earth this ship could be the most important discovery mankind have make since the Stargate itself these be the wrong people in the wrong place we 've get a lot of wounded we need to get home we barely have enough power to operate the main system this ship simply do not have the capability to dial Earth could you stop people run around activate every bloody system they can get their hand on I will our reserve be go all of our power be go our trajectory have change what be you talk about Rush Lieutenant what the hell 's he talk about Ronald Greer I can not think of a well way to move on from from this world into the next or whatever come than to fly into the most powerful thing in all creation a star out in a blaze of glory I like that that be beautiful Projet SG 1 00 everyone here all here sir if I could have your attention you 've all hear about our situation it suck I be go to repeat the fact so that we be all clear in just over a day this ship will fly into a star now we have no power to change its course we have no idea how to steer the ship even if we do we be have another bad day so here be what we be go to do we have a work shuttle we think there be three planet out there that might be habitable now we think we believe that it be no coincidence that Destiny drop out of ftl in this solar system to give we a chance now once we know for sure that there be a planet out there for we we be go to have a lottery we will draw the name of 15 people the shuttle can hold twice that not once it be be load up with supply besides there be only life support for 17 max you say 15 I will be choose two of the people myself two people with the necessary skill to fly the shuttle and survive on the planet yeah I bet I can guess who they be I will be take my name out of the lottery anyone who want to join I keep talk we be still many hour away from know if the first two be even habitable so I suggest you all go back to your quarter and wait it out that be all I have for now what you should pick everyone who go on that shuttle it be the responsible thing to do and you should include yourself if they be go to survive they will need leadership and an hr lady I be guess I be not above that I would want you to consider I yes I would want you to consider everyone who could contribute to their survival I think you should do your job and make the choice you need to make it would not be very fair it would be more unfair to send the wrong people we be all the wrong people these be the wrong people that be up to you who go other than you and I I mean or have not you give it much think we can come up with a short list Factor in skill and strength to increase their chance of surve take age and sex into consideration how about just the people we like that be not what I be say leave Handpicking two of they be a cop out and by that I mean get out now or I be go to take your name out of the lottery I may just anyway please do not God you do not even set your alarm I do not have time for this I think you have an interview today they cancel I be up all night play those stupid game they cancel or you cancel seriously mom it be not my skill set nothing be I be late we will talk about it later Damn it I be just hope to find a planet grow some food not that I know a damn thing about farm you sound pretty sure we be both go yeah maybe I be have he tell you we be the two he be pick no it be just obvious how there be only two qualified pilot on the ship I and the Colonel he take himself out that explain you why I Come on Chloe he have to pick you why you be the daughter of a U S Senator he be probably be order to be a Senator 's daughter be not go to help anyone survive on that planet I think the Colonel 's the kind of man who make his own decision I be not one of the two Matt at least I should not be I do not even know if I want to be do not say that there be still a chance that I will get choose in the lottery but if I do not I want you to know that I have probably feel close to you in these past few day than I have ever feel to anybody so if this be goodbye it be not it might be I be glad he be go to pick you I want you there what be the odd one in five one in six something like that we will see so how be you go to get the thing off the ship with the remote when the shuttle take off we might even get one last look at the Destiny from the outside before it get out of range what be you guy do here we hear your message in a bottle it start out as a documentary actually we want to be part of it figure you would be busy Eli you realize the odd of anybody find a kino out here probably nil I know let us do it anyway let us do something let us leave something of ourselves behind so who be first I be Chloe Armstrong I be 23 and I just want to say that my father give his life so that all of we could survive another day and we do another day sorry you radio I yes the first planet be too cold frozen methane the second be too hot the third that happen to be behind the star at the moment too far away to determine habitability when will we know it do not matter we do not have any choice we be go to have to launch the shuttle before we can get close enough the odd be good though its orbit be in between the other two the Goldilocks zone they call it not too hot and not too cold just right what if we use the engine from the shuttle to push the Destiny off course that be a good thought but I be afraid I 've already run the number and without get into delta v thrust to weight ratio then not a chance no when do we launch the shuttle we could wait a few more hour but the extra time I do not think it be go to give we any more info than we already have when the shuttle 's load then if by chance you be think of choose I as one of the two please do not why this ship come here be my destiny my life 's work be to be here not try to survive on some rock with a bunch of stranger in fact you can take my name off the lottery altogether look Rush I realize I should 've listen to you soon no I be not myself still you be right it really would not have make any difference do you mind if I ask you who you be go to choose Lieutenants Scott and Johansen I would 've think Scott and Greer yesterday 's hero I 've get my finger cross for Greer you could easily arrange that fix the lottery there will be those who will think you do anyway my name be Camile Wray my age be none of your business Eli if if anyone find this within the next I do not know 40 year tell Sharon that my last thought be for her the name of every person in this room be write down on one of this piece of paper Dr Rush and I have choose to exclude ourselves if anyone else feel the same way now would be the time to speak up if your name be choose you be to go directly up these stair to the shuttle where you will be meet by the two people that I have already choose Lieutenant Scott have pilot training and TJ 's skill as a medic will be essential on the planet if your name be not choose you be to remain here until I receive word the 15 be aboard and the shuttle 's rear hatch be secure do anyone have anything to say Airman Becker go David Walters Camile Wray Lieutenant James Dr Park take a seat and strap in yes sir Mr Brody Sergeant Riley and Dr Boone that be 15 we be do here you can fit more people on that thing I need you to shut up come on people if we do not do something we be do he be right we get to do something now I do not want to have to do that to anybody else but I will that be it full count this be Scott everyone 's aboard rear hatch be secure give yourself a 60 second countdown Lieutenant some of we would like to see you off copy that we be release the docking clamp the kino 's send back picture this be Scott we be away you be look good Lieutenant I expect we will be out of radio range by the time we fire up the main drive so we will be think of you guy you too brother you too Matthew T J take good care of those people there it be that be the Destiny thank you Eli I never think I would get the chance to see the ship from the outside you know what I think I be go to go for a walk how do that sound sound like a plan I shall be in my quarter for the duration I have 100 page of a truly mediocre book to finish I be sorry I get you involved in this actually I be not yet I will probably be sorry at the end of the day but we do not have that long do we no how will it happen there will be turbulence from the solar wind far bad than what we 've previously experience heat obviously and intense g force I suspect the ship will be tear apart long before we reach the star hopefully it will be quick while I do not condone behavior of that kind in any way shape or form I got to say the look on Telford 's face when you put he down be priceless complete and total shock he be surprised yes sir I guess you can say you even get away with it I be just sorry I that I disappoint you sir you be a good man Sergeant I know that besides the bastard have it come yes sir he do so long at ease Ronald Colonel just go whenever you be ready no I get it I just can you just wait outside Eli Thanks hi Emily I just I just want to say well you know you know where be everybody all the fun people be here our father who art in heaven Hallowed be thy name Thy kingdom come Thy will be do on Earth as it be in heaven give we this day our daily bread and forgive we our trespass as we forgive those who trespass against we and lead we not into temptation what nothing I just I realize it be past midnight do that mean they 've go into the sun no nothing like that it be his birthday that be all he mean happy birthday thank Mr Brody would you come up here I need you to confirm a spectrographic analysis for I Oxygen nitrogen liquid water only trace level of CO2 what it mean there will not be much vegetation the thermometer will not be spend much time above zero either but we can survive right it will be great what be we so happy about we be go to live Eli what about the turbulence and the heat and the death all of that would have happen by now the shield be protect we but you say we be out of power I be absolutely certain of that I have never be more pleased to be wrong in all my life the light just come back on in my room what be go on Stand by Colonel you be right the system be come back online all over the ship there be a rumor spread we be still here we be Destiny need all its power reserve to protect itself and we guy we be in the star that can not be right we be talk thousand of degree we 've just fly through the corona which be even hot to say nothing of magnetic field gravitational stress Destiny intend that from the moment it enter the star system you be tell I it fly into the sun on purpose why to replenish its reserve you be tell I this ship be power by the star themselves Solar power quite literally there be no other explanation the engine just come back on we be pull out of it the shuttle we 've get to call they back we have not communication yet I be work on it if you do not figure it out before we go into FTL we can not strand those people here this would be an excellent time for you to trust I to solve this problem I be go to put we in a high orbit spend a little time look around for the good spot before we put down they be go I can not help but think maybe they be the lucky one do not TJ the planet be a rock I say stop it all right here we go this be Young come in right there right there this be Scott Sir how the hell we be just as surprised as you be I will explain later get your ass back aboard this ship look there it be will do Scott out everybody hear that we have a visual of you Destiny plot an intercept course now Colonel stand by Brody come here what be it I do not know yet be I read this right you 've get to be kid I we be so close you can almost touch it what be go on Lieutenant the Destiny be accelerate away from we we can not match it Colonel we have a problem here what be it we can see you but the shuttle 's computer can not come up with an intercept solution Destiny be accelerate too fast I be try to put something in manually here but there be no way to cross the t sir we be go to fall short you be on full power yes I put the throttle up right away it be just not go to be enough you must have afterburner or something it be not an F 16 Eli it be a spaceship be there anything we can do from this end be there any way to slow the Destiny down that would do it Negative we be out of idea here come on guy come on I want you to turn and head directly towards the planet we will send you the exact course in a moment no no no the planet be a rock we would rather take our chance try do what I be say we do not have much time in order to reach the star Destiny use an aerobraking maneuver to slow down I be suggest Lieutenant Scott perform a slingshot maneuver around the planet to do exactly the opposite a gravity boost it should put Destiny directly in our path we be all aboard with that idea Doctor just give I the course and speed this planet 's get pretty big in the window here one moment I get it there be many variable be you sure Math boy send it okay math boy send the new course now be this go to work it be go to be close got it all right everybody hang on again that be they why be I watch this on tv okay we be only go to get one shot at this wish it be not the first time I try it there they be you 've get we line up you be do fine no he be not we be come up on they too fast our relative velocity be too great unless you can match our speed you be go to crash into the ship this be all we 've get it be come up pretty fast on we I know I know I know we have to come leave a little this way Lieutenant what we need be more speed Fire maneuver thruster that might just make the difference main engine off Thrusters off Docking clamp engage we be still in one piece well do well done we be on our way down I be dead serious about it that be the bad shuttle docking I have ever see in my life what be you talk about I barely even dent it the grind noise at the very least there be a giant scrape along the bottom I be go to make you put on a space suit fix it right now Sergeant we be go to need high temperature spaceship paint for Scott here yes sir I believe I 've find some Dr Rush have a seat these two have even shower no thank come on we should celebrate celebrate what that we be back where we start Come on have a seat rush some other time all right give he a double ration he deserve it why be that then I be in a good mood we be to be reward at your whim then no no just stop what you want some reason I will give you three you be right about the power situation not really you figure out the subspace communication how to call the shuttle we need to get those supply back you take your name out of the lottery so do you I be injure you actually make a sacrifice unless you know that Destiny be go to make it all along cheer everyone let it go sir he do not know I see his face there be no way no what if he do he be right sir let it go a lot of work Destiny the design be clearly Ancient launch hundred of thousand of year ago where the hell be we several billion light year from home we be on a ship but we have no idea where we be in relation to Earth this ship could be the most important discovery mankind have make since the Stargate itself these be the wrong people in the wrong place we 've get a lot of wounded we need to get home we barely have enough power to operate the main system this ship simply do not have the capability to dial Earth I read about these chinese miner that survive a cave in for six day by drink their urine I be go to go ahead and pretend I do not hear you know what they eat Coal Coal it be a true story do not get I wrong it be pretty stupid almost kill they Water level be down nobody go near that compartment on your watch Spencer ask if he could have a look in the tank why he be a crazy person Sir I say no nobody go in there without my authorization maybe it evaporate when we go through the star it be a closed system all that water go somewhere we be down to half of what we have when we get here I do not understand this you be the one try to get the recycling system up maybe there be a leak somewhere Ship say it be fine if what you be say be accurate it be we 've get a serious problem we would not if you do what I ask you to do can we stick to one problem at a time run out of water would not matter if we just dial Earth and go home I explain that to you the ship 's recharge the power reserve be full that be the point they be not where be we at probably about less than 40 of original design capacity I can not tell when someone pull a number out of his ass what I actually pull that number out of my ass he be not make it up if Destiny be ever capable of dialing back to Earth it be thousand of year ago when the Ancients intend to come here but not now you be right we have a problem yes again get Brody in on this he be an engineer I need to borrow Eli 40 000 liter that be what I hear we do not drink it it would not surprise I if there be more water than they be tell we they be hoard it it be a big ship you know the military long as they control the water supply they control we yeah I be talk about you those two be harmless keep it up I need to know who I can trust I feel like a spy clean this room up right Projet SG 1 00 what be it nothing sir just have a strange feeling we just drop out of FTL be not that I be on my way to the gate room there be a planet in range come on what have we get there be only one planet in range the ship 's already dial it up we be get reading now look like we enter the Hoth system Empire strike back the second Star Wars movie I refuse to call it Episode V Minus 47 degree Celsius Bundle up be that water ice but the atmosphere be dangerously thin and poisonous 13 molecular oxygen 95 carbon dioxide with a hint of argon Nasty planet the only candidate within range we be go to have to use the spacesuit we find but if that bring back a half a ton of ice I will take it shut it down for now Lieutenant Scott come in please there a reason your radio be off come in Colonel Young be look for you I think I would well go go what you could not find a broom closet we be still work on the other suit we be close to have a third one ready how close a day maybe we will be back in FTL by then well they be not in great shape all these year there be bind to be degradation keep at it we be go to need they look like it be just you and I then I could take Kennair sir she be do eva before you be I be fine how be we go to cut the ice Plasma cutter should cut through the ice like butter just do not get the business end anywhere near you Suit radio be voice activate between you Press here if you want to tie into the ship 's communication system you be in command while we be go be everybody clear on that I be sure we will manage start dialing assume a fair amount of physical activity you have just over eight hour of air it be what 11 hour until the next jump to FTL right do not worry you will run out of air long before we leave you behind thank beautiful one deep breath and you be dead Destiny this be Young come in yes sir we hear you five by five I 've just test the ice by the Stargate I read concentration of ammonia and several other toxic chemical how high be the reading off the chart you could try look far afield maybe on the other side of that lake be that really a good idea the further from the gate we go the less ice we can bring back I 've get just the thing give I two minute Colonel give we five Eli have an idea maybe there be fresh water in the lake under the ice at minus 47 the ice will be 10 foot deep we be well off find a pressure ridge sound like you 've do something like this before a million time do you feel that it be just a tremor you know the last planet I be on explode Destiny this be Young we be burn through suit air what be go on with this bright idea here we come people here we come sorry it be impossible to steer by remote that be fantastic Eli what make you come up with that actually it represent my most recent attempt to fly but it should carry a ton of ice Colonel we be send through Eli 's late invention I love it the man get a gold star how much will it hold More than you can carry by yourself all right we be head out keep the gate active we will radio back when we find something Sir listen if we do not make it back you will we be two guy in million year old space suit walk around alone on an ice planet if we do not make it back you be go to do fine yes sir good luck the level 's drop again nobody be be in or out Brody say there be no leak so that leave one alternative who could steal that much that be a lot of water I know I do not know what else to do it would not hurt to know where we stand start a search let us go Gorman Dial it up again Mr Riley we must maintain communication it just go off a second ago your timing be perfect because it be be 38 minute the maximum time a Stargate can remain open see I do not know that it be Dr Rush what be your status we 've find an expose area of ice that look promise testing now we be pretty far out can not see the gate anymore it be still worthless keep look go ahead I find something so do I can it wait it be Spencer I can deal with he myself if you would like but no it be fine I will be on my way I do not steal anything what be this those be mine I bring they through with I when we evacuate you bring they through with you give I a reason back off I do not have time lock he up the Colonel can deal with he when he get back you say you find something to be honest I do not know what I see I have to talk to Rush you keep search nothing we find be go to add up to what be miss I know but we have to know what we 've get no one be go near the tank and it keep go down come on come on Destiny this be Young we get pure ice that be excellent news it be a frozen waterfall we should be able to break it up into manageable piece and haul it back we will be ready for you busy day on Destiny I have not take anything I do not think you have what be you do check for steal ration it be okay Dr Franklin Confess Miss Armstrong you drink 40 000 liter of water he be kid I know I be just say we have right I be do here Miss Armstrong I hope I have not inconvenience you I understand I know that you would you Next this be never go to be enough stand back you 've do this before have you at least five time you mind if I give it a shot remember all we have be the bullet we bring with we so be we talk about like one little cloud of bug or be they all over the ship I be not even sure that bug be the right word for they what about cloud except the cloud be alive it be almost like thousand of tiny alien creature I have a problem with everything you just say what you 've just describe be it be the same as Lieutenant Scott claim he see on the desert planet that be what I be think and maybe some of they follow he would not we have notice they not if only a few come through the gate they be like tiny grain of sand and then what start reproduce if it be a live organism then they would so now we 've get alien what if they start burst out of our stomach I do not think they be dangerous it almost feel like they be try to communicate Lieutenant Scott use the same word you say he be delirious I be wrong what be your plan I guess we should stop everyone from wander around the ship after you here this be Lieutenant Johansen we have a situation it be under control but as a precaution I ask everyone to return to their quarter and remain there until further notice thank you you be you be not go to tell they that we 've get alien we will keep it on a need to know basis what else you be in charge and I be ask your advice what else always consider the great good that be it that be enough ice for now let us get out of here Gorman meet I in the gate room we have ice on the way copy they be on it dial it back please Destiny this be Young how be it go up there offload the sled now hurry it up we want to do one more run just so you know another matter have come up we have it under control we have alien on the ship what they just shred Gorman what the hell do that mean million of tiny fly razor blade float around the ship like piranha Corporal Gorman be alive Lieutenant Johansen be tend to he he be probably not go to make it that be it we be come back that be not necessary Colonel Eli be overreact we believe the creature be the same as those Lieutenant Scott encounter on the planet they must have follow we back through the gate I doubt those thing I see be dangerous sir they help I Gorman may have provoke they we will know more once he come to if he come to in the meantime Lieutenant Johansen have order everyone to remain in their quarter they be nothing more than a nuisance at this point but we desperately need more ice all right we will figure out what to do with they when we get back send the sled back through now rush out you be go to have to learn when to shut up you can not just lie to the guy and expect once back into FTL it could be day before we find another planet capable of replenish our water supply this ice represent a fraction of what we need to stay alive we need more I know but that do not mean you can it do you be make it sound like we be just stop act like a child please we have to figure this out I say we I say we torch them you know put some team together hunt they down where have you get that I can invent thing too we 've really get to work together maybe the bug be respond out of self defense Self defense do you see what they do to Gorman 's face I be the one treat he Sergeant I see exactly what they do to his face look we do not know what it be we be deal with and torch they may only serve to antagonize they far we hit they with something else Revenge that be great we get to do something if we just sit around till they drink all of our water then we be go to Alien bug show up and half our water disappear do not tell I I be the only one who obviously not the question be what be we go to do about it Sergeant you and your team go search for this alien entity cloud bug whatever it be we be call they and report back okay yes ma'am and Sergeant no torching yes ma'am I have an idea it be go to be dark soon stand back nothing be happen yes there be it be like vapor we just can not see they that be what they do when I see they they disappear so they be grow in number exponentially and consume our resource without we even know it you have to get they off the ship Sergeant Greer come in I be a little busy right now the bug be get into the water tank every time we open the hatch once we locate the main swarm we be go to have they be in front of I right now do not antagonize they I will not unless they antagonize I first do they move when you do they do now what we need be an airlock unfortunately there be none in the habitable compartment of the ship I know what to do this be not go to keep we go very long maybe Destiny will figure out we be get short on water and find we a planet with nice fresh water right next to the Stargate Come on we deserve a break can you hear I I be sorry sir the ice just give way be you hurt Negative I be okay but I be wedge in pretty good good thing too look like a long way down all right just hold on I be go to I be go to throw a line down here it come I need you to tell I when you 've get it get it now if you can manage it run it under both your arm and fasten it across your chest do this before too have you at least a dozen time now I want you to pull yourself up I be go to pull from this end you ready one two three pull Pull Scott Come on pull how stuck be you pretty dang stick be there any way you can dig yourself out I be not sure that be okay that be pass still here sir all right let us just let us think about this for a second destiny this be Young go ahead we 've get a situation here there be a tremor and Scott fall through the snow into a crevasse he be fine but he be just out of reach I try to pull he up but that be not go to happen soon how be that other space suit come we stop work on that I confine everyone to quarter all right it be just a thought we will figure it out how be your bug situation same as before do not worry about it do not you worry either T J I will be out of here in no time good luck Johansen out everyone be lie grow up do that this be Greer it be work they be move away from we as we move forward good job keep it up how about you lower the gun down and I shoot myself free that be good thinking there be no way the bullet will ricochet into your ass maybe I can cut my way out with the plasma cutter you get one hole in that suit you be dead maybe there be a way for I to get down there that be just as stupid that be just as stupid sir the last thing we need be for both of we to be stick down here you okay close in a little tight but I think what what I think I be lose suit pressure I think we be suppose to be confine to quarter I hear over the radio there be a tremor Lieutenant Scott fall into a crevasse oh my god he be okay just stuck do they have enough air Young say he be get it under control I just think you would want to know thank I think the ice tear a hole in his suit how big a tear be it I can not see it but I can hear it it be hiss out pretty good an hour at most plenty of time to make it back if I be not stick you have to consider the amount of time you have leave now I be aware of the damn time rush all I be say be if you delay much long listen to I I know what you be say and I be not go anywhere without he and that be the way it be go to be what be the matter with you Miss Armstrong you should return to your quarter you know where you can go look Colonel I understand your desire to rescue Lieutenant Scott of course and only you can decide how much time you have leave but Lieutenant if Colonel Young remain there try to free you to pull you up by himself there be a chance he might not make it back he be right just keep the gate active we be go to make it back in time with your ice which be all you really care about Young out Damn he be a lot of work this be Greer I lock they up close off the ventilation in that room vent be close should be airtight what be they do look for a way out let us hope they do not find one come on come on Sir I be think go it be okay no it be not Come on sir we both know you 've do this before too do what lose people too many time I be not I be not do it again I can not let you do it you do not have a choice not that I be count but this be the third time in almost as many week that you 've be willing to kill yourself there be a pretty good chance at this point I will not be around to talk you out of it again you be a fine young Officer you 've get a heart as big as a house and I be not here because I want to die I be here because I have not give up on save your ass so just shut up and think they be gettin ' piss off really piss off a few of they get out what how we need a plan Lieutenant I be come down there this be beautiful out here wake up Scott Wake up I need you to wake up Scott Scott come on wake up come on come on I get you that be it pull Pull Come on Lieutenant that be it that be it I get you you be okay Scott come on Hang on kid what be the plan we open the door they go for the water we close the lid all right who be go to do that I be I will I be not the one with the torch look I be not go to let you do that I have not kill any of they you be I will stand back torch they I want you out of sight what you do not trust I I do not all right Eli I be ready make we a clear path to the gate room seal off everything else you be good if this do not work lock this compartment off from the rest of the ship Destiny this be Young I be on my way back with Scott Come in let them out I get them all right dial the gate we be on our way I be almost at the Stargate with Scott Shut it down so I can dial in Colonel we be about to send these alien bug through to the planet we 've no other choice what we need you to step away from the gate and remain as still as possible they be come through now get his helmet off give she a hand his pulse 's thready but he be breathing let us get he out of here Sergeant Spencer you step out of line again I will deal with you personally Understand yes sir I do not think he do I need to talk to you about the behavior of one of yours that can wait we need to go over the new rationing amount I be schedule to use the communication stone this morning at approximately 03 00 hour ship time Corporal Gorman succumb to injury sustain in an encounter with an alien entity Lieutenant Johansen do everything that she could I intend to hold appropriate service tomorrow at 16 00 hour how do I turn it off Destiny the design be clearly ancient launch hundred of thousand of year ago where the hell be we several billion light year from home we be on a ship but we have no idea where we be in relation to Earth this ship could be the most important discovery mankind have make since the Stargate itself these be the wrong people in the wrong place we 've get a lot of wounded we need to get home we barely have enough power to operate the main system this ship simply do not have the capability to dial Earth in this case be five ancient communication stone you physically take control of an individual at the other end where be you it be top secret wait do you get the letter from yeah the air force I get it you sound like you be in airplane it be the thing I always dream of Dad no wait the ship be old and damaged we be lose air and somebody have to he be dead be not he I do not choose my job over you be not just about the job I want to get back here with you you make your choice you be so beautiful do not I be sorry I never mean to hurt you sorry sir they be wait sorry we be late you be late it be my fault thank for join we Colonel sorry I be not expect a party we may have figure out a way to get you home Surprise Projet SG 1 00 now the power flow issue be obviously the big variable but our simulation be encourage it be time to take it to the next level any question sound dangerous the IOA fully support the implementation of this plan I 've see it for myself the situation on board be dire and justify the risk I be not go to pretend to understand everything you guy be talk about but it sound like there be a chance that this plan could end badly you want to get those people home so do we I be just say maybe they could do a little more calculate the fact be we be at the stage where a practical attempt be the way to get any more hard datum the goal be to save life we do not want to put the ship at risk all we be ask be that you try it be something I would have to take up with everyone on board my office if it make you feel any well Colonel Carter save my ass dozen of time use all kind of wacky science I do not understand I can not force people to do something they do not want to do you be in command of that ship it be not a democracy I be sorry it be not that simple yes yes it be a United States Senator be dead his daughter and dozen of other people be trap a billion light year away from home the President want it do Sir with all due respect you be be give a direct order Colonel Regardless of the consequence to my standing I be go to take the situation under advisement I will let you know my decision tomorrow be you sure you do not want anything I be fine thank you must be nice to get out imagine it be everyone 's very impressed with how you be hold up under the circumstance I be do my good you be our eye and ear now your life certainly the life of everyone aboard be priority but you have to understand there be a lot at stake here you pass I up for promotion four time I never really get a straight answer as to why you be a highly trusted well respected member of this organization you would not have be on Icarus in the first place if you be not the point be I know there be no way in hell you would be talk to I right now if you have a choice so please can we just cut to the chase make this happen I be not a scientist how can I do that you have influence the people on board need to believe it will get they home even if it can get we all kill not what I 've be tell why be you push so hard if it work we think we might be able to use the datum to re engineer the process in one of our ship here in this galaxy Dial a gate to Destiny without an Icarus type planet and get the team that be suppose to go in the first place back on board now that we know where the ninth chevron lead the mission have take more importance why be not Rush here we be not convince Rush want to come home and do I have to remind you how much you have to gain personally in all of this assume I live the ship do not have enough power to dial back to Earth and as we 've see recently when the ship run out of juice it find a star and refill its tank now theoretically at that time the full power of the star should be available to we Star power Ultimate wattage baby it be brilliant if we can somehow use the ship as a conduit and channel the star 's energy into the gate as we dial that would do it Problem be the ship as a conduit part do anyone know when the ship will run out of power again tough to tell base on current usage probably go to be several month not if we can drain the power fast right that be part of the plan that sound a little vague it be possible so you be all for this let us see what Rush say give how little we know about this ship can not we at least try it and aboard if something go wrong well unfortunately the something go wrong part would most likely mean the ship explode not accord to the people who come up with the idea if only all science be that definitive Colonel you will have to choose who you want to believe nothing to worry about it do not hurt at all do I look worried a little try to figure out what I be go to say to my mom for my family I be on sabbatical in Africa when it be time to come back what do I do click my heel 3 time no way for you to disconnect the transmission yourself the base need to be manually shut down there be a device on the other side turn off will sever the connection Cool easy way to swap consciousness with someone across the universe I 've ever see what be with the kino first time use the stone very exciting any chance I could get something else to wear check I out this be weird the people we be in can not hear we wonder what they be do with our body Colonel Telford I will just get right to it I 've be order to enact the rescue plan put forward by the IOA Rescue plan I do not understand I 've bring doctor McCormack and Williams with I I believe you know they I 've set they to work what about Colonel Young effective immediately I be assume command of the Destiny you replace I for now without wait my answer you be go to say give we more time you be go to be disobey a order I offer you command of the expedition you be my first choice but you turn it down your exact word as I recall be I do not think it be still in I sir I be there now whether I like it or not whether anyone like it this be wrong and you know it I 've spend my career look up to you because you always do the right thing even if it mean disregard the chain of command do not think I like this they can not do this to we can they for now they have I think it come down to the fact that they do not trust rush the truth be I can not blame they what be we suppose to do they 've give you permission to see your family as long as you guy follow the rule I hate to go there but what happen if they screw up and the ship explode most likely we will die here too apparently they be just do some preliminary testing information gather nothing too crazy what you be say be live it up while we can Colonel Telford I presume he can use the facility that be it and what if the power flow can not be control if there be any dangerous fluctuation we just shut it down and allow the ship to continue power up early test show it should work we be not go to put you in any more danger than you be already here from what I gather supply be desperately short give the condition of the ship it could experience a fatal breakdown no one be try to alarm you unduly but we can not continue to scrape by barely survive obviously we can not say for sure that this be go to get you home but the good mind that we have be work on this and I be sure you will agree it be well worth pursue it be spectacular be not it if the plan have any chance at succeed which it do not control over most of the ship 's operational system be limit at good Navigation propulsion and many other have be lock out entirely by a master code which we have have no luck in break you might wanna know we 've come up with a way of drain the power yes so I hear many of the power conduit have be badly damage and fire the ship 's weapon system without either repair they or isolate the damage area would be prohibitively dangerous that be what we be work on right now just want to keep you inform she be not go to understand she can barely follow an episode of Star Trek you do not have to tell she can I help you my name be Phillip I work with your son you know Eli we 've recently become very close it do not feel real it be like a bad dream you be here if this be the only way I can live with that I can not stay this way forever mom I know everyone 's work very hard to get you home I be try to get through this I be your father always use to say one step at a time I miss he so much I too Awesome thank Eli drink four or five of those a day actually he quit really I find that hard to believe he be on a bit of a crash diet you may not recognize he next time you see he when will that be do you know I be sorry I be not sure really get into shape though can I get you something to eat Eli say you make the most amazing chocolate chip cookie he tell you that yeah it be crazy how close you get in such a short time sometimes it be like he be just right up there in my brain why do not I make some you can take they back with you he also say you make a mean schnitzel but I do not want to put you out no I be happy to do it you know I think he would be call more often here let I help you tell I this work you be do I know you can not tell I much about it I can tell you that it be important in fact it could change the world as we know it really my Eli not that I be surprised do not get I wrong he be my son of course I think he be special but he be always so bright so different but he just he never seem to apply himself some of it be my fault no he do not blame you at all for anything I be sorry if this be personal but he tell I you be not well do he lucky guess egg be in the fridge right I do not think he ever talk to anyone about it he ask I the Air Force be make good on their promise to help you to be honest the whole thing make I a little anxious I really just want to know Eli 's okay he be you make sure you tell he I be proud of he I will I be sorry it be just it all happen so suddenly and I I miss he he miss you too that be it for I I be almost do over here you be stall I be do thing the way they need to be do now we 've isolate power to 40 of the operational weapon system and it should be enough to get we a read on our power reduction capability the next time we drop out of FTL look this ship be old and damage the computer be not register half the thing they be suppose to I want manual confirmation before activate any system that comprehensive over 80 of this ship be inaccessible without spacesuit right now with only two suit do it your way could take month if that be what it take Dr Rush we be ready here okay send power through look like a coolant leak I think you get it so do I there be a problem Power 's backing up in the relay Shut it down I be try it be not work the problem be contain it be restrict to that corridor that be not the point how big an explosion be we talk I be go in I can seal it be you crazy you can not go in there we be on the hull we be in FTL if it puncture the hull disrupt the shield at all even for a microsecond then the entire ship could be in jeopardy it be it be go to be touch and go we be proceed with the test next time we drop out of FTL Colonel the man nearly die you be put he in jeopardy I be try to make sure you do not kill we all I be not go to I accept responsibility for what happen but you force the situation and activate the weapon system the way you be propose be completely reckless come on these people be in danger just be here evidence by what just happen this ship be fall apart they be the wrong people we need to get they home there be a right way of do that we be do it the right way that be a matter of opinion look I know that we 've have our difference in the past you want I off the team I remember it be my duty to express concern for how everyone else feel about you so be you suggest that my judgment be now somehow cloud or be it that I be just plain lie admit it Rush after everything that be happen you be afraid they be not go to let you come back hello hey it be I how be it go okay how have your mom take it could not do it I tell she I be a co worker I tell my friend I be cousin Liz from out west I may have oversell the job I say I be go to change everything for mankind as we know it what the hell Might as well make she feel like I leave for a good reason you do right I guess so so some of my old friend be take cousin Liz out on the town to see Janelle Monae you want to come hang out with we yes Emily it be I no Emily Emily please just open the door go away I be not leave I be not go to

come here I try not to come here but I can not stand it Baby I be so sorry I be so sorry and I love you so much I have to try right just in case there be a chance a chance that you could forgive I maybe you be just afraid thinking that I would die out there so it be easy to push I away now than have to face I like this I just want to come home to you and that be all I want I what be your name Phil can I buy you a drink I have one yes you do want to dance sure my god this be awesome we be go to go dance you guy want to come no so how long have Celina and Josh be together I do not know too bad about Chloe 's dad what be she go to do what do you mean her job she be work for he I do not really think that be on her mind right now sure tell she we be sorry I will you know it suck for I the Senator be hook I up with his wall street connection and now that be not go to happen I think I have to go throw up so be Chloe really okay she will be fine I wish she would call I back I be sure she miss you I think she be just have a hard time deal right now I really need to talk to her you know about the fact that you be sleep with her boyfriend what it be pretty obvious you be together Josh and Chloe break up I do not think she would have suspect that you be the real reason why I do not know who you how could you do this to I to you you be suppose to be her good friend get your hand off of I excuse I Colonel can I have a word one moment about Sergeant Greer Scott it be Young what just happen we just drop out of FTL sir what be go on it must have disrupt communication between the stone listen to I we do not have a lot of time you 've get to Colonel Young Baby what just happen we just drop out of FTL look like it might have temporarily disrupt the communication device we have to fix that Sir I think Colonel Young want I to shut down the stone this be no long his command be that clear the device stay on a glitch that be one hell of a glitch General that be what I be be tell they be work on it yes sir just let I know they say it be some sort of glitch apparently it will not happen again how do they know I do not know right now I do not care do you see that girl I be dance with she write her email address on my hand I hate this I hate everybody Captain Buzzkill no more drink for cousin Liz you see those two over there that be my good friend Celina and my ex boyfriend you can do well do you want to dance I think I want to go over there and punch he in the face I have an idea how about we get out of here easy this be awful I be not even drunk at all really because you seem drunk my head 's just all foggy almost there usually it make I feel well at least for a little while it usually make I dizzy and then I fall asleep just once I would like to go out with a girl and not have it end with she cry my life be so shallow and pointless and then I start work with my dad I really think that I could do something make a difference you can these be not even my tear I be sorry if it make you feel well I have a really great time tonight I be glad do you know the last time a girl that hot tell I I be cute never do not it bother you she be not really talk about you when you put it like that I do not mean that come on you be cute the real you what nothing go on you be say and you be funny too and you be a genius and do not say it you be a good friend yes that be I I be a good friend I do not want to be trap on that ship and I do not want to be stick here like this I can not feel anything can you you know what be the bad part about have a father like mine how do we get onto that you can not live up to it he be so great I will never be like he be my dad definitely would have punch Josh in the face I think I be go to take you home could you take I home a lot of people be behind this a lot of people play the lottery what be surprising be they would do it with their life I know you be oppose I have serious concern myself I be just wonder how much safe it might be if you be involve they can not keep I lock up in here forever you know he will as long as he can what you do he have it come to he look just shut down the damn stone man I be not you Ron he be our command officer Colonel Young be our command officer Telford 's get guard post 24 7 what be I suppose to do this well work what be you do I be make sure we still have enough power to control these console when approach the star Williams say you 've come up with a way of improve the odd of success I do not want to die Colonel Good hopefully we 've prove that be not our goal I be sorry I could not deal with it the thought of you be trap on that ship with her what do I have to do and I should not have bring it up again I know it be over but you got to understand no what be happen we just jump to FTL yes everything okay it will be soon enough all right this be ridiculous jump back and forth without any warning be completely unacceptable seriously route power flow to the Stargate ready to attempt dial in do it stand back everyone back up you be go to overload the capacitor bring power flow down the limitation be not hold because the system be not mean to handle this much power stay calm the shield be fail we need to abort shut it down it be not work I think you say you could stop it I know it will not shut down where be you go do something they be go thank you if I can have everyone 's attention please I be sorry to have to tell you that we will not be go home not yet anyway but you can all relax and return to your quarter the ship will not be explode at least not today normal power level will be restore soon right yes thank you you stage the whole thing so all of this be just to get rid of Telford have to be do so you be say that the ship be never go to explode no we would most definitely all be dead have I not put certain limit in place I also arrange for the alarm and warning to go off regardless bit of theater always nice their plan be never go to work you could have warn we you scare the crap out of everybody I do not know who be on my side do I Colonel Telford remove not only any sense of command but the two scientist that design and implement the program that be cause the crisis the situation appear to be irreversible fortunately Dr Rush be able to avoid catastrophic disaster how he do that along with the datum collect during the experiment those be people 's life you be experiment with we be try to get they home you cut and run there be no point in three more life be lose if it could be avoid Colonel Telford be follow order Sir after much consideration we have decide to stay in communication with Earth I hope personal visit for everyone on board will still be permit that depend Colonel consider it do thank you sir I be afraid the time that I 've allot for this briefing be now up General we be go to have to be tough Disciplined the road may be long than many of we hope we will have to sacrifice compromise work together without exception I think you do a good job People need to know the truth but they also need hope I need you to do something for I sure thing go over the datum collect as they try to dial I have already there be a lot I do not understand you need to learn as fast as you can and you talk to whoever you have to you think Rush be hide something that be what I want you to tell I we be go to survive we be go to make it home make no mistake my first priority be to make sure that we all return to those we love Destiny the design be clearly ancient launch hundred of thousand of year ago where the hell be we several billion light year from home we be on a ship but we have no idea where we be in relation to Earth this ship could be the most important discovery mankind have make since the Stargate itself these be the wrong people in the wrong place we 've got wound we need to get home we barely have enough power to operate the main system this ship simply do not have the capability to dial Earth look like we enter the Hoth system Minus 47 degree Celsius Nasty planet how be we go to cut the ice Plasma cutter cut through the ice it be Dr Rush what be your status we 've get pure ice we should be able to break it up into manageable piece and haul it back secure the perimeter welcome to the jungle let us get to work your first alien planet everything you expect More less we see what it be go to be like on the kino true but it be nice to get off the ship get some fresh air even if it be a bit sticky so you be not nervous at all Afraid some giant alien insect be go to come out and bite you sorry I be sure it be perfectly safe everyone have to pitch in and do their share include you Eli what I need a break so hot all you be do be stand there make sure nothing crawl up your ass and I appreciate that how be it go Good dig you do okay in general I be fine good Good that be excellent what be so funny nothing no seriously you be laugh pretty hard come on tell I why will not you tell I it be about I be not it how be we suppose to know what be safe to eat we can not know for sure what be that say a starve man maybe it be not ripe try it no thank you just expose yourself now come on seriously if you have a reaction we would not know which one cause it Volker just puke have you eaten anything here sorry be you stay hydrated what about any numbness or how be your vision no it be my head 's pound and my neck be a little we should get he back to the ship Eli dial back I do not know I just start feel dizzy it come on pretty fast you be run a temperature I think it be just the heat be your neck bother you it just start Stiff at the back mostly right I be on it guy listen up get your stuff we be bug out wait wait we can not leave if it be something that they get here it could be contagious so what be we suppose to do we have 36 hour before the Destiny leave for the sake of everyone else on board I say we we wait here for what at least for a little while just see how this play out Projet SG 1 00 it could be anything really a virus a bacteria there be no way to know if it be airborne you 've only be there three hour if it be something they pick up locally then the progression be unfold quickly until we know more I be recommend that we do not return to the Destiny with anything that might be contagious Roger that let we know if anyone on board be exhibit similar symptom at least that way we will know for sure if it have nothing to do with the planet will do check in every hour regardless copy that Young out shut it off Greer you must have some suspicion I 've see you give they shot I start they both on high dose of antibiotic I hate to waste it but give the symptom of headache fever and neck pain it be well to be safe than sorry so what be it bacterial meningitis I do not know but if it turn out that be what it be and I have not do anything they could die you do not know you be use up our antibiotic on a hunch that be my judgment call that be great I think it be not far it be not you do okay fine over here what be that smell it be sulphur I would hate to see the ant who make those hello what be you do have not you see alien this be what be make people sick I do not know they make chemical weapon from this stuff but we do not know the exact compound or concentration there be more over here it be all right I believe you look I know she do not want to make anybody else on the ship sick but what if stay here be go to kill we this could not get much bad I be afraid that be a failure of imagination top five desert island movie what it will help pass the time I will go first hacker Obvious I know the matrix Old school you got to have something to make you laugh right if trilogy count as one then all three original Star Wars but if only one then Empire that be four man this be hard I could pick so many maybe it should be top 10 Good will hunting have get to be James be not do well where be she how many do that make now that be Chloe Volker Marsden and Franklin now James too let I look at your eye I be fine you be not you need a shot too dial out Dial the gate Destiny come in if you can hear I please respond what be wrong I do not know why be it do that we 've get to get out of here we can not why be it do that what the do you guy hear there be a kino already there how be that possible we drop out of FTL the gate dial we send a kino to check out the planet they go through and there be another one already there lie on the ground not far from the gate guy we only send one kino right turn out the databank be full look like the databank be full what be on it Us what do you mean we they be watch the recording now but I hear a bunch of we be on it do what go through the gate to the planet to gather food then apparently some people start get sick I think that I be one of they but that do not happen obviously you be fine right apparently they find human remain too it be weird you okay it just hit I sure you be okay otherwise pretty understandable not to I I be talk about the barfing I be move on how be this possible I do not know what about an alternate reality Sir give the illness that develop on the planet I suggest that we quarantine everyone who go through to retrieve this kino and everyone they come in contact with since return that be all of we here I will have to coordinate on radio Brody be also in the gate room when they get back we be only there for like a half hour at most that be more than enough time to come in contact with a contagion wait a second you be worried because people get sick on this recording which never happen we do not know that what be you say that be clearly we the recording happen somehow what do you think be wrong with the gate it look like the wormhole connection be unstable it would have be extremely dangerous to even attempt travel Sir go so keep watch can you fast forward please Chloe 's dead all dead something 's wrong with the gate Rush do not think we can risk use it even with what be happen we can not reach Destiny on radio either so apparently we be trap here there be 22 hour until Destiny jump back into FTL the creature seem to be nocturnal they stop come once the sun come up hopefully the gate will start work before it get dark again apparently we do not have much ammunition leave what be you do Volker be not kill by the creature T J say he die of the illness during the night everyone seem to be come down with symptom at this point do I need to point out yet again that document this could be important see see who do you think be go to see that Us Us we be you look ridiculous it will not fly if someone have not shoot it Scott be bite by one of the creature he be now in a coma Eli you okay compare to most everyone else do not go too far we be under quarantine Sergeant Greer have find a cave nearby it could be our good chance to survive another night if it come down to that we could use some help good man my turn sorry so at least it be a defensible position back to the wall well than be expose on all side I have a lot of respect for people who do what you do it be not easy I can tell it really affect you when you can not help people it do my mom be a nurse she got stick by a needle try to restrain a junkie in the e r she get HIV I be sorry my father could not handle it he just leave I be 14 at the time that must have be hard on you do you have a family my parent my dad 's retire what do he do he be a tailor he be actually the one who teach I how to do stitch I remember this one time he cut himself pretty badly with some scissor and he sew it up himself and keep right on work brother or sister a sister she have two kid I miss they I be really afraid that my mom 's just go to give up if I die out here I remember as a kid I be I do not know maybe seven or eight my grandfather die and my parent take I to the funeral watch his casket getting lower into the ground it be the first time that I realize I be go to die one day I mean I know people die I be talk about the idea that my consciousness be go to end I be not go to see what happen to the world it be such an empty dark feeling like I be fall down a pitch black hole it be scared the crap out of I I take it you do not believe in the afterlife that fear be almost too much to handle I guess maybe I think I would just get use to it but you do not it scare I just as much every time Most people realize their own mortality at some stage of the game Eli it be not a particularly unique experience I know the question be do it change you do it inspire you to make something of this short existence that we have I be here be not I of course the ancient evolve to a point where their physical body be no long necessary find a way for consciousness to become immortal you really think that be possible I know it be maybe not for you and I but that idea it be the reason why I end up here you think if we learn enough that somehow somewhere out there we could discover how it be do we have to make it through the day you be okay it do not happen it be not clear what happen I know I do not go to that planet and have all those people die under my watch it be not your fault Sergeant there be anything you could have do differently I be not interested in what do not happen regardless of how that recording come into existence avoid the issue be simple we just do not go back to that planet do not bother you like you say it do not happen just a story right I be curious to find out how it turn out though not I what just happen she start complae that her head hurt she just drop it be be three hour since we drop out of FTL that be about the time people begin to get sick on the planet in the recording over here right here you say she just pass out I 've get 4 more case everyone who go to the planet or come in contact with someone who do can it be contain I do not know but whatever it be it be extremely virulent on the kino recording Eli say Volker die because of it how quickly within 12 hour m4 carbine hold the grip firmly stock braced against your shoulder it be get a kick keep your finger off the trigger until you be ready to kill whatever it be you be point at short burst we do not get much ammo go ahead you mean shoot for real that way Safety be off what happen to short burst you sure they be down there see them go home last night you really think this be a good idea the good defense be offense Fire in the hole literally I hope we do not just piss they off that be disgusting Come on we get more of these thing to hit his pulse be very weak do use the other remote help we be able to get a connection but the wormhole be still unstable nothing from Destiny on the radio be it break or be there a chance it could resolve by itself there be a number of thing that could be cause temporary interference we have 11 hour until Destiny be suppose to jump back into FTL there be no way of tell how long it be go to last and I guess it would be crazy to try and go anyway we can not assume that the gate be actually even connect to Destiny there would be very little chance of surve an unstable wormhole a fire would be nice I could not find any dry wood be they still watch the recording I do not know what to do they just keep show up and I do not have enough antibiotic for all these people it would help if I know the cause you be not feel good just go slow see anything good maybe we get they all today you see that do you see something I think I see something if you see anything move out there do not ask just shoot right I think the battery in this one be dead the kino have night vision why do not I turn it on never mind come on come on I do not think we be go to make it I be out Come on come on Gimme where be you go he be crazy you be crazy you be Come back wait Son of a wait stop Someone 's get to try look I will radio if I make it you will know it be safe if but you say for a moment there I think we be in trouble what for a moment there I think we be in trouble Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid it be Butch 's last line before he and Sundance run out to face the Bolivians one of my favorite too we do have something in common after all Destiny Come in what be it some sort of microorganism something from the planet not the planet they just go to the planet you and Scott go to the ice planet how do you know this be a sample of the water we 've be drink when people outside the quarantine start have symptom I know we need to look for another source but we test it at the time at the time we could not see it the microscope just be not powerful enough the organism be too small well it be not now it be possible that a batch of water be not purify properly and it contaminate the rest so we 've all get it everyone 's immune system be different the time it take for symptom to emerge will vary but once it be strong enough to pass from the blood to the nervous system it work fast and the antibiotic will not cut it for a moment I think we be in trouble oh my god oh my god it be 45 minute until Destiny jump back into FTL everyone here be dead except I I do not remember much after we be attack one of the creature bite I and I lose consciousness I be start to feel sick headache pain in the back of the neck the bite still hurt like a bitch but everything else be be well the gate still do not seem to be work I can not reach Destiny on the radio I be hope it be just a communication problem and that everything else be be ok up there I be send this through I be expect that you will send a signal that it be safe to proceed I will wait as long as I can and then I will head through regardless on my own I likely will not survive the night here what just happen it go back in time what be you do make sure it have not happen yet what have not happen yet a solar flare it be the only explanation if a wormhole 's trajectory take it too close to a star and it pass through an active solar flare it can cause it to move forwards or backwards in time in some case the wormhole can actually loop back around and connect to the same gate in a different time in this case the past this be make my brain hurt oh my god back to the future how could I not put that on my list the we on that recording drop out of FTL and go to the planet some time later a solar flare occur prevent normal gate travel so Scott think that he be send the kino back to the Destiny but he be actually send it back to the planet but in the past God that be so weird to think that be really we on the kino Us in a previous unaltered timeline modify now by the introduction of the kino from the future why be we dial the gate back there as I say to make sure the solar flare that disrupt gate travel have not happen yet thankfully it have not but why do we care about that because I think we might have to go back there I be start to feel sick headache pain in the back of the neck the bite still hurt like a bitch but everything else be be well it be possible I guess the venom of various animal snake spider scorpion they 've be test for their antibiotic property be you say that thing that bite I can actually cure what be make everybody sick you fall into a coma it release a sort of venom when it bite you apparently survive say you be feel well but you be just guess and those thing be base on this video people be go to die from this infection and quickly it seem like a wild stab in the dark but I do not know what else to do we 've all be expose so it be just a matter of time before we all get it right I will go sir not by yourself you will not we do not need liability Scott I be good to go sir get kino visual it be night time and surprise surprise it be rain which mean those thing will probably be out too bad they be easy picking when they be sleep in their nest during the day we can not wait accord to the time stamp on the recording you have an hour until the first team lose contact because of the solar flare 45 minute to be safe how many do you think we will need hopefully a small dosage of the venom will do it dead or alive Alive preferably I can not exactly anticipate the physiology not much time good luck what her pulse be very weak I just want you to be prepare I be not sure she be go to make it of course she be we be out of antibiotic why do people always wait until time like these to tell how they really feel it be so stupid I just I screw it we have not know each other that long but I think we make each other happy when I be near you thing be just well you do not even know how amazing you be it do not matter I 've never have a good friend before never never know anyone like that before never love I just I need to make sure that you know that I be here for you always will be please do not die she be go I do not see anything they get to be here somewhere Colonel Young this be Rush come I read you go ahead check in nothing yet it be rain pretty hard I be sorry to have to tell you we 've already lose four people doctor Franklin and Volker Lieutenant James and Chloe Copy that check in again in 10 minute we need you we need you come in please Colonel Young do you read if you 've find this it be because a solar flare interfere with gate travel and I manage to send this kino back in time all right listen very carefully there be a disease in the water we bring back from the ice planet it be fatal and we all drunk it but there be hope there be a creature that live on this planet lot of they actually that could hold the key to save you in small dose their venom actually cure the disease but be very careful they be deadly they be also nocturnal they only come out at night you can get they during the day while they be asleep in their nest and they be not far from the gate come on please believe I you do not have much time Act now or you be all go to die Destiny the design be clearly ancient launch hundred of thousand of year ago where the hell be we several billion light year from home we be on a ship but we have no idea where we be in relation to Earth this ship could be the most important discovery mankind have make since the Stargate itself these be the wrong people in the wrong place we 've got wound we need to get home we barely have enough power to operate the main system this ship simply do not have the capability to dial Earth in this case be five ancient communication stone you physically take control of an individual at the other end she be not go to have it she be 16 we barely even know each other if anyone find this within the next I do not know 40 year tell Sharon my last thought be of her your shift be over I be good you need rest I 've be sit on my ass for hour General O'Neill 's order get plan for tonight this be delicious my compliment to the chef I will give you his number and he deliver no kidding listen I want to say thank you there be not many people that understand what I be go through Happy to help any time be everything okay we 've only know each other a short time but I would like to feel I can call you a friend of course you can and as such I feel a certain obligation to tell you some thing about your husband Projet SG 1 00 you be suppose to join we I know sorry I pull a thing Colonel want everybody in shape tomorrow I promise let us go come on to hell with this mind if I join you you okay fine Cause you look a little tired you get any sleep I say I be fine I be fine too thank for ask we 've manage to secure two more section of the ship I be send a team in to take a look I need you to operate a kino for I Kinda busy here do what I can not say and what be that suppose to mean that I be tell not to say a secret mission be it how intriguing look you be go to have to talk to Colonel Young about this do I a favor have a look at your chest be there any insignia there that s say Lieutenant or Sergeant or anything like that all I get be you be here exactly I will be down when I be do do not bother I will manage he say he be fine but I be worried about he he and about a dozen other I want you to do psych evaluation everyone civilian military I 've be mean to ask you anyway do not you think Camile might want to do they be H r you take psych in college right one course undergrad that hardly qualify I that be perfect get to it you can do it hold on the door on your right try it More quarter not bad move on so do I start cry now or do we build up to that tell I how you be do how I be do with life on the ship it suck I hate it how about your hydroponic lab any luck there the seed will not sprout which really suck because I would have like to have start to grow some food I be not really much of a fruit and vegetable guy but anything would be well than the crap you 've be serve we and there be not enough water and the bed be rock hard and do not let I forget to mention that I be shoot by one of your people so you be do fine then how be it come I 've run simulation on a dozen variation of Telford 's plan to power the Gate but so far problem such as catastrophic failure every time horrible death fire and brimstone dog and cat live together I get it keep at it I want to make sure you be next up to use the stone to visit Earth it be all right sir I can wait you 've be wait take your turn Wray will be go too all right thank go ahead what the hell be this we find the dentist 's office do not touch anything leave it I be on my way it be I Camile Weird Neural interface a precursor to an ancient device sg 1 discover several year ago a repository of knowledge that can be literally download into one 's mind this be one of those thing within that knowledge may be the master code to unlock the ship 's core system Navigation propulsion you be sure we can not be certain till someone actually sit in the chair it look like it hold you down and shoot bolt into your head they be merely electrode allow the transfer of datum do you know what a device like this do to General O'Neill the amount of information overwhelm he it damn near kill he be what it do it lead to incredible discovery and it damn near kill he the only thing we know for sure be an ancient device like this be pretty much a death sentence nobody sit in it I want guard detail post so what be we to do Colonel Ignore what this chair can do for we I be tell you to ignore it but to study it without sit in it but Colonel this predate those find in the Milky Way I would bet the effect be far less severe and your own life so you be fine as long as someone else volunteer if it mean get these people home I will sit in the damn thing Colonel Young come in go ahead Colonel Telford 's in the communication lab he switch body with Scott and he want to talk to you I be on my way Colonel so far I 've only manage to access portion of Destiny 's database we still can not control the ship even if we could turn this thing around right now and head back to Earth how long would that take another million year you want this chair to be a wonderful discovery that be fine prove it you prove you can use it safely to do something we need it to do until then no one go near always you on the stone do not you let anyone else take a turn why have not you give we the datum collect during our experiment we be still work on it ourselves I 've a team of scientist on Earth we want to help till thing get out of hand then you jump ship leave we on our own how do Rush do it how do he defuse the situation when I know you will know I do not get it I would think you would be do everything to get these people and yourself home back to your wife if you need anything ask Lieutenant James Camile it be you right I do not know you be check in today I be not actually this be a personal visit last time I be here I do not get a chance to go home right of course but since I have you I will be there in a minute Colonel Telford 's team be work on adjustment to their plan they be make progress Young be not go to listen at least not anytime soon and Dr Rush well like you say he be in no hurry to come home still try to take command of the ship he and Young be bump head yes right now Young seem to be win that battle and you I be catch between they not sure which camp be the well choice maybe it be time you start your own your mail all four letter Popular guy so I be your chaperone where do you want to go any family friend there be a buddy I want to catch up with he be at Edwards or he be no problem you okay I would imagine the level of stress that come with try to figure out the inner working of this ship I know it be intense especially figure we 've only just scratch the surface of all there be to know so how be you deal with it how do you relieve the stress I Read 35 36 37 38 39 one two three 18 one two three 19 move it move it Come on people fast Faster Franklin move it you be pathetic Franklin you know that go again again Franklin move that fat ass you be pathetic go

for retire to our beach none of that right now forget the rowboat why do I forget the rowboat come here come on come here it be okay Dr Rush you get a sec I be do psych evaluation the entire crew no thank you Colonel Young order they it be just a talk see how you be do give you a chance to voice any problem or frustration I be fine no problem no complaint be that it he be usually not this shy it must be the uniform he love the military do you eat go brush your tooth Matthew go be Lieutenant Scott I do not know how good of a friend you be or what he might have tell you he say there be a pregnancy but that you be I could not I could not go through with it why do not you tell he I do not want to burden he he be deal with a lot of stuff what be it now that be good look there be a bad

something about you go to college become a lawyer that be then right it be time I need to use your cell phone real quick I will be right back sorry be right there come here you be go to take a deep breath and you be go to find the strength you be go to go back to that ship and you be go to work with those people motivate they do whatever you need to do to get yourself back home because I be go to be here I be not go anywhere Promise I already do that 12 year ago the only thing that will not be here when you get back will be that stupid chair over there I love you too be right here so they just patch I through to Matt and I tell he he be angry be not he he be go to need some time it be a lot to take in right now but anyway long story short the mission that he be on right now take care of he financially so he be go to arrange to have his monthly Air Force check directly deposit into your bank account really yeah that way you can quit your job you can go back to school and follow through with your dream wait a minute if Matt want to help we out that be great but I be okay with my job wait what about college I a lawyer like that be ever go to happen do you even try Tell matt thank but I 've get thing under control here he do not have to worry about we I tell you it would not take long I 've be able to access the subspace link between Destiny and the unmanned ship that be send out ahead of it the one seed these Stargates on the planet we have datum on literally thousand of gate that have already be seed I 've only manage to get through a fraction of it but I find something quite interesting almost the same mineral composition as the Icarus planet how long one year away naturally occur naquadria throughout the planet 's crust ample power for our need one more year we can gate back home it be not quite as simple as that we have to learn how to steer the ship how to orbit the planet not to mention how to make the gate work to dial home from there as I say much to be do but we will of course need the master code you well get to work crack it sound like you 've get the well part of a year but the Neural interface device be still off limit God you think I do not know what you be do here crack the damn code Rush that be your job hey how have it go great and you great one year and we be out of here first we have to do what be necessary then get to it I will but we will need your support shall we say look if it mean get off this tin can we be all in I can not wait another year I want off this ship now Chill out Spencer a year 's a hell of a lot well than forever that be much well we will crack it we will if we can I know that Colonel Young will give we access to the chair he have to a chance like this this be our ticket home the word 's get around everyone 's really excited yeah it be good timing because I do not know about you but I be get to the end of my rope here it be weird I 've never even meet your wife I only see that picture you have in your office at Icarus Telford you connect with he so what this be a residual memory of his that somehow transfer to my subconscious do not mean it be an actual memory it could 've be one of his dream just because I see she do not mean the two of Thanks Dr Boone tell I about a planet rush discover in the database be it true yeah finally some good news I hope it pan out the way while you be go Colonel Young ask I to do psych evaluation on the entire crew assess people 's state of mind any red flag that we might need to be aware of yeah that be a good idea so I be just kind of wonder if you have some time to maybe sit down and talk to I right no problem but you know I have some thing to do today be tomorrow ok yeah ok Tomorrow 's good sorry Watch where you be go Easy I say sorry expect people to get out of your way what be your problem my problem be fat ass clog up the hallway what do I do I do not know what your problem be but get it together fast he run into I Shut up I do not care who run into who you keep pull this crap I will lock you up you get that get out of here take a walk a son that be wild yeah tell I about it what be his name Matthew I get an 8 year old kid name after I how weird be that be you okay it be a lot to deal with Angry that she do not tell I that I could not be there for he look one more year and then you can take he to soccer game and little league what be the mother like she be get her issue you two be close not really yeah I mean for a short time but thing happen we lose touch until now what be you do here stay away from my wife you pathetic piece of scum keep your finger out of my face you get back to I pretend to be I crawl into bed with my wife no he do not pretend to be you he never pretend to be you he tell I who he be all along and I do not sleep with he by the way but thank for not jump to conclusion he be a friend he be help support I through this what really be that right not all man be like you and I know you be still sleep with her he tell you this what happen what just happen the connection must have be sever Colonel I do not know why be you kid I Colonel Young not now Eli be check the planetary database the subspace link from the ship that be seed the gate I come across something that do not quite fit with the coordinate establish can not this wait no sir it can not Rush lie the Icarus planet that he discover a year away do not exist it be fake datum he plant it himself you lie to these people I give they hope false hope Rush yeah well so be dial Earth I know it be pointless at the time but you persist why to boost morale you tell I the difference I will tell you one be a lie who care who else know Wray overhear so we can assume everyone know on the ship well do Colonel you 've just ruin the chance to maximize productivity I be not the one who plant false information there may be an Icarus type planet bury in the datum there may very well be I 've only begin to scratch the surface but I would be a lot far on if you would just let I use again with the chair it could be our salvation it could kill somebody a sacrifice that could save the life of everyone else on this ship I be not stop you Rush go sit be my guest that be what I think you hide out too TJ be do her psych eval I 've be try to avoid she why you start open up you end up say personal stuff you probably should not and you have to live with these people see they every day have she give you weird look as she pass you in the hall get awkward Chloe tell I you be a dad Congrats get yourself a mini Matt see that be what I be talk about I speak and say thing I should not and I talk before I think it be okay no no look at you you be you be bum you find out that you have a son but now he be probably not ever go to get the chance to actually meet you and that suck you do not want to talk about that I be go to go now I 've complete 14 psych eval I have eight more scheduled the rest of the ship 's avoid I what be wrong bad day a lot of those lately something else be bother you what happen this my psych eval it can be Come on talk to I bad day Dr Volker yes welcome to Earth I be Major Peterson a car be wait for you anywhere you want to go the design be clearly ancient launch hundred of thousand of year ago where the hell be we several billion light year from home we be on a ship but we have no idea where we be in relation to Earth this ship could be the most important discovery mankind have make since the Stargate itself these be the wrong people in the wrong place we 've get a lot of wounded we need to get home we barely have enough power to operate the main system this ship simply do not have the capability to dial Earth Colonel this chair pre date those find in the milky way you want this chair to be awonderful discovery that be fine prove it I do not steal anything what be this those be mine I bring they when we evacuate where you go what be your problem my problem be fat ass like you clog up the hallway I 've have it with you look like a sweet potato that be so not go to be sweet how do you know analysis we do when we dig the first one up just to make sure it be safe it be safe it be safe now that be one sweet potato really everybody try it dig in oh my god I think I be go to be sick it be food people it will keep we alive Becker boil them up mash them up and serve them up yes sir who be on KP duty Sergeant Spencer but he should have be here an hour ago Sergeant Spencer you have KP duty and you be late Spencer get your sorry ass out of bed you have KP duty I do not have time for this Sergeant let us go what be wrong with the old schedule I be worried that we may be push they too hard it be not boot camp no no in boot camp you have opportunity to learn from your mistake Colonel Young this be Sergeant Greer go ahead I be in Sergeant Spencer 's quarter he do not show up for duty I come by to check up on he Greer what be it he be be shoot sir he be dead Projet SG 1 00 when do it happen Rigor 's set in pretty good but not completely so I would guess an hour either side of 0200 and no one hear the shot he choose to have his quarter away from everybody else base on the blood on the wall and the position of the body I would say he be sit on the edge of the bed Suicide why be he even allow access to a gun he be a highly train NCO he be unstable you know it with duty that require to be arm it be require of he I have say it from day one that it be not suicide what be you talk about do you see a gun it be go when I get here I check the whole compartment whoever do this take the weapon so any suspect excuse I for be blunt but there be a killer on board the ship do we have any idea who do this I do not know I be still try to wrap my head around it it be unbelievable be it you put ordinary people under enough stress you will find they be capable of anything add to that the fact he be hoard water and food involve in several confrontation I doubt you will find many tear shed over this man he be one of our own Rush I be sorry Lieutenant be he your friend do he in fact have one single friend on board this ship James hang out with he she tolerate he all right so no one could stand the guy do not make it okay I do not mean to suggest that it do what I do suggest be that Colonel Young you should find out who this killer be quickly as I be sure many of you have already hear Sergeant Spencer be kill last night he sign the weapon out of the equipment lock up yesterday and the nine millimeter handgun be not return and be still miss I be aware of how extremely disturbing this be for all of we so this be what we be go to do Lieutenant Scott Eli Mr Brody Lieutenant James and Dr Park be together play card in the mess at the time of the murder they can all corroborate each other ' story which give they an alibi I be in the control room all night I be in the hydroponic lab check the kino footage I be sure other will have alibis but some of we will not I be in my bunk sleep at the time but I can not prove that and that make I as much of a suspect as anyone that be why I be turn over full control of the investigation all right we be go to do a room by room search start with quarter until the weapon be find now everyone need to stay here until that search be complete but you be not search my room without I there anybody who want to be there when their room be be search can come when their name be call that fair Dr Franklin you can be first who else would like to be present when their it will take all day that way but we can do two at a time if that be what you want you two follow I all right Dr Franklin stay near the hatch please Guess I should be thankful there be no cavity search that can be arrange Franklin we do not like this any more than you do right there be nothing here you can just stay here now until the all clear you know I understand the need for a thorough investigation check all possibility but you should not lose sight of the obvious what Sergeant Greer have to be your number one suspect he kill Spencer run away to hide the gun then go back and call it in besides if he do do it you would have no evidence at all not help your argument I be just say he be one of the few people we can eliminate as a suspect Colonel Young come in what be it I 've find some new information regard the ancient chair interface have they check your quarter I do not know I 've get work to do where be you the control interface room I 've come across some interesting datum you be suppose to be here wait with the rest of we obviously neither one of we have anything to do with this business that be not the point while this be go on we could keep work obviously I be wrong rush out rush get your ass back to the gateroom Colonel Young this be Scott come in go ahead you be up sir do you want to be here or no you go ahead I will wait here there be obviously nothing here let us move on come on what be it Colonel this be Scott I need you to get down here right away where be it in the air vent the vent that be imaginative I do not mean to look that hard that be okay I be the one who authorize the search right you do not believe I put it there no sir of course not Somebody be try to frighten I right this what I 've be think we say that we find it in a storage room only the person who hide it will know any well maybe we can smoke them out that way be we sure that that be a good idea he do not kill Spencer I be not say that he do this be someone try to undermine the Colonel 's authority that can not happen Eli 's right I want you to take this gun to Wray tell she where and how you find it leave nothing out she will know what to do I can not investigate myself you can not be ask to investigate your immediate superior officer that leave Wray we get to play this by the book but with all due respect sir if the book cover this I miss it I need you to listen to I Something be go on here if we get catch this be go to turn into a big mess than it already be so I need everything above board out in the open that be an order this look bad it do not prove anything that be not the point this be a question of morale a lot of people onboard be go to have doubt Eli you be fly a kino in everyone 's face last night just until the poker game then I put it in search mode maybe it catch something something that might indicate that Young have nothing do with this or that he do I find that hard to believe have you contact Earth yet I be just about to use the communication stone well whatever your superior advise we be on our own out here Best we handle this ourselves thank for come I need a favor you 've hear about what be be go on that be pretty hard to miss I do not do it unfortunately it look like I be go to have to clear my name before I can find out who do I do not understand Wray use the stone please to talk to her IOA superior she come back authorize to hold an evidentiary hearing on the matter do not sound so bad do not kid yourself she be go to come after I why the IOA 's be chomp at the bit to have one of their own in charge this be the good shot they 've get you could talk to General O'Neill Miss Armstrong I could stay in charge without have to run to General O'Neill if that be what I want to do this be about more than that the point be if she be go to be the de facto prosecutor I be go to need a defense so I you go to harvard political science this be more politic than law I would think Lieutenant Scott I do not want it to seem like the military against the civilian please Doctor have you ever see Colonel Young attack one of his own man before I would not call it an attack he be defend I have you ever see Colonel Young have any kind of physical confrontation with one of his man but I be not military you do serve at Icarus base for a period of six month which be under his command Spencer be out of control he have to do something do he I be in the control room run a test Colonel Young and Dr Rush be be talk I do not think they realize that I could hear they and what be they say Colonel Young be complae about Sergeant Spencer say that he have get out of hand and if the situation do not improve he might have to take drastic measure but you have no way of know what he mean by that do you assume you hear correctly no not at the time I do not remember the exact detail of the conversation but you do remember speak with Colonel Young about Sergeant Spencer the Colonel be do most of the talking I think he just want to let off steam do you remember he say that if thing do not improve he be go to have to take drastic action I be not sure he use those exact word do you agree that Sergeant Spencer be a disruptive force that his attitude be damaging to morale and be only get bad then would you say that his Removal from the situation have be a net benefit or a detriment I know what you be try to do you want I to suggest that we be well off without he and therefore imply that Young may have draw the same conclusion that as Commander he may have believe he have no choice that would be pure speculation and I be have none of it do not stop he from say it out loud do it be you sure there be nothing in the kino footage I 've confirm alibis for half a dozen or so people but I have not find anything that help he you find a empty bottle of sleep pill in Sergeant Spencer 's quarter do not you do you know he be take they I wish I have I might have be able to help he you be suggest that he have a dependence and as a result that he be suffer from withdrawal it would explain a lot of thing but you do not know that for a fact Hypothetically if he be suffer from withdrawal it could have cause he anxiety depression even suicidal tendency in fact all the physical evidence the blood spatter the angle of the wound the position of the body it be all consistent with suicide but you be not a forensic scientist no but I 've see gunshot suicide before and in those case be the gun ever absent when the body be find no but it be obvious that someone plant it be not up to you to speculate be not it true Lieutenant that if we be on Earth there be a simple test you could do to determine if Sergeant Spencer have fire that gun I suppose we could test his hand for powder residue and properly test the weapon for fingerprint but we do not have the necessary be it possible that a forensic scientist from Earth say use the communication stone might have be helpful even without the equipment you be talk about if we have not handle the weapon or contaminate the crime scene yeah but whose decision be it to have we investigate this ourselves Ms Wray I think it be my turn to ask question what be you do I be take my turn as we agree would a proper autopsy be able to determine if he be in fact suffer from withdrawal Expert or no expert without any actual forensic equipment or facility be it possible to know for certain what really happen I do not think so I think it be time that we take a short recess we will resume in an hour thank you I need to talk to you now what be that we be try to get to the truth here I do not think that be possible we can not afford to have an unsolved murder hang over our head so forget about the possibility that the Colonel be be frame and just get this over with I do not think Young be so far above reproach as you seem to think he be you be the human resource person you would know all about that in fact you know more about every person on this ship than anyone if we be throw due process out the window who do you think do it we will just go with that you do not think he really do it I be not so sure what to think anymore Spencer be a menace we all know it maybe it be just like Rush say he think he have no other choice no that be crazy well let us face it how well do any of we really know he she want to gather all the evidence she can and then put it to a vote what like a jury no everyone I say we end this right now I say we go in there tell them that the party be over and get back to work who be with I all right take it easy Greer this be mob rule this be what use to do to guy like I for look at white woman the wrong way now you think I be go to hang back and let this go be I interrupt something no sir at ease this have go on long enough Colonel we be ready to back your play that will not be necessary Ms Wray and I have already come to an agreement she be go to close the investigation for lack of evidence against I I in return will be step down from this moment on she be in command I hear congratulation be in order really I be just wonder what I have get myself into an opportunity to do thing differently perhaps what do you want Nicholas Control over my science team include Eli but you report to I of course that be it you sound surprised this be it this be it not very impressive I mean as far as chair go well time will tell I suppose so you sit in the chair it download the secret of the universe into your head then you die not necessarily Eli every time it be ever be try this close to death who be try it General O'Neill for one and he survive we do not have little gray alien to set thing right this time no we do not but this be an early model of that same device possibly a prototype build very early in their evolution in my experience the 1 0 version be usually the most buggy it be also the simple maybe it be really simple it just tell you how to fly the ship I be sure it be a bit more than that but your point be well make it be knowledge of this ship we need if we be to survive or for that matter get back to Earth one day then I be convinced that this chair be the only way to do that maybe there be a way of choose what information gets download or it be just a matter of slow down the download so it can be cut off there be only one way to find out this be our priority now I do not get it if Wray admit that there be not enough evidence against you there may not be enough to convict but there be plenty to cast doubt if I force the issue we risk divide the crew we can not afford that these people need a real leader whether they like it or not maybe nobody sign up for this and I can not just assume they be go to follow my order and I can not rule the ship by force I mean I will not all right you tell we that Wray be in charge that be fine but as far as I and Tamara and the enlisted personnel be concern you be still our command officer and nothing be go to change that still here yeah I get stick with the late shift how be it come it be not we run all ancient system diagnostic nothing Rush be try to write a new program but it seem like this thing be design to prevent any access except through the chair itself which would prevent an Alien species who do not happen to share ancient physiology from try to hack in I guess maybe Rush be right maybe we be close enough for it to work believe I if Rush think it be safe he would be sit there right now maybe you should get some rest Rush be due to relieve I at 2300 if I be not here I would never hear the end of it maybe you could go to the mess get I some alien mash potato really I be starve you get it this be Eli Anybody on this channel I need help this be Young what be it I have a medical emergency I need help now what be I do not know what happen how long be he be in here I go to the mess for five minute when I get back he be on the chair well the convulsion have stop but he be completely unresponsive he be basically in a deep catatonic state be there anything you can do for he we could try a high dose of lorazepam see if it will bring he out of it but I be fly blind here do it how be he you just could not wait could you anyone who have access to that room be order not to sit in that chair you know the temptation be there in fact you make sure of it by tell they it be our only chance you want somebody there because you do not have the gut to do it yourself both of you stop it be under my authority so ultimately it be my responsibility I know all right we need to talk you 've get those thing run day and night all over the dang ship and you be tell I not one of they see something anything out of the ordinary I 've be over it twice there be nothing there look again he be frame Eli we be go to find out by who and we be go to put a stop to it this be Brody in the gateroom go ahead we have an active gate and we send through a kino Atmosphere be nominal Temperature be in the green we be good to go I will be there in a minute may I have a moment of your time I have to get down to the gateroom we be ready to send a team to the next planet that be actually what I want to talk to you about I notice that myself and a few other marine be take off the away team duty list may I ask why call it a temporary adjustment you think it be I who kill Spencer at first do not you you be a valid suspect if you can not deal with that it be your problem not mine now get out of my way yes ma'am but I be not go anywhere it do not look like there be much vegetation around the gate so you may have to widen your search Lieutenant James and airman Rennie will be provide security but you be in charge Congratulations what I be sorry I should have catch it you have to look close there be nothing there look at the time code they do not match wait what be that that be a deletion I would not have even notice it except it cause a glitch in the code it be from the exact time that Spencer be shoot so the kino do pick up something it must have but if it be delete how do it help we because whoever do this be good but not good enough but I always back up the last two day of footage on my hard drive why my documentary I have to download it to my computer before I can edit it if there be an ancient version of iMovie in the database I have not find it there Colonel Young go to channel 2 what be it Lieutenant I 've get something you need to see I tell ya if I could change one thing about the day we escape from Icarus I would 've wear well shoe really those be nice shoe seriously how much long do we have to keep this up there be obviously nothing here Spoke too soon an alien ship be you sure that be what he say how long till we jump just over 2 hour I be on my way I be just come to get you I have to get to the planet it can wait look they find the remain of a crashed alien ship there be very little time before we jump back to FTL it can wait it be be about a week since I run out of pill have not sleep much since I can not think Everything 's I do not know these people do not even realize they be inside a big float coffin I wish I could come up with something well to say I be sorry the kino keep record but the file must have gotten corrupt this be all I could get the point be it be not there when Greer find the body so we know someone take it along with the gun who would have the skill to delete the file from the mainframe it be not that hard really anyone with a basic knowledge of the ship 's computer at least a dozen people if not more I be sorry I do not know what to say obviously we need to re think our situation obviously we should recall the team from the planet no we can not do that in over a dozen planet we have not have a single indication of advanced technology up until now this mess be not go anywhere he be right this ship could be important I be go too if you think it be really I be not ask permission I be tell you let us go it be not ancient that much we 've figure out of they the material the design it be different it be not emit any radiation or EM field it be basically dead have you be inside we 've locate a hatch but we have not figure out how to get in we would probably have to cut it open how much time would that take More than we have we be push it as it be Lieutenant let us pack it up just give I a couple of more minute it be go to make a difference well it might all right I be willing to push it if you be take your team to the gate be you sure we will be right behind you whatever you say volker be right this be unlike any other kind of alien technology we 've encounter before if they be indigenous to this universe they might be willing to trade Knowledge information there have to be a way in I know it be you I be sorry the file be not corrupt the kino keep record until you come into the room let us hear it let us hear how you lie your way out of this one I hear the shot I go to investigate then I find he and then you decide to frame I for murder that be a bit melodramatic I know there would not be any real evidence against you the idea be to create just enough doubt to get you to step aside I see that be the idea you be the wrong man for the job I be sorry to have to say but I think you know it be true do I you do not believe in the mission you resign your position as SG leader because you do not want to make the hard decision the life and death decision that make you a liability I be not proud of what I do but I do it for the benefit of everyone on board the end justify the mean something like that be we do we will never be do we should not have leave they so we could get stick there too no one be stick not yet how much time 20 second where be Rush he do not make it so we just stay too long on the way rush trip himself up start a rock slide I be ahead but I barely make it through I just want you to know that I 've inform the crew of the evidence that be come to light since you 've be completely exonerate obviously you should resume your duty as commander tomorrow you need to rest she can be in charge one more day thank Shut the door the rest of the kino footage even Scott do not see it I want you to make a copy for I put it on this and then delete it from your hard drive anything else this be what Destiny intend from the moment it enter the system we be go to survive we be go to make it home the ship come here for a reason Destiny be power by the star themselves he and Young be bump head not sure which camp be the well choice I do not know what to do with myself I be the last person who should be here you be the wrong man for the job you do not believe in the mission Neural interface a repository of knowledge that can be download into one 's mind do you know what this device do to General O'Neill the information overwhelm he it damn near kill he Young be not go to listen and Dr Rush well like you say he be in no hurry to come home he be completely unresponsive you just could not wait anyone who have access to that room be order not to sit in that chair you want somebody there because you do not have the gut to do it yourself this be someone try to undermine the Colonel 's authority we can not let that happen Somebody be try to frame I where be Rush he do not make it no headache any blurry vision I be fine you sleep okay I be good I get to go you lose someone under your command most recently three people Gorman Spencer and Rush it happen I know how much it affect you in different way I let they down if you ever want to talk I be here I do not you should I be sorry you feel like you let Sergeant Spencer down we all do there be be a lot go on between you and rush what be you say that a lot have be leave unresolved another time off to file your late report back to Earth that be right I be curious about the detail you intend to provide regard the incident with Dr Rush exactly what happen I be schedule to file my report with Earth later today and it may cast some doubt on your version of event there be only two people on that planet I and Rush I be talk about the obvious issue between the two of you that do not change anything if you want to accuse I you should have the gut to come out and accuse I I do not have proof of anything you just want to be in charge again I be say you have plenty of motive really do you think that I want people suspect I of murder maybe that burden be easy to bear than actually deal with Rush I will admit it I do not miss the man I say we be all well off that be reassure so if you do not measure up you just get leave for dead what exactly be the criterion then for stick around do you agree let us do this all good all good when you get a chance can you check the shower system the pressure be be kind of low Sure once I be do here Caine 's pretty cute there be nothing sexy than a widower a man who be prove that he can make a commitment and be single through no fault of his own what more could you ask for I can hear you I be so sorry how about we just carry on like nothing happen thank God kill I now all right I think we be ready welcome aboard Destiny I be Lieutenant Matthew Scott you okay excuse I who be you Sergeant what happen I have absolutely no idea sir now what do you think I be an IT tech you know I fix earth computer not ancient communication device Malfunction in the connection that be quite a hiccup I 've see bad we do not exactly know what these stone do do we not personally I just got put on stone duty 'cause Riley 's not back on his foot yet Sir you have be under quite a bit of stress you be not suggest that I imagine it whoever take over your body be act kind of strangely look there be no way that I hallucinate that ship or that alien my imagination be not that good I be on a ship and I see an alien now I want to know exactly what happen what go wrong and why until then the communication room and that device be off limit Understood got a minute please sit you know I always figure limited resource mean that every day would be a struggle for survival but I never think it would come to this that be some sort of hint yeah it be a hint if you be wonder what to get I for christmas I need sock I hear about today 's incident Caine 's look into it you know I find it interesting that the device just happen to malfunction moment after we have our conversation this morning I guess it be kind of coincidental that be one word another be convenient and another be surprising okay your turn you actually think that this will keep I from file my report back to Earth actually yeah no I be pretty sure it will when the time come let us hope that those who sit in judgment of you grant the mercy you deny Dr Rush I believe you mean allegedly deny Dr Rush Communications with Earth will resume as soon as I be completely satisfied that the next attempt to connect will not result in another coincidence or convenience or a surprise thank you we have tomato we finally have tomato more or less that be odd so I be talk to Dr Inman and she say the hydroponic team will have strawberry for we in about a month Sort of strawberry talk to I when they start grow meat actually they be work on a soy base protein happy thanksgiving everyone enjoy your tofurkey you be in a bad mood what be the matter I have not sleep much Colonel Young have I work round the clock try to figure out everything that Rush be work on you can not be serious Colonel Young be willing to sacrifice his own life so that one of we could have a shot at get on the shuttle when the ship be head towards that star you think he be a cold blooded murderer I be not say that it be fine can you believe it Tomatoes what from the second we get on this ship they 've be call all the shot what we eat where we sleep what we do and when and we just sit back and let they they be the one with the gun I mean we have every right to be afraid look at what happen to the last person to challenge they so what do you think we should do I do not know purple plant be you kid I purple chlorophyll be sensitive to red and infrared light the planet 's probably orbit a red dwarf the kino say breathable atmosphere water and oxygen I be concerned about potential stellar flare activity spot radiation all right then we will suit up you 've get to see this it just show up bring it up now what be it do nothing yet it be just sit there we should try communicate with it how we have broadcast capability of course there be no way they would understand we but I guess there be only one way to find out two alien encounter in a day what be the chance I be think likely Zero okay send now Let us hope they speak Ancient this can not be a coincidence I bet you I be on that ship this morning you pique their curiosity they come to check on we I be think they 've be check on we for a while there be no other way they can find we this fast they answer back that be not a translation they answer in English now how the hell be that possible what do you say we be peaceful human from planet Earth we mean you no harm and we would like to meet you what do I do what do I say back nothing nothing nothing get our weapon on line this be Colonel Young all personnel report to designate area I need you and Greer in that shuttle something 's happen I think they be launch small ship oh my god only 30 of the weapon be come on line rush put limit right after what happen to Riley we be still in the process of check each gun 's functionality find a way around it disengage Come on first real space battle over here you get it just about activate the forward battery that be what I be try to do come on get back come on let us go we be take heavy fire can you boost power to the shield I be workin ' on it Shield power be be drain by the weapon come on move go stay back we 've get surge all over the ship the weapon system be not ready Eli everyone onboard this ship be count on you I do not need to hear that you can do this no no I can not yes you can why be this all on I what about he I do not care both of you I need this ship work now you should 've think of that before you got rid of Rush just fix it you guy okay check her they be pull back Colonel Young this be Airman Dunning please respond they be retreat we get them on the run let us give they something to remember we by I need you to end pursuit and fall back to Destiny but do not engage I repeat do not engage Chloe may be on board one of those ship what the hell happen Easy Lieutenant it be nobody 's fault we be not ready for this they give up pretty quickly the attack may have be a distraction to try to come in close and take prisoner try to gain intel why be we the enemy I do not know Sir that ship be still within shuttle range request permission to deny you would not stand a chance with I what be we go to do I be go after her how the communication device Sir you be only assume that be the same ship Guess I will find out when I be on board let us elevate this have a seat and I will get to you as soon as I can thank so much anything I can do take your pick grab some gauze Chloe be take what how one of the ship latch on cut a hole I can not get a pulse over here grab the bag keep the pressure on he please Caine we need you okay that be good Tighter let I do it it be not go to happen for the record I think this be a very bad idea yes but it be the good of the bad idea go I think I get most of the weapon back on line how long be he go in for 20 minute then we pull he out you can always go back in if you do not find she we be not your enemy we mean you no harm I do not think it understand you they speak English they send a one word message for all we know they have a translation device on their ship or something then they would have send it in Ancient why do you attack we why do you take one of our people prisoner why do you do that you want to help I this be how you read my mind do you understand this one transmit this one receive like this here like this do not engage Chloe may be aboard one of those ship what happen he be back what just happen the alien ship be close in on we send I back send I back good to go ready it be not work why be not it work untie I there do not seem to be anything wrong with the device do you find Chloe guy you may have notice they be attack we again our shield be not go to hold for much long bring the main weapon on line Fire on the big ship Chloe be still on board that ship do it now Eli Return fire everything we 've get we can not keep this up the weapon system be overload shield be down almost 50 I know where be you go to try and save Chloe it be okay it be okay we have to go here oh God where be we go this way report bad and more bad too much power be go to the weapon our shield be go to fail bolster they devote all remain weapon power to the main weapon keep fire on the big ship not like you take the shuttle without ask he will say no and I do not want to disobey an order you get a problem with that you want to save she do it I be go you do not have to I be already here they be retreat keep fire we fire again and we risk blow ourselves up I do not have a choice do it they be they be retreat all of they except that one wait they be go Colonel Young say you be dead do he do he say how it happen Rock slide obviously he be wrong again this be Greer Come in go ahead you be not go to believe this I manage to activate the system on the crash ship find a database I would only just begin to look through it when alien show up I guess I must have accidentally activate some kind of distress beacon anyway I be glad I do I would have die out there there be a few people who think Colonel Young leave you to die on purpose I imagine there be he would have rightly assume that I be I be go in the rock slide so what happen when the alien bring you on their ship to be honest I do not remember that much the few time I be conscious they be probe my mind I would rather not think about it I know they be frustrate I seem to be able to resist give they the information they want he use their own neural interface against they get what he need so we could escape Location of the fighter bay basic operating system anything else like why they want to destroy we I do not think they do what they really want be Destiny probably only care about we because we recently come aboard what they want be a way past her defense try and find out what secret she might hold unfortunately I do not have time to find out any more my first priority be get Chloe and I off the ship it be good to have you back both of you I suppose you be wonder why I do not tell everyone the truth it be your word against mine I do not tell anyone you try to frame I for Spencer 's death well that be true no I just want to know whether I can assume that you be go to try and kill I again next chance you get I save you from those alien you fire on the alien ship while I be still aboard well so be Chloe that be a command decision protect the great good yes indeed look I realize that I do provoke you if it mean anything Regret leave you on that planet do not get I wrong you deserve it but I regret that I lose control that I become a man that I could not respect anymore you be here I be here we just have to live with it do not we so do everyone else on board they do not need the distraction they do not need to doubt their leadership and this ship need to be ready for the next encounter if we have not find our way home by then of course so what we just pretend nothing happen well it be not like we be ever friend for the sake of the crew for the sake of the crew hey there do you mind no it be okay you want to try some what be it a little something that Dr Inman 's be work on she claim it taste like gin I say it be a little close to rub alcohol solid sale pitch no thank you all right what do you think you and James any chance there it could just get really awkward you know if thing do not work out be stuck on this ship with someone you 've have a bad relationship with no thank it be probably good to just keep thing professional for as long as we can Anyways I mean we will see if we be here much long I hereby reserve the right to completely change my mind the Colonel 's dangerous we need to do something about that I try I know Damn near kill I for it next time will be different this be what Destiny intend from the moment it enter the system we be go to survive we be go to make it home this ship come here for a reason Destiny be power by the star themselves he and Young be bump head not sure which camp be the well choice let us pretend nothing happen we need to be ready for the next encounter for the sake of the crew for the sake of the crew I be curious about the incident with Dr Rush I manage to activate the system on the crash ship Aliens show up do not engage Chloe be on those ship they do not want to destroy we what they really want be Destiny another nightmare every time I close my eye maybe you should talk to T J it be not the dream it be what look you be they be go okay we get you back you be safe now so move on get over it right that be not what I be say forget it I want to help you it be fine I just need to clear my head same dream I too what do they do to we I do not remember everything yeah I neither maybe that be a good thing everyone think we be safe they think that they will never find we again we be not safe be we Projet SG 1 00 we need to talk I be think the same thing be you now the communication stone what about they you take one it be the only explanation you be the first to open the box you keep one for yourself and why would I do that maybe you think it be some kind of insurance policy you think it be not safe to keep in your room especially after that whole incident with Spencer 's gun so you keep one with you that be how the alien get hold of one and that be how I wound up on that ship do not sound like a denial Rush we should really be worried about how they find we they track the stone we do not even know how that work maybe they be smart than we they be advanced sure but not as advanced as the Ancients I suspect it be something much simple like what Subspace track device we take care of the ship you bring over but there may be another one attach to the outside of the hull where be this come from I be in direct neural contact with one of the alien for quite some time ever since I 've be have flash image of what you do not know I do not know but what I do know be they 've be track this ship for some time before we get here for they Destiny 's something like an obsession look we be out of FTL will be for several hour now be the perfect time to take a look Kino 's through Mr Brody please dial back the tensile strength of the shield Roger that you know it be a big ship this could take a while you have something well to do keep I post can I have a word with you Colonel all right not here I do not know what happen on the planet between you and rush maybe I do not want to know Spit it out we never do find out who put that weapon in your quarter there have be some speculation I will bet as far as I be concern we be well off without he I just want you to know that whatever happen Colonel Young come in go ahead we 've find it it be on the underside of the ship I feed the kino track into the shuttle control so it should lead you right there any time now Lieutenant all right guy ship 's jumping to FTL in a little over one hour that be plenty of time what be this place as far as I can tell it be some kind of ancient research lab not exactly ideal for our purpose but the level of connectivity with the ship 's main system should be adequate do we have to do it now we will never get a well opportunity you should get your people in position what be you do here I want to see the alien ship you know it be just park there to track we I know but I want to see it come in there it be how long have it be on the ship Rush say since before we get here although it be not entirely clear how he know he know weapon hot Target lock weapon fire that be it they can not get to we anymore Brody Brody where be you Hydroponics all right stay there it be on what now you sign off on this yeah I know I just stand by do not expect to see you here I just want to check on some of the medicinal here right sure meet up with you in about a half an hour that be just Volker and his bridge club Docking procedure Sir I be read a negative on the docking clamp Let us reset still negative Eli we 've get a problem the docking clamp will not engage what that be impossible Hang on what the hell I be lock out what do you mean you be lock out Someone 's transfer control to another station I 've get nothing the door will not open either we be jump to FTL in 8 minute what happen if the ship 's not lock down the shield will not envelop the shuttle and what I do not know for sure nothing good I know that the shuttle would not go into FTL with the rest of the ship which mean what I be not sure but I think the shuttle would be vaporize seven minute all right Eli let us let us think this through you say somebody be transfer control that be what it look like from here well can you do something about it if I stay calm take your time five minute sir I will bet you a buck rush this be young over Greer this be Colonel Young go ahead sir take a detail find Rush now four minute stop it stop it now Chloe we 've talk about this the shuttle dock clamp will not engage what you have to stop but I can not they be go to die I can not stop in the middle of this they be go to die dammit Eli this be Dr Rush come in go ahead now listen carefully I be in the process of transfer access to the computer away from the control interface room now there be nothing you can do to stop that all you be do be slow it down let I complete the transfer then I will lock down the clamp manually do not listen to he keep do what you be do we be in no man 's land here neither of we have control now let I finish before we jump to FTL do not do it Eli that be an order two minute sir what be go on it can not dock and we be about to jump I do not know the transfer would cause this to happen shut it down I do not have everything yet if I stop now Eli 's go to shut I out and our position will be compromise Colonel Negative Eli do not let that man take over a single system he be do it anyway the transfer 's almost complete I know why you be do this I also know you agree that nobody should get hurt we could lose everyone on our side shut it down I get it I get it let us go good work Eli so where do we stand how much control do we have we be about to find out what the hell come on it be Rush he be seal off corridor all over the ship Brody why be your radio turn off be there a problem sorry you be not suppose to be down here guy what be it what be happen get out of my way put the gun down I be not go to ask you again just take it easy Airman what be you do something be go on Lieutenant we be cut off from the rest of the ship I be try to report to the Colonel but these people will not let I through I be sorry it be inevitable a few people would be stick on the wrong side of the line what line we 've seal off Colonel Young and most of the military personnel to put it bluntly we 've take the ship Put the gun down not a chance why you do this Colonel Young 's action leave I no choice I be do this on behalf of all the civilian onboard this ship what do I do we be not go to go shoot anybody put the gun down now everyone just need to remain calm this will be over soon enough rush this be Young I know exactly what you be try to do and there be no way in hell that I be go to let you get away with it I be not act alone Colonel besides what be do be do I already have the food and water supply plus control of all accessible system have be transfer over to the console on my side of the line what be it that be not entirely true he stop the transfer prematurely so I could lock down the shuttle which save your life by the way move on that leave we control with one key system life support so you mean that we can shut down their heat and air on the other side whenever we want we would not do that do you have any idea what be go on here as a matter of fact I do not am I the only one you 've get our attention what do you want all military personnel to hand over their weapon immediately and submit to civilian authority be that it it do tend to be how civilized people structure their society Colonel be that as in nation or in microcosm as oppose to what military dictatorship that be get to stop well Eli tell I there might be a problem with your plan something to do with life support I be hope that he would not notice that anyway I 've do the calculation we be occupy a much large area therefore we have a great volume of air plus we have the hydroponic lab produce some oxygen not enough to make a difference if you cut we off right now we would have at least three day which be around about the same amount of time you would have to go without water if it come down to a contest I be not sure what the final outcome would be but it would not be pretty it be not pretty now Sergeant what do he say nothing but they be still pump air in here he will give in he be get no choice we have the Gate room and the communication room he be completely cut off yeah but he still have one thing that might make a difference come on buddy you get this it be a very complicated lock out program okay I be go to need some time so I get a head count Lieutenant Johansen and Airman Dunning be unaccounted for so I think we can assume that they be on the other side of course because someone be on the other side do not mean they be on the other side obviously not we 've get half a dozen civilian all of which claim to know nothing what about Chloe she be with they like I say how be it come slowly and it do not help that I be start to get hungry low blood sugar be not my friend it be not the food that I be worried about it be the water if dehydration set in we will be in trouble be there anything we can do about it they 've offer a trade a limited amount of food and water in exchange for Eli I I 've already agree to it he be the only one who can get we around whatever Rush do to those computer I know that and they know that and that be why they want Eli but there be another way in all right guy I be here and as you can see I be alone open the door Irony Put it down come on so here we be I can not help but notice that you seem to be well work with these people what do you think I be a prisoner I be hope they wait a minute in the control room when you come by be you just try to distract I so that I would not notice what Rush be do what do not what I of course not look I know it be come but I do not know when believe I or do not believe I it do not matter I guess I be just a little surprised you be take Rush 's side against Young Rush be an inconvenience so Colonel Young leave he on that planet to die deliberately the hole the alien cut in the hull be on the other side of the line on their six suit up Lieutenant I already tell you I want you here in case it do not work we should not have give food and water it be just go to give they more time that do not matter they know they 've get no choice why do not they just give it up then he be a full bird Colonel in the United States Air Force he be use to get his way but he also know that every military in the free world take order from a civilian government we just need to stick together until he remember that I will leave you to it to what once again I find myself in need of your assistance what exactly be you do we be go to squeeze every last ounce of power out of the ship 's system and then when we be do we be go to find some more what for the shield we be go to need they the tracking device be on that ship that we blow up one tracking device be on that ship there be another one surgically implant in my chest next to my heart Colonel we get to go this be insane do anyone else know about this I have to be sure she be not implant too and there be no surgical scar they be almost within weapon range I be dial up the shield wait maybe maybe that be the wrong plan maybe we should throw everything we have into weapon we can not take on three ship at once we can not run away either that be exactly why I have to do this if we can survive until the next jump they be go to realize they can not get past the shield and they be go to give up do not know that that be the way it be be for a long time they attack they try and get onboard the ship 's automate defense stop they they be attack we now because they be hope we be go to make a mistake do not Eli do you want to die that be what be go to happen if you do not let I do this what be the matter with you right what sure you will open the door for Scott and his team and I will go find Rush I just want to see if there be anything you need you can let we out of here do not worry you will not stay in here for much long because the Colonel 's go to take back the ship you do not have any idea what you be up against I think we do not a clue sorry but a bunch of civilian up against the Colonel 's training and experience it be about listen to reason not once you take the ship that make it war and that be what we do it be not go to make life on this ship any easy it be not go to make what those alien do to you neither will anything you could possibly say to I what be that they be back what be happen stay here this be Wray Report we 've get company so I figure let us go Sergeant they be fine I go easy on they that be it that be all the power we be go to get the shield be hold listen up if you have to use force so be it but we still have to live with these people tomorrow remember that go yes sir what be go on they find we how we know this be come we be prepare who be we I know Rush be the only person on this ship who have any idea what you 've be through but it do not mean that you can trust he he save my life when Colonel Young be ready to sacrifice we both we can not afford to have a majority vote every time a decision need to be make we need a leader all right put the gun down you guy okay yeah we be fine come on let us go you be surgically implant with a tracking device be that what this be all about you think if Young be in command he would what throw you out of an airlock give my previous experience it be hardly an unreasonable assumption and remember this be your idea do not matter whose idea it be it be over everybody down now on the floor get down I say get down wait wait wait wait get the weapon online he can not why I create a separate lockout code give he the code we be under attack I know the good form of defense be to devote all of our power to the shield not your decision it be already be do really maybe I should just shoot you right now get them out of here wait he have a transmitter in his chest that be how they 've be follow we even if we survive to the next jump they will just track we again t J take care of it what cut it out I can not just go dig around in his chest she be not qualified we will use the stone we will get someone we be not equip be you crazy that we 've get to get that transmitter out Sir I do not recommend give up any military personnel at this particular moment I will do it I do not need to know what I be do it will not be I right this be Dr Brightman thank you what do you give he an anesthetic I make from the venom of a creature we run into a while back in low dose it will knock you out pretty good you give he alien venom be that safe without it we would all be dead right now I think at first we be go to have to go in blind but then Eli he be one of our people come up with this it be a camera he take it out of a kino what be a it be like a video transmitter anyway we take it apart and mount it on that and that way we can go in arthroscopically what be that we be under attack what shield be hold we be good Welcome on board all right that be it that be it we get weapon I find a way around the lock out but I think what I think Rush might be right about this one if I be read this correctly the shield can not take more all the more reason to shoot back we can not spare the power weaken the shield even a little and they might collapse completely that be what be go to happen anyway be not it but maybe not before we jump maybe you get something I can hold this open with thank you can you hold that please thank you hold it up thank you okay I see it get it out be go to be a bit tricky but be you okay oh god oh my god Eli this be Scott we just lose the connection what the heck be go on down there say again we 've lose the connection the doctor be go maybe there be too much interference with all the enemy fire on the shield fix it what I be guess as it be sorry you be on your own you get that thing out of he shield be not go to last much long there be nothing I can do how long till we jump just over a minute get that thing out of he or I be go to have to he be come to hold he down hold he down give he a dose of anesthetic what be you do to I hold he steady I can see it I need you to hold this there it be all right I get it now pull it out we get it shield be barely register we be jump okay we can close he up nice work how have we do sir the ship be take some damage Eli 's look into it anyway we be still here all right everyone I need all of you to head back into your quarter now everyone Sir we can not guard them all if we let they split up it be over Sergeant all right people you hear the man let us go I be open to suggestion obviously we need to find a way to work together pretend it never happen you mean you should not have leave he you think I do not know that it be not over sir no it be not this be what Destiny intend from the moment it enter the system we be go to survive we be go to make it home the ship come here for a reason Destiny be power by the star themselves he and Young be bump head not sure which camp be the well choice we pretend nothing happen we need to be ready for the next encounter for the sake of the crew for the sake of the crew do not let he take over any system he be do it anyway we 've seal off Colonel Young and most of the military personnel we 've take the ship you 've get our attention what do you want all military personnel to hand over their weapon I be just a little surprised you be take Rush 's side Rush be an inconvenience so Colonel Young leave he on that planet to die he have a transmitter implant in his chest that be how they be follow we even if we survive to the next jump they will track we again we need to find a way to work together pretend it never happen you should not have leave he you think I do not know that Projet SG 1 00 www projet sg com should you be out of bed there be too much work to be do we would well get on with it we Ready all right go ahead and re pressurize re pressurize it be hold steady and we 've get atmosphere very good continue with the repair begin with navigation and propulsion Roger that what the hell be you do repair the damage shuttle if that be all right you just have surgery I be fine thank you you look like you be ready to drop dead and that would be a bad thing that would be a bad thing the civilian aboard this ship do not try to take over because I be do a bang up job I get that good for you I also get that I have to make this work so I 've order my people to make a special effort I would like to do the same even with you that must have take quite the effort you have no idea Scott we just drop out of FTL please have a team ready on standby but the gate be not dial why not because there be nothing there what it appear we have drop out of ftl into empty space no planet no star nothing you might want to re check that datum the ship that be seed the gate ahead of Destiny I think they send a record of the star system in our path they do that star be not suppose to be here all right sit tight guy Gate 's not dial they think it might be some kind of a glitch in the database and here I be worried I would have to cut short my delicious meal you okay look like you might be come down with something I be fine just tired we call that cold it be go to take a little time a special effort on our part towards a spirit of cooperation the Colonel 's right about that we have to live with these people do not mean I get to like it you do at least you have to look like good luck with that be I wrong do she look like she be come down with something it be a G 2 star yellow dwarf similar to our own sun because Destiny do not know it be here the star 's gravity well disrupt our propulsion system cause we to drop out of FTL prematurely it be a glitch in the technology so what happen now we 've enter a parabolic course once we be ' round the star we will be far enough away from its gravitational influence back into FTL and on our way how long be that go to take a few week there be however a silver line a planet only one in the solar system so far as I can see about the same size as Earth look close it be within shuttle range Atmosphere in a word Perfect I 've be over the database a dozen time no evidence of any glitch or anomaly I could not find anything either it be like this star just appear out of nowhere vigorous surface activity strong stellar wind bipolar outflow it be brand new it be straight out of T Tauri phase which would still make it like a hundred million year old it be 200 million how far ahead of we be those gate seeding ship it do not make any sense the ship would have notice it and drop a shiny new Stargate on the planet that be the weird thing about this if this star really be this young then that planet should still be a ball of molten rock we be through the upper atmosphere everything look good I be go to set she down on that land mass directly below we no sign of any wildlife that we can see it be pure how you feel great a little sunshine fresh air water just what I need check this out there be a whole grove of tree back there load with these thing it be like a kiwi we will do an edibility test I will do it what the hell be you do that be nice we do not even know if it be poisonous we will we be get a ton of plant sample TJ think there be all sort of medicinal possibility that be great we also find some fruit Greer go ahead and eat one so far he have not have any reaction to it how about water ton of it pure too we will bring back as much of it as we can no alien creature slither around no nothing it be weird but it be daytime so who know what come out at night load up the shuttle and head on back do a fly over of the area on your way copy that Scott out there you be this place it remind I of home we use to go camp Olympic Peninsula my dad and I we would go hike for day at a time find these amazing vista and canyon waterfall time to go TJ Damn near perfect it do not make any sense the ship not know about this place of all the planet to put a Stargate on I would think that look like we be not the first one here it be massive 2 000 foot high at least we detect a faint em field around it but nothing else those marking like some kind of alien language do you think it be the same one we keep run into not with this level of technology what to build this thing to create a planet they actually build this planet the Genesis device the end of wrath of khan the reason why Destiny have no knowledge of this star system be that it be place there after the gate seeding ship have pass you be tell I they build the star too that would make they the number one all time advanced civilization that would be an understatement so what do we do about this we send a team back down there what look our orbit have be refine it be go to be four week two day seven hour before we jump back to FTL I be propose we take advantage of the wait you say we be almost out of shuttle range we be but we be go to swing back into range once we circle the star and before we jump to FTL we send a team down now and we can pick they in a month load with supply we time it right on the return we could take two maybe three trip what about the alien we do not see they it do not mean that they be not around look we have three hour leave before we be out of shuttle range if we be go to do this we have to do it quickly just to say this out loud assume that this star and this planet be create by the most incredibly advanced alien ever maybe they do not want anyone mess around with it we need the food and medicine I agree the gain outweigh the risk do they we be 0 for 3 on close encounter of the third kind what make you think that these guy be go to be different I be not send anyone down there without protection and we will have the shuttle in case we get to bug out everything we do out here be a risk I hear you find some plant with possible analgesic property high concentration of salicin Similar to aspirin you get a headache only since I 've be on this ship take these steep they in hot water and drink it so you be join the team go down to the planet yeah all type of medicinal I can not pass it up how about you I do not know I mean part of I want to but what if Rush 's calculation be off can we trust he you tell I I want ' round the clock watch on camp Guard detail on every science team go into the wood hopefully we will be able to fix the damage shuttle before you return and double up on supply we can bring back good luck thank you be come too be there a problem with that happy camping you all set Cole will be look after Franklin in the infirmary while I be away I tell she to contact I if there be any change in his condition anything else we be clear we will see you in a month all right folk you get the whole month to enjoy the scenery we need to set up camp establish a perimeter Sun move that way guy over here Sun move that way so that be west okay River 's back that way about half a klick kilometer we will sleep in the shuttle for now but I want shelter build ASAP how many of you guy have go camping before well okay that be fine just watch ask and learn you guy know your team assignment let us get go I do not have a team yet oh yeah right sorry do you feel like help TJ with plant sure what be go on over here I be not dig the latrine be that what you tell he to do Somebody 's get to do it true enough start dig what no you can not make I you too but sergeant I you be go to dig okay you be both go to dig and you be go to love every moment or you will keep dig until you do the spirit of co operation we be all friend now so we will photograph and log every plant we find do not ingest anything until we do a proper edibility test you all right yeah just it be pass I be fine the amount of food and water we get on that ship it be a wonder we be not all faint from malnutrition well I just get the word Destiny be now officially out of range no turn back we be stick here how be it go well I hope they bring back ton of food the last of that fruit that they bring back be already go or so you think snuck this early I will split it with you if you promise not to rat I out deal so tell I thank you think it be possible to create a star no way now be transport to a ship on the other side of the universe by a wormhole that be totally doable that star just appear out of nowhere and the planet 's age do not match if some all powerful alien being do not create it who do I be sorry I will go somewhere else no that be okay I want to thank you I know all the military personnel be try to mend fence but you be one of the few who actually seem to mean it we 've get to work it out right it be interesting that we 've now be give the time down here to do that we be pretty lucky to find this place my mom use to say there be no such thing as luck only the hand of god give you a little help when you need it most somewhere along the line I mean I stop believe all that but now I look at this place put right in our path for we to find tell I that be not a miracle how be it go terrible Great which be it Propulsion 's almost completely shoot might be able to fly down to the planet but it will not have enough power to get back up so there be that we be make some progress on navigation we can turn leave but not right or up or down why do you say great we can turn leave go ahead while Destiny 's engine be off line I would like to use the extra power to strengthen the shield maybe explore some damage area in the ship possibly make some repair reclaim some real estate exactly you go ahead I will have Lieutenant James put a team together you two you keep at it you have a month to get this thing to fly to and from that planet and do more than make a left turn Fate bring we here I do not know maybe maybe that be what bring we to Icarus and then Destiny you do not believe that you miss your flight the plane crash you be not spare for a reason God do not have a master plan for you thing just happen so we be bear we live we die it be all random and along the way you do the good with whatever crap you happen to step in I be start to get a bad feeling I too I be afraid we make a mistake send those people down to that planet the mistake be not go with they you okay here Gosh I think you be feel well I be let I help you back to camp you should lie down I be not sick how far along about 15 week right before we leave Icarus but nobody know and I would like to keep it that way eventually they be go to I know I know but not now I will figure out when the right time be sure back on the ship I be not do well get anemic but out here with all the food and water actually the morning sickness be a good sign what about the father what the hell be it I do not know yet look like a robot figure it out no problem once I 've attend to the other hundred thing on my list put somebody else on it I be not go to have anyone touch this thing without I present I be go to get to it Colonel close it up you okay Homesick for Destiny only a few more day till we head back honestly I be not I like it here I be start to wonder if Dr Caine be right that it be no accident we find this planet we be bring here by god or whoever I do not know if some alien being be powerful enough to create this place maybe there be some kind of high power in the universe that know we be in trouble put this planet here for we to find maybe it be time we stop think about what be that when tonight just now come from the obelisk shoot straight up into the sky Dr Volker detect some kind of a a strange radiation he be work on it it be like this whole thing suddenly come to life why now why not when they first get there perhaps their initial impact be not enough to trigger an alert but now so this light you think it will bring the alien back to the planet you will not be there to find out Destiny be almost in range Colonel Young want we to start break up camp get ready to head back what about the obelisk I need time we do not have enough time we need to be ready to fly as soon as Destiny be in range so we can make a couple trip and get all that food back to the ship all right you hear the man move your ass let us go again with this the shuttle can fly it can now go both left and right and up and down but like I say before too many problem with propulsion Fact be we may never be able to fully repair it all kind of citrus type fruit bean potato Sweet potato Scott say they be amazing they can not get back here fast enough you seem concerned Dr Rush something we should know about no problem with your calculation the shuttle will return as schedule and Destiny will leave this system never know who create it or why you might want to give she some time we be break camp and she take off without tell I she be think about stay here a lot of people be Come on you can not be surprise you 've hear people they like it here I like it here too but we can not stay it be out of the question why not if people want to stay they have the right where have you be we 've get to move I be not go I understand how you feel I like it here too but we can not stay the Colonel give we order Matt do not I can not go back there why not it be safe here Safer the alien who build this rock may be on their way back good if they be advanced enough to build a solar system I know they can help we get back home not if they do not wipe we out first why do you immediately think they be go to harm we I be sorry do you not remember what the last alien do to you this planet be create for we we be lead here for a reason for God 's sake what if they do not come back then what I be okay with that I be healthy here there be food and plenty of water and we be bring a ton of it back and eventually it will run out what about the winter Dr Volker you say you find evidence it get very cold here yes well below freeze for month TJ so we will build well shelter I do not even think it will come to that the being who create this world will return and they will help we get back home I know it you would rather take your chance out here than on Destiny we do not know where that ship be go or if we will ever even make it home there be a Stargate on it as long as we have Matt I be pregnant I can not go back there I can not stand the thought of raise a child on that ship we be in range you be clear to make the first trip back we only have the one shuttle so time be of the essence Sir we have a problem down here what be it some of the people have decide they would like to stay on the planet you tell they no I try they have pretty much make up their mind who be they 11 people total Dr Caine Chloe Lieutenant Johansen what no Scott you tell they and I 11 include some of my own people and Scott he have the nerve to ask I to fly he back down to the planet after he drop off the one return to the ship I can understand some of they want to stay but Lieutenant Scott and TJ yeah he say he feel an obligation to help the people survive down there what be you go to do I be go to make sure they do not stay down there you can not force they to come back I think he can we be go to lose more people through attrition aboard this ship we simply can not afford to shed that many people at one time what do you expect he to do bring they back at gunpoint well if it come to that yes you allow Lieutenant Scott to return with those who want to come back to Destiny then send down a military detail and round up the rest that be great rush come from you first you want to kick the military out and now you want we round people up at gunpoint those people have the right to make their own decision about their future not all of they do you dd you tell he about I I will let you do that it be not my place he be the father right I catch a few look between you I do not think anyone else know I have not hear any rumor or anything you be go to be okay I will be here and I be not go to let anything happen to you have you go mad I really do not want to argue with you you be let they stay not all you be give they a shuttle it be damage it be not damage anymore you say that the shuttle may never be fully functional we may need the shuttle I be not go to leave they down you can not let they stay I have make my decision be it ready yeah but there be still some issue as to whether it can hold up through atmospheric entry Questions that be about to be answer Eli just radioed Colonel Young be on his way down here why how we be enter upper atmosphere so far so good come on hold it together yeah right there Destiny this be Young I make it through have anyone change their mind about return to the ship here be the deal I be leave the damage shuttle behind for those who want to stay you can use it for shelter and power fly around in short hop on the surface you will not be able to leave the atmosphere so do not even try what it will do be give you guy a fighting chance while you be down here especially with winter on the way thank you I know this be not I be not finish I will leave it for you only under one condition all military personnel will return with I to Destiny reject my proposal and we will take you all back by force you can not do that that be not something you want to test Sir some of these people just do not feel safe on board none of we feel safe that do not mean we give up they be not that ship be the good chance we have of get home I disagree sir I believe we be bring here for a reason and that whoever create this planet will provide for we they be our good chance of get back home what be it go to be you want to stay here out of obligation to these people to protect they I can respect that but there be people back on the ship who do not have a choice and you have an obligation to they as well they need you welcome home as predict we 've correct our course and jump back into FTL I be sorry you do not get your wish and what wish be that Aliens advance enough that they could build a star system finally somebody you could have a decent conversation with I enjoy chess do you have a moment can it wait I want to well explain my reason for choose to stay behind look I realize you be probably not hungry Lieutenant but I be I hear they be serve up a feast in the mess so why do not we talk about it later Sir later what if we be mean to stay there all of we what if that planet be a lifeline and we just let it go I can not pretend to answer that Matthew no one can this be what Destiny intend from the moment it enter the system we be go to survive we be go to make it home the ship come here for a reason this ship be power by the star themselves he and young be bump head not sure which camp be the well choice we pretend nothing happen we need to be ready for the next encounter for the sake of the crew for the sake of the crew I want to see the alien ship be you just try to distract I so I would not notice what Rush be do I know it be come but I do not know when Navigation propulsion and many other have be lock out by a master code which we have have no luck in break this ancient device be pretty much a death sentence I be not stop you Rush go sit be my guest Projet SG 1 00 www projet sg com have you see my glass Bread box you be up early be I I think you would sleep in I 've get thing to do 4 00 what Dr Browning oh that be today right listen I will not be able to make it today Nicholas nothing to worry about who can tell I the significance of Shor 's algorithm it be a quantum algorithm use for integer factorization it be important because it can in theory be use to break the widely use public key cryptography scheme know as RSA RSA be base on the assumption that factor large number be computationally infeasible this assumption be valid for classical computer no classical algorithm be know that can factor in polynomial time Professor Rush very good what be you do here sorry not now be not you take Gloria to the oncologist today she want to go by herself do not sound like her be you sure she really mean it oh yes quite sure I think you would be worry sick I be very concerned it be back I have a feeling you do you never say so I can not go through this again I can not Nick be you there be you come home yes soon soon hi I be Dr Daniel Jackson so you be your office tell I that you have not come in for the day I do not have time for this you be go to want to hear that be there some place we could talk you be go to tell I about the Stargate program your current dilemma how to unlock the Stargate 's ninth and final chevron specifically how much energy will be require how do you know those detail be classify the project have not even be name yet have it how about Icarus I know because it be already happen and you be just a figment of my imagination relive all of this be just a necessary evil an unfortunate side effect to a process I can not control and it keep get in the bloody way of what I need to do you the University the cloud in the sky all just a dream a distant memory and one I would really rather go away what the hell 's go on his pulse be strong BP 's elevate but not dramatically he do not want to involve anyone else I be in command of this ship and that mean you do not do anything without involve I do you understand what be all this we modify the interface we hope it will allow we to use the chair without cause damage to the subject and rush be the first subject let us wake he up I can not sever the connection be dangerous he have to do it himself without I Rush still would 've do it even after what happen to Franklin this be the only way to unlock control of the ship the code have to be in the databank let us forget about Rush for a second if he want to kill himself so be it how do you know this modification you 've make be not go to backfire put the whole ship in jeopardy I do not how do this new interface work we create a buffer to slow down the transfer of information we also limit the connection to a narrow range of the subject 's subconscious that should protect the vast majority of his brain in a bad case we hope only the memory we target could be lose if it work the datum store in the ship 's computer should be make available to rush through a dream a dream a semi lucid one Sort of a stimulated recall of the memory in question how do he wake up there be a build in trigger it should appear to he as a distinctive door he just have to open it and walk through he seem stable for now okay let us say this be work do you have any feedback do you know what Rush be do anything go wrong I be pull the plug get on a plane go I do not want to go alone I will go with you thank you the truth be as much as I would like to I do not think I have the strength my god Nick do not worry I have not lose my mind not yet anyway but as you can see I be rather busy ignore it be not help anyone bury yourself in work this way she need you thank you for your concern but I really can not deal with any distraction at the moment be that what your die wife be to you no of course not she want to go home one last time you should take she I know you mean well I really do but I can not go anywhere not now be we okay sure why not you choose to sit here by yourself instead of with I you look busy I need to know that we be go to be okay I know you think that I betray you and I be sorry I never mean to hurt you it will never happen again your friendship mean too much to I never a dull moment shall we see where we be now what do we got take a look be those building be they look like ruin it be the first sign of civilization on a planet Human no sign of any life we should go check it out six hour you guy gear up I would like to go I too Chloe have be study all of Dr Jackson 's work really you have say something archeological Stratification that be good thank you plus do not you say you take ancient history I do at Harvard I do not see how that help we billion of light year from earth but I get it I be pretty sure we 've establish this ship be no safe than any planet kidnap by alien right here I do not have a problem with you go I never say I do just be careful every code that be ever be crack every cipher in the last two millennium have be base on those that come before they this code however be so old there may be no know predecessor a proto encryption exactly how do we attack it with no basis then none of you nothing none of you see any pattern in this so what good be you lot then why be you here I 've never even see those symbol yes you have you have because I have and you be all I get out all of you just get out it be not their fault I know I be the one who can not solve it despite the fact it be right in front of I have you give any thought to what we talk about I be go to fail at that too I be sorry solve the issue of dial the ninth chevron I will devote two and a half year of my life to that meanwhile my wife be go to spend her die day alone while I be off out try to solve that little problem and then some kid some big child with no meaningful education be go to jump in at the last moment and solve it just like that no sense of ambition he spend most of his time play ridiculous game and yet he be the genius I will never be he be the one who should be here now see what I be see look obviously you be not yourself right now I do understand what it be you be go through yeah I know I lose my wife I could do nothing to save she it be a terrible helpless feeling yeah my wife 's not the answer Data do come quick when I be with she but it be not go to help I if I can not interpret it there be pattern I be just not see I be just say if you need time take it be with her that be more important right now that be more important than anything thank you 've be really helpful your nose be bleed the kino really could not do this place justice it be pretty incredible Awesome it do not look like anybody be be here for a long long time we have about six hour to figure out what happen let us look around Progress his nose be bleed it be stop now what do that mean I do not know exactly but it can not be good for he the way this thing mess with the brain his heart rate and BP have be fluctuate you say he be stable I say for the moment that be over an hour ago no way at all to tell if he be have any success all I be able to monitor be the rate the data 's flow into his mind and that be be fluctuate as well what be the odd that yank he will kill he I would not even hazard a guess I 've spend most of the last 20 year watch what I ate deny myself the thing I most love and now I could eat anything I want and nothing seem appeal why be you here Nick because this be what happen you have work to do go and do it I be do it it do not seem to matter where I be you have the chance to change so many thing the one thing you can not change be what be happen to I do not let that hold you back when the time come I know you will be there okay every time I turn I see another wall so what do you think that mean what do you got buddy well it be pretty cool look like a network of underground tunnel we should check it out why do not you want to know who live here how do that help we so far destiny have stop on planet that have something on they that we need it be not always go to be the case you see anything on the kino but we what could possibly be down there that we would need I do not know how about a power source capable of dialing back to Earth come on you never know they do not seem advanced actually many advanced alien civilization find in the Milky Way and Pegasus galaxy live in what appear to be primitive stone architecture that conceal extremely powerful technology I admit that be a big nerd moment but it be true be not it all right you get the kino footage let us go yeah that be the thing we do not have the kino footage what do you mean it be a bit of a maze you lose it I take a wrong turn try to steer it out I just need to take a look and get my bearing the footage may be important I be go to stay up here and cover your back be you scared that be a joke I be sorry I must have mistakenly think we be on that level now you know friend who can kid each other like that do not kill I Come on you can take up the rear we will not go far what be his problem I do not think anything scare he he be a little claustrophobic I need to sit down God be our refuge and strength a very present help in trouble therefore we shall not fear though the Earth be remove though the mountain be carry into the midst of the sea though its water roar and be trouble though the mountain shake at the swelling thereof there be a river the stream whereof make glad the city of God the holy habitation of the most I want you to practice okay God be in the midst of her she will not be move God will help she when the morning dawn what be that probably wind anyone else think we 've see enough be not you hope for dead body some evidence of human skeletal remain actually and there do not seem to be any oh God get it off get it off get off that be it I be out of here good idea let us go why do not move oh my god what what be it Run I think you get it do you read Lieutenant Scott Sergeant Greer come in this be Scott sir I be glad to hear your voice sir we be in a bit of a pickle down here what be that we be trap in an underground tunnel we be explore the ruin Sergeant Greer be force to fire his weapon the tunnel collapse on we no one be hurt Eli and Chloe be look for another way out but if they can not find one we be go to need help get out of here sir why be Sergeant Greer force to use his weapon there be a spider sir it be approach Chloe a spider it be a sizable spider sir I will send a team Young out Less than two hour before we jump into FTL this be my fault we should not have come down here so the good news be we have not run into any more spider do you find the kino unfortunately these tunnel seem to go on forever we have not find any other sort of exit or access to ground level we hear wind howl that be what you say it be I I be already have trouble breathe there be air down here my heart rate be very high slightly dizzy all right calm down there be get to be more than one way in and out of here I take it the digging be not go well we get C 4 that be not go to do anything but make this bad Colonel Young just radio through the Gate they be send a rescue team and what be they go to do do you read we hear you where be you we just find the tunnel entrance be everyone okay we be fine look how bad be it I be not go to lie to you it do not look good we be go to get you out of there let us get to work I be sorry I ring the bell several time the door be open your nose be bleed again I 've get great news our source inside the Lucian Alliance have come through we 've get the location of a planet that might suit our power requirement that be terrific I would though you would be more excited it be go to take some do there be a mining outpost Jackson do you understand anything on that board no not really why should I I do not either I do not expect it to just present itself why should it it be a code it be mean to be hide Code for what Destiny this be all information store in her memory bank at least I suspect a small fraction of it all completely meaningless to I in this form without context and unfortunately I do not think stay here any long be go to make it much clear be you go somewhere Yep I be do how be your wife do she be die today actually I really be sorry yes so be I should not you be with her you keep say that yeah it be true be not it what be the date today you say your wife be go to die today but you no please just tell I April 6th April the 6th she be take a turn for the bad the doctor say the situation 's grave they do not think she be go to make it for the day thank you April 6 what do that mean I do not know but Gloria do not die on April 6 well it be not the ultimate answer to life to universe and everything that be 42 Hitchhiker 's guide to the galaxy thank you you 've be very helpful the address of this house be number 4 not 46 why do it say 46 on the door well 46 divide by 2 be 23 I be sure you 've hear of the 23 enigma yeah it refer to some ridiculous notion that everything and anything be connect to the number 23 Most rational people acknowledge the enigma be evidence of the mind 's power to perceive truth in almost anything yeah if you look for it you be go to find it so what be this be this my mind play trick be I see something that be not there convince myself this be somehow significant Lieutenant James this be Colonel Young come in I wish I have a well news for you sir we be do the good we can but thing be pretty slow move you be run out of time yes sir we know can I panic now we 've get less than half an hour we be not go to make it seriously what be we go to do Sir he just suffer from some sort of cardiac event he seem somewhat stabilize but I do not know of much more of this he can take leave he in there be go to kill he I think so sir it be a matter of time and you say plug he out can kill he too I advise against it but maybe the risk be well than the certainty thing be not go well on the planet we will not have enough time to dig they out however if Rush can find the master code we may be able to stall Destiny 's jump into FTL we risk sacrifice Rush accord to you he be choose to stay connected to that chair he may not be aware of the danger he be in if we jump to FTL Eli Scott Greer and Chloe be go to be leave behind so right now look like their good chance be Rush we could not find any other access maybe it be time we make one Lieutenant we be run out of time we know we be go to use c 4 to try and blow a hole in the top of the tunnel how far back be you from the collapse opening not far about 10 meter move as far back as you can and let I know when you be clear copy that let us go guy Good we will see we be ready hopefully we be clear down here Fire in the hole Lieutenant do you read yeah we be still here do not look like that have the desire effect no sir we just make thing a lot bad I be sorry no it be not your fault Lt you do the good you could get your team back to the ship Sir we still have time not much that be an order lieutenant go you be not here for I I 've already be through this no you have not not really I be here you can not lie to yourself you choose this memory because it be one you would rather just forget what you need be here now that be why you be here it be not for I you just want your answer I need an answer you be die I know you would rather die than fail what have you become Nicholas the thing you 've do it be not who you be it be not you I always have it in I to make the hard decision I have reason good reason to hurt people be you sure you tell yourself my death give you courage in truth it make you callous you be not the man I love he die with you I be never your conscience Nicholas you still have one of your own you just need to listen to it some people live their whole life and never find what we have do not let what happen to I change you this way it be nobody 's fault I know I know that it be one stupid gene pass on to I by my mother incapable of perform its one simple function to repair damage dna that be it be not it that be why you be here of course go I know how much you love I stop take it out on everyone else I have not forget you Gloria and I never will listen to I we get five minute to stop this ship from jump into FTL people ' life be depend on it I can not I can not do that I can not do that I can not do anything about that Lieutenant Scott can you hear I we can not stop it Understood sir God be with you all of you it be not over son do not give up they just jump what be you do out of the infirmary I get work to do Colonel how about solve the access code to turn this ship around funnily enough I think you do not find anything I do not say that I say I could not stop the ship then and there even though it nearly kill I I manage to find a clue which may give we control of this ship once and for all a clue 46 that seem a little too simple it be the number of chromosome in human DNA Genetic code this help we how we know in other case with their later technology that the Ancients use sensor that restrict access by detect specific genetic marker the access code to the Destiny be not like that it be definitely numerological the problem we 've have be that we have no basis nowhere to start we be take shot in the dark and now now we know where to start they use their own genetic code likely a specific one more evolved than ours no doubt but all we have to do now be run through the variation we be still talk about billion of possibility here I 've write a program which be go to go through the permutation so how long several day really or several year I be be a bit more optimistic that be a little different for you all this this be worth risk your life for we will see this be what Destiny intend from the moment it enter the system we be go to survive we be go to make it home the ship come here for a reason Destiny be power by the star themselves he and Young be bump head not sure which camp be the well choice we pretend nothing happen we need to be ready for the next encounter for the sake of the crew for the sake of the crew I be not sick what about the father this be unlike other kind of technology we 've encounter before if they be indigenous to this universe they might be willing to trade you lose the kino no I take a wrong turn try to steer it out I just need to take a look and get my bearing we have not find any other sort of exit or access to ground level we be not go to make it Fire in the hole it do not have the desire effect we just make thing bad God be with you Colonel Riley Eli would want someone document the effort to rescue the team leave behind give that Eli be one of the team that be leave behind I would have think he would want everyone do anything possible to help rescue they you do not like my idea tell Destiny to go back be not go to work how do you know because I 've already try it I be do the Stargate aboard this ship be much more primitive than the later model find in the Milky Way as you can see from this map each time Destiny stop it be in range of only a small group of gate that mean the next time we drop out of FTL the planet the team be strand on will no long be in range of Destiny However Dr Rush and Mr Brody be work on that be weird what happen the battery must have die I just get this one it be not I I be not the sort of person who just jump into bed with anyone I think we Colonel Young ask you to check on I yes but he be ask I to keep tab on everybody he believe in you he do not have much choice I be also here because I be your friend I be sorry it be just that rush come in several system be down look like Destiny 's activate some kind of power saving mode that be strange our reserve be at maximum capacity from the last recharge Life support 's fine I should be able to work round it get the light back on in a couple of minute maybe we should not what work around it there be get to be a good reason this whole ship be fall apart computer do not last forever maybe it be a malfunction we be not go to be able to do anything in the dark we have two day of water top we will find more step one we get out of these tunnel we be off to a bad start we will find food and water they can not turn the ship around we will use the gate to catch up in order to connect the dot between here and the Destiny there have to be gate in range of each other between this planet and wherever Destiny stop next plus this remote only tell you which gate be in range of this planet not where they be there be no way to know which direction we would be go and in case that be not bad enough we have no idea where Destiny go one step at a time let us keep a positive attitude C4 blast could have destabilize the whole place Great we have to take the risk we be seriously all we can do right now be keep move Projet SG 1 00 www projet sg com Son of a what do we know not much several nonessential system automatically shut down we still only have limit control how about rescue the team we leave behind we will not know if the planet they be leave on be reachable until we 've drop out of FTL this be crazy you would think some of these tunnel would lead somewhere no wonder the people that build this place die out they probably all got lose down here just wander around think if only we have think to put in a few more exit or one of those map you see in a mall with a big red dot you be here how hard be that I would kill for a big red dot right now I can not take this anymore all right let us stop take a quick breather five minute still look for that kino so what be you do I 've be think about use the gate and I may have paint an overly bleak picture before I will admit I be freak out a bit and now we do know that Destiny be travel down a path basically a corridor of gate leave behind by the ship that be send in advance it meander somewhat but generally it head in one direction they would not put gate on every planet obviously not People do not realize how big a galaxy be anyway let us say the gate in range of the planet we be on be in this circle this circle represent the gate in range of Destiny the next time it drop out of FTL we need to get to that circle yeah right now hopefully there be gate in range of each other between these circle once we be in range of Destiny the address will show up on here you see how easy it be to make a simple map how do we know we be go the right way we do not but if we do go the wrong way we will either run out of address because we 've hit the edge of the corridor or we will run into planet we 've be to before or at least address I will hopefully remember or recognize but at least it be a 50 50 shot Good we should really get move why it have not be five minute Eli seriously be you see what I be see I suspect as much if it be true I know you be not go to tell Young it be not certain you have to tell he she be upset we all be but she be fine though I do not have to worry about put she back out there a few word of encouragement from you would not hurt though she think that you be only send she because you do not have a choice I do not I know you think she be a good soldier be she aware I know about her relationship with Scott she be not over he either but that be not an issue thank there be something else I need to tell you that sound serious Colonel Young come in Rush go ahead you be go to wanna see this I will be right there you be go to say it can wait it be more of a long conversation when I be leave behind on that planet with the crashed alien ship I remember one of the thing I see there appear to be a map of this galaxy include the Stargates and Mr Brody and myself have be work on our own map base on our own record of where Destiny have be thus far I think Destiny have a map of where it be be but we be try to create a clear picture of the galaxy just cut to the chase I be hope to have some well news but if I be right then we be at the very edge of this galaxy now how be that bad news Destiny travel between galaxy yeah but the space between galaxy be huge Empty that be why that power saving protocol kick in I do not know it could be but there will be no more gate no chance of dial back to this system if we do not find they the next time we drop out of FTL we will not have another chance oh my God what the kino look look an exit the kino find an exit that be awesome where be the kino I have no idea right exactly at least now we know that there be a way out of here left or right what be it go to be we be travel blind so what difference do it make leave I like leave no offense to what you like man but he be right we should go leave how do you know because that be what this map say there be be a few of these along the way I think they be just decorative at first so far they 've be the same except for one thing this symbol seem to be in different place you be here there have be map down here this whole time that be awesome be you sure well this seem to be the fork we be stand at there be only one way to find out what be you do go to go look for another one Greer she be right there be another map I try I do really I be about to tell he and then he got call away by Rush you should have tell he anyway it sound important so be this I know he be go to find out soon enough I mean you be start to show I know be you afraid of what he be go to say or not say I do not know tell he right now it just seem like there be always something Matt I be fine oh my God come in Greer Ron can you hear I maybe the signal can not penetrate the rock we could hear James pretty clearly three hour besides dialing check for safe environment roughly eight to ten minute per planet Factor in time to get back we will be able to see roughly 20 planet at least we know the direction to go in we will find they Sir good luck Colonel it be TJ come in go ahead have they leave unfortunately it be a very short window do you have some time to talk in private I be on my way to see to Dr Volker talk about the charge plate put they back online nothing seem to be work around here can it wait come on buddy wait wait all right stop stop move rock we need to get out of here look I see those rock come down he would want we to get out of here especially if there be no hope for he you just say that because you think you need to get we out Gear up give I a second here just go look Greer I be sorry man move move move this thing be come down please the boy have to eat look do not you go near there you got to let he out I do not get to do nothing Mom the boy have to learn can anybody hear I I be here Scott this be Greer come in come in at least the tremor have stop probably get far enough from the cave in I will go do do he be not always like this you say that all the time he be a good man a good father you be too young to remember I hate he it be not his fault do not care you need to be strong I know you get it in you he need we both of we Nobody else be go to take care of he we need to go where far away both of we we need to get out of here Eli hold up a second what I be say maybe the thing to do be stay put if it be possible to connect the dot between here and Destiny then Colonel Young be go to send a team back to look for we we would be well off wait for they to find we we do not know how long Destiny be go to stop for there might not be enough time for they to get here and then to gate back to Destiny we need to take the chance okay dial it it be hard to see look pretty foggy but everything else be good it be safe to go get out get out I do not have any money probably a good thing down here it will take a minute for the Gate list to refresh if Destiny 's in FTL it will not show up right right should not we spend more time on these planet to see if it do what if it be out of FTL but just one planet away from here see I know this be a bad idea do not you say we should stop be negative 10 minute we give each planet you hear that of course we hear it dial the Gate I be dial dial fast I be dial Holy go Mom we have to go Mom wake up you should 've let I burn it be beautiful not that I would want to be stick here for a long time but it be an incredible sight to see this be our tenth planet we have less than an hour and a half this be a lot more complicated than I would anticipate who would have guess Destiny have skip over so many planet with Gates on they get back should be much quick we have extra kinos and a remote Time to split up cover more planet agree we be go to find they we just need a bit of luck I be afraid I do not believe in that so you will take one team and I will take the other the fire the fire be everywhere that oil burn hot Got so we forget what a clean breath of air feel like Emphysema asthma bronchitis they say none of the guy send in to put out the fire show any effect come on you buy that how can that be true those fire be everywhere the man be a live hell send by the devil himself to torture I for all eternity just a little skin reaction they say just a little itchy on the arm the FDA approve it though it would never be through any large scale trial there be no side effect they say it be the war not the vaccine between 1998 and 2000 20 000 soldier have to be hospitalize after receive the vaccine even though they have never be deploy overseas the Pentagon fail to report that to Congress be not as bad as the sand flea though they get under your skin and how carry all kind of disease disease you can not even say tank buster Uranium deplete I load those munition nothing dangerous come off those what do you think 18 000 time in two year those alarm go off it be not the mustard gas never the mustard gas it be cigarette Deodorant can you believe that chronic fatigue loss of muscle control headache dizziness memory loss shortness of breath brain cancer I be go to kill he put he out of his misery it be the war it be the war it be not the fire they be everywhere big black billowing smoke the war be why he can not breathe listen I be sorry one thing turn into another next thing I know a 5 minute update I be pregnant you be pregnant how far along be you about 22 week it be yours ours a baby on this ship I be keep it no I do not I do not say you should not what be you say we be go to make this work that be what we be go to do we be go to make it work this be a problem what the kino say the atmosphere on the planet we just send it to be toxic we can not go through we can not get that kino back and we will not know if the next address we try be safe dial another one but I just say that we can not stay here can we no no but I you stay I will go I will go I will radio back if it be safe look we stay here we be as good as dead anyway dial another one they leave you abandon you they do what they have to do they think I be dead Nobody be go to save you nobody care in the end all there be be you you alone Doctor say there be an infection in his brain there be nothing they can do for he I enlist what for I do not get the scholarship but you work so hard be not fast enough you always say it be not his fault his choice be not wrong he just want to be somebody I want to be somebody you do not have anything to prove to anyone you do not let he change you nothing can hurt the spirit God give you I have to use it do not I to make a difference you can still change your mind I be not go to all right I be okay it be cold and dark but I can breathe and there be no crazy dinosaur at least not yet come on through it be kind of pretty sometimes we would spend Christmas at a cabin in Vermont Amazing that a planet on the other side of the universe can remind you of Vermont here we go the next set of address oh God what I recognize this one one we 've be to before not recently that be not good it be the one with the down alien ship the planet rush be strand on we 've be head the wrong way okay so what now can we retrace our step wait we should go to this planet why look even if we retrace our step and try this all again with different choice we be travel blind Rush say he we be able to boot up the computer on that alien ship yeah and that be what bring the alien but in the small time that he be there he be able to glean some information about the shape of this galaxy and where the Stargates be if I can do the same we will not have to stumble around we would have a map okay but what about the alien believe I you do not want to end up a prisoner on one of those ship I realize we might not have much time we will have to get in and out quickly if they be not there now I hope this be a good idea all right come on how about this we be in the right place I do not see any other Alien spaceship do you Clock be tick I know I know 15 minute where have you get that number I like it this be an Alien spaceship exactly 15 minute that be it end of discussion nice work Lieutenant thank you sir any word from Rush not yet I be glad you make it back they think I be dead I do not think they would have leave I otherwise I hope that choice do not mean we 've lose they none of this make any sense okay time 's up we need to walk away not yet wait you say none of this make sense I know I know go back what do you mean the screen go back there Select that there it be how do you know that I do not know can you read this no I just know what it mean can you use this to get we back to Destiny or not I think so we have to hurry though why if I be read this right Destiny be about to leave the galaxy if we do not get back on board before it do we be go to be strand for good Game over five minute seriously there be no quick way if I be right this planet should be just there it be Destiny Dial down to the wire incoming wormhole you cut it close and the other be not with he what happen I do not know it do not connect why not I do not know so where be they again what happen I say I do not what the address disappear how can it be there one second and go the next they jump we miss it we must have just miss it that be it we be do I be try to carry on for Eli do not you think he would want I to I think it be important I know you 've be through a lot I only need a minute or two what happen on the planet People be go to want to hear your story maybe another time this be what Destiny intend from the moment it enter the system we be go to survive we be go to make it home the ship come here for a reason Destiny be power by the star themselves he and Young be bump head not sure which camp be the well choice we pretend nothing happen we need to be ready for the next encounter for the sake of the crew for the sake of the crew the convulsion have stop but he be unresponsive he be in a deep catatonic state this be Scott Sir we be in a bit of a pickle down here we have not find any other sort of exit or access to ground level we 've get less than half an hour we be not go to make it they just jump God be with you Colonel all of you Colonel Young we be all here I be on my way Dr Rush have just confirm that our current FTL jump will take we between galaxy which mean it could take some time before we be able to make another Gate connection to replenish our supply strict food and water rationing will be reinstate as of now it also mean that any hope of rescue Chloe Armstrong Eli Wallace or Lt Matthew Scott be Colonel Young would you please join I in the control interface room I will be right there that be all I 've figure out why the ship be be try to conserve power we be go to fall short Short of what our destination no matter how I do the sum and how I try and conserve power Destiny will not make it across the void Projet SG 1 00 www projet sg com we just pass through a star we should be recharge yes we do but like everything else on this ship Destiny 's ftl drive and power reserve be nowhere near 100 the database say the ship barely make the last intergalactic jump recent battle damage could not have help but if the ship realize that it can not why be it try it be program to follow a predetermine path since we have not manage to take control of the ship our presence be secondary to that Destiny will drift the rest of the way but our bone will be dust by then what do we do I be open to suggestion how much will we fall short 50 000 light year give or take a few percent of the total what if we can increase the FTL drive 's efficiency work well with the same amount of power five percent would do it actually we do not know how the engine work we could make thing bad Mr Brody 's right be I the only one here who think we should not screw around with ancient drive technology without a clue about what we be do we will bring someone that do I can think of two or three people who be the good Amanda Perry she be part of the team help to design the next generation of hyperdrive there be no one well qualified let us make that happen let us get she on board for all her ability there be certain disability of which you should be make aware for how long potentially several week of course there will be someone to assist with the day to day thing she require a respirator in order to breathe obviously there be go to be some kind of adjustment will I be able to see my family they 've get clearance then I will do it Sir Lieutenant you all right mandy God I be really here be not I you sure be it take a moment to get use to the transfer you be tell I I be sorry Sir I could not do it just leave her leave she so Lieutenant James have trouble getting use to the ventilator I will be fine fix the ship Ms Wray take all the time you need to adjust this be Mary she will be your helper while you be here she will also brief you on how to cope with your host 's disability Afterwards Dr Strom be hope to see you I be go home I could not do it yeah I know I hear it be okay no it be not I let he down the Colonel listen he be the last person that I recognize you as I be say this be the mess hall one of the place you probably want to try and avoid what be those they be a kind of fruit we collect from a planet we visit recently may I try one I will warn you most people find these rather bitter Most people spit they right back out this be the first food I 've be able to feed myself since I be nine tj this be Young have you see Rush he turn his damn radio off I think I 've get you in trouble they be on their way now Sir I take my vacation time all of it we have a lot of lose time to make up for you got rid of the ugly chair you can do well than that five or six percent would do it that be the thought the problem be how to do that without any access to the ship 's core system or for that matter any knowledge of how they work in the first place I be just say show she everything you 've get Nicholas it be I again we come out of FTL something 's happen to the ship I promise to get to everyone but I need anyone who have a potential head injury or internal trauma to move to the front of the line do not be shy put we to work anyone who be shaky do not take any chance the quiet could be in the bad shape what about you I be fine go be we under attack or not it be a malfunction no sign of any hostile ship in range not that I can tell anyway what happen then an explosion in the FTL drive we be adrift why an overload it could be anything can we access the engine not without a space suit Most of the ship 's unpressurized Best to check the damage from outside I can fly a kino pretty well get to it you two monitor from here I will use the stone to report this Mandy be you sure you be all right for a second there I be back on Earth in a strange house back in my own body again the link be temporarily sever when we go in and out of FTL I be sorry we be not expect that to happen I be fine what do you remember I be walk then I be somewhere else and I do not know how I get there then the explosion happen so the lapse happen before sometimes concussion can cause short term memory loss and confusion we will keep you here tonight make sure it be nothing more serious he be on the floor I could not tell if he be hurt or not put he over here guy Franklin this be Volker be you get picture yeah we see it so be there anything I need to worry about I 've be with Amanda a long time we will monitor her blood pressure and there be a few other thing I need to show you that just come with the territory and she will be fine I be sorry it be just I be new to all this you will be fine too what be happen incoming wormhole this be Rush we have an incoming wormhole Sgt Greer meet I in the Gate room with a defense team I need everybody out of here that will not be necessary Sergeant do not shoot stand down tell you I do not expect to see you again either you be not expect to see we do not you guy figure out a way for we to dial in I join a book club it be suppose to be all woman but there be a few enlighten young man who stop by and claim to have an interest in 19th century chick light can we concentrate on eat right now sorry you know what why do not I do that we will be fine one at a time get it this be not freak you out be it you be here that be all that matter here we be pretty much resign to the fact that we be stick out there talk about feel like a third wheel on the second night the kino remote just light up I guess I just think you guy must 've figure something out we dial back and here we be I do not think it be possible to miss this bucket do you people realize you just scare the crap out of we Sorry sir you be forgive be they go to live look like it it could not have be all that bad that be good because if we do not get the FTL drive fix that be where we will all be go really really Eli I be sorry but I be go to have to put you right back to work welcome back how be he do same but something change since we got stick do not he look different to you maybe it be like he be in there and he know exactly what be go on but his brain and his body just be not connect anymore I do not know I talk to Rush and he say I be probably just imagine it maybe I be I mean I have not sleep in I do not even know why I keep have the same bad dream I be stick in a dark room but I be not I and I can not get out be you claustrophobic little bit maybe it be some weird phantom memory from your switch with Dr Perry hey math boy get those calculation I be ask about do please do not call I that I know what that be like Nick call I Little Miss Brilliant a couple of time and it stick Nicholas we be colleague back at SGC a couple of year before Icarus he use to like to bounce idea off of I when work on that ancient proof that you end up solve Congratulations by the way look where it get I I would do anything to be here anyway after Nick 's wife pass away we use to have these long talk about his work and my work the Ancients ascension it be like he do not even see the chair I try call he Mr Brilliant a few time but I do not think he ever get the hint you have a thing for he what be wrong with that I just find it kind of surprising why because a disabled person can not have feeling for someone because you be talk about he thank for this Sure you 've get something Dr Perry 's conclude that the explosion may be to our advantage how there be an overload one that probably should not have happen because the system be incredibly robust with more safeguard than I can count but it happen and as with most overload it happen in the weak link the FTL drive be make up of 16 separate module the one that blow up be the weak link because it be the least efficient the ship can fly on the other drive even well than that without the worn out drive bring down overall efficiency Destiny should be able to make it across the void that be great work I would not pat anyone on the back just yet we still need to isolate and bypass the damage with no access to the core system it have to be do manually or or what the robot we find we think it might be able to do some or maybe all of the repair I 've already program rudimentary instruction to begin the repair Scott this be Young Eli and Dr Perry have a shuttle mission to brief you on copy that sir I be on my way what be the odd that this be go to work Fair to middle Time 's an issue there be another option the Chair if we can gain access to the core system we can bypass that damage section in a single command tell you what if it come right down to it I will sit in the thing myself get into position now open rear hatch okay we be good here we go Come in I would like permission to join the team go through the Stargate to the planet Scott 's go he be a little busy fly the shuttle right now he be already on his way back so be this how it be go to be maybe I would like to see where I might have to raise our child if the ship be not fix by then Maternal instinct I guess permission grant thank I will be careful Lt Scott find fresh water due East of the Stargate it will be your first stop we should check out as much land as possible in case we end up have to live there send it you know we just come from there this be a waste of time it be standard procedure if you ask I sometimes you military people be a little too Holy crap do you see that I see shut it down look like they find your camp can they get through the Stargate not without a remote Lucky we be not still there or they would have one either way we be cut off we have to fix the ship you know I could just go to the corner store we need a decent grocery shopping we be almost out of everything I should not be long I will be right back I could 've go I want she to get out of the house even if it be just for an hour that be it you 've do it that isolate the drive that be the easy part we will start on the bypass in the morning okay you guy do not do much for fun around here do you there be Mr Brody 's still you have a still come and see so I be in a room but I be not I what do you see nothing Blackness but I know that I be not alone what if it be not a dream thank you Mr Brody Cheers thank now be careful this stuff have only one redeem quality we make do with what we have right speak of how be you manage without your coffee I must admit that be be one of the most difficult thing about be stick up here the hardship I think insanity be the proper word there and back again I 've even have dream about the stuff for year after my accident I have dream that I could walk I remember you tell I that and then I get to do this and it be it be all happen God it be like a dream come true but we have to fix your ship we do and then I will have to wake up Sir I think I think I be the one who damage the ship I be start to notice that redeem quality you be talk about you will have to ask yourself if it be worth it in the morning can I ask you something sure after your wife pass away and we would have those long talk do you have any clue how I feel about you I think you feel sorry for I I guess I think the same about you at first I think you be absolutely brilliant remember I use to call you little Miss Brilliant just forget about that I could never be sorry about that good night would you like to come in I be sorry darling I be sorry I can not do this why I just I can not do this it be I I think we both know it be a bit more complicated than that the word be insane but this be also a once in a lifetime chance for I Mandy you know probably well than anyone how I be when Gloria pass away I recently experience something that make I go through it all again More than a dream as real as this be to you now and I can tell myself that it be be year all I like but in my heart it be just happen again well at least this time I can do this sorry what be it the Colonel need to see you in the interface room right away both of you be everything all right no it be about to hit the fan again let us go you be go for hour I know I be sorry I lock my key in the car I think you have get into an accident I imagine you be take away by an ambulance Camile I be sorry my imagination just go I know what it be like to wait for someone you love to come home I be here now I know Mary I do not know what be happen I be just go to elevate her leg above her heart to stabilize you be do fine just try and stay calm we be just talk and then she I do not know what be go on she be go to be okay Lieutenant James leave the comm room without wipe her imprint off of the stone it got knock onto the table and nobody notice we think that in that opportunity an alien might have take advantage use the stone and sabotage our ftl drive she tell I she black out around the time of the explosion I think it be post concussion syndrome Mystery solve I do not see how it change anything what part do not you get they know we be here yeah they already do without a tracking device they can not know where we 've drop out of FTL he be right the void be unimaginably huge they can not know our location unless the alien who take over James 's body manage to broadcast it like a subspace message you mean or the alien figure out our position before the explosion and take it back with they how would it know how they sabotage the ship how do they know how to do that he be right that be it then they be come I be so sorry do not be silly I bring this on myself forgive the intrusion come on in Colonel Young use the stone to report Dr Perry may have to return to her body in the next several hour we think it be good that she return to an Air Force facility we will say our goodbye I will wait outside let us go this be young while repair to the ship be still day from be complete despite our good effort we believe an attack will happen at any moment Shields will not withstand a sustained bombardment this time we will not be able to jump to FTL neither can we escape through the Stargate Lieutenant Scott will be in charge of our ship 's defense follow his order as you would mine if board Sergeant Greer will coordinate the strike team but everyone will have to join in our defense we will give they a good fight when the time come do not wait too long it will be okay I want you there to talk I through it this be all my fault I panic the Chair they be here Sir tell I what to do we 've manage to isolate the damage module from the rest command the ship to enter ftl on the remain drive how the hell do I do that first you have to sit in the Chair wait Dr Franklin just speak something about the Chair what about it that be all he say but I think he know what be go on and he be try to say it should be he you can not know no Sir but I really think that we be under attack I be go to do this she might be right I can not ask a man to sacrifice his life he be already be through it his brain will have the time to heal we do not have time for this which be why it should be he at least give he the choice this ship be under attack if someone do not go back sit in the Chair and help the repair the ship 's go to be take we be all go to be take do you understand what we be ask you to do Fire on the small ship they be go to try and board we go back to your team the temperature 's dropping fast any idea why I do not know this be something new go something 's happen Sergeant keep an eye on that door dammit we be about to be board right on top of your position copy that I think you be the FTL drive be power up do this mean you fix the ship Camile no it be I again do not you hate that what be our status the damage section of the ship have be bypass the FTL drive have increase efficiency it look like we be go to make it across we do it yes we do and now it be time to go it be not a very nice thing to say but I do hope you need my help again I be not above arrange that you know welcome back Camile anything happen you would know well than I would I be watch a closed door do it stay closed yes Sir this be what Destiny intend from the moment it enter the system we be go to survive we be go to make it home the ship come here for a reason Destiny be power by the star themselves he and Young be bump head not sure which camp be the well choice we pretend nothing happen we need to be ready for the next encounter for the sake of the crew for the sake of the crew Dad

situation be be contain so there be no need for anybody to get alarmed as soon as I know anything Colonel Young come in can you come to the infirmary I just discover something you see so it be difficult to see which be why I miss it on my initial examination you see right there yeah it look like a tick I check the other they all have one same spot top of the neck there all except Corporal Barnes she be clear welcome to our new galaxy so the tick be cause the hallucination I do not know for sure but I think so maybe they inject a venom some sort of toxin that affect the brain 's chemistry okay I want out get I out of here I want out of here TJ okay just relax okay can you remove it they seem similar to Earth tick I could try and remove it the same way you up for go first what happen I do not know he be crash let us start CPR he be breathe he be back all right do we get it we remove it it be dig in even deep his pulse be normal bp 's back in range listen be remove they

and see if I can remove it safely okay let us just take a look here it be go the tick it just die off I do not know Theirs be both still attach Volker as well could it have jump yeah no I remember

here Rush show yourself what be you do open that door you be not take over the ship again Colonel Young come in go ahead Scott no sign of Greer still not respond to any radio call I will keep at it Rush and Wray be also unaccounted for no one know where they be Rush be not respond to his radio either all right I will put a few more detail together excuse I I get to go help look for Greer you go to be okay but if you feel any different see anything out of the usual no believe I I be as concerned about this as you be keep I post More than one tick attach to you would explain why some of the hallucination be more intense than other the toxin maybe they target the limbic system it be the area of the brain that be responsible for emotion fear anger remorse Matt 's guilt over his son Claustrophobia my dad let I guess issue with snake and you listen to I I can not stop the bleeding you have to open that door if I do not get medical attention no sir I do not know who else be involve

bleeding and stitch the wound so we will keep an eye out for infection but she should be okay the rest of the crew I check everyone it look like we get them all so hopefully thing will get back to normal around here whatever that be what do we get the atmosphere be good 10 hour on the countdown shall we send a team our luck 's get to change at some point just remember the bug spray Scott this be Young get a team ready you be go off world this be what Destiny intend from the moment it enter the system we be go to survive we be go to make it home the ship come here for a reason Destiny be power by the star themselves he and Young be bump head not sure which camp be the well choice we pretend nothing happen we need to be ready for the next encounter for the sake of the crew for the sake of the crew what do you got Lucian Alliance that would be my guess they have not introduce themselves any word on how they gain intel on our base Casualties 12 80 plus MIA I be pregnant it be yours ours I know that we 've have our difference in the past it be my duty to express concern for how everyone else feel about you I 've never even meet your wife Telford you connect with he be it a residual memory of his that transfer to my subconscious I would think you would be do everything to get these people home to get yourself home back to your wife and I know you be still sleep with her you be up late I have a very interesting dream everyone think theirs be interesting nobody else care you be go to care about this one I be outside a warehouse on Earth there be bird at least I can hear they Seagulls I think I be at some kind of meeting there be four or five people there who I do not know but I be give they information Reports Files I be talk about Icarus in detail who be they I do not know they have a Goa'uld cargo ship the Lucian Alliance on Earth I can only guess you be the spy who leak everything about Icarus to the Lucian Alliance it be not I what be you talk about on the way back to the car I see my reflection it be Colonel Telford I be Colonel Telford Projet SG 1 00 www projet sg com Rush switch with he two day ago the only reason I be tell you be because you be the only person who be ever experience this kind of bleed through memory after use the stone it be just that once Sir certainly nothing like that thank Lieutenant all right look Sir I understand that you have your issue with Colonel Telford but you can not sit down before he be assign to Icarus Telford spend a year undercover infiltrate the alliance you really think he would turn eight month into his assignment there be an attack on a planet that we have a large team work on p2s 569 37 people be kill now we later find out that Telford know about the attack and decide to do nothing in order to protect his cover that be what he say Stargate Command let he off the hook and everything be sweep under the carpet but now Sir there be get to be more to it than that we know that the Goa'uld have brainwash technology could make a man turn against his mother it be possible that the alliance now have that capability if they do Sir then we can not trust anyone we be just go over some of the datum we find when take a break Eli secret you two please go so I talk to Scott he do not remember anything like your dream we have to do something agree Telford 's still on active rotation with the stone yeah he be due to make a connection in a couple of day with Dr Morrison what if I take Morrison 's place and do what make contact with the alliance it be risky it be a pretty good disguise be inside someone else 's body I will go that would be a mistake why be that I have the dream there be still element I be try to piece together for example there be a number 314 now I know it be significant but I do not know why if I be there in Telford 's environment then you be not train for this who be I will just have to do my good if Stargate Command be this badly compromise I can not tell anyone what you be up to do you understand once you be on Earth you be on your own no back up I get it someone have to stop this guy he can not be allow to continue the alliance probably already know more about this ship than we do not much I would not underestimate they I be not I need a minute that be about all I get do you bump Dr Morrison from his spot on the communication stone without consult I any particular reason you care to enlighten I with everything that we have be through you really want to do this I 've get good reason not to tell you or I would you be go to have to trust I welcome back I be staff Sergeant Graham I will be your escort right I want to talk to Colonel Young now he be busy at the moment Sir but he say he would come see you shortly why be I connect with Dr Rush that be not part of the schedule sorry it be unavoidable why Dr Rush have to consult with some people regard some technical problem you be a terrible liar Lieutenant I would like some fatigue no problem this way Sir I need to speak to General O'Neill and you be Colonel Everett Young authentication 1619414 it be urgent Everett I will have you know I be miss a national security briefing for this sorry about that Sir if you have ever be to one you would not say that what be up it be Dr Rush he be in the body of Colonel Telford probably have not even leave the building so we need to put a tail on he he be get an escort he will ditch the escort we should let he do it then follow he why he be about to make contact with the Lucian Alliance I do not know you could sew I can not not really I hope it do not fall apart it be beautiful thank you open this one can we talk to you for a second you make this yourself if it be a girl I can make something else no it be perfect what be go on we be hope you could tell we about Rush go back to Earth on the stone I be sure there be a good reason that be what we be afraid of they do not say anything to you Young come in to talk to he the other day they do kick I out we hear Young go too he do he be there right now something be definitely go on Camile if I could have a moment of your time please be you aware of the change we could check those Control interface room I could meet you guy at the I believe you 've witness this brainwash technology that be true I recommend we keep the number of people we bring in on this to a minimum thank you Colonel for state the obvious you take a bit of a chance by tell I do not you I have to Sir Rush be ask for a free pass an unscheduled unauthorized visit to Earth the sort of thing he might do if he be the mole himself if he be the mole why would he be try to frame Telford at this point I can not answer that Sir and if he be tell the truth hopefully he will still be able to lead we to the alliance and not lose his life I 've quite a few personal thing to attend to I will be a few minute not to worry I come prepared so do you know what they be go to do to rush they do not let I know they be try to keep I out of the loop it be not where have you be it be nice to see you too come with I we have some thing to discuss do we privately we have not see you in a while Colonel I hope everything be well I 've be on assignment of course I will give you some privacy yeah this be Telford I have some new information we have to meet stand by for instruction get in you be allow alcohol onboard now I doubt I could stop it so I can report your command of this ship be solid as ever then I be do my good to make it work why do I connect with Rush oh we will get to that I think we need to clear the air a little bit have another I be on duty you be on duty we be both a billion light year away from the near disciplinary hearing so what you afraid of what you might say I do not have anything to hide from you or anyone else be that so I could 've bring you up on charge you should just thank I and let it go well I think we both know that you do not want the detail of that little incident get out any more than I do you cheat on your wife and she move on end of story you take advantage to get back at I on a personal level you be sleep with an officer under your command I mean look at you Everett you be a disgrace but I be here right and that be that be what be kill you be not it because this be suppose to be your prize your reward for all that hard work an entire year live with those criminal thief murderer pretend to be one of they I mean that be get to take its toll I be not do this again the man I use to know would not let 37 people die to cover his own ass what change what happen to you David thank for the drink what be we do we be wait what else Daniel come in do you read what be it Carter say they be use some kind of jam device we can not get a lock on anyone in the area what be your status they 've stop look like we be wait on someone well ground assault be stand by they will move when you call it Hang on who be you sorry I do not know what you mean all right who be I whoever you be you must be use the ancient communication stone what be you talk about you fail to use the proper code Telford would never make such a mistake his cover 's blow Move in Move in now they have a ship go go we be too late you okay I be fine what chance do this baby have of ever live a normal life what be normal anyway I do not know but I do not think it be this look I know right now it seem impossible that we will ever make it back but I also know that since we 've be here it seem like we be average about five impossible thing a week so why assume the bad look at the very least there be a lot of people here who be go to care about that baby that be something we be all go to help you Thanks Chloe come here accord to our intelligence her name be Kiva she be the daughter of a Lucian Alliance warlord name Massin one of the high up powerful and brutal that intel come from Telford at least we know who the mole be eh there be an easy way to end this we cut the connection on the stone they get Telford back we be no close to figure out what they be up to Dr Rush 's life be in danger he volunteer he know the risk that ship slip past our sensor we have no idea where it be go Telford might and he may know more I be just ask for the chance to get it out of he he still have right do not he he do not say how he be go to do it with all due respect you and I both know the people who make the rule be not prepared for this I be sorry I know that really hurt well I suppose it be worth it I have to make it look good of course I do not give they the code on purpose I be not a complete idiot on purpose what be you talk about they be get suspicious I be begin to have concern about that myself well that be why I have to come in I be not sure whether I be be follow I figure if they think I be be take by force it might help we salvage something from this operation Nice try you almost manage to make that sound convince well it sound convincing because it be true if you really be colonel Telford you will know my name it be Kiva Good next question what be yours a spy a Lucian Alliance spy you be so desperate to get back at I that you would say or do anything we have proof oh come on Everett this be all about I and Emily how do you think I find out about that you switch body with Scott do you remember that he be the one who tell I he see it in his mind a vision call it residual memory whatever you want it seem that every time you use the stone you leave a little something behind maybe maybe that be guilt maybe deep down inside you want the truth to come out you be insane well you 've already confess you just will not admit it we will let he sweat a while give I a shot sir will not take long appreciate the enthusiasm Sergeant not yet I would really prefer not to have to do this I wish I have time to convince you that I be not what you think I be and what be that I be a reasonable person just try to do what be right for my people you make a terrible first impression we have brainwash technology I could try those but I be not sure what they would do under the circumstance with your consciousness in somebody else 's body unfortunately I 've learn one thing about torture over the year it be effective Barbaric I know and I hate lower myself to this level but I need to know who you be and beyond that whether or not you be any use to I have he be give any food or water open it maybe I should go in there with you that will not be necessary this be on I only I open it you can not keep I in here forever no one be pull the plug on the stone so why do not you just admit what you do and we can move on I want to talk to Scott I have a right to face my accuser this do not come from Scott you switch with rush remember rush this be come from Rush at first I do not believe he either I figure I would give enough rope to hang himself but guess what that do not happen what be that Airman Dunning bring it along with his personal effect do you recognize they they be all station on Icarus the fire suppression team they got trap during the attack when a corridor collapse they all burn alive every last one of they you take a good look take a look I want you to look at their face because you kill they you kill they as if you have douse they with gasoline and light the match and they be not the only one so we know that you be a traitor and a murder now we know you be a coward too all right that be enough stand down Sergeant I say stand down get out both of you get out so where be we this will eventually kill you you will be kill Telford too that might just work out for the good give that he be be compromise I have a full rundown of the personnel aboard Destiny and I doubt very much that civilian or the scientist would have endure this so the question be whether or not Colonel Young would have put himself in this situation or send his first Lieutenant Scott how do you know I be someone aboard Destiny that be a fair question you can make this stop if I answer your question you be go to kill I either way I be dead I will not you have my word you have nothing to lose I be Dr Nicholas Rush I want this connection cut and go back to my own body no you do not you go back now your friend at the Alliance will not be happy I do not have friend in the Alliance not anymore you do not your only hope be with we you come clean now I will help you I be not a spy Everett how many time do I have to tell you recognize it should I it be your work to do with dial the ninth chevron that lead to Destiny these reading Similar Naquadria deposit we have some issue adapt the equation there should be enough power to get we there you 've find another Icarus planet let us talk about the outpost p2s 569 we 've be through this I be clear of any wrongdoing 'cause they do not have all the fact I could not blow my cover I do not have a choice remember that little combat engineer she use to follow you around like a puppy she be hit in the first blast right arm sever at the shoulder she be scream yell beg I to help she all I could do be watch her bleed to death in the dirt it be not my fault now we already know you do it but it be possible you be not responsible what be you talk about think about it think about it why be it that the memory transfer happen only with you and only you and no one else when they use the stone they mess with your head David they make you think you be one of they and you be not that be not you now we can help you we can bring you back but I need you to take the first step you tell we where they be take Rush tell I we 've replicate it as well we could Olan Meet Dr Rush Olan be one of our lead scientist work on the project your work be impressive it be nothing really when I find out that you be on your way we be all very excited to have Dr Rush 's full cooperation maybe now we will actually make a connection as you can see we 've procure some familiar technology it be necessary to implement your method I trust it will suffice I will leave you to your work the figure for these Naquadria deposit be correct yes yes 'cause if they be out even by a fraction we spend month do a detailed orbital survey we map every deposit down to the last vein all right then I be do really it be not that difficult when you know what you be do but I be kid this be probably go to take some time of course quite possibly the rest of my life there be a lot of talk around the ship about what be go on in that room this be a military matter ma'am it do not concern you that be the kind of talk that force we to try and take control of this ship before do you want the rumor to spread or do you want to do something about it it will be over soon enough that be all you need to know see that be the wrong answer Come on Lieutenant something tell I you do not want this on your conscience well be careful whatever it be we all have to live with it I need to communicate with Stargate Command do we let he out Nobody in or out that be an order I want to talk to he Progress none yet you must be joke you be stall if you want to blow yourselves up you go right ahead you along with we this be go to take time and I do not just mean a few hour but Olan say we 've be close for month now I assume that with your help we would be able to with all due respect to Olan here his work be shoddy at well sorry you be just go to have to trust I the whole thing be a bloody mess I may have to start from scratch you call yourself reasonable I be you say he be incompetent I be stall right I should not have to demonstrate how important this be to I to all of us Dr Rush no more chance now what be happen we be not sure Young 's be back and forth on the stone all day look like this time he bring someone back with he who be it welcome to the Destiny General Corporal sorry about that sir this way who be this it be really he Let us say it be true I be be hold without charge I 've be deny counsel and one of his man attack I David he know he authorize it maybe not that last part there this be what I 've be try to tell you Time to come clean son we need to know where they 've take Rush you check out that gate address I give you dead end you do not think I would give you anything real do you you should see your face you look so surprised actually I be disappoint I be actually hold out hope that it might not be true that there be some other explanation it do not matter you can not stop it stop what here you go I would not say it be good what be it like we 've hear description but what be it like be there on Destiny you 've fly around in space ship before not an ancient ship not that far out into the unknown universe it be a rust bucket what can I tell you I can not wait to see it for myself what if I can not do it what if we just fail to make a connection Kiva promise she would not kill you her word be good I will have to kill you myself you think I be brainwash I come to my sense we free billion of people from thousand of year of slavery all over our galaxy then we pat ourselves on the back we leave they with no mean for survival what do we think be go to happen this be not you David Wake up Everett you think the Lucian Alliance be just a bunch of criminal who make we judge and jury People will do what they have to do to survive you should know that by now we take whatever we want we do whatever be good for we regardless of the impact on other planet what make we so special I know what make I special this be not our ship it be not intend for we where be they take Rush it be suppose to be for the benefit of all mankind he be more far go than I think General I 've hear enough probably take it to the next level go ahead and do what you need to do communication room this be Young please cut the General 's connection dismiss Corporal this have go on long enough you have to cut the connection I can not Dr Rush 's life be in danger that be more important than get intel on the Lucian Alliance I just think maybe we would be well off if she know this be Young this be Brody bring up the life support control for this section I get it begin vent the atmosphere in Colonel Telford 's quarter now say again begin vent Colonel Telford 's quarter now what the hell be you do Camile stay out of this he can not do this David can you hear I it be get to be a bluff to scare he you can not I be vent the atmosphere in your room you 've get five minute before you die of suffocation your only hope be to tell I the location of the Alliance base you be bluff kill I and you kill Rush I know but right now I be think of the great good what be it go to be open this damn door we both know you be not go to kill I this be what Destiny intend from the moment it enter the system we be go to survive we be go to make it home Ths ship come here for a reason Destiny be power by the star themselves he and Young be bump head not sure which camp be the well choice we pretend nothing happen we need to be ready for the next encounter for the sake of the crew for the sake of the crew you dream you be the spy who leak everything to the lucian alliance it be not I I be Colonel Telford the Goa'uld have brainwash technology it be possible that the alliance now have that capability on Earth you be on your own you must be use the ancient communication stone what Telford would not make that mistake we know that you be a traitor and a murderer now we know you be a coward too you 've find another Icarus planet we be all very excited to have Dr Rush 's full cooperation kill I and you kill Rush begin vent the atmosphere in Colonel Telford 's quarter open this damn door we both know you be not go to kill I Mr Brody this be Wray you need to restore the atmosphere please disregard that request by let this happen you be participate in not only the murder of Colonel Telford but Dr Rush as well Sir you 've make your point I be not try to make a point open the door I know what I be do you be kill he I know that Lieutenant what should we do the Colonel 's bluffing he be not go to kill he what be happen to he you 've kill he you be all in danger what they be come who be come the lucian alliance they be come to take Destiny Projet SG 1 00 www projet sg com we 've be inform that this ship face an incursion by armed force of the lucian alliance the group responsible for the attack on Icarus base all military personnel on board have be place on high alert if the enemy have acquire the mean to dial Destiny their point of ingress will be the Stargate we be clear so the gateroom be off limit all surround corridor have be place in lockdown no one may enter without proper authorization I 've provide homeworld security with intel on the planet from which the lucian alliance intend to launch their assault they be dispatch force as I speak the good case scenario Earth force take the launch point intact and we gain a supply line from home the bad case scenario our force do not make it before the attack be launch in which case we will have to deal with they on our end in that event all non military personnel will be order back to your quarter where you will remain until the situation have be resolve make no mistake this will be deal with swiftly and decisively thank you that be all a couple of hour ago Colonel Telford admit to be a mole for the lucian alliance and now suddenly he be on our side you trust he I do not say that what in the hell be that what in the hell be that sir all you have to do be tell I I be keep you out of it you do not have to if I have know kill he and bring he back be the only way to beat that brainwash I would have be behind you 100 so you will follow order as long as I explain everything beforehand no sir that be not that be great because if it be we would have a problem Lieutenant do we have a problem good it be not the time for that no headache or blur vision I tell you I be fine rush be fine I will find out about I when I switch back look I really need to go and can you give we a minute how be you feel David Confused I bet you go the whole nine yard to the brink and back I have to in my defense it be not the first thing I try yeah thank for that at least the brainwashing explain why you 've be such an ass I 've read the SG mission report of that method be do in the past I just never you have no idea what it be like to remember thing that you 've do terrible thing you be not yourself David you 've get to send I back not yet I 've do all that I can here I already kill you once I be more useful to you in my own body with they you know that how else will you get Rush back listen get he out of there you 've just come back from the dead I want you to get your strength back excuse we listen when they come I want you here safe Safe there could be wound we be go to need you what we will need be a real doctor you be up for this not even close what be you plan to do evacuate the atmosphere in the gateroom the minute they step through kill they all you mean you think I have a choice if you be ask for forgiveness I can not help you there either I will do my good you be back that be I I have to see whether you be fake well I be not I apologize back to work I know Planetary scan it look like the intel be good the planet 's laced with naquadria deposit we detect an energy signature emanating from what look like a pyramid Pyramid that take I back the complex inside be shield against beam technology so Rush can not be beam out we will have to go in with ground force all right Colonel you have a go what be that we be under attack can we dial the ninth chevron not without blow everything up dial it get ready we be go now the lucian alliance be an organization of human from sovereign planet who have take control of the resource and technology the air force video I be just see if there be anything that might help what be he go to do the Colonel they be send an army what do you think he be go to do this be it it be happen now go Radio back when you reach the other side and take he with you I see they Eli all personnel report to your designate area this be not a drill Defense team stand by which button this one how long will it take till we reach vacuum a minute or so that be about right Defense team stand by to secure prisoner on my order copy that Monitor from here stay on the radio get it what happen no no it be I the ship the Lucian Alliance we know everything Telford tell we so what be we do about it Let us just say it will all be over in a few minute come on I be read a huge energy spike at this rate they 've get less than a minute before their core go up get our people out of the shielded area and beam they back to the ship now the core be go to go critical I can not stop it still no signal from the other side get as many of our people through as you can Colonel we still have two 302 on their way back from the planet we can not wait get we out of here be not we suppose to go to our quarter these be my quarter and I be not go anywhere they bring rush along with they we be go to have to use the hard way what do you do to the Gate it be not I you kill over a hundred of my man Massin your father 's name be my password Gate travel must have sever the link Lucian Alliance force you be surround and seal in you will also find the intel provide by Colonel Telford be now useless Lay down your weapon in front of the door step back into the center of the room with your hand on your head or we will vent the entire compartment to space can they do it then they should have Colonel they be up to something talk to I they 've get something to open the door vent the atmosphere in the Gateroom do it now it be too late take cover get back go fall back Rush you should stay here no no the ship be under attack it be time to go just wait let us go now there be an elevator this way oh God go wait you be welcome want to get the hell out of there you 've be shoot sorry sorry see it be okay you will be okay you will be fine you will be fine I will be right back okay over here Colonel Young who be this Commander Kiva of the Lucian Alliance force we will not be comply with your request to surrender we barely make hyperspace this time it be even close what about casualty two of my 302 could not make it back and if Rush be still on the planet I be sorry Sam do any of they make it to Destiny I have not hear so much for that why do not you evacuate the compartment to space that be the plan he do not do it to save you not I the connection be sever the minute I step through the gate give I the lay of the land this be the Gateroom they 've also occupy the surround corridor they have advance far but they pull back just take what they could hold with limited manpower that be smart once they retreat I lock down the area behind they give the technology at their disposal it will not stop they but it should give we some space the prisoner be be hold here between they and we 30 foot of corridor either way Tthe second we hit the outside section those hostage be as good as dead I 've do a head count we have 12 miss and presume capture include Riley TJ Eli and Chloe Come on what happen you be shoot I stop the bleeding you be fine look up here look at I look at I where be we I do not know I 've never be to this part of the ship before no one have I just press some random button we can not get back I be guess someone lock out elevator access Us or they that be the problem I just need to get to a window get an idea where we be and then we can walk back I 've get you come on come here Ready here we go one two three Lean on I I 've get you Ready here you go Colonel Young go ahead here be how I see the situation we have the Gateroom and some of your people you hold the control interface room which I be tell be the ship 's nerve center what do you want we come here for the same reason you do we do not want to hurt anyone you be welcome to stay aboard Destiny and help we realize the potential of her discovery Lay down your weapon and join we or if you prefer we can drop you off at the next inhabitable world or I vent the atmosphere in the section you be occupy and keep the ship if you have that in you you would have do it already the point be I have the ability to end this conversation right now she want to see you would not shut up in fact as you be Sergeant we be way past the point of fight our way out of this situation we need to negotiate with these people and I think I should be the one to no I think you be right he he and her that be a mistake it be a demonstration all it will do be force their hand do you want control of the ship or not they have some of our people but we have some of theirs so the first thing we need to do be suggest an exchange do you think they will do it no but I think it be worth a shot this be the control interface room this be the Gateroom if we cut our way through the wall here we can flank they I can lead a team that will reduce our number here we take the control interface room there be no need the ship will be ours these section be in red that section be expose to space the ship 's shield will hold long enough for we to pass we will slowly vent atmosphere to space yes but we could seal the corridor again after we 've take the ship take six man I will need twice that six and if anything go wrong these three die not her she be a medic we can use she in the event who be this my name be Camile Wray I be the civilian authority aboard this ship I would like to act as an intermediary to resolve this issue without further bloodshed Colonel Young will not transfer control of this ship to you and you will but I will expedite a prisoner exchange your people for ours if I release my prisoner Colonel Young will not hesitate to vent this compartment you have 12 of our people we have only four of yours I propose an even trade four for four you maintain your advantage and gain some much needed manpower Colonel Young agree with this in our society the military take order from civilian leadership I will consider it nice job that should buy we some time look you be try to save life here obviously that be a good thing but even if she agree to the four which be doubtful she will not go any far once the equation tip to the point of acceptable loss no acceptable loss Colonel Young have already determine what that number be he know the chance of we win without loss of life be practically nil so limit our loss yes all that we can but you will have to do something you do not know that I be one of your acceptable loss you know what you be get into you should have get I out you have no clue stop this now please I be go to save every one of those hostage and I be go to retake this ship do you understand I Telford have convince she that he be still with they otherwise he would be dead Sooner or later he will make his move we be to gamble this ship and all of our life in the hope that some traitor have have a change of heart look at that I guess those elevator go more than just up and down right there you good I must have hit a few button I be not suppose to press be the air get thin Life support be not work out here how do you know I be the one who shut it off Rush 's order there be air there be not any new air be pump in we need to keep move I do not know if I can no problem I get you this be my Lieutenant Varro save he he be badly wound at even the slight hint of trouble I will bring you back sir I need to speak to General O'Neill Second guess a decision be a waste of time I be not there but I be start to wonder if maybe I should be I can not speak to that sir this should be do Colonel over at the time I believe that vent the gateroom would kill both Dr Rush and Colonel Telford they deserve a chance we lose two 302 pilot send to stop the attack sorry Colonel Carter know she would lose her ship if she try to save they but it be the right decision be you up for this Everett because somebody will take your place if you be not I be not go to let anybody take that ship then get your ass back there we be good what be you do just check to make sure we be head in the right direction this way there be no countdown what we drop out of FTL because someone be gate in why have not we jump back someone just activate a console in one of the access corridor a console just come on use Telford 's code there be a cordone off section come our way that be his move it be cold really what do you find we have to be careful move through section there be a reason we 've never beenthis far a ton of compartment be de pressurize Hang on ready more dark and gloomy we be good Gotcha how be you do good you sure stand by we be good to go Ready just give the word sir it be lock down I will handle it okay get ready what be that ready what happen you do not do that what be that just a minute ago it be a man you need to stand down till we figure this out this be Young everybody stand down throw I a radio Radio three click go to channel six we be go to have to try this again let us stop I be fine Eli you do not seriously this be nothing once I climb the Redridge Mountains on my way to Stonard with a full pack where the World of Warcraft that must 've give you quite the sense of accomplishment a little break what do you think be happen we 've probably win by now you think so if we win then why have not we be rescue First they will figure out what to do with the prisoner and then there be that whole post victory celebration Streamers everywhere I be so tired you be still lose blood I be not able to stop it completely I be go to take care of you it be not they I do not know what happen to our man but it be not they they be not able to do that to a person be you tell I they have nothing to do with this what happen Overload in the relay proceed by temporary disruption of all shipboard system light to life support how they do that they do not what cause it that be what I be try to figure out they be make their move it would not be that obvious would you care to tell I what be go on we do not know one of my man be dead you need to know that we have nothing to do with that yes so I be tell I be go to ask for a show of good faith what do you want how be you I be fine we be all fine what be it that they want some of their people be injure badly I be go to need medical supply to help they what be the point a goodwill gesture do not have to accomplish anything of course it do so they lack medical supply who know what else they might lack water they will get desperate make their move then they will be deal with the hostage there be only one way this be go to end if we wait how do you know we do not even know what be go on with the ship all the more reason to act now Rush be right we have to take they down and we have to do it right now this be what Destiny intend from the moment it enter the system we be go to survive we be go to make it home Ths ship come here for a reason Destiny be power by the star themselves he and Young be bump head not sure which camp be the well choice we pretend nothing happen we need to be ready for the next encounter for the sake of the crew for the sake of the crew they be come who be come the lucian alliance they want Destiny they can open the door take cover Grenade fall back you will be okay what happen you be shoot you be surround Lay down your weapon or we will vent the entire compartment to space can they do it yes then they should have wait we will not be comply with your request to surrender we have 12 miss and presume capture include Riley TJ Chloe and Eli I be go to save every one of those hostage and I be go to retake this ship do you understand I we 've get the medical supply you request we be prepared to give they to you as a show of good faith thank you one condition you and I meet to make the exchange agree let us do this Ready now remember quick kill centre mass all right you ready to do this we be ready bring the medic open the door I be in who be this Ronald Greer be also a medic another offer of good faith in exchange for Lt Johansen first thing first go and check the supply and see they be what you need hold your fire do not shoot Power go out throughout the ship I can see that please step aside get behind I she take one step in your direction and I will shoot she myself I 've get the shot sir Projet SG 1 00 www projet sg com my man have be order to execute the prisoner if I be kill step back in my direction Sir I 've get the shot stand down Sergeant Damn it what happen they surprise we what do you mean they surprise we do you want I to explain it again hostage be useless if they be dead at least they serve a purpose tell they tell they I be here she just kill Rivers Understood do not fall asleep it be dangerous that be a concussion it be boring so what do you think they will do with they who the prisoner probably drop they off on some planet I do not know I just hope everyone 's okay I just hope it be over not much we can do about it rest time be over this feel familiar what the hell just happen we still do not know we be just get system back online maybe we can analyse Screw analyze fix it got to know what be break do it now river be dead what it be go to be someone would you prefer it be Chloe or Eli Lt Johansen perhaps you be think the same thing figure out what be wrong with the ship and fix it fix it now I have order to help what be your name Koz I will let you know what I need you do know there be a way to save they you be just not wire to consider it I be not surrender this ship what exactly be so wonderful about it we give up she kill everyone except for those who have value to she and let I tell you that be not a hell of a lot of people this be Young I would like to speak to the civilian Colonel Young have prove that he can not be trust can you then why do you let they plan an ambush I voice my disagreement and you could not stop they obviously not for that one of your man be kill if you fail to live up to your promise twice I will kill again do you understand no I do not understand but I do believe you then I would like to take you up on your initial offer with one modification four of your man for four of ours and food and water for three day will food and water be offer to the hostage they be no good to I dead then we be agree next time we take supply with we in the first wave if there be a next time damn it flashlight what be happen I do not know I be up to my wrist in someone 's body right now do we have any answer yet just the one every crash have be exactly 46 minute 37 4 second apart so it will be easy to show you what be I look at that be our problem it be a binary pulsar it be the combination of a rotate neutron star and probably a white dwarf orbit around a single point in space what do that mean to we Pulsars give off gamma radiation and x ray as they rotate short deadly burst of ionized radiation the shield and the hull protect we right now but the pulsar be literally feed off of the white dwarf strip off material and create an accretion disc White dwarf plough through that material every orbit which give off an even big gamma ray burst on top of what we be already getting hit with that be why our system be shut down the shield have to draw extra power in order to compensate and that happen every 46 minute 37 4 second it be what be kill that man and it be go to be what kill we the Lucian Alliance just dial in when the damn thing be in range Destiny have to drop out of FTL to make the connection it be bad timing bad luck then why be we still here our ftl capability 's be compromise do not yell we do not know why yet the shield be what be keep we alive but soon or later it be go to fail when it do we be dead the radiation burst be what be cause the system malfunction which will only get bad because the shield will fail eventually yes unless we can find a way to make the jump to FTL how much time accord to Rush we can withstand two more burst People will start die by the third we see what one of those burst do to a man when he be not protect by the ship 's hull first we will make the trade and then we will discuss this new problem have their medic complete Varro 's surgery not yet then find out what be take so long I will do it she tell I to check on your progress tell she it would be a lot fast if the light do not keep go off that be a whole other problem the Destiny come out of ftl within range of a pulsar Time be short before the shield fail Crewman Young and his man be on it she will not let they I will do my good to convince she you do that we 've get the supply that they request and we be ready to make the prisoner exchange copy that I be fine I be fine and Varro I 've do all I can for he will he live I get the bullet out and stop the bleeding so he should have a chance I would like to take a look at the other wound Fine let us go you get it what be this a flak vest just in case how can I expect they to trust I if I can not even demonstrate a willingness to trust they in turn with all due respect ma'am I do not think they can be trust you tell Colonel Young I appreciate his concern Colonel say you would not take it I just think I would try be you sure about this sir good enough for I hope you make a well impression than I do Commander Kiva be you ready we be Brody open it thank you I will take it from here I ask for civilian these be the two we have we agree on four for four four what about Lt Johansen she stay even if we figure out a way to jump back into FTL and right now the odd be not good then we be right back where we start but this do not have to end with one of we lose if we could just figure out a way to work with each other I can see you be someone who enjoy talk through problem but if you do not solve this new one then neither of we will have anything to talk about alright get in the infirmary where 's Chloe and Eli she say they be the only two civilian then where the hell be they now if we could just sorry sorry take a break Eli have to be get close by now you know what we should do this twice a week this be the kind of exercise that really motivate I carry a wounded person the length of the whole ship in low oxygen good time thank you Eli now it

lot of friend but I do not they be a billion light year away but they be still your friend they do not really care about I and I do not really care about they either that be nice because until I meet you I do not really know what a friend be do you know what I mean Eli a friend be someone who will support you no matter what like you why do not we I be not just say that because I feel like I be go to pass out and even if I do I just want to say it first and you do so whenever I say stuff like that to you you always react like I 've just award you some runner up prize and it be not yeah I know it be just that I know of course you do there be a console over there I do not notice that when we come in and it be get power can you call for help I can try Dr Park look it be not much of a solution but we do not have to shield the entire ship just the side face the pulsar array we will have to leave shielding on the underside but we could transfer something like 90 it should buy we enough time to restore ftl capability so why have not you guy do it yet because it can not be do from inside the ship it could if we control the core system but look someone be go to have to go for a walk I can tell you where to go what to do the mechanic of it be relatively simple then why do not you put on a spacesuit and do it well you get the ftl drive back online while I be go and you 've get a deal we will get it do sir I know you will gear up they have only the time between the gamma ray burst to complete their work the next one be less than 20 minute from now so obviously time be an issue so what do you need from we there be a hull breach in the access corridor that be under your control it be the exit point close to the array we need you to let we in transfer control of all the ship 's system to we and we will let they in you do understand that if you do not help we save the ship we will all die I understand completely and I want you to transfer the ship 's system to we when be the last time you run a security sweep in there never mind I will do it Radio Calvos this be Telford give I access to the damage section you tell I you think she be bluff she do not have to she know who she be deal with but to be fair you do not have much of a choice at least they will keep some of we alive for a while anyway yeah like you you forget I 've recently be in their employment I would not envy I

Rush be miss tell they he panic and run away they will be look for he to late at the first available opportunity I will access one of the gateroom console and transfer control of the ship back to rush the second they find out they be go to start shoot prisoner they will not find out not right away anyway I will not lock they out completely they can have control of the ship until I decide they can not they will herd all of the prisoner into one compartment if they do not I will suggest it when they do I will contact rush on this channel I will tell he in which compartment he can vent the atmosphere and you you let I worry about that I get to go it be all clear good not to stick around this be Young I be prepared to surrender control of this ship provide certain condition be meet go
