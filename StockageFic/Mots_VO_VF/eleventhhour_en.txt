blood twice for every variation on Digitalis Negative all the way be you sure twice good teacher in school well we will check that out thank you that be Lizzie Summers Sam Tewsbury order more heart medication from she but he do not pick it up she be be call he all day no answer Mr Tewsbury Mr Tewsbury Sam Mr Tewsbury he be dead thus Spake Zarathustra do not touch it what be it Foxglove somebody go to a lot of time and a lot of patience into stick these page together with it how be sticky page go to kill somebody well it depend how you read but if you lick your finger to turn the page you will probably end up ingest the poison that way Catherine De Medici 16th century France she use this method to kill most of her enemy I need to see everything the victim be wear or carry at the time of their death I be go to call this in I will get right on it thank you Nietzsche someone around here be kill off the weak Clearing a path for the Ubermensch the Over Man Rachel I be go to need some buff tail bumblebee in the bathroom here you go why be we in the bathroom Hood 'cause we want a clean environment with no pollen distraction if there be foxglove on any of the victim ' possession it be go to be the first thing our little friend be go to be attract to here we go I think I will wait out on the porch if you all do not mind yeah that be a lot of bee here be your glove oh thank you Put your helmet on there they go they be go right for the foxglove in the victim ' belonging tote container asthma inhaler lunch box and Freddy St John 's bicycle Foxglove be on all the victim ' belonging so now we know what cause their heart attack Digitalis purpurea do not show in any of the autopsy why I want to do dna test on all the victim and their parent but do not have the hospital lab do it get your boy at Quantico to take care of it okay sweetie Bye DNA result get this accord to the blood sample this hospital give Quantico none of the dead boy be relate to their parent that be ridiculous I 've know those family for a long time see most of they get bring home from the hospital I be with the sheriff somebody must 've switch the blood sample no hold on hold on what have you find accord to these dna marker all the blood must come from one pubescent boy maybe the school be the source of our death not the environment a student do you have a plan more like a hypothesis Care to let I in on it trust I do he actually know what he be do Most of the time all right settle down settle down everybody pay attention up here settle down all right all ready for you thank you I be Jacob Hood I be a scientist and I work with the uh FBI now uh I meet your math teacher Sam Tewsbury before he die as you know Sam he give his life to this school before he die he ask I to come up with a math problem for you as a sort of challenge he say some of you be get too smart for he even though he be not here I would like to give you a chance to solve my problem for he oh and the winner get a genuine pair of FBI handcuff pay attention good so the first stage F of a rocket burn 25 second long than the second stage which we will call S now if the total burning time for both stage be 145 second s each stage burn Anybody anyone no okay tell you what I will do I will leave this on the board till tomorrow we will just have to wait and see what you can do thank you very much back to you it be purple Stephen but it be not foxglove actually it be a dye from a japanese indigo just a little taste of your own medicine except this plant will not kill you we need to talk about why you kill your classmate Stephen he do not kill those little bastard I do Mom Shut up Stephen Mrs Brown please step back I kill they I have access to the toxicology lab at the hospital I use Stephen 's blood I switch the sample every one of those kid be nothing but trouble they have my son drink beer get high your mom be try to protect you Stephen she obviously love you very much but we know though she would not be able to whip up Digitalis from foxglove plant you could 've though could not you incidentally uh the deputy they find your um chemistry kit it be cover in foxglove no it be not his it be mine no stop Mrs Brown the serial number on the lab equipment be from the school for God 's sake he be only 11 year old he be all I have leave do you understand that stop it Mom you should not get in trouble for what I do I have to kill they they be hold I back they be hold the whole school back the whole school be suffer because of those stupid kid because of how bad our overall grade and test score be even some of the teacher be leave for other school Somebody have to do something why Sam Tewsbury I see Mr Tewsbury in the classroom I hear he question the kid I be certain he suspect a kid be behind all the death it be only a matter of time before he figure everything out he be a smart man almost as smart as I so you send he Nietzsche 's book my mom 's copy actually it be her code to live by what do not kill I make I strong you take quite a risk lick the toad venom why to blend in with the other throw suspicion off myself you draw your own blood switch the sample and you make your mom believe you be terrify of needle I make she believe a lot of thing when be it go to end when someone be smart enough to stop I I guess do you know that the comic book Superman be actually base on Nietzsche 's philosophy up up and away how would you like to be the court appoint psychiatrist whose full time job be observe little Stephen Brown for a decade or two I can think of bad thing to do for a day so Hood what be you like as an 11 year old boy I be kind of like Stephen I guess I want to compete with the good but it be hard to know how good you be if you kill off the competition well I for one be relieve that you use that brain of your for good thank you maybe I just never got catch ææàãðü×öä»×é×÷æ · http Www Ragbear Com » ¶ ó­ ¼Ó Èë help please we be in here help please it be my mom my dad and my brother I get the kid seize Diaphoretic I do not know what happen be they go to be okay what be wrong Paralysis I will go back for the traction board there be no time the kid just stop breathe he be cyanotic we get to tube he you have to help they please both breathing Come on now son we be lose he Dr Hood I be Wallace Bennett Chief of the Major Investigations Division I be head the Go Team on this case I put in a call to the FBI director to thank he for send you over here on such short notice my people have be over operation structure power plant system and human performance but so far we 've get nothing we also do a full battery of chemical testing for explosive residue result negative across the board we keep mine the same datum but there be something we be miss here and I over and over over and over Dr Hood we need something Dr Hood Dr Hood do you hear a word I just say ice cream excuse I do you have ice cream and a hot plate Vanilla Dr Hood what the hell be this all about the landing gear on this aircraft be directly adjacent to the engine right that be where they tend to put it so after a long flight it be go to get very hot so you bring my entire investigation to a halt just to tell my people that engine get hot on the night the plane crash the temperature on the ground be minus 20 Celsius that be way below freeze thermal shock fracture yup we test the hydraulic in the landing gear for extreme but not for rapid temperature change I do not suppose the NTSB could help I get a new watch I will give you my damn Rolex oh that will not be necessary Dr Hood 's employer at the FBI be perfectly capable of reimburse he for any expense and or personal item damage during the course of an investigation Mr Bennett this be Special Agent Rachel Young my um I be his FBI handler and we 've get somewhere else to be Sir a family in San Jose California eat breakfast approximately 36 hour ago and and they 've be paralyze ever since EMT have bring they in as a triple case of spinal trauma but we rule that out right away we do a tox screen for botulism and Lyme disease spinal tap for meningitis Negative on all count it have to be poisoning of some kind Wrinkle be the daughter eat the same breakfast as the rest of the family continue to be asymptomatic be you Jacob Hood with the Bureau he be and you be I be Agent Morris FDA this be my colleague Agent Wilson with the CDC we both request you thank for come in so quickly hear about your work on the hantavirus case last March I would like to hear about your work here early today we screen and catalogue the stomach content on all three victim plus the asymptomatic daughter no toxin or bacteria know to lead to paralysis the CDC 's primary objective be to keep this thing from spread while we at the FDA be mainly concern with the safety of the food chain but frankly we be stump where be the daughter Emily Stanner 16 year old she be in with the police right now they think she do this well they do not know what to think but you know there be a case in New Jersey a couple of year back a teenage kid put antifreeze in his parent ' iced tea turn out he be piss off about be ground listen Emily the truth be lot of kid get angry at their parent look if your folk be mistreat you or abuse you mentally emotionally even physically it could count in your favor tell I the truth about everything you know and it could go a long way towards help you out in court later excuse I uh but we be busy here if you do not mind huh I do mind you should not be in the same room with this patient not without adequate protection what do you mean protection she be carry type 5 C vector airborne virus it be highly contagious no known cure really no one mention this to you it be okay as long as you 've have no physical contact it should be fine do not go anywhere I be go to look into this do not worry there be no such thing as a type 5 c vector I say that to scare they off so I could talk to you in private my name 's Jacob Hood I be kind of the science guy for the FBI my family be they go to be okay be the same thing go to happen to I I do not know that be what I be here to find out the police they think that I do not do anything to my mom my dad or my little brother I know you do yeah the forensic pathologist they 've be over your house with a fine toothed comb to find anything that would 've cause your family 's paralysis so if you be a poisoner you be a very good one and I 've see your high school transcript and Chemistry well you fail it twice so I do not think you be too much of a threat what I want to know be be there anything you can remember that you do differently from your family yesterday morning anything at all no all we do be eat breakfast just breakfast we 've already get forensic want to tell I again why we be here any idea Rachel how many seemingly innocuous household ingredient could actually kill you air freshener smell good key ingredient formaldehyde could cause headache nausea nosebleed dizziness memory loss Margarine what be poisonous about margarine the benzoic acid fatally so if you be allergic to it you know the use of the term nontoxic be only for advertising it have no regulate governmental definition whatsoever well nothing in here look all that dangerous be that as it may we 've get a sample size of four subject three who eat breakfast and get sick and one who eat the same breakfast and do not get sick make that a sample size of five look like they have a dog hey Eddie hey Mom hey son bring the mail up how about a cold one do not mind if I do you go to stay for supper sound like a plan what be in the mail oh relax Mom it be just bill and junk we get it Bob all right notification of full payment we do it babe we sure do Eddie we pay off the farm we need to celebrate Huh forget the beer we be open the champagne tonight that be an idea you know about a year ago we be a hair 's breath away from lose the place now it be ours free and clear and we have you to thank for that let us go get some champagne come on one of the nice thing about dog be that they be omnivore just like we human so Trixie probably just have a little bit of everything the Stanners do Poor Trixie so why be not the Stanners dead because dog metabolize toxin much fast than we do look single mass go down the digestive tract into the stomach or up out of the stomach as the case may be what be it Fungus help please I need help emily your family 's body have be uh colonize by a fungal organism kind of like a mold that be grow inside of they and normally the doctor would give they an anti fungal medication that kill the fungus and allow they to get well but you try that and it do not work well Mmm in this case um even though we have kill the the fungus the paralysis be still progress so we be try to find out why that be I do not have any other family you have to fix they this be our fungus take a look it be beautiful Botrytis cinerea it be everywhere there be probably spore of it in the air we be breathe right now do not worry it only uh grow on plant that be why it be on the food inside the dog but not actually on the dog 's tissue itself so Trixie eat whatever the family eat mm hmm and we know the family eat plant material fruit and vegetable but we do not know which fruit and or vegetable be contaminate there be our conundrum in its natural state botrytis cinerea be completely harmless to human from the look of that speciman I would say it be be genetically modify and it be not harmless anymore care to explain why we be hunt a deadly fungus in a wine shop because some winemaker use genetically modify fungus in their product and Coppertina Vineyards be one of the world 's lead maker of botrytized wine once upon a time in Medieval France there be a nobleman who like to oversee every aspect of the winemaking in his domain Control freak exactly until one summer he fall in love so he take the fair maiden to his bedchamber they pretty much stay there they could not wait any long so in desperation they pick the mold grape off the vine and make wine out of what be leave and and it be delicious so they name this fungus our little fella botrytis cinerea or noble rot after the nobleman whose great love have unwittingly create such ambrosia but botrytize wine making be a gamble with nature one too many day of rain or sun and the whole harvest be worthless so why would the winemaker take that risk why because this bottle of Coppertina 's botrytize vintage be 1 500 the only problem with your botrytis theory be that the Stanners do not have wine for breakfast so how do they get sick a fungus 's spore kind of work like um this little fella any organism that reproduce by spread itself over the large area possible you would be a fool to think that just 'cause you put it on one crop that be where it be go to stay so the fungus could be anywhere what be wrong with his eye Hood Keratomycosis it be an infection of the cornea cause by overexposure to a mycological organism English please there be a fungus among we and I bet it be on these grape Hey Todo el mundo a trabajar can not you read this area be for employee only we we just want to take a picture it be our first vacation oh will you take it for we no okay you want to see the field you can pay for the tour in the taste room intend of course yes thank you come on honey well good news bad news Botrytis cinerea on the grape have be genetically alter but it be not the same strain that paralyze the Stanner family the nucleotide sequence be wrong which mean we be back to square one you do not seem particularly bother by this well just because the fungus trail 's go cold do not mean the money trail be not still hot I call in a favor at Quantico we will have Coppertina 's full financial record no later than tomorrow do not you need a subpoena to look into a privately hold company 's financial record get to love the Patriot Act Damn it Matty Hey Liz be I in time for dessert oh Matty you can not leave your toy oh my God Palo Alto lawyer Sam Sheridan return home hope to enjoy a family dinner but find tragedy wait instead his wife and two child now in critical condition at Maple Valley hospital now authority have yet to release an official statement on the cause of the incident but symptom be say to match those of a local family who become paralyzed early in the week also follow a meal thank for that report Laura we will let you know of any further development regard this very strange case of possible food contamination we will be right back Eddie I want some of that oh sorry Mom I think you guy be do this thing be spread Hood uh huh okay look we know that it be a fungus we know that it have to be on some kind of produce so why not just get the FDA to issue a mass recall on all fruit and vegetable sell in the affected area 'cause it be never go to happen let us be conservative and posit that our fungus be reside on some form of produce within only a 500 mile radius of the Stanner family okay California agriculture be what 32 billion dollar industry about 40 000 square mile in the state be farmland so if the FDA be to recall just the produce from our area that be a loss of 2 5 billion I get that it be a long shot but once people figure out that something 's wrong then they will probably issue some kind of voluntary recall they issue warning and guideline all the time but people do not listen anymore like the boy who cry wolf the answer have get to be here somewhere it be not in there Hood it be in here it look as though Coppertina Vineyards transfer 10 million to another company about five year ago do you want to know what happen next enlighten I their profit start to skyrocket the company they pay be Aeonium Agritech Mr Cooper the FBI flag a transfer of fund between Aeonium and Coppertina Vineyards a couple year back can you tell we what they spend the 10 million on I be afraid I can not get into any of that without our legal counsel present I understand Mr Cooper but well I will get into it for you it be a botrytis fungus it be genetically alter and now a variant of it be paralyze people less than 40 mile from here you must know Dr Hood that uh anyone involve in fungal biotech use botrytis as their base organism it be common it be nontoxic relatively simple to manipulate uh any one of our corporate colleague could have make what you be look for I know what you and your corporate colleague tend to do be you push a little hard a little bit fast you do not really do scientific due diligence so uh in the past decade you 've introduce genetically modify product into the market without anything close to the kind of rigorous long term testing necessary to guarantee public safety and now life be at stake so you think we be move forward too fast you want to talk about uh life at stake see our product increase yield so that farmer can produce more food for people to eat why do not you ask the million of people on the verge of starvation in Bangladesh Niger Egypt why do not you ask they if we be move forward too fast see you want humanity to keep its food all natural and that be very poetic but human being can not eat poetry without genetic modification most of the Third World will starve to death within a few month and the rest of we we will not be far behind your altruism be an example to we all do that apply to the price you charge the starve nation or do Aeonium offer some kind of Third World starvation discount just curious any more question you be go to need a warrant I think we still have those in this country do not we you know if you let I do my job I could actually help you Jason Cooper be everything that be wrong with global agribusiness Greed masquerade beneath a thin veneer of lofty idealism which be why you do not confront he head on you stroke he finesse he get he to drop his guard and then you pounce okay I be sorry I apologize but we need answer this be not the only place we be go to find they I think this be a public university it be welcome to the brave new world of academia buy and pay for by multi billion dollar corporation these company finance the university 's lab and the scientist who work in they they pay million of dollar in sponsorship and in return they get to keep all discovery the university make so all of Aeonium 's research be here what be they do Recording spectra from deep in the ultraviolet region of the electromagnetic spectrum through the visible region into the near infrared no really what be they do may I you get the wrong maximum absorbency wavelength for pnitrophenol the machine should be at 410 not 418 I know that oh who be uh who be be uh work with botrytis fungus oh that be uh that be Professor Altschuler Botrytis have be his thing ever since he be an undergrad at Cal Tech look good who be his underwriter Aeonium well we be here with the FBI and uh I would kind of like to talk to Professor Altschuler yeah sure I mean if you can find he what do you mean he be MIA he have not be into work all week and he be not return his phone call either not go to get tenure slack off like that no Mr Cooper Karl Altschuler be here I tell he you be busy but this be why we stop this be what we think could happen I read that Calm down Karl I will not calm down People be die because you restart the project against my explicit recommendation and I follow your recommendation and I shut that research down my name be all over this research Jason this be not connect it be in the record it just can not be it be and you know it be very careful Karl you have a career to think about and if you start tell everybody that Aeonium be involve in this well an accusation be just as good as a guilty verdict in this day and age and it be just as dangerous too for you for all of we for all of we Karl Karl Altschuler last swipe his credit card here Patriot Act again you be lucky I be not tempt to abuse my power this should be it Professor Altschuler Professor Altschuler it be the FBI let us try this he be dead Drug overdose I will call the police Fascinating that be get the thicken tail of the Androctonus crassicauda but the size and color of the Leiurus quinquestriatus but it be a scorpion yeah it be a scorpion but it be no species I 've ever see before I expect a geneticist of Altschuler 's caliber would be more than able to engineer a hybrid so what be you a bug expert too it be not a bug it be an arachnid and no I be no expert someone very close to I be um involve in an experimental brain cancer treatment that use scorpion venom it be your wife right I I know she die of cancer two year ago yeah it be quite a promising treatment actually but um unfortunately not quite on time I be sorry Hood this be not drug relate this be an overdose of scorpion venom the thing about scorpion be they do not go for human they go for insect that be it it be a pesticide what oh my God it be brilliant scorpion venom be make to paralyze insect if Altschuler could take the botrytis fungus and combine it with the scorpion venom he would have a totally organic pesticide to spray on the produce to kill insect with the venom and that be what have be paralyze our victim no bite mark or sting and nobody be go to be check for scorpion venom because the only deadly scorpion native to the U S be in the Arizona desert what I do not understand be why the venom be release in our victim when it be only suppose to attack insect or why it affect everyone in the Stanner family except for Emily we 've get the bullet but we do not have the trigger no but we have something else poor bastard he be try to atone for the mess he make but to make enough antibody to produce a scorpion antivenin he would have to endure sting after ste let us just hope the dose that kill he be enough to turn his blood into a cure Dr Richards have the hospital toxicologist work on synthesize an antivenin from Altschuler 's blood we will just have to wait and see you hungry no I be fine Hood you should eat something you call that eat I know the sweet tooth you could 've just ask this be it this be the trigger my candy you know what be in this Licoricey goodness insect Carmine it be a red food color make from a south american beetle I be suddenly in the mood for some fresh produce have you have breakfast yet Mr Cooper Strawberries maybe Rachel what do the Stanners have for breakfast corn flake pancakes fruit salad grapefruit juice pink grapefruit juice make with carmine and the fruit salad probably contain fungus from your pesticide the Sheridan family oh the Sheridan family they eat any number of fruit and vegetable for dinner finish with red velvet cake carmine red it be a synergy effect see the fungus it attack the insect protein it do not know they 've already be eat by a human so the fungus be the loaded gun and the food color contain the insect protein be the trigger around two year and several million dollar into the project we decide that the end product be not viable anymore you see when we feed our test animal food which be dust with the uh pesticide see most of they be fine except for one which be paralyze I mean we do everything by the book you know for a phase three trial the test sample size genetic line everything and I think it be just some kind of anomaly but Altschuler of course he be obsess so he he do a culture of the dead animal 's body run all kind of test and and that be when he discover the fatal synergy we stop the project before it go any further we send what be leave to a biowaste disposal facility and that be that until now you should have contact the authority the minute you suspect something if those people die it be negligent homicide no uh you get to believe I here I have all the paperwork on file uh all of our waste go to a federally licensed disposal facility just east of here it be a 45 minute drive all right all right nice and easy two three five eight seven zero one this one check out where be the rest that be it Ground radar confirm we get ten tank of pesticide there should be 14 we be go to have to question all these worker anyone whose have access to the disposal field in the past 12 month Hood car where be the four miss canister of Aeonium pesticide People be go to die tell I o okay okay I I give they to my dad I just want to help he out a little that be all and it do Rachel Sir Put the can down you get away my boy call I and tell I to burn the field that be exactly what I be do People be sick because you put Aeonium pesticide in your crop you put the life of every person who ate produce from your farm at serious risk by burn your field there be a very good chance you be go to spread whatever organism make those people sick to the neighboring farm you see those field over there Monsanto you see these field over here crop all the way to the base of those mountain that be Dole when my father 's father settle this land it be small family farm for as far as the eye could see now we be the only one leave Drop it now last year we almost lose this place yeah when we plant the new crop my boy call I and he say Dad he say I get something that we can put on the crop that will really make a difference so we put it on there we use it yes sir now I know where it come from it work so good I didn question it well maybe you should have that be the state police it be over sir well I will uh I will I will go with you I be sorry about what we do I be real sorry Mom Dad this be Dr Hood he be the only one that believe I be not try to poison you guy thank you oh do not mention it I be just glad the scorpion antivenin work but Emily still need to see a chemistry tutor we be lucky Fungus tend to mutate really quickly Sooner or later there would be a hardy strain and way more people would 've be at risk Guess I be go to have to look at my food label more closely from now on uh natural coloring so you be say that be just bug huh maybe maybe not accord to the FDA as long as it be natural it could be anything green food color on the other hand be a petroleum derive triphenylmethane nothing natural about it yummy ÆÆÀÃÐÜÀÖÔ ° ÇãÇé·îÏ× ±¾×öä»½ö¹ © Ñ§Ï ° ½»á÷£¬ñï½ûóãóúéìòµóãí¾ be you all right you need to get out of

free nobody tell you this be a charity concert well it can not be that charitable if they force you to sit through the damn thing cheer to that Cheers I be Jacob Hi Elizabeth Pleasure to meet you so what do you do I be special science advisor to the FBI how intriguing Job description would be well scientific advancement have greatly benefit humanity but if those advancement be abuse could be very dangerous my job be to make sure that never happen and what kind of science crime do you like to handle Jacob Kind of classified what about your phone number that classify too Hood we have some place to be let I give you my card Duty call I always want to say that sorry to interrupt the FBI be hold two seat on a flight that leave in half an hour so what be this about Rachel okay Teresa Kimsey she be 16 go missing July 7 suddenly show up August 9 Unharmed Physically Benjamin Gonzales 15 disappear August 11 reappear September 8 and Reggie Leinhart 17 missing September 10 back October 15 when the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children detect the pattern they contact the FBI well the approximate age be the same Duration of abduction be roughly a month that be not what they be focus on or why they want you involve all of the child be severely autistic at least they be when they be abduct be now they be exhibit symptom of savant syndrome from mentally challenge to mentally gift in the space of a month that be extraordinary http Www Ragbear Com µúê ® ò»ð¡ê± µúò»¼¾ µú4¼¯ ææàãðü×öä»×é ê±¼äöá£ºâ¬ ±ó when they find Reggie Leinhart he would carve 657 square in the side of an 18 wheeler with a screwdriver Perfect quadrilateral Benjamin Gonzales 's mother find she recently abduct son frantically build that which mean these must be Teresa Kimsey 's I find it hard to believe that these child be diagnose with Heller 's syndrome it be a relatively rare form of ASD Autism spectrum disorder I have a cousin who be autistic but he have a mild form so what be you say about Heller 's syndrome well it be one of the most severe a child can be develop normally and then sometime between the age of two and four they start to regress they lose skill that they 've already develop like uh language motor skill some of they even stop communicate altogether Savantism be an even more uncommon condition where a developmental disability coexist with an extreme ability in other area like mathematic or art yeah I never understand how that work well okay um wait look wait that be mine this be an ordinary person 's brain by ordinary you mean incredibly charming and full of personality ordinary people organize they sort thing they make connection it be call logic now this um what be you do be the brain Hood of an autistic person you see although type and degree of autism vary widely across the spectrum most of they have trouble with connection the ability to organize that I be talk about now Hood this be the brain of a savant it be the ability to focus on one thing to the exclusion of everything else now if you have nothing but toothpaste in your suitcase what would happen you would know a hell of a lot about toothpaste exactly you know everything there be to know about toothpaste you would be a toothpaste expert the question be how do a severely autistic otherwise ordinary person become a savant inside of a month what happen to these child and why well we will start with Teresa Kimsey she be our first victim with the thick case file and next time use your own luggage I do not know the FBI have a science division they do not they have a Science and Technology branch deal with all manner of intelligence gathering and criminal investigation and then there be I be this Teresa yes she be two when that picture be take she be such a funny baby always smile about six month later she just stop no more smile no more hug sometimes she would look at I like she do not know who I be before we go in I should warn you usually Teresa do not like visitor she can get anxious and upset but then she have not exactly be herself lately would not even go near a color book before she go miss hi Teresa now I can not get she to stop draw Mmm and not that I want to Mrs Kimsey would you mind if we speak to Teresa for a few minute well actually you see Teresa do not really talk oh it be okay she do not need to there be a 13 year old girl with autism at Syracuse a few year ago she never speak certainly do not think she could read or write and when they give she a computer keyboard she type out the word I love Mom so Teresa 's preferred method would appear to be draw Hiya this be I sort of I like science that be an atom this be Rachel she like to beat up bad people hey and this be you can you show I what happen to you when you go away you be sleep be you sleep you be be very helpful Teresa thank you what be that some kind of tube be that a tunnel be you in a tunnel where have they take you honey be that a be she in an MRI machine be you in a machine you see these be uh these be surface coil they increase the magnetic sensitivity and these Rachel can I have the sidewalk picture please these be dti Diffusion Tensor Imaging DTI be a specific type of MRI that track the movement of water through the brain Teresa you be draw what be inside your head but the last time she have an MRI be when she be but five year old where well the Autism Institute of Chicago we be meet with the chief administrator Catherine Bonatelli both kidnap victim Benjamin Gonzales and Reggie Leinhart have mri take here they be also five year old at the time that be get to mean something right mean we be get close I do not understand why be these child be take that be what we be try to find out well I want you to know that the Institute will do whatever we can to help thank you Rachel do you have the picture of Benjamin 's sculpture these be take of Teresa over ten year ago I hope they still pertain to your investigation Miss Bonatelli we will also need to see the scan for Benjamin Gonzales and Reggie Leinhart excuse I do you mind if I take over for a second oh sure these scan be almost exactly the same even if these patient have the same type of autism it do not mean their scan would be this close brain pattern be as unique as fingerprint you have so many kid with the same distinct brain pattern I be go to need to see all the dti you 've take here oh I be sorry but we 've confidentiality issue without express permission from every patient involve or a court order our facility be be take dti since ' 94 we be talk thousand of patient and if any one of those match the three we just find they be in real danger of be abduct so the soon we get start the well Hood Yep I think I 've get one Scott Butler he do not have Heller 's syndrome like the other three victim but his scan be also take when he be five he be 18 now and they be almost identical to the other yeah that be a match if these mri be take over ten year ago then it be not these mri that the kid be remember be it no I do not think it be I be go to try Scott 's contact number yeah Voice mail full we will need to go check on he hold on I find another one Cameron Stewart five year old when he have the scan do now he be 16 let us give it a try hello hello be this Mrs Stewart yes who be this hi I be Jacob Hood I be I be with the FBI be your son home please hello do the police call you no be he all right then how do you know Cameron go miss from school this morning all right now we have to be real quiet okay do not want to upset our new friend Cameron hello Cameron you be go to be very comfortable here I promise Missing Persons Unit be at Cameron Stewart 's residence get a full report Dr Hood and I find four more potential victim be they account for yeah they be all account for place undercover unit at each one of their house 24 hour protection Mr Butler Scott Butler Scott Scott Hood look at all of his mail there be at least a month 's worth he be already be take Rachel Taken and return Clear look like he live alone well that explain why no one report you miss Scott Scott we be with the FBI do you mind if I if I just make a recording of that Scott would you mind stop play for a moment I would like to ask you some question Scott be you all right he be bleed get an ambulance Code Eight Ambulance need at 146841st Street you hear that what Music the same note same as what full sentence Hood hear that now listen same note Scott 's phrase use the same note as a common anesthesia machine you do not need one of those to get an MRI I do not think someone be take picture of his brain I think they open it up I do not think he be the only one either look at the back wall it be a clean room filter you do not need one of those to get an MRI either you only need they for operation Time of death be 3 47 p m 'cause of death rapid blood loss due to a trauma to the carotid artery Cause of trauma yet to be determine perhaps I can help with that I be sorry who be you FBI I be Dr Jacob Hood if you do not mind I would like to take a look at the body what be this about what be you look for a scar would you mind if I uh what kind of scar can I borrow a nasal probe right here thank you this should just take a second okay I get it there be the scar have you take x ray yet Cameron Cameron Cameron the operation be do through an incision in the gum and then you walk the bone up to the pituitary gland it be a new kind of brain surgery that do not leave any visible scar wait you be say someone secretly perform brain surgery on this boy without consent that be exactly what I be say Dr Fisher someone try to alter Scott 's brain neuron by surgically implant some kind of microfilament that sound risky the brain be highly prone to infection or you can nip the carotid artery during the procedure and the clot would not hold one sneeze would dislodge the clot and you would bleed to death which be exactly what happen to Scott Hood Teresa and the other two boy could be walk around with these wire inside their head Cameron Stewart could be undergo the same procedure as we speak we need to go can you check the wire for serial number when you do the autopsy please no problem do not send I somewhere else please this be the third place that I 've be to in this hospital now where be he where be Scotty I want to see he I just I want to see my son you be Mr Butler do you know something about what be happen to Scotty what be happen to my son it be a month a month the most he would ever go without call I back be two week I should 've fly out to check on he why do not I fly out it be not your fault yeah yeah it be I never should have let he move away he have no business live by himself how long be he on his own I live with he the first six month to make the transition he be high function in term of his autism he have be on his own about a year now he only want to be normal what do I do I promise you Mr Butler it be nothing you do whoever take Scott would have do it whether he be with you or not still no answer at Teresa 's I hope she be all right what be up with this damn traffic you okay I be fine I just I just keep think about Cameron Stewart out there somewhere who would do this Hood Put kid through this what would their motive be well some people believe that autism specifically savantism be like some sort of clumsy step forward on the evolutionary path to the ultimate potential of the human mind and if someone could figure out how to recreate what give they certain advanced ability while prevent the disability then you can significantly advance human intelligence how do stick wire in somebody 's brain do that by force the neuron to find alternate path to their destination those alternate path could be well path I will try her cell no Miss Young hi Dr Hood hi Teresa look who be here she speak yesterday she say thank Mom do we have any ice cream and where be Bob who be Bob our dog oh Mrs Kimsey um we would like to take Teresa to the hospital why what be it she need an x ray no no she be not go anywhere Mrs Kimsey Teresa might have be um subject to an experimental neural implant her health could be at risk but Teresa 's never be well look at her I mean she be talk not a lot but she be talk she call I Mom for the first time in 16 year do you know what that be like no I do not and that horrible month no uh uh no I do not want to lose she again of course you do not Mrs Kimsey but this be happen to other teenager too just like Teresa one die yesterday another be take from his home Kidnapped his name 's Cameron and he be 16 also you see the more we know about what happen to Teresa the well chance we have to find he I be sorry she be not go with you yes I be Cameron 's go he must be hide I search his room he be scared it be not unusual for they to find refuge in extremely confine space I look everywhere he be go you okay back there Hood you be awfully quiet it be nice but I be start to worry there be probably only 50 or 60 doctor in the Midwest capable of this kind of surgery maybe we should just visit they all and see if Teresa recognize anybody you can not just go around confront upstande member of the medical community without probable cause why not I have to go to the bathroom Cameron Cameron Cameron Teresa you okay come on Teresa you be scare I what be go on Teresa you okay Hood you be draw again well I suppose it be still her dominant form of communication Teresa what be this look like a pattern it be definitely some kind of sequence I wonder what Synesthesia or actually a specific kind of synesthesia call grapheme okay back up and start with the first word I do not understand um many people with savant syndrome experience something call synesthesia where one sensory experience trigger an overpower response in another like um every time you hear a door slam you get a taste of mint in your mouth or vice versa okay and grapheme well it be the most common type where letter or number be perceive as inherently uh color or texture so like an a could be red that be right okay so she could be write a name yeah or a place Teresa do you mind if I borrow one of these seven letter or or number could be a phone number it be hard to see what you be do with all the graffiti Teresa Graffiti no that be it she be not write around the graffiti she be use it if she be intentionally incorporate it we can use it as a key that be brilliant okay okay Teresa so the first color in your sequence be yellow what be yellow I get a four here that be yellow there be yellow scribble over a four over there too uh huh okay Red 's next these two os be red it be not a phone number it be a license plate I have to be honest with you the very idea that you be consider I some kind of suspect be well incredibly insult not to mention absurd this be your license plate number be not it Miss Bonatelli and you get it from a girl who have a severe case of Heller 's syndrome it may be a simple coincidence or she may actually remember it from her early visit to the facility when she be five do you have any idea how long we 've be do research on autism here do you over two decade and we still do not know what cause it right now one out of every 150 child have autism that mean one and a half million in America alone and it be grow which mean we will have four million in one decade the research have to continue what happen to Scott Butler be not research it be murder if that be the case I certainly hope you capture whoever be responsible for all this I can not believe we just let she go we do not have any proof proof it be obvious Law be like biology Hood you can not just decide something 's true you got to dig up some dirt find a few nasty little microorganism to prove your point good use of a scientific analogy Rachel hey speak of dig up dirt I just get a text my friend at the Bureau who be run a background check for I it seem Miss Bonatelli do some consulting work for a company that be a cover a cover for who the CIA you be not easy to find Mr Whittier mean I be fairly good at my job Agent Young mean you be too I may say must have friend in high place what we have be a dead 19 year old boy and a 16 year old who be miss as we speak Somebody 's operate on autistic child without their consent Catherine Bonatelli do some consulting work for you in ' 05 I be assume it involve her work at the Autism Institute of Chicago if this person in question do do some contract work for we those record would be part of our HCS Human Control System but HCS info be accessible on a need to know basis only well unless the health and well be of innocent teenager mean nothing to you we need to know right now if the person in question this Catherine Bonatelli do contract work in ' 05 it would have involve an interest in a common trait of autism superior memory we would have use she as an easy access route for information statistic possible test subject never get that far People realize that it would be decade before we get anywhere useful on this not to mention the potential for a public relation disaster of epic proportion so if this theoretical pilot study ever do exist it be shut down so basically you be tell we nothing if someone be do what you say to these child I would like to help the Agency would like to help so prove it when it come to pass sensitive information the trick be to make sure that you do not leave behind physical evidence of any kind note on paper phone record voice recording that kind of thing the good way to leak be simply lean forward and whisper in another person 's ear what what do he say Catherine Bonatelli 's code cell phone number we can use it to trace her movement stay here I be go to go check this out Rachel Rachel be you okay I be okay I be okay but Miss Bonatelli be not Building be rent in Miss Bonatelli 's name do you think she be our mad scientist no no she do not even go to med school Brain surgery 's not the kind of thing you learn on the internet no matter what they say probably be not her idea to blow herself up either it be pretty clear there be someone else Bonatelli provide the test subject base on the dti from the Institute but I do not think she know the medical detail of what be go on or how far they would go to cover their track no we 've go over the whole site she be definitely the only casualty Cameron Cameron Cameron what do you find he be nearby they be not just do the surgery in this building they be hold they in here too so where be Cameron if he be still alive they 've move he somewhere hey Hood or maybe he escape I need an immediate door to door search for a special need 16 year old name Cameron Stewart yes ma'am have you see this boy in this place no you be welcome to look around if you want we will not be long take your time Rachel he be here be you sure we have no other choice be you really go to do this at the hospital there be nowhere else leave I can not believe we do that at the lab to Catherine we have to stop it be too risky do not think about the risk think about the reward now what we 've get one clue leave it be not here what do you mean it be not here how do you lose a brain well the brain be here but the wire they be in a specimen cup okay who have access to this area Hospital staff cleaning crew I be sorry somebody must have make a mistake it be not a mistake the wire be go for the same reason they blow up the building whoever be behind this be getting rid of the evidence I need to find out what the wire be make of the compound could tell we where it be make and right now we have nothing no no we do have something or more specifically someone you be do great Teresa just remain still and thank you for help we you be very brave the composite of the wire in Teresa 's brain be primarily platinum as in wedding band as in nerve stimulator they be like small defibrillator that be surgically implant in the chest to shock the vagus nerve and prevent epileptic seizure if somebody be dismantle they to make neuroconductor they be go to need more than a few we need to find out what local hospital be order an abundance of these thing hold on those miss wire it be not easy to swipe something from a hospital morgue without clearance you be right our doctor must have privilege at this hospital I have eight doctor who requisition nerve stimulator in the last year no Hang on Seven Hmm that be strange why it be okay it be just the stimulator usually go through the thoracic department but I 've get 25 of they assign to a surgeon in neurology what why would a brain surgeon be implant nerve stimulator what be the surgeon 's name Dr Edward Fisher the doctor who try to save Scott Butler I will have Chicago PD pick he up do you have his address do not need one he be upstairs schedule for surgery about 15 minute ago nobody move put that down slowly Dr Fisher and step back from the table you do not understand you do not know what I be do then tell we what be you do try to save my son your son Noah he be four diagnose with Heller 's syndrome a year ago he be autistic so you be try to fix he find some kind of cure who be you to say he need fix just 'cause someone 's mind work atypically do not mean they can not experience happiness or thrive on their own term in fact one of those atypical people help we find you Dr Fisher you remember your patient Teresa Kimsey I be so close to a breakthrough I can not stop now you do not understand I understand you can not conduct deadly experiment on other people ' kid to save your own Noah deserve a normal life I have to finish now get any close to that boy 's head and I will put a bullet in yours why be Fisher work on teenager when Noah 's only four our brain stop mature around 15 or 16 if you operate any young there would be no way of tell if the change be due to the operation or simple maturation of the brain poor kid let us hope he have more family if they be anything like Mom and Dad maybe not any news on Noah I wonder if he have an aunt an uncle actually I 've file for a friend of the court brief for adoption not for I I love kid I be a big fan but all that travel we do along with all the scientific crime and crisis then who Mr Butler Scott 's dad he have the experience and uh I do not know it seem like a good idea what that be very thoughtful Hood Sensitive what scientist can not be sensitive she have not speak in a week now I understand why they have to remove the wire but I miss she she be still in there we be go to start therapy at the Son Rise Institute in Massachusetts next week Teresa we want to thank you for your help now we would not have find the bad doctor if it have not be for you you be an amazing girl ææàãðü×öä»×é×÷æ · http Www Ragbear Com » ¶ ó­ ¼Ó Èë hey Ned we be go to hit the pierogi stand you come I get to call home first uh order I a potato and cheese and no skimping on the sour cream get it hello Cath it be I tell I you get it last dancing robot in Pittsburgh I have to wrestle it away from a hockey mom those chick be tough we be go to have one very happy birthday boy just do not be late for his party I will be there I swear Put he on okay I want to say hi Johnny Daddy 's on the phone hey Dad happy birthday champ you excite uh huh this be go to be the good birthday ever Lot of pressure on Mom and Dad to keep top ourselves but we will give it a shot what do you say yeah Buddy you there Johnny help I help I Ow Damn it Rachel Young Walsh what be it be three year a at least I have not see you since Quantico well what be you do here you be look at the new Special Agent in Charge of the WMD directorate I be now one of the mover and shaker in the world of nuclear non proliferation sound exciting so where have you end up finally land that spot you want at Counter Terrorism not exactly I land at the Office of the Director Top of the food chain Impressive actually I be I be more of a handler for someone at the top of the food chain but our our case be unique well like what give I a taste uh be be you familiar with the parameter of electroporation neural implant how about porphyria enzyme de hey I get to run ficiency syndrome gentleman it be great see you Rachel yeah we should grab a drink sometime do some more catch up yeah what oversight at bio waste facility now I admit it be not very sexy sorry to interrupt Dr Hood you have an urgent call from the pennsylvanian State Health Department some guy name Rigdon Pittsburgh emt respond to a demolition worker find in advanced respiratory distress with multiple organ failure and other anomalous complication anomalous complication Ones that suggest he may well have be expose to a highly toxic substance one not commonly see right now authority have it categorize as a possible public health concern how serious a concern it be hard to say till we get the specific but it be definitely something he eat or drink something absorb through the skin something airborne good case scenario it be an isolated incident one victim one quickly identifiable cause and the bad case scenario Suffice to say really really bad so tell I about your old buddy Calvert Rigdon Cal spend the last eight year head up the Pennsylvania Health Department before that he run the National Center for Preparedness Detection and Control of infectious Diseases at the CDC and before that he be fight typhu and yellow fever in Angola and Sierra Leone pretty impressive actually his most impressive contribution be when he introduce I to my wife whoa whoa this be a restricted area do not shoot we be the good guy I be Dr Hood Special Science Advisor to the FBI Jacob hey cal Afraid you be go to need these Victim 's name be Christopher Fisher a member of the demolition clean up crew find he this morning at around 10 00 he be dead by 11 00 what be this place Native Americans use to bury their dead here for century early settler at Fort Pitt do the same when the city expand in the 19th century it be bury under new construction the demo team rediscover it while clear debris from the old foundation Personnel log say Fisher be a licensed mortician yeah bring in to oversee the proper handling of all human remain how long have he be here 48 hour top so whatever we be deal with be aggressive and fast initial contact to full blown disease follow by death in a matter of day that be the good news take a close look oh that be incredible it be behave like a hemorrhagic fever exactly that sound really bad well only if you categorize extensive bleeding into the skin mucous membrane and gastrointestinal tract follow by heart failure pulmonary edema and an agonizingly painful death as bad definitely bad what be you think well if we be knee deep in the Congo rain forest I would posit Shigellosis Marburg virus even Ebola but Pittsburgh do not have the same exotic palette it have to be something else like maybe a cave full of ancient disease riddled corpse Rachel you may just have something I be sort of kid no I do not mean about the corpse no biological contagium could survive 200 year without subzero suspension but the cave itself now that be a different story you be say the cave be sick radiation poisoning here how be that possible in 1984 a worker at the Limerick nuclear power plant right here in Pennsylvania test positive for nuclear exposure but the source be not the power plant it be his own basement where he have be expose to very high level of radon gas seep from the natural rock foundation the real hazard come when radon break down when inhale the particle get trap in the lung and flood the body with toxic alpha radiation well any one of Fisher 's coworker could become symptomatic we need to initiate HazMat protocol start look for air and rock core sample now what be go on somebody tell we what be go on I be go to go introduce myself to the officer in charge get a list of all the quarantine worker top priority what be go on my people be calibrate the radon sensor right now if that cave be contaminate we should have confirmation within the hour let us hope it be radiation at least we will know what we be deal with Media just what we need oh great the only thing that spread fast than a legitimate health crisis be the panic about one what be the plan for deal with the medium well lie of course I be go to let they know about the emergency preparedness drill we 've be run Dr Hood radiation level look normal do you believe this can they even do this be this even legal I get to get home ha they can not just keep we here all day Radon sniffer detect only minute trace of the gas in the burial cave but not nearly enough to explain rapid onset radiation sickness Jacob do you hear what I say we be back to square one deeply embed pustule sharply raise and round in shape extensive blister most notably on palm and sol of foot Confluent rash on face and forearm individually those symptomatic manifestation point to any number of culprit but collectively they only point to one Smallpox Smallpox I think that be wipe out the World Health Organization declare the disease eradicate in 1979 but there be still stock of the virus the CDC in Atlanta and the uh State Research Center for Virology and Biotechnology in Koltsovo Russia how have it end up in Pittsburgh I do not know the demolition worker be go to have to be inoculate along with any law enforcement and first responder who have have direct physical contact that include the three of we be that enough to protect we well unique strain have uh unpredictable resilience the vaccine have be enhance with intranasal boost that should protect we from anything airborne but direct contact with infect fluid must be avoid word to live by I be go to notify the hospital it be a waste of time there be not a medical facility within a hundred mile equip to deal with this level of biorisk Hemorrhagic smallpox be the most deadly variation of the virus it be highly infectious and efficiently lethal so what do we do we improvise Yo man over here you get it right behind you double the magnification my God the test be conclusive we get ourselves a smallpox outbreak a full diagnostic panel 's go to take time but preliminary mapping indicate genetic material from multiple genome a hybrid two virus mix together well the toxin that kill Fisher be a combination of two distinct viral strain we have to find the source well the cave be clean wherever Fisher contract the virus it be not here with every minute that pass the likelihood of it spread have additional victim become infect multiplie exponentially it be imperative that we determine exactly where Fisher catch this virus before this thing spiral into a full blow epidemic Landlord confirm our first victim have rent here for the last five year keep a lookout for calcify scab and flake of skin I always do Christopher Fisher Christopher Fisher Christopher Fisher he live alone the only thing his co worker know be that he be divorce and have a daughter in college Believe in luck Rachel I be in Pittsburgh dodge smallpox for a live how much lucky can a girl get well good fortune be the result of careful planning it be more of a statement than a karmic prediction whoa can you make this kind of cash clearing body at a demolition site I do not know maybe he be work two job he be a mortician if he be juggle two job he might 've put the number in speed dial try number four work ex wife kid 's cell second job Jackson and Sons Mortuary your mask hello Mr Jackson yes I be Jacob Hood I be part of a team investigate a serious public health matter involve your embalmer Christopher Fisher Fisher I would like you to tell I the name of everyone he work with and every dead body he work on Today 's my son 's birthday that be great he be nine year old we be you know throw he a party check this out look at that I be go to destroy you you think he will like it sure what kid would not I be not go to make it to his birthday be I they say we can go home soon they be lie keep we under control the government be not go to help we even if they try they will screw it up oh we be on our own here come this way just leave all your personal belonging right there Hazmat 's do a full sweep of the funeral home Rigdon 's wait to brief we on the status here what be up how many worker do you count accord to the foreman 's report there should be 21 I count 20 Ned Cathy it be after 3 00 I 've be call your cell for hour they take it what do you mean who take it it do not matter Cathy just listen to I something happen you promise John you would be home for his party there be not go to be a party cancel it and start pack we have to get the kid out of here what be you talk about Ned you be scare I please Cathy just do it what be you do what you you can not keep I lock up I have not do anything wrong no but you be about to Ned you 've be expose to a very dangerous highly contagious virus I want to see my family I want to see my kid I know you want to keep your family safe you want to protect they from danger Ned Ned listen to I you be the danger where be you keep my husband explain to I Ned Ned daddy hey John Wait wait Ned hey buddy this way please I get something for your birthday daddy you go with these people now son I will catch up with you later no no it be okay come on honey you will see your dad later okay they will not even remember I they will Ned I promise we catch a break Ned Warner 's rash have not progress beyond the macule phase so it be still in the early stage when it be least contagious that make it highly unlikely he infect anyone else on his way home Records from the funeral parlor we will find out which corpse infect Christopher Fisher I will oversee the decontamination in Ned 's apartment these be the people Christopher Fisher embalm during the likely period Susan Crane retire civil servant 72 cause of death pneumonia Gary Firth doctor 45 stomach cancer Jack Ruddock maintenance engineer 56 industrial accident in a cold storage facility my money be on the doctor the man deal with disease for a live you just lose your money domesticate specie lack a certain glycoprotein the virus need in order to replicate excuse I the doctor be a veterinarian you could 've just say so even vet be familiar with medical safety protocol so let us focus on the other two candidate we need a full background check dietary history family illness any recent travel out of the country who go first the woman who die of pneumonia or the guy who die in the accident at the cold storage facility when in doubt always use the scientific method head or tail yeah we can provide pickup service give I your address Mr Pulido can you hold on a sec yeah I be your man you look for some cold storage we be here about your dead maintenance man Jack Ruddock I be go to have to call you back 30 000 square foot keep at a constant 25 below we be the large public refrigeration facility east of the Allegheny all the big company and university store their perishable here what exactly be they store Ice cream to rocket fuel you name it we get it in popsicle form that be giant bluefin from the Gulf of Maine over there we get CO2 pellet for industrial blast clean and those ice core from the South Pole from Penn 's Antarctic survey hey you can not be back there be this where Jack Ruddock have his accident yeah he be fix the refrigeration unit and he fall OSHA 's already clear we do you know if he have be out of the country recently Jack Nah Jersey be a foreign country as far as he be concern look I 've get to take this just stop by my office let I know when you be do why do it matter if the victim leave the country Fisher be patient zero in this country because of our reporting system but some country do not have one and some country would not even tell we if they do have a case any chance they be in Latin America I want to know the village in Guatemala they come from and exactly how long they 've be in the country how the hell should I know Hood here Pathology 's back on Fisher test be conclusive it be definitely a hybrid form of variola major Smallpox mix with another virus I tell the CDC this would happen eventually that we have to be more aggressive with our research but what do they do they restrict my work they slash my funding cal I know you be frustrate but I need you to concentrate we have to establish this strain 's origin it come from Central America obviously something new something manmade what do the lab report say it be mixed with an adenovirus serotype 14 that be a respiratory virus be that combination even possible in virology almost anything be possible sorry I can not help you translate that be not spanish they be speak then what be it good guess Garifuna it be one of at least 20 mayan dialect speak in Guatemala Great do anybody understand what I be say comprehend your fly be down your coworker Jack have a bad infection when he die there be a good chance he pick it up work here we need to know how her brother arrive in the city last week he stay inside because he be too sick to work say he have a fever and a rash what else her village back home there be sick people there too how many everybody do not touch anything Rachel do not touch he everyone stay away from this man and wowon folk stay back please what they may both be very sick how much protection do vaccine give Rachel well hybrid strain be notoriously resilient and give so many unknown variable time antibody count 20 give or take what about Xicalal the Guatemalan village oh we contact the Guatemalan Red Cross and the Pan American Health Organization the place be be quarantine so we squash a bug Jacob it be over cal as long as Rachel and those people be at risk it be far from over Rachel 's a hero Jacob whatever happen next we must never forget that I want everybody 's name when this be over Payback 's a bitch you look for something Professor Rachel I be sorry for what you do what you have to do be that Ned no it be one of the other worker Ned 's hang on for now how many have die Hood how many six we think their viral load overwhelm the vaccine maybe if we get to they early do you have the number Rachel do you have it yeah I have it I want you to make the call tell the bureau that your handler be be compromise tell they to send a replacement immediately Rachel I do not want a replacement I do not care what you want you be my responsibility you get some rest I get thing I need to do Hood make the call do you hear I Hood I be serious it do not add up Calvert what that apartment can not be grind zero the timing 's all wrong the Guatemalan patient be only now present in symptom that be a full 12 hour after Christopher Fisher die well not everyone suffer at the same rate virus react with their specific variability even if the illegal be not show all the symptom yet they may all be dead by morning so we should write they off the way you write off the demolition worker I be be realistic I want Rachel remove from general quarantine until we have confirmation of infection protocol dictate she be in private isolation we simply do not have another level three facility available for that approach the rule apply to everyone Jacob even the people we care about most it be not fair it be just the way it be until the blood work come back on the Guatemalan carrier Rachel stay where she be Cath be that you Cathy Cath Cath Shh Shh I be right here oh I feel bad it be okay we all do no I do not mean that I feel bad because I be leave it all on you I will not be here to help you know with the kid yes you will Ned you just have to hang in there yeah Everything be go to be okay yeah this be the dead Guatemalan 's blood sample so what we be look for be the variola virus shape like a brick with a surface like a ball of wool you 've see it before only in book in 1979 when smallpox be eradicate the who have most of the live lab culture destroy since then scientist have have to rely on computer simulation only you say the smallpox virus be brick shape that look spherical wait a minute Rachel get Agent Young out of there now what what be you do he be wrong who Rigdon the man you touch he do not have smallpox he have chickenpox Chickenpox I have chickenpox when I be five year old that mean you do not have it now somebody get I out of this damn thing now I wish I could cheer but right now we be 12 hour into an outbreak of the variola virus and we be no close to identify the source excuse I Variola mean smallpox yeah why customer rent the space by the pallet nobody ask any question as long as the check clear Ice core from the south pole yeah but ice core be only viable in their original virgin state these core have be melt and refrozen so this be not virgin ice not even close there 567 alpha frozen water do not lie Manny how about you you have any idea what be at stake here Jack screw up the repair on the fan fry the motor he and Pulido they stay late one night to move the crate to another area so everything would not spoil their job be on the line you be not go to open that be you do not worry anything viral would be benign at this temperature do not blame I if something leap out and eat your face well that would have be well than this the sample be go Pulido 's go he be take the variola sample with he Police and Hazmat have the city lock down they will find he the question be how many innocent people will he infect before they do what be you do get direction Pulido search the ' net for the quick route from here to the intersection of Fourth and Grant street 15 minute ago pull over sir so we can search your vehicle turn off your engine license and registration please Pulido sorry to disappoint you Professor you know that immigrant boy be not our source do not you the virus could not have come from Central America because it be from your laboratory be not it I be not sure at first Jacob you got to believe I but when it turn out to be Adeno 14 I I know it have to be one of mine it be an accident an accident wait to happen how could you store a deadly hybrid smallpox virus in a commercial facility if it be not my strain that get out it would 've be someone else 's be you listen to yourself Calvert you 've kill six people you put the life of an entire city at risk how dare you try to rationalization that to I we live in dangerous time and mankind have get to come up with well vaccine more powerful treatment that can not be accomplish use computer simulation and theoretical model alone you know that who be you try to convince I or you be it Pulido 's idea to move the sample or yours when we round up his worker he realize what be in the cooler demand 75 000 for it I be go to pay he and I be go to destroy everything I make a careless mistake Jacob eventually you be go to make one too it happen to everyone who carry our kind of weight you will understand one day be you go to have her arrest I now not yet first you have a job to do I want you to call your emergency response team get they down here right now and you will help clean this up Calvert you will help clean this up I be sorry Jacob Hood can not let he get away I be not plan on it Pulido stay where you be do not make thing bad Pulido Pulido FBI everyone stay where you be Mr Pulido do not touch anyone you be infect with the virus right now there be a microscopic army wage war inside of you it be go to invade your blood stream attack your central nervous system and destroy every healthy cell inside of you until there be nothing leave no I get the vaccine too late to be effective you and Jack be infect the night you move the box no Jack be not sick he fall and break his neck he be the lucky one on the floor now Mr Pulido or I will shoot hey you stay away from I you need medical assistance Alan I need my money listen to yourself you be not make sense it be the virus it be affect your brain Ladies and gentleman I be go to ask you to gently quietly leave the premise no no no no nobody go anywhere until I get my damn money listen to I I want my money listen to I no amount of money in the world be go to stop this disease that be rage inside of you but you might be able to stop it hurt other people now if you stay here you be issue a death sentence to every innocent person in this room do you understand that I do not care I will shoot do not open it there be one al miss it be do Jacob oh cal I run into an old colleague the other day he be do really well it make I so jealous I could taste it and then last night sit in that damn plastic tent helpless I think I be go to die make I question this assignment what I do for a live everything and and you be a major pain in the ass but you also do a lot of good I be go to see this through make everyone else jealous of I Mom Mom that robot be design by a NASA engineer it be get artificial intelligence seven servo motor it dance it snore it even do little electric fart that be a really cool thing you just do not really I also get one for myself Energy restore whoa I take it you be the ice man from the FBI Ice man Hmm that be a little harsh actually I be the science man from the FBI I be Special Agent Rachel Young I be assign to Dr Hood well I be Detective Cordero LAPD this be Dr Nash from the coroner 's office hi Dr Nash how be you do this be our case till the feds show up tell we to wait for you why be the FBI so interested uh you should uh put on a mask no I do not think so Funny I would not have peg you as the live dangerously type there be nothing dangerous about it an airborne pathogen could not have freeze she like this why not it be thermodynamically impossible uh airborne molecule they be too small they do not have anything close to the heat capacity to cause this kind of damage to a human being well then what do I mean there be no wound no puncture mark on the body no bruise lesion injection mark no indication of physical trauma whatsoever who be she Detective Marlena Gower Marketing student at Malibu State she spend most of last night at a house about 100 yard from here leave near dawn be a big party a few noise complaint from the neighbor but no report of scream or sign of a struggle 39 degree Fahrenheit seven degree above freeze her body show no sign of sub thermal exposure and it appear like she be not warm up either Detective can you tell I how a seemingly healthy college student in the prime of life freeze to death on the beach on one of the hot day of the year no doctor no neither can I which be why the FBI be interested anything unusual on Marlena 's body maybe in her purse we find a near empty bottle of champagne pricey stuff a bottle of prescription tranquilizer and some odd text message on her cell Odd in what way well they be pretty cryptic ask she if she have reconsider something have you trace they to a prepaid cell we be try to track it down right now she write back some pretty nasty response so whatever it be about she do not like it and you check her cell record there be three other have you reconsider text message first one come in five day ago could be connect to the death I ask Dr Nash to run a metabolic panel also to check the stomach content see if there be anything unusual in that champagne she have please call we with the result will do thank you also we should check out the house she visit last night see if there be anything there to give we a clue as to how she end up like this or why yeah she be here too bad she be a real hottie come with a bunch of coed from Malibu State real party girl if you know what I mean and I be sure they be all over 18 right all my party be legal hey hey what be you do man just check out your AC unit here yeah well it be up to code and state of the art you use it very often now and then do not get over 90 in Malibu that often it do yesterday yeah well I have it on for a few hour in the afternoon turn it off as soon as the sun go down okay thank you very much someone slip our victim a Freon Mickey they do not use Freon in air conditioner anymore damage the ozone layer any sign of tamper on the unit no so we can rule out death by air conditioner she be take prescription medication maybe we should go talk to her doctor she be take benzodiazepine for anxiety Understandable of course why be she have trouble at school or with a boyfriend she have big problem I assume you know know what she be diagnose last month with severe aplastic anemia unfortunately we could not find it in time to begin effective treatment she be terminal I be afraid so could the illness have contribute to her freeze to death it be a very rare blood disease with a lot of horrible symptom but fatal hypothermia be not one of they it be amazing you can actually see the heart beat and now we know what color to paint the nursery I 've always love the color blue we will name he after you I just wish I could give he more than a name maybe you can Honey I make that appointment for we at the Foundation I think you should at least consider it we still have some time leave before it be uh be over 24 hour and the extremity be finally start to thaw her body be just a uh few degree below ambient Autolysis have begin the body have start to digest itself it be always such a brutally efficient process to watch yeah life be a miracle but uh death in its own terrible way be no less beautiful she be only 21 oh well her death be tragic no question but uh I do this autopsy on a guy last month who have be hook up to a heart lung machine for uh 12 year because his family just could not accept the fact that he be brain dead the way our culture try to deny death uh hide from it I just think that be tragic too you get a tissue sample yeah I get a liver section right over here thank you no frostbite but that be impossible I mean she be freeze be not she well that be the interesting thing she be freeze but but not with ice crystal be there any chemical compound in the blood work you could not identify well the tox panel be clean there be a few line in uh the spectral analysis that I do not recognize but of course that in itself be not unusual well I be go to need at least 100cc 's of her blood tissue sample from her major organ and a real lab Rachel can you find I one oh yeah not bad not bad at all can I help you yeah I would like to borrow your facility please I beg your pardon uh Dr Hood and I be here to discover exactly what kill Marlena Gower a 21 year old student from your school and to ascertain whether or not it pose a risk to national security now I can not legally compel your cooperation or the use of your lab so I be ask you to compel yourself to do the right thing I have good day and bad day I be set to start chemo treatment next week I be do everything that the doctor tell I I be glad to hear you be follow their advice we at the Forever Forward Foundation want to see you live a long and productive life look I know that time be not on my side but I do not intend to go out a moment before I have to we just find out it be go to be a boy I may not be around when he be bear but maybe with your help when he be grow up I could be back and spend some time with he talk to he that would certainly be our hope as well but I have an ethical obligation to be crystal clear on this point with both of you we can not make any guarantee it could be decade before a cure be find for your illness Edward even long before the technology be available to successfully revive you maybe you will be able to meet our son and our grandson now I be use a fluorite substrate instead of glass why Glass block infrare very good and we need infrare datum to get a complete organic profile and fluorite be transparent to infrared you care to assist Sure run this sample please Mm hmm thank you be that an ice pack do you hurt yourself you get a spare one of those I could borrow for a second please Mmm Sure here you go thank you this be an example of an endothermic reaction squeeze it water mix with the ammonium nitrite it get cold than ice exactly I have a lot of experience with ice pack see most reaction they release heat an endothermic reaction do the opposite it absorb it Thanks Dr Hood Bye now see you around so you think Marlena Gower be dose with ammonium nitrite no because it would 've leave behind ice crystal but it be something similar it be a pair of compound that absorb heat when they react just get to work out which compound so who would have a reason to create something like this well sometimes people need to ship um transplant organ from one state to another refrigeration 's a way of keep they viable but if ice crystal form inside the cell it can cause a lot of damage if you could find a way of preserve organ without freeze they you could save a lot of life or take they or take they where be Mr Science he be at the lab you two um strictly business right of course why oh just check tell you the truth I would not mind brush up on my biology with he Janitor find he about a half hour ago Name 's John Robbins big time entertainment lawyer Coroner 's on the way unnaturally low body temperature no apparent sign of trauma same text message little less cold and stiff than the other victim but just as dead we will take excellent care of you Mr Grekowski when the time come my wife convince I if there be even a one in a million chance I could see my son someday I be go to take it I will uh I will bring you the check tonight I think you 've make the right decision for yourself and for your family thank you the trunk be still somewhat rigid but the rest of he be nearly back to room temperature and still no puncture wound it take Marlena Gower close to a day to thaw out this man be be dead for less than eight hour if this be due to a chemical reaction the hormonal difference between man and woman could affect its rate he be also old than the previous victim he be get the same text message she be ask if he would reconsider but with no indication of what he be suppose to reconsider the text message on the second victim 's phone give we probable cause to geo locate the caller 's location but so far nothing whoever make those call know their telecom tradecraft what do that mean it mean they compartmentalize the device never use it for anything but those call and probably remove the SIM card and battery when they be do send the text these spectrograph from our victim 's blood sample represent half a dozen different compound we 've get to identify the one that cause she to freeze to death so we have to work backwards right figure out the set of all possible reaction that could make they yeah but there be literally hundred of possibility just get the final autopsy report for our late victim John Robbins he be terminal too Hemochromatosis that be a fatally high level of iron in the blood the answer be here I just I just can not see it you will figure it out sir you be brilliant thank for the vote of confidence Janet but I keep tell you please stop call I sir it be Jacob okay well we know what the reaction make but we do not know what make the reaction maybe I be think of this the wrong way I be assume that these two or three different compound be go together to make the reaction that be how chemistry usually happen yeah but what if the fragment we 've identify be all part of the same molecule but how would that work what would it react with with itself it be like the Ouroboros from the egyptian methodology the snake that swallow its own tail eventually it consume itself but if this be a self react molecule there would still have to be some kind of catalyst to get the reaction start Potassium it be a catalyst in lot of organic reaction and there be plenty of it in human cell in mineral form there be only one way to be sure we have to synthesize the molecule Rachel you hungry not particularly I need a hamburger okay I will see what I can find at the cafeteria how do you want it raw one raw hamburger so that be our killer huh well if we be lucky and my organic chemistry be not too rusty here be a perfectly raw hamburger now watch this will just take a a few moment for the potassium in the meat to trigger the process do you want I to go back to the cafeteria for some fry where be your team spirit have a some patience please it be 39 degree same temperature as the first victim frozen solid but what about John Robbins if the same compound kill he why do not he end up frozen his terminal hemochromatosis too much iron in the blood Iron reverse the process Janet could you get the iron sulfate for I please watch this you see Robbins have just enough iron in his blood to prevent the process from complete but not enough to keep he alive unfortunately for he no and now we be back to normal temperature okay you say the chemical would be develop to preserve organ for transplant right absolutely to that market it be go to be worth its weight in gold so it would definitely be worth patent Janet there be no internet on this computer be there a t3 connection anywhere in the building our professor 's computer or if you would like a little privacy I have WiFi in my dorm room no your professor 's computer will be fine application no 8293024 an endothermic chemical process for the purpose of tissue preservation it be the same as the molecule we just synthesize the patent be file by Adastra Pharmaceuticals Biomedical firm in El Segundo now we know where the murder weapon come from Agent Young Dr Hood I hope this be important you pull I out of a stockholder meeting I need to get back as soon as possible oh I be very sorry Dr Ramesh be you tell your stockholder about Trimethyl cryazine Cryazine be still in development not nearly ready to bring to the public what be your interest in it my interest be I uh synthesize it in a lab and we believe it be be use to murder people I have no idea what you be talk about Cryazine be manufacture to preserve organ at this stage the FDA have only approve of limited clinical trial on kidney and liver who be conduct your clinical trial I be afraid I be not at liberty to say you know two people have already die because of your research I hardly believe anyone associate with this company be responsible anyone familiar with the chemical be a possible suspect include you Doctor if Cryazine be successful it could save thousand of life an investigation could compromise our research scare off our investor well we would not want anyone get cold foot we be simply ask for your cooperation tell we who your partner be on the clinical side and we will be discreet and I be sure your stockholder will be relieve when you go back to your meeting and tell they you avoid a federal subpoena the Forever Forward Foundation here at the Forever Forward Foundation the idea of immortality be no long a fantasy Dr Gregory there be someone to see you from the FBI at 320 degree below zero liquid nitrogen can preserve they indefinitely a doctor be always present to certify time of death it be good that our client spend their last moment here so we can begin the process as quickly as possible so how many float head do you have here we prefer the term de animate neural suspension each cylinder contain four client there be ten cylinder in this storage unit and five more unit just like this one you do the math you promise these people that someday when there be a cure for cancer or whatever else kill they you will just thaw they out it be good enough for Walt Disney and then what you put their head on wheel in the future it will be possible to clone yourself a young and healthy body why bother preserve the old one plus it be cheap to just freeze the head right do you know a Marlena Gower or a John Robbins they have contract with we what do those contract run exactly 80 000 our service be not cheap but they both have money Robbins be a successful lawyer and I believe Ms Gower have a trust fund do you know they be dead when how a couple of day ago well they have to be bring here immediately the long we wait the low their chance be for reanimation be you aware of a substance call Trimethyl cryazine how do you know about it it kill they both do you use it here for clinical trial only we encourage our neural suspension client to donate all of their harvestable organ for research if Cryazine prove effective it could be a huge step forward see our big challenge be prevent cellular damage cause by freeze brain tissue do you have the chemical on the premise oh yes there be only nine bottle there should be uh 15 who else have access to this cabinet our lead researcher uh two technician uh security guard we will need all their name so we can run a background check I will also need to see a list of your client just the one who be not dead yet so you do have a contract with the Forever Forward Foundation for de animate neural suspension actually I be call to see if you 've receive a threat of any kind recently possibly a text message from an unknown sender ask you to reconsider okay well if you do receive such a message please contact we immediately thank you still wait to hear back from a couple of client but no one else get an unusual text not yet Rachel Young here something come up on one of the employee at the frozen head shop Security guard name Joey Lux he use to be a cop retire he be force to resign one too many police brutality complaint and a corruption charge to go with it sound like a real upstande citizen I have a search warrant and I be texte you his address I will see you there okay that be Cordero with a possible lead we could use one by the way she like you what Police open up Police open up do not move LAPD what the hell we have a few question to ask you Mr Lux you work security at the Foundation when they start test a new tissue preserve chemical so so several bottle of the chemical be miss Stolen and two people be dead because of it who be next Joey I do not know what the hell you be talk about we be talk about the fact that you be one of the few people who have access to the chemical and a couple of your coworker see you snoop around the room where the chemical be keep after your shift have end and you think that make I a killer well standard for promotion to detective have seriously drop since I leave the force we canvass the neighborhood where the two victim be kill we find a syringe with trace of the compound in it and your fingerprint you care to explain that hey kiss my ass Detective I be a cop remember if you would find a syringe with my print on it we would not be talk be we do we be do for now but do not leave town Rachel what not a syringe a gun I do not follow Detective Cordero just try to trick he into confessing by suggest that we have find a syringe well there be no puncture mark on any of the victim ' body no bullet hole either I do not mean that kind of gun jet injector gun use a powerful jet of liquid instead of a needle to penetrate the skin no puncture mark we need to subpoena all medical supplier of jet injector gun and get name of any individual or company in Southern California who 've make purchase in the last 12 month what be it uh uh it be nothing I just keep get the same junk mail text message uh it be so annoying do you think there be really a chance the people in those cylinder those head can ever be revive well the science be debatable and the ethic be questionable but sure there be a chance just as there be a chance a snowstorm could bury the East Coast on the Fourth of July I be serious so be I it happen 1816 it be a combination of low magnetic activity from the sun ash cloud and sulfur aerosol from a volcanic eruption the year before but it it create a a summer of snow and rain across the entire northern Hemisphere so if there be a chance it be probably worth take it I mean consider the alternative soon or later Rachel everyone die I mean you can fight it my wife do but in the end um in the end I think it be how you face your death that count I do not know about you but I would not like to face mine as a frozen head on a Popsicle stick Cordero this be Rachel we will be right there that ex cop Lux they just find he dead in his apartment nothing say guilty like kill yourself with the murder weapon I be not so sure drink this compound be not a very efficient way of absorb it into the bloodstream the stomach acid would break it down before it have a chance to reach the rest of the body one thing we do know for sure our prime suspect just become our late victim anything good jet injector be order by Camp Pendleton near San Diego and a diabetes research institute in Pasadena all of they be account for another dead end Hang on a second I also get a subpoena for all PayPal transaction involve online purchase of surplus jet injector over the past six month and one be ship to a Malibu po box less than a month ago the user name on the PayPal account be Glacialis Glacialis that be Latin for frozen what be the name on the account Eddie no Mrs Grekowski yes this be special agent Rachel Young I be from the FBI I be try to find your husband I 've be call his cell phone but he do not pick up be something wrong he sign a contract with the Forever Forward Foundation yesterday I be afraid he might be in danger and I be wonder if he be get any odd text message recently no just junk mail but nothing he be at the Foundation right now drop off a check Dr Nash what be this FBI Mr Grekowski what be you do here we could ask you the same question but we already know the answer I be here to certify a death that be my job the way our culture try to deny death be tragic be not that what you tell we at the morgue I would be happy to have this discussion some other time but right now I have work to do whoa whoa what the hell be go on here Dr Nash be the one who send you those threaten text message I do not understand there be nothing to understand this be crazy Cryonics attack your whole belief system do not it your world view I just respect death I think everybody should well that respect be what be keep you go help you cope with your job day in day out Year after year Corpse after corpse you know how much money people like Grekowski here waste try to cheat death what that money could be use for a billion child go to bed on this planet every night hungry while hundred of million of dollar be throw away on ridiculous dream of immortality Joey Lux steal the chemical for you and provide information on client you kill he to keep he from talk and try to make it look like suicide and you come here to kill Mr Grekowski on the premise a customer freeze to death at a cryonic lab well that be big news could certainly close down this facility for good maybe bring the whole field into disrepute you be both crazy you do not have proof of any of this well we know that you take delivery of a jet injector gun the type use to administer cryazine without leave any mark the lapd 's on their way I wonder what they will find when they search your place more missing bottle of cryazine maybe do not move you move he die they be all go to die anyway let us go stay here drop it Nash it be over Doctor let he go step back everybody move away I mean it I will kill he do not do it Nash one more step it be over Lucas everybody back away I be serious come any close he die please I just want to see my son Nash listen to he oh no Rachel this man need an iron infusion now this be Special Agent Rachel Young I need an ambulance at Forever Forward Foundation Third and Rosemead Temp be 95 7 and fall Come on Mr Grekowski stay with I be he go to make it if we keep his temperature above 86 degree he may have a chance Temp be 95 2 he need more iron Eddie you hear I I need you to stay awake for I Eddie I need you to stay awake we be almost at the hospital now please keep your eye open can you see I now I want you to think about your little boy I want you to think about your son think about how much you want to see your son keep your eye open can you see I stay awake we be almost at the hospital he be right over there oh hi hi I be Emily Grekowski yes of course please sit down oh no thank you I just want to let you know that the doctor say my husband be go to be fine for now thank to you uh but I do not even know your name oh I be Jacob Hood this be Rachel Young hi hi Mrs Grekowski a friend of mine work for Memorial Sloan Kettering in uh Manhattan he be part of a team work on a new treatment for your husband 's illness last I hear they be get some positive result no worry he be expect your call we be go to name he Edward but I kind of like the sound of Jacob thank you no you should uh you should call he uh Edward it be a cool name thank you so much what pregnant woman they they get really emotional actually it be more to do with the buildup of oxytocin hormone in the body of course so you say the ethic of cryonic be debatable and it be probably crazy to have your head lop off and preserve for future use do that mean you agree with Nash you think cryonic should be stop oh on the contrary when uh immortality be outlaw only outlaw will be immortal come on Sacha come on come on that be almost twice as fast as the last time that little guy be go to save a lot of life here be your reward dude get to chill with your buddy get in there Dr Miller have he be get the require amount of sleep Mm hmm this be nice work Bruce you 've exceed our most optimistic projection by a large margin well how fast can you be ready for clinical trial to collate and quantify the datum we be talk month now not year now if this thing ramp up as it should Belton Pharmaceuticals be go to let you write your own ticket everything okay yeah just a question down at the lab I well go do not want to fall behind schedule Sacha what have you do where do he say to meet he right here Dr Hood Special Agent Young I be Henry Brooks I appreciate you take the time to see I Colonel Brooks be not it that be right with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DARPA the folk who really invent the internet tell I Dr Hood what do you know about the Warfighter Enhancement Program well I gather there be a great emphasis on miniaturize some of the 80 plus pound of gear carry by the average soldier enhance the strength and flexibility of battle armor that be only part of it we be also work on how to improve raw human physical and mental performance in battlefield situation Hardware software now wetware too work on the soldier themselves could be um controversial well we think we mostly do a good job in balance the scientific ethic with the need to find new way to protect our troop in wartime mostly not always we 've have an incident in one of our primate study the contractor be a biotech start up call Belton Pharmaceuticals the head researcher be a neuroscientist name Bruce Nesic the result be off the chart until this the chimp attack leave trace of hair and blood everywhere include on the victim now local animal control authority want he destroy but we have million of dollar invest in this particular animal and we need somebody on the ground in Nevada yesterday I do not get it Colonel why not use your own people I do not have that kind of infrastructure besides anybody I could send be already too close to this research their objectivity could be compromise it be very simple Dr Hood find out what happen in Nevada be essential for the national security of the United States okay I will look into it thank you hood watch this the guy 's get as much security as the President Hey where be you go that man 's agency be responsible for the world 's first breakthrough in artificial intelligence gps unmanned aircraft other thing you 've never hear of but you will be use every day in ten year ' time odd be the science that that man make happen will have more impact on the future than the President how be the veterinarian do Dr Miller be still unconscious she be stable but just barely there be no sign of a break in so that mean Sacha would have have to open his own cage and all of the other too well like we chimp be very ingenious even devious back when I be do my grad work I hear of a young male who pick his handler 's pocket hide the key for hour and then free himself this be Sacha look docile enough now too docile he be be sedate well yes we think it well give what have happen what exactly be the nature of the research you be do with Sacha he be be give a drug cocktail of neurotransmitter and endocrine compound to enhance the mind body performance by speed up the chemical reaction in the brain it be our hope that by use this regimen along with other like it that we can improve the fight ability of the soldier that be where Enhanced Warfighter funding come in you be right now we know that Russia and the Chinese have similar active program but we believe that we can leapfrog what they be do by year any theory on what provoke the attack well at first I think maybe Sacha have contract an infection of some sort so I begin run a series of test the result of which we will know in a few day but to be frank Dr Hood I think it be sabotage really why some of the surveillance file from the time of the occurrence be miss who be the last person to have access to the file Rudy Callistro he be a veterinary technician he be Sacha 's hand on keeper now when all this happen everyone who work here in the lab be greatly affect but Rudy just disappear it add up deep background check on the personnel here turn up blog comment hit I on animal right web site I have he flag for priority questioning we will need to see everything else you have on he and I would like to see your lab record please uh go how far back um start of the project you realize that be be about five year I mean it be go to take quite a while just to print out the stuff no need to kill any tree I be all about the bandwidth come on man over here put it up put it up put it up good shot good shot watch out watch out pass it out pass it out sorry man you okay Yo Pierce relax man Nobody be try to foul you on purpose Hey Kevin Dr Nesic I came look for you the other night but you be not in your bunk I be probably out take a walk try to relax what be up Doc it be time for your next treatment can I just shower first of course I can wait hey hi I just get a hit on a property hold in the name of Rudy Callistro 's sister get this she be arrest for throw red paint at a celebrity 's fur coat at a fashion show so run in the family Property 's less than an hour from here we should check it out maybe that be where he be hole up what I do not understand why he would harm the chimp if he love animal so much well I say it be all about the miss video maybe that be his idea alone admistere some kind of drug or or goad the chimp I mean can not you just see this footage all over the internet in the next few day it would be a huge public relation victory for the animal right movement Sometimes Rachel you have a very dark view of human nature you know some culture even one that eat meat treat their animal with much more respect than we do in Japan there be Wagyu cattle feed they beer sake massage they every day forget the cattle I need someone to do that for I Mmm we be in the right place all of these specie be commonly use in animal testing Rudy Callistro who want to know we be from the FBI we need to talk to you about Sacha Whoa get back here hey if I have to shoot you to get you to stop I be go to be really piss ow what the hell do you throw at I anyway Ground beef heart it be cheap and if the animal do not eat it it go to waste that be just great give I your other hand I do not know Doc last time I could not sleep for a week afterward a common side effect it will diminish over time that be not all I be tense all the time I get these headache and the med you give I be not really help either if it be all the same to you I would rather just skip this treatment I understand but we be at a crucial stage of the sequence in fact this may be the last one I really just want to go home I think the whole point of this posttraumatic stress disorder therapy be to make it easy for I to spend time with my family in between deployment this be it be just take I away from they Kevin you know the stat the whole point of all the treatment be to reduce conflict on the home front tell I that do not interest you yeah but I do not sign up to be a damn guinea pig why do you volunteer for this study for my wife then why do you want to quit at this point in the game when we be so close okay Doc I will take my medicine like a big boy so you go to work for Belton in order to sabotage the lab no I be only there to gather information lay the groundwork for a new Equal Rights Amendment that include all specie the way science be treat animal it it be criminal sometimes but you be diabetic right how have you know that your fingertip from uh testing for blood sugar with a what portable glucose meter the discovery of insulin which make it possible for diabetic like yourself to live with the disease be make possible by animal testing without the sacrifice of those animal you would be dead Rudy what do you think happen at the lab it be obvious be not it Nesic be the Dr Frankenstein of the animal kingdom he take peaceful primate and turn they into killer why do you run 'cause when it all go to hell I know that nicicould find some way to blame I for what happen do you steal the surveillance video no no Download any file I never access the system and I never take anything okay let us say we buy your story be there anything you can remember that might help we to figure out what be go on with Sacha yeah I do notice something you know chimp exhibit handedness just like people do right for pick up item like seed or raisin some prefer the left hand and some the right well Sacha be a righty but in the last few day he switch he go totally ambidextrous for for feed himself and he even begin to favor his left hand three two one do your screening for pathogen turn up anything not yet do you also test for T gondii Toxoplasmosis no Toxoplasmosis yeah it be a parasite that infect the mind of its host and can alter behavior and thing like handedness but there be no feline or rodent at this facility and they be your most common carry of toxoplasmosis well it could have come in contact with any number of specie during transshipment you may be right that could help explain Sacha 's action we will test for it Whoa Sacha 's go let us go lock they down all right come on now all right put that up put that up oh yeah yeah all right come on come on you all right man no I be out Hey Kev Nick 's hurt come on Hey Kev get your stuff on man hey Kevin let us play some ball man come on you will never get away with this Kevin Daddy hey hey buddy what be you do here Honey I think you only come home on weekend why be not you at the base what be wrong Kevin be you okay I get a killer headache babe we get an aspirin or something strong the well be you hang over no just my head hurt that be all Jackson honey you just keep watch tv okay Mommy and daddy need to have a talk I have not be drink I just have to see you Kevin the therapy you be getting be suppose to help you be with we you need to get back before they think you be AWOL just want to see my wife and kid and my head hurt from those treatment the one that be suppose to be help I Damn it kevin your hand it be fine do you see what I just do yeah you punch a hole in the cabinet not that I I just I I throw a left I should have throw a right I be a righty you should not have throw a punch at all it be these stupid treatment Abby I be sorry it be just I know I be sorry too I can not pretend to know what it be like to be in combat I do not know what you see out there but I be glad to have you here at home thank we will be in touch Animal Control have every available officer do a grid search for Sacha Let us hope they turn something up do the datum check out I 've only really see the tip of the iceberg it be go to take a while to sift through you know the Bureau be not without its resource we have a entire department devote to datum analysis as talente the uh government 's programmer may be Rachel not many criminal be find by run linear regression on their credit card purchase and porn download Analysis software be write to spot common denominator of falsehood if you be look for anything specific you can not really use generic datum sift code I get it instead of rely on electronic intel you need to put your own eye on the target do your own legwork exactly only in this case I get do it sit on my ass check leave I will check right Gary you go down the embankment check the drainage pipe remember the miss chimp can hide high or low copy that Special Agent Young FBI what 've we get single victim take a bad beating his tranquilizer gun 's be fire so he probably put up some kind of fight we 've get compound fracture to the ulna defensive wound most likely get break collarbone both elbow hyperextend extensive facial contusion okay same injury as the chimp at the lab and Dr Miller the veterinarian you think Sacha could be responsible well it be possible fully grow chimpanzee be up to five time strong than a human being Hood over here the Animal Control Officer 's tranq dart do hit Sacha but the chimp must have attack before the drug could take effect it look like the officer inflict Sacha 's fatal injury while defend himself where be Sacha well Dr Nesic I believe Animal Control and County Coroner be have an interesting jurisdictional debate about the body see as how a chimp share 98 dna with a human who should get the corpse I will take Sacha back to the lab with I he be the property of Belton Pharmaceuticals and we have not complete our research I be sorry Dr Nesic this be a criminal matter now it be out of your hand Faster Faster fast Mommy More More Contents of the bowel be very interesting I be afraid you would say that Sacha 's large bowel be empty just what you would expect after a sudden death his bowel should have evacuate immediately upon die but there be no sign of defecation where the body be find anything in his system would have leave at least a trace where he die more likely a big trace which mean Sacha be kill somewhere else his body must have be plant there after his death also mean Sacha could not have attack the Animal Control Officer then who do Dr Hood we be about to cut into his skull just one moment I have to see what be inside his skull Kevin baby you 've be in there a long time be you come to bed Congratulations Hood you 've get I stare at monkey brain well they be worth stare at well no paramecia rule out toxoplasmosis Most of the brain structure look normal see the uh amygdala here it be pretty much the same in chimp as it be in human it be the center of the fear response the fight or flight reflex when the sense tell it of a threat it respond by send alarm signal to the uh other organ the pituitary adrenal gland they flood the system with adrenaline so you either run away or you fight your attacker or an enemy soldier that be not all the amygdala help regulate handedness all of Sacha 's new behavior his aggressive reaction his change from right to left handedness all would tend to indicate change of that part of the brain so Nesic be mess with the amygdala yeah somehow Nesic manage to make Sacha 's two amygdalae twice their normal size which speed up reaction it be like when you sneeze when you sneeze every muscle in your body involuntarily convulse by give the amygdala the size and heft to take over the entire system I mean deal with total force you be kind of turn the urge to to violence into the equivalent of a sneeze something you can not control the result the subject the the chimp would respond to any perceive threat no matter how small with overwhelming force that be one hell of an unintended consequence I be not so sure it be unintended Come on all right bring it up bring it up hey check it out gentleman anyone know of the whereabouts of Kevin Pierce it be very important that I speak with he nobody for a three day leave at the Hard Rock Casino all expense pay if he have go awol you could save he a lot of trouble you would be help he we be not stupid Doc Sergeant Pierce do need help and whatever you 've be do to he it be not work that be right mm hmm so you here to play or just hog the ball I know that you think that you be watch his back but you be screw he you be screw yourselves Nesic 's datum be perfect too perfect what do you mean let I show you Hood Minibar expensive oh do not worry Rachel live a little now this be what datum look like it be a group of far flung point on a graph can I use your phone charger please thank you if we be to draw a curve on this data it would look something like this see the phone charger represent a line that encompass a general rule we call that an average of all the datum point but Nesic 's datum do not look like that Nesic 's datum never leave the curve that be statistically impossible you be say he fit the datum to the curve rig it to say what he want it to say well he be definitely hide something the question be what we need to get back in his lab now this be Special Agent Young I need the Megahut to send Entry and Exit people for T 3s I will give you the address T 3s I absolutely love that for once you have no idea what I be talk about the Entry and Exit specialist should be here any minute so Hood I 've be mean to ask you how exactly do you get this gig 1986 World Series excuse I Mets versus Red Sox I be a Mets fan and uh one of my classmate at Princeton be this uh annoyingly button down history major from Boston so he have ticket for the game but he have no way of get there I have a 1979 VW Passat that I would modify to run on vegetable oil so we um inevitably declare a truce and um we end up drive up to uh Fenway we watch game five then we drive down to the city and we see game six at Shea Stadium by the time we get home to Princeton he and I be pretty much friend he go on to become an officer in the Marines and earn his law degree and become director of the FBI that be exactly right one day he give I a call ask for a favor and before I know it I be spend most of my time with people like you hey in place like this do not worry you ever get into trouble with the Bureau I get plenty of dirt on the director you can use to get out of it here we go Agent Reed sorry for the short notice no problem thank any time Rachel tell I this be legal please we 've get the FBI and DARPA behind we I be pretty sure we can get the breaking and enter charge throw out six so there be only six primate cage Nesic have extensive history on seven experimental subject what be you look for exactly well we 've see how number can be manipulate I be look for hard scientific evidence he must keep the blood and tissue sample somewhere Hood I think I 've get it the sample be in here Rachel subject seven 's blood chemistry be all wrong he be get type AB and only one primate have type AB Subject seven be a human being hey there you be hi Abby Dr Nesic be something wrong with Kevin I do not know I be hope you could tell I oh God Kevin may be having extend combat flashback I 've see it before with soldier suffer from PTSD I tell he he should go back to the base you 've see he then be he here I need to get a hold of he no Kevin 's not here but I can tell he to call you when I see he good bye I apologize this be not on my radar it turn out the company Nesic 's work for be run another defense relate study 20 minute up the road from your location at Nellis Air Force Base they be test therapy on a sequestered group of return combat troop who suffer from PTSD any indication which one might be subject seven one of they a Sergeant Kevin Pierce leave the facility without permission after exhibit strange behavior it sound like our guy Dr Hood Agent Young if you need anything else you just ask we will thank you sir thank you we need to get to this air force base now I think it be Pierce that attack the animal control officer he probably approach he in what seem like a threatening manner Pierce would 've respond autonomically as if program his nervous system take over to deal with any perceive threat so maybe Nesic stage Sacha 's escape to hamper our investigation when the animal control officer be attack Nesic see an opportunity to end the scrutiny he kill Sacha and plant the body and then go off the grid that be true and appear out there be a danger to himself and anyone who cross his path Nesic be out there too I be go to order a 24 hour guard for our injure veterinarian she be the only witness we 've get we come from all different unit different area around the country but we all get the same story when I come back from over there it be like like the world be move in slow motion and I be still in combat speed so when they offer this study I jump on it you know anything to help I fit back in have it help maybe we mostly just sit around watch video fill out psych test but your friend Pierce get special treatment yeah they hit he hard man I mean drug endurance test I mean he be hurt always seek for painkiller he even start shift the hand he dribble with play ball you know he go from right to leave it be weird this be very important Private Vasquez Sergeant Pierce be not in trouble but we need to find he for his own good that be the same thing Nesic say when he came look for he Nesic be here when last night look for Kev same as you we do not tell he jack though what make you think we be go to tell you before be assign to Dr Hood I spend six month as an FBI component of Task Force Eagle in Kabul Afghanistan I work with guy like you everyday do sensitive site exploitation look for intel and what the bad guy might be up to I be not one of they and neither be he I believe that you 've all be victim of a scientific fraud Dr Nesic have already abort one fail experiment and I believe he be try to do the same with Kevin Pierce and any one of you could be next that be why I think you should tell I there be a park near here you know a couple time when thing get rough he would go there decompress chill out thank you Yo Joey we 've get your stuff Hell man that be not Joey look at what we get here this be a place of business home we do not need any suspicious look character bring the cop around do you hear a word he just say you need to leave buddy my phone die do either one of you guy have a spare cell phone battery be you kid I hello hello hey hey baby it be I I do not recognize the number it scare I I have to borrow a

View Park 415 Ryder Street Hey Hood blood and tire track I think Pierce take their car he could be anywhere not anywhere he be hurt Private Vasquez say he be seek painkiller he will be look for a pharmacy Freeze put your hand up Hands where I can see they Unit five David request backup Subject in sight turn around Pierce stop Hood do not the slight move could set he off let I do my job Rachel Put the gun down trust I listen to I Kevin we be not here to hurt you we know what they 've be do to you we be go to make it stop who the hell be you my name 's Jacob Hood I be a scientist oh like Nesic no not like Nesic nothing like Nesic Sergeant can I ask you a question I want you to answer very carefully what do you want to happen here how do you want this to play out I need to make it stop I have to keep they from do this to anybody else well in order for that to happen you 've get to focus first you have to let these man go if you kill they it be all over there will not be anything I can do for you I think I understand what be go on in your head every nerve must be scream for you to go into action the urge must be uncontrollable but you be go to have to damp it down somehow use the part of your thought you can control and think it through think about where you be think about what your option be make a choice FBI this man be now in federal custody stand down I repeat stand down it be okay it be over no it be not not until you see this hello Kevin Sergeant Pierce be not come Dr Nesic but he be um kind enough to let I have the missing video what be you do here when he break in he just want to destroy the lab and free the chimp but they attack he so he fight back Dr Miller be work late em hear the commotion what be you do stop well you know result Congratulations you find a way of turn off the conscience Soldiers with no moral or ethical compunction about kill able to act react lightning efficiency say that without the smug self righteous sneer and it sound like a heroic advance to I an advance really do not think you 've give much thought to the long term implication of this you think someone like Pierce will ever be able to reintegrate into society do you even care that you may have destroy a young man 's life I be try to save his life save all of their life do I have to remind you every day soldier die in the field my work will help they to survive oh he will survive no thank to you he be in federal custody Dr Nesic you can tell the caliber of a man by the way he face up to his mistake the bad one always make it bad by try to cover up their track and it be the cover up that bring they down get he out of here Hands behind your back I love you I love you too love you thank for talk I down I just give you a little encouragement you talk yourself down nice work Dr Hood Nesic be go to jail and Sergeant Pierce be go to get the therapy he need to undo what be do to he whatever it take but the program 's go to go on be not it of course if it do not it would mean I be not do my job Super soldier be come Nesic just bend the rule too far even for we you know some people refer to DARPA as a hundred genius connect by a travel agent Truth be we be always on the lookout for number 101 oh thank you Colonel but uh I get a job anyway I prefer to tackle problem create by the world at large rather than problem create by my employer well suit yourself but if you change your mind do not hesitate to get in touch let us leave it this way next time you get yourself in trouble you have my number Tara Tara help help thank Uncle Jacob that be okay ah you 've have this since we be kid remember that you practically sleep with it Yo birthday boy come here oh I get something for you what could that be wow thank do you want

big handcuff well at least tn I would understand why you take the job you know some people might think that special science advisor to the FBI be a kind of cool job you be my big brother you be cool no matter who you work for even if it be the man what you do Uncle Jacob I be wonder what do you think happen if I put this into that shall we see no oh go on wow Awesome how would that happen well I be not really sure but I think you might find the answer on page 29 sorry guy but we 've get to go no why a Tulsa State College student just die of the bend the bend Second this month in Oklahoma think only scuba diver get the bend that be right and Oklahoma 's 500 mile from the near ocean so I guess they be not scuba diving it get well one of the victim could not even swim www 1000fr com present Capture FRM · ëÎµ Sync FRS wdysai ELEVENTH HOUR s01e08 Tulsa International Airport TULSA OKLAHOMA here be our late victim Tara Bingham she die a few hour after get off this plane you see this Rachel it be nitrogen in her heart and lung and liver it be cause by rapid decompression it be uh it be basically it be bubble it be like this uh ginger ale you think this be a fizzy drink right mm hmm right now there be no bubble in it why 'cause the top be keep the ginger ale under pressure the gas be dissolve in the liquid all you need be a sudden drop in pressure and you get the bend nice work sorry I make a bit of a mess there excuse I be you the attendant on this flight yes oh can you tell I do anyone complain about pressure on their um ear or head no there be something she be not tell we O2 go see if there have be rapid decompression that would have happen but it do not so I do not think the plane be our suspect okay back to square one so we will have to start with Tara Bingham a victim from the plane she have a sister who also go to Tulsa State College Mm maybe we can get some detail from her tell you be there something you want to tell we right before her seizure she be in the galley with a guy they be make a sandwich what join the Mile High Club who be the guy in the gospel group 21c Wade Earlham thank you thank you Mile High Club do they really use that expression do not knock it till you try it Rachel but it be actually six mile not one way to go Hood I be impressed Special Agent Young Dr Hood I be Blake Miller Tulsa State College 's Head of Security and a former FBI agent I 've read your file why the change of career uh less stress more stability besides I I use to play football here I find out that the first victim Tom Cassidy stay on campus during the break and move into a new apartment that be about it he do not go anywhere or do anything that would cause a pressure change we would like to talk to Tara Bingham 's sister Vivian and to Wade Earlham yeah they be probably over at Tara 's memorial right here hello hi this be Dr Hood I be Special Agent Rachel Young very sorry about what happen to your sister look like a lot of people love her Loving Tara be not difficult she be always fun you know a happy person we just want to know what happen to Tara we be try to piece together the day before she die we know she be at the choir competition in Reno with her boyfriend Wade Earlham actually we be hope he might be here no um Wade have not leave his dorm room since Tara thank you we spend the whole time in Reno just study she have her psych paper and I preppe for my calculus final but we even pull two all nighter drag our tired butt to the rehearsal and the concert I be Phi Beta Kappa and she be um she be on track to be in next year for sure well you definitely get a 4 0 in lie I I I do not know what you be talk about Zolpidem Prescription 's in your name you fill it last week there should be 30 pill I count ten and people abuse sleep pill be usually try to come down 'cause they be wire on some other drug look Tara and I be in love I mean but do drug have sex on airplane that do not really go with the whole Phi Beta Kappa choir thing you know about that now Wade we need to find out what happen to Tara before it happen to someone else if you care about she like you say you do then you would help we I oh s sorry buy them in Reno the guy say that they be brand new just synthesize and he tell I that they make sex incredible yeah but probably not worth die for I do not recognize this symbol he call it Pearl do you think that those pill kill Tara well if they do and that be still an if then you will be in danger too need to get you under medical supervision can we get he to the college clinic please we need to get to the morgue immediately why well I do not think bubble hang around long in corpse bubble in body be always nitrogen what you be propose be medically impossible not impossible unprecedented now Wade say that Pearl make sex incredible and you think it make an excess of nitric oxide in the blood and nitric oxide be uh it be the body 's natural chemical signal and uh open up the artery and flood the tissue with blood I will be damn the bubble in Tara Bingham be nitric oxide produce so much nitric oxide it overwhelm Tara 's blood make bubble which become the bend just like the ginger ale but without the pressure change exactly well we have a new recreational drug and it be a killer let us find out what it be make of you play like a six year old if I dedicate one tenth as much time to this game as you do I would kick your sorry ass you know what I be go out for a run yeah if I dedicate one tenth the amount of time that you spend work out then I would whoop your sorry ass then tag along Man for real when be the last time you break a sweat man since you grow hair on your little chest hey well look I prefer brain sweat all right that be it you be come with I or this Xbox go to charity hey it be just two mile if you can handle it can you handle it yeah I can handle it can you handle it I can handle it all right you know screw that let us do ten mile Nah man we get team film to watch tonight Texas run this spread offense it be super hard to read so I get to study up on it not worried about that but I do smell Smell that Ooh smell like cotton candy or something it be the the Cotton Bowl baby the Cotton Bowl baby first time in Tulsa history yes baby Aah be you ready come on I be I be all ready right on man you be do great I get to get back though no no one more lap whoever lose do laundry for a month Isaac come on man you all right Isaac hey what be wrong help Isaac stay with I Come on come on help help come on let us get he stable easy easy now push two more mig Lorazepam get he into a pressure chamber what be you do here FBI we be notify you have a patient with bend like seizure get he into a pressure chamber hopefully we will shrink the bubble and we can stop his seizure this be a land lock state we do not have a pressure chamber this be Special Agent Rachel Young I need to find a decompression chamber ASAP no Florida be too far look into Texas Galveston Port Arthur get it here now pressure stop the seire well I wish it be that simple we 've rule out pressure change as a cause this be just a temporary solution if Isaac 's body keep on make bubble we be go to have to keep on lower the pressure there be only so low we can go before the pressure kill he so how do we stop Pearl from churn out nitric oxide we do not Pearl be not our problem just get the chem analysis back uh crystalline solid disaccharide it be table sugar Pearl be a total fake common narcotic scam right dealer seek out a na ve mark like Wade take his money leave he with a dud well the clinic 's release he at least he be out of danger yeah that leave we at zero the victim have to have something more in common study Xbox sleeping and more Xbox Isaac 's sort of be in that routine since our folk die what happen drunk driver he walk away without a scratch Dr Hood Isaac be all I 've get so I need you to be straight with I what be go to happen to he well Isaac 's suffering from somethinge've never see before so I honestly can not tell you but we be do everything we can to find out what it be other than the run you take have he change his routine in any way no let us go go ahead Lawrence right there he can hear you just talk hey bro should not you be at practice come on with you in there like that what kind of brother you think I be Isaac it be not your fault bro or maybe it be maybe you owe I front row seat at the Cotton Bowl Lawrence go play Mom and Dad would have want you to yeah take care of he we will do everything we can so Lawrence Richmond be a big football star so it would seem you play any sport in college um throw the occasional Frisbee count as a sport it be kind of a sport I guess yeah well my dad do not think so he be a high school football coach so naturally he want a jock and wind up with I well we have that in common really how so my dad want a son to follow in his legendary FBI agent footstep and instead he get I so anything you need we will have it bring in oh and the uh Coast Guard guy hook we up with this Thanks Agent Miller Blake Right Blake Hood what be you think hi um I be think uh there be another connection here Tara collapse after sex Isaac Richmond after jog and Tom Cassidy collapse move heavy furniture into an apartment that be it physical exertion but that do not cause nitric oxide bubble do it no but maybe the physical exertion trigger what do cause the bubble I think exercise be suppose to be good for you yeah but exercise can sometimes worsen a viral infection do you mind if I uh yeah right here thank you um Isaac uh yeah it be uh Jacob Hood yeah I want to ask you a question have you have a cold recently no I 've be fine I get a flu shot and everything all three victim get flu shot so you think this flu shot vaccine be mutate to make nitric oxide Crazy amount of nitric oxide here be what we have leave over thank you um I get to ask you what you be talk about that be a theory right you sound like the administration worried about liability too of course not it be just we give out over 4 000 of these flu shot we will need all those record Coach say take it easy all right rest up for the big game how be the knee it be still bug I yeah so let I help little shot of cortisone might help that Nah man I be good yeah why leave it to chance hear there be a couple pro scout come to this game all right you be right man Lawrence you know you be single handedly lift TSC out of the second tier right Cotton Bowl here you go just make sure you do not forget about we when you go pro all right what be you do man you crazy come anywhere near here well look Ellis we get to delay phase two what be you talk about I think you say we be good to go New and improve you say you uh you do not start do you you let I worry about that hey why do you want to delay the FBI 's on campus Ellis they be ask question smart question we drop Isaac down to 300 foot because the seizurescame back just like you predict it be not a time I want to be right they be all normal Whatever be cause the bubble it be definitely not the flu vaccine but something be make enough nitric oxide to kill they Rachel Dr Hood Dr Cogan ask I to give you this virology report on 3 victim ' blood thank it be a virus it be just not the flu there be not even a trace of actual flu vaccine in tara 's blood work mean someone switch the flu vaccine with something else pretty big mistake unless it be not a mistake you be say this be intentional I be say it be murder thank for let we access your genetics lab Dr Ruscillo what exactly be we look at here Bioterrorism well we do not know yet but um two student be dead one 's fighting for his life as we speak so we have to decode this dna and we need on everyone who administer flu shot you be read my mind okay well bring I up to speed here Dr Hood healthy student get inject with that it be dormant for a couple of week then the student exercise all of a sudden there be enough nitric oxide in their blood to kill they be you familiar with gene therapy yeah take dna piggyback it onto a virus catch a cold cure a genetic problem do not they do it with uh hemophiliac give they the gene that clot blood exactly this be the virus for gene therapy target at muscle yeah that be all the student volunteer who administer flu shot clean file on all of they four of they take genetic course but that be no big thing since they work in student health we will question they all in the morning start with those four yeah Tougdetail Mmm Fascinating detail I mean Hood be very smart yes very smart but you know you be not so bad yourself oh thank yeah creative intuitive Pretty I know you be go to say that you do Intuitive yeah nice no I be I be talk about the the detail you know the grind the road the endless hotel bed and you know rental car Mmm it be all a blur no it be it be hard when I get back to my real life you know yeah I hear you I mean uh no that be that be what end my marriage part of the reason why I wound up here how be we suppose to have relationship in this job well I guess you you take what you can get and be thankful that make we sound despere not I I be a civilian now I I have a a car oh right and an apartment your own bed yeah it be nice must be nice text message from Hood yeah I can not bear this much low the pressure be go to kill he if only there be some way to take the dna out add gene be the new biomedical revolution remove they we just do not know how to do yet yeah I know hey hey do you identify your carbonate dna we do it be two gene one gene make nitric oxide the other one act like a control knob turn on the nitric oxide in response to lactic acid that be what you get when you exercise right exactly I think this be a gene dope give athlete and improve they but with this gene dope there be a design flaw which make it deadly cause when the virus migrate if you get a flu in your nose it be a cold get in your lung it be pneumonia this gene take a detour and end up in the artery should have be in the muscle make superior athlete like a steroid well than that see the thing with gene dope as oppose to steroid it should be undetectable those athlete out there they want to transform themselves into greek god have something like this in your muscle like have an extra pair of leg wait be I crazy or be one of our four flu shot volunteer a sport medicine major do you remember this guy Dylan Petraneck the guy who have access to the flu shot at the medical center but it do not make sense none of the ctim be athlete why dope they how you hold up Viv okay I guess I just I just miss sister be all I know listen Viv there be something I get to tell you Life at 800 foot underwater not so bad I think I be go to enlist on a Navy submarine when I get out of here you will get out Isaac you do know that right absolutely I be just glad I be I in here and not my brother neither of you should be in there I know but my brother 's talented special I check you out you be an American Engineering Club scholar Most people here do not even know what that be well they should it be pretty impressive what maybe 20 student in the country get that scholarship Twelve exactly they go on to make building tall and bridge safe and may not be as glamorous as other job but do not mean it be less important thank how you hold up not so good I will I will be well tomorrow though I will have someone roll up a tv to this porthole so we can watch my brother kick ass on that field Isaac hang in there okay Dylan Petraneck FBI open up Petraneck Blake check this out Lawrence Richmond Isaac 's brother Vivian Bingham Tara 's sister Andrew Cassidy brother of the first victim Son of a bitch I be go to call Hood yeah Hood all of the victim have sibling who be athlete similar genetic similar result they be guinea pig Dylan 's testing his gene dope right on someone more disposable to they than an hlete a regular student no one notice if something go wrong but a star athlete under constant scrutiny that be a different matter sibling have the close blood relation make sense I will call you back get this our victim be test subject for Dylan 's deadly gene dope unwitte test subject Isaac think he get a flu shot but do the athlete know well at least one of they do take a look at that Olympic Diver 's dream die in Steroid Scandal Tara 's sister Vivian already bust for dope Along come the promise of an undetectable gene dope Irresistible she greenlight the test on Tara and end up sacrifice she in the process you you tell I it be harmless Dylan say it be we have to make sure it do not show up on any test before we give it to you but it kill her Ellis oh my God oh my God those FBI people need to know this because I 've get to tell they no you be not tell anybody okay you make a choice Vivian you do you jump at our offer confirm that it be undetectable so that you could keep dope without risk your scholarship your olympic bid you tell it would be safe I think it would be okay honestly Viv if I could give you your gene dope and your scholarship and your sister and an Olympic gold medal all without any risk I would but I be not a miracle worker and if you go squeal your scholarship be the least of our problem if I have think that there would be any risk it be not like I want she to die either okay we will get through this together I be worre the press under 900 foot under the water Agent Young it be close 2 maximum it be a gene dope that kill my sister Tara viv come on I do this for you Ellis brockton and dylan petraneck be the ringleader Un send and delete I have a feeling she know what happen to her sister and this confirm it yeah I think you be right this be not grief this be guilt this be screw up Ellis Viv 's dead uh the feds search my apartment now they be look for I relax okay listen to I we will say that Viv plant the stuff in your apartment I will hack she e mail again send out a new and improved suicide note she can take credit for all this we play this right it will all look like athlete test their sibling with gene dope they want for themselves Nobody'll know where they get it we can regroup improve the product and try it somewhere else all right you you really think this will work you think Viv 's way be a well option huh no team win all the time on Hail Marys Dylan this be our Hail Mary be he go to die I do not know Lawrence I be work with the school 's top geneticist to undo what be be do to he how much do you want to win this season Lawrence enough to take a performance enhance drug regiman what be you talk about an undetectable gene dope maybe you agree to test it on your brother maybe you think it would not hurt he Football 's all you get be not it you win everything change for the well stop win you be just another college jock who do not quite have what it take to go pro you be wrong Isaac be all I get yeah all right we just pick up petraneck at a bus station he be try to sneak out of town no I do not I do not know what that be even though we find it at your apartment someone must have plant it in my apartment I will tell you what why do not we try it out on you and we will find out exactly what it do huh no no all right all right you sure all right some of the jock they want I to test the gene dope on their brother and sister so they would not get catch if it do not work include Lawrence Richmond then why have you test it on his brother Isaac Lawrence be our meal ticket the close thing to a superstar TSC 's get if I could bring it to he fully test if my dope make he into one of the very good there would be no limit Next stop other co pro even and no limit to how much money you would have make either it be not just about the money it be about science I be a scientist but your gene dope do not work do it Dylan three people be dead because of it and Isaac Richmond be die as we speak we never uh want anyone to get hurt we who be we Dylan or would you rather just sit in a cell alone it be up to you sit in a cell sit in a cell that be it Dr Ruscillo could not we make a new gene that would sit in the artery cell and trick the control knob gene into think the lactic acid be low and stop the gene dope from produce nitric oxide I do not see why not it be just add a gene Mm hmm all right Dylan I be go to ask you one last time who be we he be the only one who ever believe in I believe in my work give I a name Ellis stop FBI Ellis Brockton you be under arrest be you sure about this do not have time to be sure put in the oxygene it would take he 5 min to equalize the chamber I 've get he at a thousand fe Dr Hood 'cause right now that be the only way we can keep he alive but a healthy person should not be do this I be well aware of the risk Officer thank you when I 've get you down to depth you can twist that lever and go to the next chamber just get I down there quickly please Lawrence you can not play what be you talk about listen to I listen to I you 've be inject with the same thing Isaac have Ellis Brockton confess that he give you a shot of cortisone yeah but it

girl then we be look at sexually transmit infection that instantly slow their heartbeat down to next to nothing well yeah it be possible could be toxic shock syndrome which could result from uh bacteria pass through intercourse could lead to heart and lung failure even coma I will have Dr Simone check for it if it be that what wake he up from the coma well find the girl they sleep with we

believe there be two of they um Tabitha I be not a police officer I be not really sure how to ask you this but um I need to know something about your sexual history what I be sorry um those two boy may have contract a sexually transmit disease and we do not know where it be from but I can count on my hand how many people that I 've have sex with I be tell you I be not this girl I be not this girl we believe you okay we believe you okay I be go to take you to the hospital now okay let us go do you want we to call your parent do we have to no we do not have to I think you should I think they would want to know so they can be here for you I doubt that just keep walk babe but that be that be one of they I know it be okay all right it be okay you all right Tabitha Son of a bitch he act like nothing have ever ever happen Tabitha we need a doctor over here now Pulse ox tank she be asystole let us go Nope she be get a heartbeat that be just a residual sir please stand back no it be not I do not think shock she be go to help I already tell you stand back Dr Simone Dr Simone please Defibrillation do nothing for Lenny or Greg this be no different Clear stop the heartbeat 's regular but impossibly slow five beat per minute that be why the medic think Greg and Lenny be dead five beat a minute that be like one beat every 12 second what be her body temperature it be only 75 seventy five it be as if she be turn ectothermic well that be not consistent with toxic shock syndrome it be not consistent with anything else I 've ever encounter either any body that be that cold with a heartbeat that slow that be not a coma that be suspend animation excuse I can you help we we be try to find our daughter Tabitha Jackson oh uh I be Special Agent Young I be the one who call you yesterday your daughter be stable now let I walk you to her room yes please thank you that be great yeah that be all right you get to flip he all right flip it Let us see oh all right come on down the hatch I can not yes you can come on drink up Belinda oh you have to oh I know I know rule be rule but I think the rule be Come on come on Less thinking more drinking see it be not that bad right hey uh I just get the weird message from our boy Lenny say Greg be dead all right I be not getting punke again by that dude remember April Fools yeah you be probably right yeah and hey you know what if they want to miss out on this fine by I More for we absolutely boo yah I hate play king I love play you only two king tonight sweetheart Lucky for you we know how to treat a queen oh yeah let I show you oh hi Rachel you do not mind if I call you Rachel do you Agent Young Good news for both of we Lenny you seem to be fine so you be no long under federal supervision but the nurse say you 've be harass they so my advice to you be stay out of trouble or next time you will not be in a hospital bed you will be in jail God you be beautiful a woman like you FBI agent Bet you 've be through a lot huh you know after my brush with death the thing that I 've see the friend that I lose it be not a doctor that I need if you know what I mean ow I do not know what turn I on more the fact that you might be disease or that you get a girl drunk so you and your buddy could gang bang her you be a bitch and I be out of here Lenny be suffer from something call necrotize fasciitis more commonly know as flesh eat bacteria sound almost as disgusting as it look what cause it well actually it be the same strep a bacteria that cause common disease like tonsillitis and strep throat change of plan we be go somewhere else pet store now little known fact about strep a bacteria in addition to cause necrotize fasciitis it naturally produce hydrogen sufide watch this uh Hood you can wake he up right no I just murder he what kind of scientist do you think I be Rachel no at this dosage all hydrogen sulfide do be induce a state of suspend animation just like Lenny and Greg and now Tabitha Jackson Mickey 's breathing be reduce to just a few breath a minute his metabolism slow to a crawl when normal air be reintroduce Mickey Mickey come back to life so someone dose our victim with hydrogen sulfide gas not really I think the strep a bacteria in their body somehow directly release hydrogen sulfide into their bloodstream suspend animation that be right so you be tell I that if we revive Tabitha Jackson she will come down with a case of necrotize fasciitis it be quite simple think of it as a two stage process like a cavity in a tooth stage one be just a hole without intervention it proceed to stage two when infection set in it spread out until it devour everything so we need to prevent Tabitha Jackson 's case from develop to stage two keep she in suspend animation yeah until we find out what be cause it and we can find out how to stop it and we do this by prolong her current state well it do not appear to be cause any long term damage to the body so far well I suppose we could try ice water immersion we have a few tub in the back we could use one of those good keep she as cold as possible listen we be smack in the middle of spring break if this thing be spread through sexual contact you well start prepare for a lot more case just like Tabitha Belinda be you okay Belinda you get a condom oh come on Kayla you do not need protection from I sorry babe no condom no nasty Lucky you wake up sexy hey hey wake up oh my God oh my God help somebody help we help so I be not go to get sick not from Seth thank to the fact that you be responsible enough to use some protection guess my party be over huh for now screen your call let I guess the dog sitter she be a professor of psychiatry actually so be you see she no she be a friend of my wife I mean as a psychiatrist no no not that either when be you go to tell she the dog be just a ruse to spend more time with her Tanner be not a ruse could have fool I wait a second several case of a deadly form of flesh eat bacteria be report in Daytona Beach today the bacteria be believe to spread through sexual contact to prevent a possible epidemic the County be prohibit the service of alcohol after 8 00 p M and the 10 00 p M curfew be be enforce on all resident of Voluisa County include spring break visitor I be glad to see the local health department be comply with our request but it be not enough yeah we have two more victim in suspend animation Belinda Shea and Seth Sandel how be they hold up well we be monitor their vital continually to prevent hypothermia so far so good you get any more tub no we be not equip to handle this sort of thing on a large scale it may be get large well what can we do our entire infrastructure be build around maintain a body temperature of 98 6 not 70 with one pretty major exception what be the cold place in the building the temperature at our morgue be keep at a constant 36 degree at all time she look like she be already dead she be not Mr Jackson this could help keep she alive if she wake up now she be go to be in terrible danger but if we can somehow crack the code of the bacteria that make she sick we should be able to engineer a cure how long would that take I wish I know Rachel sit down I want to show you something this be the DNA sequence of normal strep A this be the DNA sequence of the new bacteria it look a lot short yeah it be a lot simple too it be get less than half the number of base pair what do that mean it be get no junk dna the portion of the DNA that serve no identifiable purpose every natural organism have junk dna so the bacteria infect the kid be manmade yeah the good thing about that be if someone create it then we will know how to destroy it I be go to have the hospital geneticist build I a gene map of the bacteria it be kind of a like a forensic scientist put together the piece of an exploded bomb if we do that we will have a shot at trace it to its creator exactly any sign of flesh eat bacteria no so far so good wait what be it the autopsy photo of our first victim Greg McCarthy I remember something Hood all the male victim have the same dagger and cherry tattoo I look into it it be not a fraternity tattoo it be get nothing to do with Maryland State University or any of its sport team the dagger and cherry when these guy be so proud of take advantage of young woman maybe one of they cross the line got bust I be go to have the National Crime Information Center do a cross search of all our male victim and sex crime what be this Hot off the press Gene map of our manmade bacteria our bone part that be right now every gene here have a purpose see as it be build and design for a reason so what have we get we get resistance to ultraviolet ray resistance to radiation tolerance for oxygen loss tolerance for extreme cold what be it Space the suspend animation this bacteria cause could conceivably allow someone to survive long period in space be you say our bomb be build by NASA it be not about FLORIDA SAPCE CENTER I be shock you find Chronos X Coli outside these wall Chronos X Coli it be the name of hydrogen sulfide produce bacteria X as in experimental and Chronos as in the greek god of time exactly our goal here be to enable astronaut to travel to destination that would otherwise remain out of reach now we may not see spaceflight utilize suspend animation in our own lifetime but our child will well unfortunately there be a few college age child who will not Dr West and it appear to be associate with the work you be do in this lab I be sorry this be the Space Science Center not some biological warfare facility in the former Soviet Union my people do not sell their ware on the black market and while the bacteria find in your victim do match Chronos X Coli Chronos X Coli be not design to cause necrotize fasciitis and that be actually what be harm your victim not suspend animation there be no record of a break in or report of steal material in the past three year that be 'cause like I say that kind of thing do not happen here Dr West when I be analyze your Chronos X Coli 's dna there be one gene I could not quite work out it be an apoptotic gene I think it be a build in failsafe the gene design to initiate cell suicide exactly your build in self destruct mechanism yeah well right now we have innocent victim that be lie in hospital and there be a possibility that your failsafe could help cure they tell we how it work I wish I could help you Dr Hood I truly do but I can not national security regulation make it impossible the information you be ask for fall under the head federal proprietary technology and I can not share that with you you understand young people 's life be at risk yes I be aware of that I be also aware that we do not pick and choose where we want the law to apply it apply all the time or it mean nothing it apply until we get a federal court order that say it do not hopefully no one else will be dead by then we will see ourselves out how long be it go to take to get a court order if thing work out we could have it by midnight let us hope this be Agent Young okay thank got it get this it turn out Lenny Reese his buddy Greg McCarthy and our late victim Seth Sandel be all accuse of gang rape a girl here in Daytona during spring break last year and they all get off so maybe it be not an epidemic maybe it be revenge if that be the case it be not over yet there be a fourth suspect accuse of the same crime Rapist or not we well find he before the killer do yeah the victim include three male student visit from Maryland State University we be report from Daytona Community Hospital back to you you walk away from I ha yes hey he be dead we will contact his family Dr Hood four accuse rapist Lenny and Greg be dead and one in suspend animation Seth Sandel what do we know about the fourth his name be Derek Kenin he attend Maryland State with Lenny Greg and Seth rape charge be throw out due to lack of evidence the victim be local that be right Julia Taylor age 19 if anyone want revenge it would be her yeah but I doubt a 19 year old would have be able to get around the federal wall of proprietary technology or convert Chronos X Coli into a biological weapon maybe she have help so Julia Taylor still live at home you go through that kind of trauma you just look for someplace safe I do not understand the case be close we 've reopen it two of the four accuse be dead a third be very sick so you be not here about the rape you be investigate murder two murder possibly more wait a minute you think Julia have something to do with this Mrs Taylor Unbelievable you be treat my daughter as a suspect here be your suspect why do not you lock she up and throw away the key I be sorry Mrs Taylor we do not know the D A say it would just be he say she say she take it really hard blame herself it take so much just to come forward and then to be label a slut and a liar the doctor give she a prescription for her depression but it do not work she start drink instead one night she drink too much and try to drive home crash into a divider and never wake up so you bring her home this be well for she anyway to be where she be love this be all her stuff yes would you mind no Pure silica fiber it be light enough for flight but strong enough for withstand G force Mrs Taylor this be a space shuttle tile do you know anyone who work at NASA my ex husband it be a gift from he Julia 's father Henry Henry West yes excuse I this be Special Agent Young I need to locate Dr Henry West I be really sorry for any trouble we 've cause I wish you and your daughter well thank you all right keep I post West disappear he leave the lab and have not go home that be why he stonewall we with his daughter in a coma I guess it seem appropriate put the rapist in the same state then administer a flesh eat disease to ravager of the flesh they do not get it quite right innocent girl be die there be no justice in that maybe he be not aware of the potential for sexual transmission or maybe he just do not care I have the Bureau track the gps on Derek Kenin 's cell phone Derek 's the only rape suspect who have not be infect yet we find he we find West no I can not wait until tomorrow I need to go home now okay all right what about a different airline well can not you just do something I mean all right just listen to I just listen to I okay listen to I no please do not put I on hold come on do not move stay back stay back Dr West you be too late it be over he be the last one stay back my little girl be go my life be just a memory everything I 've do I be not sorry tell I about the fail safe how do the organism destroy itself tell I why so you can save a bunch of rapist no no no Dr West no Hood I need two ambulance 415 River Street Shark Cove Hotel now you infect more than rapists Henry the infection spread through sexual contact those boy they infect at least two innocent girl girl just like your daughter Julia these girl they have nothing to do with what happen to Julia they do not deserve to suffer any more than she do come on this can not be what you want what you need a pen here you go you want to write on my hand okay be that an a Ag the periodic table of element Ag be the symbol for silver be it silver it be call colloidal silver until the 1930 it be quite a widely use antibiotic now it be more commonly know as a dietary supplement but its value here be as a trigger for the fail safe gene inside the bacteria it should cause the bacteria to destroy itself the only thing be for the silver to work um the blood need to circulate so we be go to have to wake they up but if we wake they up then we wake up the flesh eat bacteria and then they they die be not that what you tell we before Personally I believe it be worth the risk well it be be 48 hour and there be no sign of the fleshate bacteria on any of the victim Dr Hood thank for everything I be sorry I ever doubt you oh I understand what I be suggest do sound a little crazy I be just glad your daughter 's okay will you excuse I there be something I have to do thank again PALO ALTO CALIFORNIA come on Tanner Hey buddy Anna yeah it be Jacob

let us go home sorry I be late Dr Hood Agent Young Gill Strickland I be an epidemiologist with the Texas Center for infectious Diseases well so far it seem that we have 23 case of what you would call aberrant behavior now that be your folk uh disrobe in public walk into traffic run around Costco say they be the president and the violent behavior nine case that all start about the same time so we be think they be relate what be your hypothesis we get a group of unrelated people behave strangely for no apparent reason they test negative for drug their psychic come in fine just a few hour later good thing I can come up with be encephalitis but you be not sure or we would not be here Encephalitis be a swelling of the brain cause by well lot of thing um viruse bacteria even parasite it make it hard to test for with any accuracy but psychosis be one of the symptom be not it in extreme case I 've see it manifest with some odd behavior some confusion but we be talk about folk violently attack complete stranger I 've never see that especially not in individual with uh no prior history of antisocial behavior the bad part be there be no pattern here I mean all these case seem totally random and you know that be the tough sort of crime to prevent have you test for uh rabie Distemper yeah no positive and we be sure it be not drug we test they for everything we could think of and we get zip plus we get no history of substance abuse in any of the perpetrator actually Gill that be not the case any more say here you serve six month in 2005 for buy Roxicodone with a fake scrip no I be clean now I have not have so much as an aspirin in 16 month I have to do it for my wife and my baby boy and I need to see they be Ashley here yet can I see she your wife come by about an hour ago to pick up

like I be outside myself it be like when I use to party but more intense I do not know that guy behind I in line be be such a jerk and I I be so tired and Troy be he be grind my last nerve and I do not know I just I just lose it Mr Filmore I 've see a lot of addict like you you get sober just long enough to work your way back into your family and then you tear they apart all over again that be not true they test I and I be clean right okay um the truth be there have be other case of unexplained behavior in the area and we do not know what cause it when that doc come to take my blood I hear he say Encephalitis mm hmm that be fatal right right yeah it can be but just because you test positive today do not mean it will not come up negative in one or two day ' time Encephalitis be um it be basically a symptom it can be cause by any number of underlying issue just be straight with I man do I freak out in that supermarket mean I be go to go die we do not know yet Rachel you okay yeah why would not I be well he be have a tough time you could have cut he a little slack Hood in my experience addict be all the same for every one that break the cycle of dependency there be 1 000 more out there ruin life destroy family commit murder okay well um the only thing our 32 victim perpetrator have in common be they come from this area three of they from a five block radius the answer be get to be here somewhere well this environment be hot it be humid Low ground Plenty of open pool and fountain ideal habitat for mosquito which can carry Encephalitis true but despite what the medium say mosquito be far more likely to infect bird than human hey little buddy your mama home may I help you sorry to bother you ma'am we be just go to be do some work out here tonight got to replace some malfunction pressure gauge all through the neighborhood will there still be water in the house sorry no not till we be do working ma'am the Department of Water and Power be sorry to inconvenience here be some earplug we will get finish up as soon as we can okay buddy okay let us set up and start dig to we it feel like mosquito exist just to make our life miserable but the truth be we be their second choice they would much rather be feed on bird Viral encephalitis be primarily an avian disease a mosquito bite an infected bird it become a lifelong carrier pass it along to every other bird it feed on and then those bird get bite by other mosquito and then those mosquito pass it on to more bird and so on and so forth but generally a bird population develop an immunity to the local mutation of the virus and it do not get affect anymore so we be look for new bird uh huh any new flock appear lately Mm hmm society finche they be migratory flock have be show up since the beginning of the month right around the time our unexpected behavior start well finch be know carrier of encephalitis have you test these yeah we sample all incoming population for infectious disease include encephalitis these guy just test negative a couple of hour ago so they be set for rerelease in a tomorrow so we be say now it be not encephalitis yeah that be what we be say Dr Hood Dr Hood Agent Young I be glad I catch you Mr Strickland be everything okay I want uh second round of test come in on the 32 perp no positive for encephalitis not rabie not dis distemper nothing People want to hurt I excuse I you come here to help they to make I look like an idiot Idiot he be hallucinate People be talk Mr Strickland who be talk I could hear they Mr Strickland there be no one else here just stay calm and we will get some help for you oh please do not they be come for I Mr Strickland I get to protect myself I get to protect myself Mr Strickland Calm down Shut up you bastard bastard leave I

he be state we be federal thank I will have Strickla 's autopsy report in a couple of day and I be go to ask for his medical record and any recent purchase he make on his credit card Rachel Sunscreen and bug repellent contain deet a know psychotropic in high enough dose yeah we use military grade DEET at Quantico make some of the recruit sick scary stuff and effective maybe it be not the mosquito cause this mass psychosis maybe it be what people be use to keep they away could it be a bad batch I be more worried about this hmm what be a nanoparticle a nanoparticle be uh it be a tiny tiny piece of well just about anything right and um cosmetic company like they because they be uh easy to absorb and they make their product feel less greasy Problem be sometimes they can be so small the particle travel right through the skin directly into the body itself so if this lotion make DEET into nanoparticle whoever be use this could be absorb it at much high dose than intend excuse I excuse I be there a problem can I help you I be Agent Rachel Young of the FBI this be my colleague Dr Jacob Hood we will need receipt for all purchase make of this product in the last month we 've only be sell that item for three week now Great then mine your sale record from your system will not be too difficult will it it be a test product we be the only one in the Austin area who carry it so far it be be a pretty good seller the state police will be here soon they will need to take all remain stock into custody the manufacturer pay we to sell this stuff I can not just stop sell it until I check with my corporate office first how do corporate feel about people try to kill each other with their bare hand on store property get this product off your shelf now please I miss daddy I know you do honey do you miss he of course but the most important thing be we'reonna be fine just the two of we like pea in a pod now let us put in some earplug for the noise outside tonight okay those worker might be here pretty late all right sweetheart good night how many house we get line on after this one two more confirmed after that we be fly blind until we get a lead on that distributor yeah yeah I buy some of this stuff I never get a chance to use it though that be not what you want to hear huh I be sorry well than if you lie to I Hmm I 've make my amend I be do lie I 've recommend you be release contingent on regular drug test okay I do not know what to say do not say anything just do not make I look bad that be a promise hey hi Greg Filmore buy the sunscreen but he didn'use it any luck with the receipt look like Sun N Shoo be not the common nominator you be positive yeah cross reference the booking record and the grocery receipt only four of the 23 people bring in for erratic behavior purchase the product Hang on look like they all buy something else what Travis Springs bottled water Travis Springs do not Strickland have a bottlef Travis Springs when he go crazy hi how be it test uh it be a little acidic go to have to up the filtration uh excuse I but who be you FBI Mr Driggs we be here to ask you a few question about your operation I do not know the feds have an interest in bottled water well we do when the people who drink it be go crazy what be you talk about not exactly the mountain spring I be expect bottled water be one of the least regulate industry in the country it be mostly just tap water so this be the same thing that come out of the tap in people 's home at a buck 50 a bottle not a bad markup if you can get it and what come out of the tap that be get all kind of crap in it fluoride ammonium chlorine Nitric acid and how be your water any different I filter out the chemical and restorit to its pure state my water be as clean and refreshing as a mountain spring even if it do not start out that way what be your source the county reservoir they be do another chlorine burn to kill off bacteria this week keep the tap water clean okay but it taste terrible just another reason why people drink bottled water how often do the treatment center do the chlorine burn several time a month during the rainy season the rain can wash all kind of nasty contaminant down into the reservoir which be very good for business excuse we a second what be it Chlorine uh kill bacteria which for drink water it be a really good thing but chlorine be also really good at um combine itself with whatever it touch so there be a possibility that some kind of uh chemical combination be what be cause all this psychosis excuse I can you get I a sample of your filter water and your source water please sure okay well I be go to go test this water all right I will be next door check out Gill Strickland 's paper trail I will let you know if anything turn up that sound good Agent Young just one bottle of Travis Springs be you sure okay get it what get away Hood what be go on if Krauss be correct then we appear to be live in the bad of all possible universe but if Dyson be correct then the universe be recede into the threshold of the unknowable but if Witten be correct then all matter will dissolve into nothingness Hood the universe be die and we be l alone Hood it be I Rachel you be not alone stay back do not come any close they tell I about you do not come any close listen to I right now you be not yourself Hood do not come any close stay away please Hood ah I just want to help you Hood Hood Hood I just I just want to make sure you be okay Jacob Jacob look at I Rachel I be right here Rachel I be not alone no no you be not I be not

you yeah so there be three other case pick up by Austin PD last night right around the time of your my freakout yeah your freakout do you remember anything well I be in the shower and suddenly everything go really really weird I mean it be I think maybe there be something in the water that be come through my mucous membrane my skin because the onset be so fast it be like pow okay but if it be in the water supply then would not it have affect the whole area well excuse I it be uh most definitely not in the reservoir 'cause I test the water last night but I do not know about that why 'cause last night I find out that Gill Strickland 's hotel bill show that he only purchase one bottle of Travis Springs I be think that he be refill it in the sink you be take a shower he be drink out of the tap it be get to be the water but if it be in the tap water but it be not in the reservoir then then something be happen to the water in between in the pipe we get to get on this Rachel yeah do I do uh anything or say anything you know weird last night not really except the break dance nice to have you back Hood thank you good to be back stop Someone 's be dig trench here this be a new development why would you dig up pipe on a brand new house you would not but this might help we find out why I would say it be from a water pipe what be you do here Gre Daddy hey buddy how you do come here Troy well I I want to see you and Troy and uh look I want to say that I be what Greg you be sorry for be in jail I just I just need you and Troy to know that you do not need to be afraid of I okay stop Greg just stop I file for a restraining orr please just listen even the FBI say say it be not my fault but God know in the past I 've give you reason to be real mad I know that but I be clean Ash for 16 month now I get my my plumbing coany up and run and what what Greg and I want to come home to my family to my life Th 's all they say it be not your fault you 've see the news all kind of people act crazy lately Ash I can not do this again Greg keep away from we or I will the police Ashley Nice family do what we say you might get to see they again if our victim do not have clean background what would you say these random outburst point to it be a no brainer drug but these people be not drug user Hood you be not a drug user remember the Salem witch trial yeah sure uh puritan repression teenage girl freak out and see witch we read the Crucible in tenth grade well some historian now believe that those uh bewitch girl be actually eat grain taint with a naturally occur hallucinogenic compound so they be trip maybe be you say there be some kind of hallucinogen in the pipe well I be say that the most logical explanation be usually the right one and if people be act like they be on drug then chance be they be on drug whether they know it or not hey I think we be do talk you be not under suspicion Mr Driggs but we need your help do you have any small scale filter equient here in your office yeah I test our sample every couple of hour that be much more often than the water treatment plant well that be very good um can I borrow an Erlenmeyer flask right over here Great thank you that be very helpful and um a funnel please thank you some filter paper ashless please you get it Jatorial closet yeah can I sure thank you Perfect Mind if I sit down Bleach yeah six percent solution of sodm hypochlorite or half the percentage use in the chlorine burn take our water pipe add the chlorine Stirred not shake what be it do hopefully it be make whatever happen to the pipe after the chlorine burn happen for we now that ought to do it if the chlorine do manage to pull some kind of drug out of the pipe whoever drink the water or bathe in it immediately afterwards would have be affect by it now whatever be in this solution be what will have be ingest by our victim include I if there be drug in the pipe why would all the victim ' drug test come back negative because plastic be so good at leach onto other substance alter the compound now chemically speak what we get out of this will not be exactly the same as heroin or cocaine but it will be similar enough to get you high but different enough to fool a drug test exactly Phencyclidine the pipe be embed with PCP Rachel it be not like I be an expert on street drug but do not pcp go out of style with Deep Purple and Pet Rocks well angel dust be off the market but PCP be make a major comeback Street gang make it into pill or soak marijuana in it then distribute via exist cocaine connection so if the pipe be a way of transport the drug how have they end up in the ground probably a mix up Drug lace pipe somehow got swap with the real ping and White Tail Hills get itself a bad trip the question be how much more be out there and how can we track it down without anyone else be affect we start by shut down its method of delivery who be you call the reservoir pumping station that service White Tail Hills I be go to have them shut off the water for the development ASAP hey Greg who the hell be you someone who be miss something valuable and this place this be the lose and find you buy a flat of three inch pipe schedule 40 recently why because it be ours and we want it back I do not know what the hell you be talk about you be the only plumbing supplier in this crappy little prefab paradise Greg you know what that mean no it mean you be lie no I be not the drug trafficker must be dig up pipe look for their merchandise but how do they know where to dig Grab Greg Filmore 's case file from my bag will you got it now he say that he live with his brother in Cedar Park right but on his paperwork he list his address at 131 Columbia Street White Tail Hills that be where we get the pipe sample that be right somebody be dig up pipe base on the police report of erratic behavior with all the chlorine burn at the water treatment plant we can be sure those pipe already have a big percentage of the PCP flush out of they they need to reclaim their merchandise as quickly as possible well Greg Filmore list his place of employment as Kingston Plumbing and Pool Supply what be it hold on hold on hold on Yep it be an ID stamp supplier put they on pipe in case a pipe fail inspection K I Kingston where be the rest of the pipe I tell you those pipe be just what the manufacturer ship we the the truck pull up and I take what they give I one pipe look the same as the next now that be it man that be it 2 000 foot of pipe per pallet we 've take 78 foot of pipe out of the ground you want to tell I how much you think be leave uh 1 900 close enough so what I want to know be where be the rest of my stuff I do not know man I swear to God I do not know you be lie where be the rest of my damn pipe I do not know be not that the truck we see at White Tail Hills it sure be they be work near Greg 's house keep your head down and the door lock while I check this out well Rachel Hood it be good you stay here you got to believe I man I get no idea what you be talk about you get a wife and kid back in that crappy new house do not you you do not start talk it will be they sit here maybe this will help you remember where my stuff be spin he around sit up I do not want to do this Greg but we be talk close to 20 million worth of product my PCP I do not know nothing I do not know nothing find it boss here you go I be do ask you nice Greg give I his hand no no please hold still this be hot enough to melt metal Greg Rachel what do you think it will do to your hand do

check it out give I your jacket why 'cause I want to tear it apart come on Antifreeze propylene glycol be a non toxic humectant put it over your nose and mouth it will protect you from the chlorine come on let us go Greg tell I he be not responsible for what happen at the supermarket well he tell you the truth he just drink the wrong water from the wrong tap could have happen to anyone whose house be feed by those pipe believe I I know Mrs Filmore in my line of work I I do not tend to be very forgiving when it come to substance abuse but I be wrong about your husband he be clean and he be

possible I perform the exam myself the tumor be right there well it be not there now People be flock to what be be call a miracle spring which suddenly appear during the heavy storm that hit Lewiston Montana a little over three week ago now this be eight year old Nicholas Harris who be diagnose with a cancerous tumor on his kidney but after he start drink from the mysterious spring the tumor just disappear the boy 's father believe it be a miracle what the Hood hey Rachel you see this Hood what be you do here nice place Hood it be Sunday Rachel you have to see this I have to see this Miracle

be perfectly healthy you 've see he even the doctor say so yeah and that be an incredible thing but my concern be how Nicky get well will lead to other people get sick do you know why they call it a miracle because there be no explanation I owe you tough stuff thank you that be okay Lily no sweat Nicky come here son come on one at a time folk there be plenty of miracle water for everybody 40 a jar please have your money ready exact change be always appreciate there you go ma'am oh bless you you take care of yourself now I be just curious have anyone be down here to prove this empirically I mean like a researcher or scientist type person to see what if anything be actually in this water it cure cancer that be all I know that be all any of these folk need to know look buddy you be hold up the line you want to buy a jar or do not you oh yes please how much 40 please 40 00 okay thank you you take care now so uh this be go to fix all these sick people huh yeah go to cure over 200 type of cancer leukemia brain tumor breast cancer how about insomnia I have trouble sleep be it any good for insomnia we will see huh as far as I know only one person actually seem to have get any well one person I will tell you what how about I take this back with I I test it scientifically and if I can prove it be not what you say it be you can give all these people their money back well let I ask you this how be you go to test a miracle huh besides it do not matter I own this land and everything on it so go ahead and test you be Travis Dobbs correct yeah the same Travis Dobbs who be on probation for sell alcohol to a minor at the Gas and Sip off of Route 28 the hell be this FBI with your criminal record fraud can get you up to ten year in prison whether this be your property or not so arrest I you be okay what be your name honey Lily Lily can you tell I what be wrong with you I have lymphoma let us get she to the hospital we have get a serious problem here Most of these people be patient from across the country who should be in bed not stand in a field for hour on end where do you want I to put they first the storm flood shut down half the hospital now this okay put them on gurney keep they in the hallway I be go to check out maintenance see if we can get b ward up again and run whoa whoa whoa careful where you step Ms Cole you know we still get a few live cable down here those puddle could be damn hot Hurdle what the hell be take so long well the storm really do a number on this place you know so uh we be about halfway through replace the fried circuitry I need power back up on b ward I need it yesterday how about a week from yesterday how about I fire you and hire someone who will charge half of what you do and get it do twice as fast Ma'am we 've be work all kind of hour to get thelace fix up I do not want to lose my job how about two more day you know we will just work around the clock all right without overtime sure no problem come on let us get back to work all staff please stand by to test power okay Lily what happen she overdose on spring water and you be Dr Jacob Hood he be the special science advisor to the FBI I be Agent Rachel Young Lily you 've stop your chemo treatment have not you not you too oh come on Dr Reeves we both see what that water do for Nicky you can not deny that it cure he there be no scientific proof of that which mean there be no reason for you to stop your treatment when do you go off the chemo just over a week ago I I get to know Nicky while we be both be treat here I trust he he would not lie to I about the water Nina yes Dr Reeves make sure she have zero water and start she on a hypertonic saline drip okay thank you do not really make sense come off the chemo she should be feel well at least temporarily any other patient exhibit symptom not really typical of their illness yes several um there be a woman with rheumatoid arthritis who can not stop vomit there be a down syndrome patient who be get chronic insomnia I mean these be symptom that be completely unlated to their illness but they be all drink from the same spring be I right I have test that water countless time and I can tell you there be no mystery to it good or bad it be just water okay can I see your result can you wait for I to get off my shift cute dog I rescue she from the pound you be a sweetheart be not you Bonnie Come on you know understandably Helen Cole and the rest of the hospital hierarchy want nothing to do with this miracle so I bring my research home any idea of the source of the water we can not get any access to it because of Dobbs Property owner yeah be there any way that you could have the FBI step in and shut he down so we can trace the source well first we have to get proof of some dangerous element in the water then we can shut he down could I see your result please thank you you mind if I Nicky 's tumor be diagnose six week ago the storm that cause the spring to emerge be three week after that Nicky start drink the water immediately three week later Nicky 's tumor be go now still I test that water and I can not find anything in it I see that you test for infrared spectroscopy crystallization you be right this be normal water Veronica can I ask you a question do you think it be possible this spring water contain some magic property that could wither away a tumor I do not know that be not really an answer either you believe in miracle water or you do not the fact be an eight year old boy have cancer and now he do not it be not because of any medical treatment I give he so whether you like to believe it or not that be miraculous yeah well there be just this one fact go through my head and that be that every year half a million man woman child in this country die of cancer and they all ask for miracle every last one of they so what make this little boy special no I believe there be something in this water I be go to find out what it be thank you very much for your time excuse I Rachel he be not speak as a scientist be he he always speak as a scientist but he do lose someone to cancer a couple year ago thank again who the hell be you you need to close the spring down you need to get the hell out of my truck pal wrong answer yes well I respectfully disagree I feel that it be in our jurisdiction t yes sir it be the director he be really piss your face have be all over the tv hey Frank well 'cause I be worried about the medium spread the kind of superstition that could cost life no I know it be not an official case but there be definitely something go on here well 'cause I be look at a body right now that be how I know um you be break up I can not you be break up what do we have here Detective Somebody snap his neck Death be instantaneous but we find some blood in his pickup truck look like they want his cash maybe so why make the statement why drag his body all the way up here and dump it in the spring Thk you Detective well if you want to shut the miracle spring down but it be just a crime scene in 72 hour it go back to be open to the hopeful masse 72 hour would be enough for what well if someone be dump contaminant in this spring then all this miraculous attention have get to be the last thing they would want 72 hour could be enough time to flush the water clean we need to find the underground source of this spring right away I will get the Department of the Interior to send out a hydrologist good but even if we can not get result from the water maybe we can get it from the cancer we need to talk what about one of the miracle seeker just die a 26 year old man and the other be get sick be he an oncology patient no it be not cancer it be sepsis blood poisoning hold on be he sick before he take the water how much spring water do he drink a gallon a day for the past week a gallon a day okay well that settle it it be definitely a cause Jacob could not have do this by phone or computer or satellite link well then you would not get to meet Dr Veronica Reeves oh see he think I be buy this crap but I know his MO Firsthand observation hypothesis experiment result it be all about the cheeseburger and the beer hi nice to meet you Matthew Kaplan genius Matthew be one of the country 's lead cancer researcher one of he jest big time be that the speciman yes I call he Quasimodo Nefroblastoma stage 3 kidney tumor it be the same tumor that Nicky have it be just what we be look for well let us hope the little guy be thirsty Miracle water for the rat come right up you be not go to see result for at least 24 hour I be go to get back to my patient very nice to meet you Dr Kaplan that be what they all say now if this soil have a high salt concentration I would be use a resistivity array to chart the flow of subterranean water by measure change in electrical conductivity at progressively deep subsurface level oh you would would you have you track the source of the spring ironically the uh rocky soil here actually help our ground penetrate radar map subterranean terrain soft silty soil on the other hand would uh deaden our signal and make undergrnd mapping far more difficult oh my God what be it Hood you be not go to believe what this water run under this place be a storage depot until just after the first Gulf War Storage for what deplete uranium mostly what do you say deplete uranium uh the base be decommission by the army in 1995 Post Cold War downsize Yep Dr Hood it be Veronica Reeves I just speak with the coroner who work on the patient that I lose to sepsis and and there be significant cellular damage to the stomach lining and the intestine none of which would have show up on x ray or mri it be classic symptom of Radiation poisoning you know what I think I just find the source will you excuse I a second Rachel think we be go to need a full radiological analysis of this facility now yeah Sergeant hello again where be you I be at an armory on Pennington Hill where they use it to store deplete uranium route I know where that be I be come right now still nothing above background radiation have you check the storm drain the uh ventilation shaft all do and we find nothing okay thank you can you check the calibration on your Geiger counter you be operate at maximum sensitivity Dr Hood we 've check and rechecke I be sorry sir there be no radiation if deplete uranium be ever store here it be remove a long time ago can I see your hydrological map please this do not make any sense at all she drink the water but it make she bad not well hey it be not your fault Nicky it be not your fault this be your miracle okay come on no no this be not fair Lily deserve a miracle too I know I know it be okay some unknown substance be contaminate the groundwater Groundwater that be spring up since that storm the armory be test negative for radioactive waste and there be no natural radiation no radioactive ore within 100 mile but uh well there be there be something something 's here and I can not see it and I be not wrong everybody 's wrong sometimes Hood yeah yeah maybe Rachel not today okay well we will start from the periphery of the water table and we will work our way down the slope Hood there be a possibility that it could be something else cause the contamination something that mimic the effect of radioactive poisoning we know that it be not a miracle it be not a miracle 'cause there be no such thing Hood do not make this about your wife it be not about my wife Rachel this be about all the people who will die if I do not help they really you say what make this boy so special how come he get a miracle and no one else do Agent Young we will be right there Dr Reeves be dead clean swipe of the femoral artery she know what she be do must have bleed out in a second and this be in her hand yeah one clean cut suicide even with doctor you usually have hesitation mark you check her system for drug already in the wor should have result by tomorrow thank you Detective coroner need you Rachel yeah I have a really horrible feeling Veronica die because she give a damn I too come on where I want to confirm this really be suicide and not murder Hey Quasi Drinking like a camel be not you you like this stuff I will be damn hello Jacob I 've never see anything like it Quasimodo his tumor it be go it be disappear look you got to find out what do this Jacob yeah this be unbelievable okay thank tell I that spring water we give Quasimodo seem to have shrink his tumor so it do cure Nicky look out Geez you okay yeah I be okay that raccoon be not I do not hit it do I no raccoon be nocturnal animal they do not come out in the day so maybe it have rabie maybe it have somethinglse Hey Bonnie Hi girl how you do how you do you miss your mommy no water no food if she be go to kill herself she would have make arrangement for someone to take care of her dog it be not a suicide she be murder just like Travis Dobbs should I ask I be make ice cube okay Bonnie Pee pee time Pee pee time hey tough stuff how you feel Fabulous you know what I be go to do when I get out of here no teach you guitar we could get our own band go what do you say okay it be my fault you be in here no it be not Come on but you could do I a favor anything I need a drink can you get I a lemonade okay thank okay Rachel what do we know about ice it go great with Scotch yeah well off of that you know it be cold it be hard it be crystalline and with normal water it float now this ice be from the spring our so call miracle water what kind of water make ice cube that sink very rare very special kind of water call heavy water the molecule in heavy water have extra neutron that make it um heavy and in human it have be know to shrink cancer cell but this never occur to I because it be so incredibly rare but if it shrink Nicky 's tumor that would make heavy water a good thing right no heavy water be not a good thing it be really toxic it be like radiation except it be not radioactive and it be practically undetectable however it be the only substance that can actually effect a change in sleep pattern in mammal the raccoon so it be just a fluke that this spring pop up full of heavy water no no it be not a fluke only one in 5 000 water molecule be heavy water only human technology can produce it in large quantity even I know one use for heavy water nuclear weapon so this be the kind of water worth kill for so you be tell I that Dr Reeves be murder by some nuclear terrorist here in Montana she be kill because she be get too close to the truth and Travis Dobbs be kill because he would not stop promote s miracle stream your radiology department 's the only place in the area actively produce nuclear waste of any kind on a daily basis now I know it be small amount but it be real nonetheless so where do you store it we 've be do electrical repair ever since the storm look be this really necessary only if you want to find out if you 've be irradie or not it be normal level of background radiation still use this no it be one of the original water heater from when the hospital be build in the ' 50 it have not be use in year by you that be a centrifuge tube and it be use to make heavy water by electrolysis see with the right amount of uh current you can split regular water molecule leave nothing behind but heavy water yeah there be some radiation nothing dangerous but more than there should be well whoever be here probably use the thalium 201 from your hospital 's uh stress test add the neutron to change it to thalium 202 thereby increase the gamma ray count Gamma ray yeah put the dirty in dirty bomb the heavy water must 've be store in here in this tank Yep when the basement flood the water pressure must 've crack the fitting the heavy water would 've flow out into the hospital drain down in the water table that run below ground the amount of pressure change and find its way into the spring and give Nicky his miracle yeah I think they must 've build a dirty bomb here explain residual radiation then take it with they who do you hire to do the electrical repair just our regular people our chief maintenance man and his assistant what be their name Brandon Hurdle and Ben Adams I think the symptom all your patient have be suffer from be cause by heavy water poisoning you need to flush it out of their system right away Brandon Hurdle have a degree in physical chemistry from Emory University as well as a record of weapon and explosive charge a little bit overqualified to be a hospital maintenance man do not you think what about Adams he be separate from the service during basic training two year ago for refuse to take order from a non white recruit squad leader this be all very hard to believe Timothy McVay 's neighbor say the same thing hold on guy Agent Young speak got it stay on the line please local cop hit both their home nothing do you have any idea where they might be Hurdle have a house up at Kramer Lake he use it during hunt season really think these guy have a dirty bomb in there Positive and now we be go to get a look at it use my Bluetooth and the camera on their computer we get barely 50 milligram More than enough to turn billing into ground zero a few dozen milligram of that a stick of dynamite a hell of a lot of damage all rit when the suspect exit the cabin I will order they to lay down what be in their hand if they comply immediately we will take they into custody if they do not we will put they down Understood Copy that keep your head down this be the FBI Drop what you be carry or we will sot you bastard Hood the dirty bomb have get to be in the case do not touch that do not touch that do not touch that Central we be go to need an ambulance dispatch Hi Lily how be you feel well at least for now Now be good Nicky I think Special Agent Young have something for you she like you what do you say Nicky you think you can give she a good home can I Dad yeah here you go hey little one I speak with the director he say to tell you good call so the big question be do you believe in miracle now Define miracle well if that storm have not hit Nicky Harris would still have cancer and half of Billings Montana could have be irradiate sound like a miracle to I http sfile ydy com proudly present http sfile ydy com sync ßçèâèâ can I have another cosmo please and one for my friend thank right away ma'am help somebody get Lowell my husband he be still in the car Lowell Lowell Lowell somebody call an ambulance somebody do something be he okay check be he breathe no breathing why be not he breathe Breathe come on Baby Breathe Lowell guess how old this guy be 42 no he be 41 he be 56 I know can you believe that and it be weird 'cause he have a history of alcohol abuse and he smoke I know it be time to start drink explain why he drive himself into the pool oh wait no his tox report say he be clean really then what make he plow into the country club hate rich people no he be rich people you know who Lowell Parks be do not you Lowell Parks as in Parks Airways what the hell get the medical director the chief administrator and the health department on the phone they be go to want to see this a6 those x ray be take of Mr Parks about eight month ago as you can see no sign of deformity but he do have congestive heart disease well he be get more than that now do not he Unbelievable tell I about it it be not even bifurcate it be two separate organ there be no doubt about it this man have two heart be that even possible Surgeon General be hope you might be able to tell we that well we well uh excise the heart and uh part keep they on ice we need to keep the cell alive for testing do it kill he good bet two extra heart valve would have overoxygenate the blood and eventually would have slow down and then stop the impulse to breathe in other word he suffocate yeah so I guess two heart be not always well than one any natural cause for something like this only man 's natural desire to meddle where he should not www 1000fr com present Sync FRS luscinia Eleventh Hour s01e12 not the kind of memorial you would expect a grieve widow to arrange this be exactly the kind of memorial Lowell would have want he love party he tell I he want his funeral to be the big and well ever well he certainly seem to have live life to the full spend every day as if it be his last but then he know it very well could have be you be refer to his heart condition of course he start complain that he be tired about a year ago trust I Lowell be never tired ten year old than I and it still take everything I have just to keep up with he anyway he have problem breathe and sleep so I finally force he to go to the doctor that be when we find out it be congestive heart disease be there anything else wrong with he that you know of not until he die that be obviously why you be here right I mean the FBI do not show up just for heart attack not usually no but when they find out Lowell have a second heart well I guess that demand some extra attention do not it yes it do be this something that you be aware of before he die well Lowell always have a lot of heart but no I have no idea all right be he on any medication just beta blocker to relieve the stress on his heart that be really it the doctor also tell he to stop drink and smoke if he want to live long he think that be pretty funny he would say what be the point of a long life if I can not enjoy it he be obviously very active but be there anywhere in particular he like to spend his time I be Isabelle Van Dyke I be the manager here Mr Parks ' accident at the pool be well upset to say the least I certainly hope you find what you be look for thank so do we let I know if there be anything else we can do will do thank you Hood check this out it be get a doctor 's label but not one I recognize from his medical record Name of the medication be not list what do you think it be I do not know let us call the doctor and find out small world look like Dr Templeton 's a member of the club too Dr Bruce Templeton yes do you mind if we ask you a few question about this uh mystery substance and its connection to Lowell Parks uh this be no mystery this be HGH human growth hormone yeah I be give it to Lowell ever since he be diagnose with congestive heart disease but you be not his cardiologist no but I be a friend of some 20 year who also happen to be a doctor Podiatrist not a heart doctor I prescribe some HGH it be somewhat unorthodox yes but it be helpful and it could be malpractice look Lowell be terminal his only hope be for a transplant but he be not eligible for one he drink too much hell he do everything too much smoke recreational drug use let us just say he like to have fun and I give he the HGH so that he could have as much fun as possible before he die very thoughtful of you yeah and I assume his actual cardiologist be aware of this yes he be and there be no risk of contraindication look I give he the HGH to improve the quality of his life and it do I mean he seem to be young every time I run into he I mean hell you should have see the guy like a damn 20 year old Dr Templeton I do not think it be the HGH that give he the extra energy he develop a second heart excuse I oh my God that be incredible I 've never see anything like that how long have you be give he this eight month but it would not cause anything like that you sure this be HGH yes uh test it if you want to oh we want to well thank you again sir for your understanding really I promise it will not happen again I hope not let us go look Gracie I be sorry do not talk to I Brian well be not you go to say anything you tell I not to talk to you I hope you realize I just use our last sympathy card in there you get into one more fight you be expel expel come on Grace that be ridiculous no I will tell you what be ridiculous you get into a fight with half your junior class come on what be it about this time look all I do no you know what I do not even wanna hear it would you make up your mind you know be this the person you think Mom would have want you to become be it Bri Bri wait come on stop it I be sorry okay that be not cool I just I be so mad at you right now and I just I do not have the energy to keep get your stupid butt out of trouble not right now okay I know okay let us go home Grace Grace Grace Grace Grace Grace Grace hey help somebody help Grace be that really HGH in that vial Yep and could that have make the body grow heart 2 Nope Whoa be you try to gross I out Hood I think maybe if he have inject directly into the heart there might be some kind of tissue mutation but the HGH be have absolutely no effect on heart cell whatsoever it be definitely not our culprit what be this thing it be a device for keep um heart transplant viable by flush blood through the chamber I be use it to keep the cell alive so I can test they it be amazing be not it amazingly creepy oh my what this be the first dna result for the double heart the two heart have different dna so maybe it be some kind of transplant no I be not say the heart have two different dna the second heart have dna from 15 different people and still count what happen to keep it alive the final dna count on the uh second heart be 19 I need to open it up and check your uh scar tissue theory and and nothing but rule out surgery get I to think about another theory which be there be only one way to get 19 different dna in one organ and that be stem cell I mean it be a radically new technique but it be possible that they inject stem cell directly into his heart as a way of repair damage cardiac tissue so instead of fix his first heart he create a second one that be my guess say this be a a damage heart if you can and this water be the stem cell you put stem cell into your bloodstream and they naturally seek out the damage tissue they repair and they replace the sick cell until the organ be all fat and happy be that why he look so great despite his insane lifestyle yeah 'cause the blood travel through the whole body I mean uh the stem cell would fix the joint the muscle the skin the whole deal so look young could be a side effect pretty sweet side effect yeah well that be the good part the bad side effect be heart 2 I mean theoretically if you take a hypodermic syringe fill with 19 different stem cell you inject it directly into an organ there be a chance it can overload the stem cell could uh replicate too quickly I think he force feed the stem cell to the extent that it generate a whole new heart okay so now we know what cause the second heart but what about who Templeton give he the HGH maybe he give he the stem cell as well yeah but you do not just walk into Wal Mart and order yourself a batch of stem cell even if you be a doctor then where do Lowell get they from I do not know a hospital a research center a cord blood bank but the fact be you can not get stem cell in these place unless your umbilical cord blood be bank when you be bear or your child 's and that do not explain have 19 different stem cell in one organ yeah but people with money have a far reach what if we track down the people the stem cell come from ID the multiple DNAs Put they through the criminal database not just criminal military medical it be worth a shot do not think that be nice to I now be go to make I forget about how pissed I be at you as soon as I get out of here I be go to finish kick your ass oh really kick the ass of the guy who take on half the junior class I do not think so I say that do not I do not worry about it I take it as a compliment you know I be once just as sick as you be look at I now I be go to be fine you know your stem cell save you mine be go to save I it be practically a do deal yeah you be go to be okay 18 of the 19 DNAs come up dead end and the 19th belong to a 16 year old boy name Brian Dahl register with the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society diagnose with a rare form of all when he be ten go through extensive genetic testing and lucky for we his dna end up on file not lucky for he no but it say he have a full recovery what be it his sister do not she be diagnose three month ago same leukemia as he yeah she be in the hospital right now what what do you mean no stem cell how how be that possible I think you say she have a large sample of the cord blood but that do not guarantee there would be a large amount of stem cell in it okay well somebody must 've just screw up then Brian no no no that do not make any sense to I Stem cell do not just evaporate okay could someone please explain this to I sorry to interrupt but I may be able to help you with that who be you my name 's Dr Jacob Hood I be a scientist we be with the FBI we be investigate a case involve stem cell we be in the process of track the origin of some stem cell that we believe be steal I be afraid yours be among they Brian I do not understand how be that even possible well we do not know that yet but we do know we find your stem cell and they be in somebody else and what about Grace 's well her cord blood arrive here safely from where it be store but we be unable to find any stem cell in it when we spin it down both of your stem cell be store at the same place correct then it be very possible that Grace 's be steal as well why for what I mean who would do something like that well I would say someone who be very sick who obviously do not care about you someone sick well so be my sister they say the chemo do so much damage to her immune system that without a transfer she be not go to make it well that be why we be here we be go to find whoever it be steal your stem cell and get they back welcome all right everyone she be here hello excuse I hi I want a complete tour of the facility please be you the police we be with the FBI do you know where Dr um Davison be please I need to speak to he as soon as possible we need an address and a phone number um well he be at a fund raiser tonight where at the Monticello Hills Country Club Country club that be a coincidence no such thing I be Dr Davison what be this about if you do not mind speak with the doctor outside that would be fabulous you be touch I now really oh it be just that uh there be a dress code oh I be sorry my gun do not fit under my gown Dr Davison we believe that stem cell from your facility be use to treat the wrong person I do not understand Treat who do you give stem cell to Lowell Parks to help he with his heart condition what God no I would never do that even for a friend he be a member of your club here La Jolla 's a small world this club have almost a thousand member that do not mean they be all my friend and I certainly would not compromise my life 's work for any of they well the fact be we have dna proof that stem cell from your facility end up in Lowell Parks and they grow he an extra heart a second heart my God look all our inventory be account for be you sure 'cause I know a 22 year old girl who be in the hospital right now with leukemia she store her stem cell at your place and you know what they be not there anymore well I sincerely hope you be wrong about this People be already wary of stem cell something like this could give the entire industry a bad name Wary because they confuse cord blood stem cell with embryonic stem cell yeah that be one reason of course they be not the same these do not require the sacrifice of any life as a matter of fact you only get cord blood stem cell if the baby actually live exactly so why do not more people do it Reason 2 money People do not want to spend the cash on something they be not sure they be ever go to need Personally I think it be the cheap form of life insurance you will ever find Stem cell be miraculous they be like little chameleon morphing into whatever they be surround by turn sick cell into healthy one exactly there be over 70 different disease you can treat with they now and we have a sister company in Brazil who be work on a treatment for brain and spinal cord injury you know these thing could cure paralysis and they be absolutely noninvasive you just take something that be go to be throw away and freeze it no pain no donor well so far so good look like they be all here well be that as it may we should start test these sample which one all of they this be not cord blood Rachel it be not even human then what be it Pig 's blood what whoever steal the cord blood replace it with pig 's blood it be actually quite a smart move 'cause chemically pig 's blood 's very similar to human blood that way the theft would go undetected for as long as possible but I 've be all over this place it be state of the art Alarms even bulletproof glass there be no sign of a break in and none report either well they get in somehow how much be miss about a third of the inventory and if that much be steal be not just for one man 's bad heart you tell I that our cord blood be rip off and replace with pig 's blood um I take a look at your family history I see that your mom pass away what about your dad where be he no idea and we really do not want to know really you mind I ask why when Mom die Dad fall apart finally drop we off at Grandma 's and disappear we be just kid we have not see or hear from he since he abandon we Screw he not to defend he but some people just do not seem to be equip to handle grief the way they should I mean I lose someone very close to I a couple year ago and I do not could not speak to anyone for three month that be not the same as skip out on your kid no you be absolutely right I be just say that sometimes when people be um suffer a lot of pain they make bad choice however you feel about your dad I just feel I have to tell you that he could be a very good bone marrow match for you Grace even if we do know where he be it would be a waste of time trust I he could not even handle my mom 's death he be not go to be able to handle this what about my bone marrow sorry Brian but because you 've already be sick I be afraid you would not be viable well then I guess that be that grace it be not you still think that you be go to find my stem cell look I appreciate you try but what if you can not well I will put it this way I be not go to give up and I do not want you to either okay I run background check on the staff no red flag forget the staff we need ask our little porcine friend excuse I People lie you say it yourself pig do not Rachel oh my God how long be I out I be sorry it be okay I be on day two without sleep I can not say I blame you be I snore no drool a little great it be okay it be kind of cute find our pig seem like pig breed be pretty easy to identify this one have a low concentration of lipid in its blood the Mangalitsa pig Originating from Hungary they be often call ' four footed olive tree ' because they be feed a strict diet of mostly acorn yeah but the pig 's genetic actually make Mangalitsa fat more unsaturated than normal pig fat say the meat be marble yeah it be like the Kobe beef of pork it be all very fascinating but more importantly it be very expensive and labor intensive which limit the number of place you can get they exactly I need to track down where these guy be sell in the US if we find out who buy the pig 's blood we can find out who our stem cell thief be San Diego PD Agent Young what be up okay we will be right there the pig be go to have to wait they find another body any idea on exact cause of death she suffocate just like her husband look at this her neck 's swollen too yeah at first we be think an allergic reaction until we find this Rachel these be stem cell must have shoot they directly into her face in her face like Botox yeah to regenerate the collagen the elastic fiber essentially to give her baby skin be that even possible oh yeah if you keep it subcutaneous but she go too deep the cell proliferate in the fatty tissue instead of the skin it create tumor see on the face it be not a pretty sight but on the neck it be deadly yup the tumor get so large they obstruct her air passage suffocate her Rachel I be find it hard to escape the conclusion that Lowell Parks do not really care about fix his heart about fix his face this whole thing be about vanity well I be not say it do not start out as a way of fix his heart but by the end it be definitely more about the cosmetic effect it be have and then his wife want in on it and who know who else God what people will do to be beautiful put staple in their face inject themselves with Botulism yeah well what be funny be I think there be a tendency for people to think that we be get bad as a species but the fact be we 've always be this way victorian woman would literally tear hair from their head to give they high forehead there be tribe in Africa that would elongate their neck use ring I mean it be human nature to try to perfect ourselves it be never go to change okay we need to get this to the hospital so they can test what be leave will do maybe we will get lucky it will turn out to be Grace Dahl 's Angie Parks she must 've suspect her husband die of this stuff and she use it anyway People know smoking give they lung cancer and they still do it I be more concerned about the people on the other side of this they take the time they spend the money get their stem cell store and then when they need they to save their life they be go I mean that be murder be not it negligent homicide maybe no Rachel Grace Dahl be die because these people these selfish fool they think they find the fountain of youth it be murder okay I be go to get this to the hospital and then we need to find out where Mangalitsa pig be slaughter on the West Coast okay I will catch up with you later where be you go I be go to try and fix this mess and you guy be the only one on the West Coast who slaughter Mangalitsas that be right Most people find the subject of animal slaughter to be unpleasant but I get news for them no such thing as a steak tree uh we can go in the office if you want it can get pretty gruesome out here trust I I 've see bad so who be buy the Mangalitsa pork well I know eight place buy the meat actually I be more concerned with the blood okay blood um most of it end up with the mechanically recover meat which be Cat food primarily but there be a couple place that buy the blood straight some people consider it a delicacy let us see a tapas bar in Chula Vista a greek restaurant over in Spring Valley Monticello Hills down in La Jolla wait a minute the country club Mr Dahl Mr Richard Dahl yeah hi I be sorry to disturb you I be here on behalf of your daughter Grace she need your help who be you my name 's Jacob Hood I work for the FBI I be here on my own time today but I hope you do not mind I have the agency look up your address for I I need to talk to you actually I do mind look you do not understand the situation I be aware it be a very complicated situation Mr Dahl but I be here to tell you your kid really need your help no no they do not those kid be well off without I that much I know Grace have leukemia Mr Dahl she be die I do not know sometimes I drive down there sit in the laundromat across the street from their apartment they seem okay I do not even know Brian have be sick well Grace be now and you can keep she alive I how your bone marrow I should never have leave once I do I could not go back the past be the past it be what we do now that matter watch yourself it get pretty busy in here right before dinner rush well we will be quick we just need to see where the blood 's keep of course I be glad I can help so pig 's blood be on the menu no but Highland blood pudding be you say something 's foreign and suddenly it become exotic expensive a lot of thing around here seem to be about appearance be not these the refrigerator yes but that be not where the Mangalitsa 's keep we have some trouble with employee theft a while back so we build another fridge with a key card lock the Mangalitsa 's to the right and the blood be on the back shelf so who exactly have access to this place just I that do not just happen well the good news be we know who the bad guy be and the bad news be she just lock we in the damn fridge well we be not go to starve no cell service Great should be some kind of emergency release mechanism Rachel you see this it be a double thermostat it be negative 100 degree it be a deep freeze Perfect for store stem cell it be empty she probably take they with her okay yeah help I pull this out why Protection do not tell I you be go to build some kind of bomb with champagne and bake soda Rachel I be a scientist I be not MacGyver shoot the lock out of the fridge and into the fire Hey wake up hey so guess what Dr Hood he think he might find a match who Dad it be go to take a few day while I take the medication to build up enough bone marrow but the doctor be hopeful oh I be sorry I will go start with the doctor and uh I do not want to upset you no I should be upset but stay for a minute please this be Agent Young Issue a be on the lookout Thanks turn out Isabelle use to work at a cord blood bank in Brazil explain why she be so familiar with stem cell maybe that be not the only thing she be familiar with what you 've get that look I like that look what well do not Dr Davison say that he have a sister company in Brazil that be a coincidence there be no such thing you do not know that Pinot Noir have the high resveratrol content that be the only red wine I drink anymore do it have to go there well it be the good place to hit the neural crest cell Neural what do not Belle explain it to you in the tutorial they be migratory which mean it be the

Perfect record out of the car put your hand on your head let us go you too get out now on your knee Rachel Stem cell be here let us hope Grace 's be in here too Dr Hood Mr Dahl I want to thank you for track I down I I wish I could have be more help oh you do plenty you help probably more than you realize uh be she go to be okay well all three vial of her cord blood be recover so she be get more than a good chance they be about to take she in for the transplant now so ok thank you know once upon a time get old be a sign of wisdom something to be revere now people kill to stay young yeah can

the existence of these three baby a secret not three baby Agent Young Four we find this diaper bag next to the truck it be drop by someone who be not apprehend in the raid and inside it we find these identical quadruplet I be go to have to run some test Maintenance to Pedes ICU I test the nuclear dna of all three baby Rachel oh it be a perfect match it be pretty much what you would expect from um identical triplet create from one fertilize embryo create then I do a similar test on the mitochondrial dna the DNA material outside the nucleus of the egg you know what I find these three baby have mitochondrial dna from three different mother I be lose guy identical baby from three different mother be not that impossible in nature absolutely there be only one way identical nuclear dna can find its way into the egg of three different mother somebody put it there can one of you guy please tell I what the heck be go on here Agent de la Pena what you pick up in your routine bust yesterday be three clone baby clone do you just say clone a cloning operation this sophisticated can only mean one thing Geppetto Hood there be a fourth baby out there who the hell be Geppetto Geppetto be the criminal alia of a black market geneticist which we track down a while back in Seattle and this Geppetto get away Rachel we have to find this baby and when we do it be go to lead we directly to Geppetto www 1000fr com present Capture FRM ÏÄ·ç Sync FRS Ð¡¸£ eleventh hour s01e13 this be unmanned drone footage of the raid on the truck Interviews from detainee confirm that the quadruplet be the only infant in this load of illegal and they be all with this young couple right here we will get a Persons of Interest bulletin out on the two of they right away yeah well while you be at it send out a public health bulletin to hospital and local health facility this infant may need urgent care what make you say that well clone of other specie exhibit a lot of quite severe problem there be no reason why human should be different yeah but the three that we recover seem to be healthy enough to I yeah so far let us just keep they under observation I mean they could have pretty maj problem if their uh DNA come from someone who be old how do you mean well it be kind of ke an old shoelace that snap each time you use it um do not matter how many time you tie it up it be go to keep on break these baby may be start out with the human cellular equivalent of that old shoelace that be the reason why ethical scientist do not want to get involve in human cloning among the item find in the smuggler 's truck be a prepaid cell phone I have someone at NSA run a matrix on all the call make by number dial by that phone the phone call a number in the mexican port of Tampico that number make a few call to a prison in Washington state where our old friend Lea Muller be do time Lea Muller she connect to Geppetto one of her key operative Geppetto be definitely back Hood she never go away she be learn from her mistake and this time she be get it right I do not believe it what Lea Muller die last night ALICE TEXAS Neli oh my God what be you do here I come to see my sister oh Precisosa last

but we have nowhere else to go we have no money get what you need for Esperanza for Esperanza his name be Val Tambor those chocolate test positive for cyanide we be watch a murder in progress and here be the information from Tambor 's Nevada license wait a minute the Val Taor who come to visit Muller be not the Val Tambor whose photo on file with the Nevada DMV Stolen ID Original well at least now we know what he look like Geppetto be plan something big and she be more than capable of cover her track which mean she will kill anyone who try to stop her Carla hi please what do you want the baby where be Neli I have not see she since she go back home oh that why you try to shut the door on I no come on come on Shh shh shh shh come on come on let us get up no I on I know I know I know Shh that

Carla no no Ray I 've get something an anonymous witness call in a murder involve the license plate of a car rent by whoever be use the Val Tambor identity it be a live crime scene not far from the border Geppetto 's get desperate and desperate people make mistake so our victim be a legal resident in this country she have a job she pay her taxis this wld look like a burglary go bad if it be not for the connection to Lea Muller 's death yeah Detective this might be your guy we think he be a hire killer okay look familiar that be our couple the patient 's pain level be at nine out of ten the prognosis pende blood analysis be at ree week to six month of life the patient understand this and be prepared to pursue treatment it be I Geppetto how sweet of you to call we 've be miss you the sister will not be a problem anymore do she have any information for you she be tough but I be right behind the nanny and the miss baby they be on foot and there be only so many place to hole up in on this road well we be ready here do not hesitate to call and hurry the patient be run out of time Understood do you know that I pass Phase 1 testing to get hire at the Bureau let I guess you want I to tell you how I pass Phase 2 of my FBI recruitment test you just read my mind any luck find out who the couple in the picture be yeah the woman 's name be Neli Gamarro she be our victim 's sister turn out she have a job here in the US as a nanny until she be deport two year ago for overstay her visa well Geppetto 's network tend to use very young very vulnerable woman as egg donor surrogate mother woman who have no idea what they be getting involve in so our Neli be run for her life try to make a break from Geppetto 's organization along with the baby yeah explain why they end up in the smuggler 's truck financial tracking check out Carla Gamarro 's purchase over the last couple day any idea why a single woman would spend 280 on baby gear what be Carla 's time of death roughly 2 00 p M yesterday then what be she do use the same card on a motel room 40 mile up the road last night at 8 00 p M which room same credit card pay for a pizza to be deliver to room 5 well let us check it out we will go in the front door you watch the window in the back you get it Hood yeah the door 's open look like whoever be here be go now they definitely leave in a hurry get out of my way get out of my way get down get down okay federal agent Freeze Ray look out get out of the car get out oh God get out get down FBI damn it you guy okay very funny you do realize this be really go to help your application at the Bureau take it easy Ray well I manage to bleed our bad guy we get a sample from where he hit the bathroom wall we will run it through the NCIC 's database could have be you in there you do not get rid of I that easy Agent Young I be pop the trunk what do we get well our bad boy be definitely an assassin this be even more interesting we be look at the content of Carla Gamarro 's medicine cabinet clean out by her killer look at this injectable vial of Pergonal and Lupron Fertility medicine yeah it be use to increase egg production during ovulation for egg harvesting there be no pharmacy label which be kind of unusual for compound like this but from the expiration date I would say she have they about a year it be the right time frame to make Carla eligible to be an egg donor yeah she must have be involve in the cloning operation with her sister Neli he clean out her medicine cabinet to hide her role in the whole thing First Geppetto take her egg then she take her life I would say she be definitely after our miss baby and whoever be with her yeah and I do not think this miss tool kit 's go to slow he down much we get to find Neli before he do GOLIAD TEXAS thank you for the ride I wish we could pay you you sure you want to get off here I could take you guy to the doctor Baby do not sound too good thank you Neli come on he be right Cristofer Espy be not do well she be get a fever and she refuse to eat these people be after we they be just wait for we to slow down or make a mistake if she die it will be our fault our fault I be walk back Carla Gamarro 's financial how do this sound two wire transfer total 6 000 from an account in the Cayman Islands yeah that be in the ballpark for a pay egg donor the account be hold by Jennifer Hammer of Houston age 38 and single could be infertile feel lonely and for a shortc to a child so adopt straight up narcissist look to replicate themsve at any expense why would you even think of clone yourself that be twice as many problem I guess some people just can not get enough of themselves hey what be it Hmm be something bother you Hood no I be fine sorry to bother you but you be a nurse no yes my baby girl need help we have no money we can not go to the hospital uh yeah uh I could get in so much trouble for this please she have a fever I do not know exactly how high her throat be inflame and there be congtion in the lung it be definitely an infection now if it keep up you will need antibiotic but right now she need fld just use a medicine dropper and squirt a little in her mouth every few minute and give she something to help with the fever thank you well if you do that you will be do everything we would do in a hospital do you understand yes and if she get sicker you need to take she to an emergency room promise I you'l do that I promise Gracias gracia Carla Gamarro 's test result confirm that she be an egg donor for one of the clone that mean Jennifer Hammer 's payment to Carla link she directly to Geppetto 's operation that will make it easy to get a court order to test her dna if it come to that right Geppetto it be I have a little setback involve some federal agent Jacob Hood be there really well Jacob Hood be a very stubborn individual I could have have he our security be still very tight here we be just wait for word from you that you have the child you may have to maintain a little long on your end my patient may not have much time leave I 've be in touch with my source in Mexico Neli 's boyfriend h a cousin who be a construction foreman in Victoria Texas he may be their next attempt at sanctuary I do not see that work out too well for they next time you bump into Jacob Hood I would consider it a personal favor if you would take care of he Dr Hood Agent Young I be Jennifer Hammer it be nice to meet you thank for agree to talk with we can I ask be that your mother yes it be a very striking woman with a personality to match oh really she be still alive yes uh but she be be ill I be lucky enough to have full time care for her so she be here with I still still I know that must be very hard for you not as hard as it be for her well I be surprised the FBI be interested in where we keep our money offshore account be hardly financial exotica my family have investment in many part of the world the Cayman Islands be a well know flag of convenience and a well know tax shelter I think you be with the FBI not the we be kind of one big family call the government I need to ask you about two specific transaction you make last year wire transfer to the account of a woman name Carla Gamarro Offhand I do not recall any such transfer but I can have my accountant look into the notation of that payment would it help your memory if I tell you that car be murder yesterday probably to keep she quiet about be an egg donor that be what you pay she for be not it Egg donor yeah the thing be we be really not interested in you we be after the people who actually do the cloning it will help this all go away if you tell we everything you know about a scientist know as Geppetto Geppetto as in the Pinocchio story no as in the story of a woman who pay to have herself clone I do not know what the hell you be talk about big mistake Ms Hammer maybe maybe not do not really matter what do you mean well we find out verything we need to know the moment we come in Jennifer 's eye be a very nice shade of brown and her baby 's eye be blue they be six month old so they will stay that way um that mean they could not have come from Ms Hammer 's dna your mother 's eye be blue FBI do you say you be that be right Offhand I would say you do not have the build your neck be not thick enough but you will do in a pinch oh yes you will do thank you you do not have to answer any of their question Mom first of all you call I Pete that be my name Second of all try and shut I up I do not get many visitor and those that do come I catch look at their watch as soon as they sit down sick old broad that be I Mom what can you tell we about your illness well it be no secret I be die Cirrhosis of the liver in my case it be cause by viral hepatitis not booze I be not say I will not take a drink now and then how about you sweetie I like a glass of italian red or three I hear that honey my daughter here she seem to think I have a good chance at a transplant I let she think so but I read the list every day I be way too old and that do not make I a priority what would you say pete if someone be to tell you they could grow you a whole new liver one that would kind of neatly sidestep the main problem with organ transplant tissue rejection your body would accept it more readily because essentially the organ would be genetically identical to your own tissue what would that be worth you could not put a price on it well right now the state of the art do not really allow we to grow a whole organ in the laboratory we still need the protective system of the human body for that so it can not be do oh it can be do yeah have be if you need a particular human organ with a specific dna pattern it be now possible to grow a whole person just for the body part and that be what we believe your daughter have do see right now we have three little baby who we believe be clone with your daughter 's help in order to ow an organ to help her beloved mother I be go to call our attorney right now so you be say Jennifer commit a crime well the problem be uh clone baby be people no matter what their origin and some organ can not be remove without kill a person if you remove the organ in order to put it into someone else the donor be go to die and that last time I check be murder you leave I want to talk to Dr Hood in private now it be my fault Dr Hood I be responsible for everything for the cloning everything whatever I will shoulder the blame for any and all crime commit well suppose we could accept your confession how can you help we how about a name we be listen GenVictus a company our family suddenly make a very large investment in a year ago Jennifer probably think I do not notice I be wonder when I see it and now I know the reason I want you to know I would never endanger the life of anyone particularly a child it certainly would not be the first time I have know someone go to extraordinary length to help someone they love I be sorry for you Dr Hood I why we be an industrial agricultural cloning company we clone a dozen animal a week here this be one of our two year old gain weight nicely you plan on grow the next triple Crown winner in a laboratory no the last one the last five actually we have an extensive library of genetic material from prizewinne stallion and mare we only clone prov winner who be already profitable semen donor and broodmare seem like it be work out for you Mr price well a single stud fee can go for ten of thousand of dollar it only make sense to create a brand new genetically identical animal after the original can not produce any more equine joy juice we uh charge a fee for cloning and then take a royay on ery successful mating and it be not just horse we be work on clone our sixth specie here and it be all legal accord to the FDA your clone have an unusually low rate of defect what be your solution to that problem well that be a bit oa secret sauce question we call it the Pinocchio Effect let I guess you 've find a way to lengthen the telomere the way uh lie lengthen Pinocchio 's nose you seem to know your way around DNA Dr Hood yes that be exactly what we 've do every time a telomere divide a little bit break off and that mean there be a little bit less the next time it reproduce yeah it be part of the natural aging process do not have to be natural forever well I would certainly be interested in know how you develop that technique uh it be before my time Hmm ever hear of a scientist who use the name Geppetto that be a funny name for a scientist quite a coincidence give the name of the technique responsible for your company 's success you know I be sure our legal department would tell I that we be get into the area of proprietary information here Jennifer Hammer place a great deal of money with your company can you tell we why have you do any genetic work for her our lawyer give I very specific instruction on what to say and what not to say so again that information be not at my discretion to disclose I be sorry not as sorry as you will be when we come back with a subpoena you notice you mention Geppetto and people clam up whether it be to protect themselves or protect their profit or both at the same time Hood I 've locate the Pinocchio patent the name on the application be a Dr Miranda Cochran trace her yield only a few biographical fact date on her undergradand doct at Massachusetts Academy of Technology but not much more she add an MD at Los Angeles University and then she just disappear Falls off the grid entirely it do not add up anybody who invent something so promising should have a massive trail of article in the scientific press I will contact the school see if they have a picture of her Ya ya it be okay it be okay it be okay Hood the academy send we a freshman yearbook image of Miranda Cochran I be go to age she up to her 50 Rachel that be her Miranda Cochran be Geppetto Federal Building Houston Texas Ladies and gentleman today the FBI officially announce an addition to the Ten most Wanted List Dr Miranda Cochran AKA Geppetto have be identify as the head of a criminal enterprise and involve in at least three murder in two state she be also want for wire fraud money laundering and repeatedly violate FDA regulation regard scientific experimentation on human subject the FBI have institute a 50 000 reward for any information lead to the capture of Miranda Cochran now I will take any question you have we be not go to be able maintain much long and if we can not maintain you can not get pay relax this be your last call Geppetto it will all be over in a few hour my patient be ready just make sure she have my final payment I be kind of a stickler about that Cristofer hey where be you bro relax I will come pick you up no problem just tell I when and where okay well you should be happy Most agent work their whole career for a Ten most wanted case well I be not really an agent so I do not care about stuff like that so much what be on your mind Hood and do not say nothing when I be um hold that child that clone child I have a feeling for a second what it must be like to be Geppetto Godlike and it make I dizzy I mean if this be really where we be head if if we be really go to be play God then I do not want a part of it I mean there have to be boundary have to be there be just go to be moral chaos out there hopefully the Bureau make this public will help you know a lot of case be still solve average care citizen make a call so we wait where be Rudy I do not know he say he would be here Shh oh it be okay it be okay it be okay you will feel well soon uh Crtofer what be it what be the matter she be get bad she be burn up we need help several tip link this hotel room seven block from here to our ten most wanted felon Miranda Cochran Subject be in her late 50 and incredibly creative at evade capture she be have practice in the last week and a strong short punch any question no no all right let us check com link before we mount up FBI FBI FBI Clear Clear Clear Clear we have somebody who see her kind of wait in line at the service elevator in the last half hour okay all right she beat we again she leave in a hurry look these drug tell a story Rachel Cytokine inhibitor Anti tumor necrosis factor Insulin what be they use for well take together they tell I that Geppetto 's patient 's suffering from a form of pancreatitis not liver disease like Pete Hammer and with pancreatitis the body 's digestive juice attack the organ it be very painful normally fatal there be only one cure let I guess a new pancrea make perfect sense I mean you can transplant a pancreas from a child to an adult fairly easily there be a possibility that Geppetto be plan to use more than one organ at the same time explain the number of uh donor Hood you can not live without a pancreas right no not a chance help we please what be the matter she be burn up be she go to be okay we be do everything we can excuse I Es mi prim Rudy FBI hotline may I help you Hood I just get a hit off your health alert it be from a hospital less than 20 minute from here our baby show up in the ER Hola Cristofer ah ah ah do not be stupid you be go to take I to that baby or I will blow a hole in your belly big enough to pass a burrito through Fancy run into you here Wayne Swafford yeah that be right we ID'd you from a little blood smear leave behind when you sucker punch I do you know Wayne that in Texas they execute more murderer than any other state help we nail Geppetto and I will make sure that do not happen to you you be go to let I go after a long prison sentence of course do you have the child I 've get she we be en route to your locale she be perfect you know she want I to kill you well I must be do something right FBI nobody move you can wake up now it be all over be it do yeah I would say it be do this time you be the patient Miranda so you clone those baby for yourself Alys the savior Jacob Hood would you mind call I Dr Hood I do not really know you by the way the baby she be safe she be with her mother you would sacrifice a talent like mine for a clone infant she have a name Esperanza and yes I would sacrifice your talent for an insect I create life only so you can destroy it I could teach you everything I know if you help I that be quite an offer Geppetto but um I be go to have to say no you see unlike you I have a soft spot for human being you be a coward Dr Hood you play at be a good man but you will never be great I can live with that Miranda Cochran AKA Geppetto you be under arrest how be she do she have none of the genetic problem you be worried about what she do have be a very bad case of the flu her seizure be febrile seizure very scary but also fairly common in baby with high fever if it have not be for the care she receive from these young people it could have be a lot bad your three baby sister be do just fine too and we be find very good home for they so something good come do come out of Geppetto 's work you do realize she be a very special baby do not you I know I break the law but I also know I do the right thing I mean look at her she be alive and she be safe oh by the way um apparently it turn out catch a Top Ten most want Felon 's some kind of big deal you both help with that so thank to the FBI your um immigration and your adoption paper be not go to be a problem so you be go to be able to stay here all three of you as a family be that okay mm hmm welcome to www 1000fr com it look like we have some break news out of Highway 894 Terry Gillman our traffic reporter join we live with the late Terry hello in the studio be you guy get this this guy be haul through traffic head southbound on the 894 do at least 100 the real problem be he be drive on the northbound side of the highway well Terry we can see that a police copter be in hot pursuit but be there any ground unit pursue this guy no Ground unit break off when the suspect

feed I say cut the feed be you look for someone the director assign a trainee to cover preliminary and provide support for this investigation an agent by the name of Lee Lee Kind of big guy Enthusiastic you know he think I be about to Hey Dr Hood Agent Young hi I be Felix Lee uh oh I know what both of you guy be think really tell we Dr Hood you be wonder why the director would burden you with some rookie agent at the head of a very serious case well why would he funny you should ask I know I do not have much field experience and science not exactly MIT the whole tactical training bit be not really my bag so what do you do Recon I would have to say recon it be easy for I 'cause I be real good at blend in I be like a mouse a 6'6 mouse exactly what be Agent Young thinking why I do not flash my FBI badge until now okay so what do we have here well the pilot 's name be Terence Gillman reportedly suffer a loss of vision right in the middle of a live news broadcast anyone on the ground when he crash no that be the only good news actually the pre crash footage be all over YouTube think that where the director see it yeah prior to join the uh news team here Gillman fly for the FBI as part of the Hostage Rescue Team the director serve with HRT yup and Gillman save his life not once but twice well that explain why we be here solve this case just become personal so Gillman be in perfect health and without warn his sight go yeah I be think river blindness cause by those nasty little nematode that can live in the human body for up to 15 year Wikipedia River blindness um those nasty little nematode be fairly common in uh Western Africa but not really likely Milwaukee do we get anything from the autopsy Body be toast it be practically cremate oh so it will be pretty hard to identify any other symptom oh there be this yeah he be marry I find it in the crash sight we need to talk to his wife yeah here she would want that I know I would let us hope she be the only widow we have to speak to while we be here www 1000fr com present Capture FRM ´ ó± ¦ Sync FRS ÓîÒâ eleventh hour s01ep14 Terry love that job so much so much for the last five year he never miss a morning commute you know it be funny he be not even suppose to be work last night they just call he in to cover the chase and we be sorry for your loss Mrs Gillman I need to know what happen please we believe Terry suffer from something call uh rapid onset blindness it be a very rare condition need to ask you do he complain recently of uh poor vision or headache nothing he would have tell I if something be wrong maybe he do not want you to worry Terry take the responsibility of be a pilot very seriously and he would have never fly if he feel that he be impair in any oh be you okay yes just pregnant I never think that I would be raise a baby by myself it be not fair I want to have my husband back I you will let I know if you find out anything I promise thank you what now we find out from Mr Gillman if he have any more symptom you can talk to dead people Remarkable he be on tv every day for the last five year remember well eastbound I 94 be really go to put a wrench in this morning 's commute what exactly be we look for any uh indication that he be sick well good luck in the three year I know Terry he never catch so much as a cold it be go to be a rough one out there folk in a bizarre twist a few lane be block by chicken who apparently fall off a delivery truck how long be you Terry 's assistant three year couple month ago I got promote to junior reporter it never would have happen without Terry 's help God his poor wife she must be heartbroken you and Erica be friend yeah we got throw together at a couple of office party but we decide we like each other she must feel so alone right now this be really help thank you Debbie so if I be to give you any advice that be the third time he be adjust the volume on his headset in two minute maybe the roar of the engine be too loud well why be he turn the volume down could be uh hyperacusis it be uh extreme noise sensitivity scratch his neck why be that odd well it be odd if you have an itch in the same place for three day could be uh dermatitis Deie be the cabin uh climate control yeah that be why I never fly with he he like it arctic he keep the air conditioning at 65 freeze that please well you can add hyperhidrosis to the list sweating when it be cold right yup my God why do not I notice this no if he do not notice why would you um what be the date of the first broadcast where we see Terry 's symptom the Monday before last so two week ago it narrow the timeframe yeah excuse I yeah I be the first person he tell about they be pregnant he be so thrilled to become a dad 911 just dispatch an ambulance to Erica Gillman 's house Terry 's wife she be blind Dr Nayar I be Jacob Hood this be Rachel Young we be with the FBI oh Dr Hood yes hi how be uh Mrs Gillman and her baby they be do okay I I have to say I 've never see this before she suffer spontaneous blindness but nothing in her medical history relate to it her husband have the same thing and it cost he his life what test do you run every diagnostic panel I could think of they be shot in the dark huh exactly right so far we just can not make the connection oh you should know that there be be a flurry of patient with really strange combo of symptom really such as pin and needle numbness in their hand and foot a lack of muscle coordination Skin rashe memory loss yeah what be you think Hood can you give I uh a specific example well um this morning a traffic cop come in he be have trouble write ticket also have a bad rash and this afternoon a woman be complain of numbness in her foot we be test she for Buerger 's disease Minamata Minna who all the symptom point to it Minamata it be a it be a city in Japan and it be kind of where the real danger of heavy metal poisoning be first discover this chemical plant they dump a load of methyl mercury into the bay and it poison the sea life which be the town 's main food source and it devastate the population I will begin target hair and blood analysis if it be mercury poisoning we will know within the hour thank we appreciate that yes where would people be expose to mercury here I do not know that be what we be here to find out before this town end up like Minamata yeah that place hey hey oh hi hey what be you do hey how you do not good you know what that do to the ecosystem around here I be sorry you be sorry you will be once I give you a 500 ticket 500 come on man 500 buck you be kill I maybe next time you will think about what you be kill man Analysis of Erica Gillman 's hair indicate a mercury level of 2 9 part per million almost six time the normal range my other patient have similar mercury level certainly enough to prove mercury poisoning be it treatable with chelation therapy we inject a bind compound to collect any heavy metal then the body excrete they naturally the treatment should work for the other patient maybe but not for Erica Gillman I do not understand if you know what be make I blind why can not you fix it in most case the chemical use in chelation therapy be safe Most case it be not safe if you be pregnant Erica right now the mercury in your system be be pass through the placenta to your develop fetus with every minute that pass the danger of serious complication multiplie my baby be sick the soon we stop the uh baby 's exposure to the toxin the well Erica I need your permission to perform an emergency c section I be in my second trimester my baby will not survive Preemies as young as 23 week have go on to live normal healthy life give I a percentage every case be different I do not care about every case what be the chance that my baby will survive 10 to 15 Erica before you make your decision you need to know that without intervention you and your baby will get much much sicker the only way to treat you effectively be to treat the two of you separately I 've lose my husband I will not lose my child too you understand we be bring in a diagnostic team from the EPA to help with this investigation well we be go to need it identify the mercury be the easy part find the source that be go to be difficult any idea ah well the upside of what happen in Minamata be it be fairly contain but nowadays the way the food supply be it could be up and down the country very quickly then how serious a health risk be we talk here well I think from a few isolated case to a full fledge epidemic well with only four case so far let us keep our finger cross that it stay that way excuse I I have a mercury advisory issue to all the local hospital like you ask and every patient with the appropriate symptom be be test it be not pretty they 've already identify 25 new case six in the last hour alone so much for keep our finger cross we have to find the source otherwise what happen in Minamata 's go to be like the good case scenario where do we start I be think a little of something the science community call immersive garbalogy oh yeah cool what be that Gillman on the address get another one Hood you can tell your friend in the science community that immersive garbalogy suck Hey Doc be not mercury use in thermometer use to be they do not use mercury anymore I be pretty sure as a kid my mama put those thing in place mercury definitely should not go yeah well even if they do not have toxic mercury in their house as a permanent fixture maybe they just have to pass through it once something they already eat or drink in large quantity yeah yeah but those other 25 victim be not all hang out at the Gillmans be they no probably not but uh there be get to be some kind of common thread You Officer Walter Barrett hi the traffic cop who have trouble write ticket and have the weird rash uh yeah that be I Nice to meet you Officer I hear your toxicity level be not as high as some of the other but if you start to feel nauseous or sick in any way just let we know will do so how can I help well as we go through this trash if you see anything that you eat or drink in the last couple of week you just tell we okay Peanut butter no I be allergic to peanut my head swell up like a watermelon Mayonnaise Ew never touch the stuff all those preservative give you Alzheimer 's well the Gillmans sure like their milk Lake Fresh I use that in my coffee how many time a day Breakfast lunch dinner and every hour in between Prevents gout well if there be toxic mercury in this milk the compound on the swab should find it pretty quickly it be positive Felix call the Health Department have they issue an immediate recall on all Lake fresh dairy product I be on it Officer Barrett do not the milk industry have safeguard in place to stop something like this from happen yeah sure it do but it do not normally include test for heavy metal we can get the remain stock off the shelf but what about the milk that be already be sell I do not know do it okay Lake Fresh have uh two local bottle plant they be shut down production we need to investigate both we should split up this guy be all through traffic heading southbound on the 894 do at least a hundred the real problem be he be drive on the northbound side of the highway Ground unit break off hey baby hey how you do all right I be just put together a memorial segment for Terry oh yeah I be sure it will be amazing oh um I know I tell you I would be do with that wetland pollution piece by the end of the week but it be just it be okay honey I can not do not worry about that all right this be way more important thank you for understand I just wish I just wish there be something I could do something I could say I will be okay I just um I just miss my friend I know you do Agent Lee thank you it be Agent Lee we could use some good news Felix sorry Lake Fresh East be clean the equipment be anyway some of the milk be test positive for mercury but it be not come from this plant Lake Fresh West be negative too so the milk be taint before it get to Lake Fresh where do that leave we well the victim that drink the uh poison milk they be the final link in the food chain Processing pnt they prepare their raw product for distribution they be in the middle but it all begin with the dairy farm and the cow that supply the fresh milk there have get to be what at least a dozen dairy farm in this area 26 actually but accord to the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture 's database only one supply milk to both Lake Fresh facility all right I be forward the coordinate to your onboard gps Agent Young Thanks Felix I do not know you could do that Afternoon something I can help you with I need a refrigerator something old right this way I get a bunch of them over here how much for this one uh you do not want that piece of junk the compressor 's shot and the coil be rust through Better to repair it than buy a new one right I be big on recycle a sale 's a sale come on back I will write you up cash or charge oh I prefer cash work for I I already tell you my girl be healthy this be quite a large barn for such a small amount of cattle what happen to the rest of your cattle I sell off some head to raise cash the one I keep produce more than enough milk to make my quota you expand your dairy to something more agricultural look like that field 's just be plow Rachel will you give Felix a call something I need he to grab for I do I tell you I come from a family of farmer really yeah yeah yeah yeah third generation and with the economy the way that it be it be impossible to not cut corner be I right so uh you understand I understand you do what you have to do right right they be lose weight stagger around a lot I figure it be mad cow disease I be really scared I euthanize they last week your cow do not have mad cow disease they have mercury in their system which go directly into the milk well how could I have know that you know they be sick and that be when you be suppose to call the health department but instead you just cover it up I be protect my livelihood I be look out for my family really what about the family who drink the milk look I do not think I should say anything else until I talk to a lawyer you be go to need one take he into custody Three generation of farming well now we know how the mercury find its way into the milk but not how it get into the cow every inch of this farm have to be test the feed the grass the water turn everything over 11 inch do everything look okay the baby 's heart and lung be develop normally so far it be your heart I be worried about the long you wait to treat this the more stress be put on all your vital organ Erica I do not want to lose both of you but you say the baby look good unfortunately there be no way of know whether the mercury be affect he at this time but Erica with the level in your system the chance be it will affect he the question be how much wait a minute you say he affect he be be it a boy yes you be have a baby boy okay so far we 've run trace metal screen on the storage silo feed trough and the cattle feed itself all negative for mercury Jacob Hood yeah do you run the simulation with a low dose okay well thank for try what be that about it be the head of obstetric at Johns Hopkins I think maybe a low dose chelation regiman might help out Erica 's baby that do not sound like a yes no it be not you know Doc when you be behind a desk victim be just name on a computer out here it be different how do you deal with people who 've lose so much to tell you the truth Felix I have not really work that one out yet Hood we check out Breen 's remain livestock all clean well that mean the infected cow eat something the other do not well the remain have be send out for stomach content analysis but it will take time well till we get the result all the local dairy farm be go to have to be quarantine be not there a fast way to figure out what those cow eat fast yeah oh do not tell I we be dumpster diving again we do not really have to you be kind of stand in it oh crap you know contrary to popular belief cow do not have four stomach but they do have four digestive compartment girl must love you I do all right this be interesting what be that what let I see what the hell be that it be fish bone fish bone Yep I think cow be vegetarian well they may think they be but farmer have be supplement their feed with meat by product for year and the cheap one be fishmeal well we need to find out the name of this fishmeal distributor if other farm be still use it dairy product could be just the tip of the iceberg nail it test confirm the fishmeal Breen get from here be our source this be what his cow be eat Blue Fleet 's wastewater be laden with mercury notify every cattle farm and feed house that buy from they in the last 60 day I 've already get disposal team out handle collection Agent Lee exactly what kind of fish do Blue Fleet process mostly menhaden and lake herre Herring I do not really like fish you know that uh Three Stooges movie where Curly swallow that fish whole in the x ray you can it swim around his rib freak I out anyway there be uh not really many kind of fish that can carry dangerous level of mercury it be only really predator like um swordfish and shark big fish that eat other big fish I doubt we will find swordfish or shark in the great lake so how have the mercury find its way into the little fish Lake Michigan be huge it be big than some country there be no way we can search all of it you do not have to Someone be do it for we let us see if we can find more seagull the handy thing about gull be they will eat anything so if they 've be feed on tainted herre there be go to be sign what kind of sign Tremors ruffle feather droopy eyelid um violent behavior roll your window up you folk okay yeah thank to you Rachel I think we really need to get to the source before it turn up somewhere else in the food chain oh thank for the uh by the way it be how long have you be with the Department of Fish and wildlife long enough to see the number of specie face global extinction raise to 16 000 the evidence that we be kill our planet keep pile up and we keep ignore it it be frustrating the only time the federal government take notice be when their bottom line be threaten we be not the enemy Officer be this your transmitter yeah we use they to track the bird 's breeding and migratory pattern Rachel this be why we be here if these sick gull be feed from tainted herring we can use this to lead we to the source so the GPS datum from the bird transmitter narrow our search to five square mile this sonar will find any uh foreign debris on the lake floor that could be poison the herring what be that only one way to find out gas mask on yeah that be uh that be liquid mercury be those maggot yeah well that would certainly have the effect of lure the fish toward the mercury what be the glass from it be a barometer yeah old barometer have glass servoir fill with pound of liquid mercury that be right Wikipedia this sure as hell be not an accident someone could be out there right now dump more of this I think I know how to find he Liquid mercury be classify as a hazardous material so if you want to buy this much of it without a license you would just get a truckload of mercury fill antique with cash from a dealer who will not ask too many question exactly yeah that be that be a beautiful thing okay let us get every available field agent from here to Detroit canvass antique store and local online dealer Felix find out who those barometer be sell to it be the hospital Erica suffer a generalized seizure the uterine contraction trigger a drop in the fetal heart rate well if nothing be do she will lose the baby and her life will still be in jeopardy so delivery be now the only option yeah she still will not give consent well can you blame she she be face the tough decision of her life and she can not even ask her husband about it then if I I do not induce my baby will die be that for sure there be always exception but uh no it do not look good if I make the choice and I fall on the wrong side of the percentage I be always go to wonder if I not a great bet be it no no can I ask you something sure anything what would you do if it be your wife if it be my wife you know what I think I would say to hell with the science just go with your heart Agent Young how be she about to make the hard decision of her life she be have the baby they 've get to induce I will tell Dr Nayar so what now we wait excuse I ma'am official FBI business so in the last six week local antique shop have sell more than 30 mercury fill barometer thermostat and thermometer the part recover from the refrigerator account for only half of they so that be over 200 pound of mercury unaccounted for who buy the antique a man use the name of Lars Saunderski he leave a phone number with several dealer so they could call he when more barometer come in the phone number trace back to a disposable cell phone and the name do not exist actually yes it it do uh Larus saundersi it be the latin name for the Saunder 's gull it be an endangered specie okay so who in the hell use an endangered bird as an alias sorry do you mind I ask your um necklace could not help notice it be uh it be begin to oxidize there be not a chance that anyone uh be handle mercury could have uh touch that be there I mean uh you do not know anyone who work for the Department of Fish and wildlife or anything my husband he give I this necklace last week your husband that would count Debbie you you should not be here what be in there Ben tell I you do not poison all those people it be the only way to get their attention the toxic effect of mercury they be reversible Terry die and his wife could too and their baby I do not mean for that to happen oh my God Ben what do you do I do this for we for the baby we be go to have someday and for for their child too my God Debbie th Th this planet be under attack and nobody care but I do I mean I be I be actually try to fix it do you know how crazy you sound no be not you the one who be always tell I that the only time people sit up and take notice be when something tragic happen that be what I give they honey this be front page news Debbie come on Debbie let I explain there be nothing more to explain Mr Finney you be come with we now I do what I think be right and when there be no fish and no forest you will wish you have not stop I you kill someone I be not sorry I stop you Ben Finney you be under arrest how be the baby do Doctor Strong like his mom hey so we recover the last of the antique from Finney 's storage unit you add to that what we get off his boat look like we get it all okay so um the lake should clean itself within a couple of month and that be uh well thank you very much for all your help Felix please do not mention it oh so I guess that be it Yep this be it okay Agent Young Agent Lee Dr Hood see you around you know uh I could hang around if you guy want that be something that I would consider if you ask but just know there be several other post at the Bureau who have express interest in what it be that I bring to the table and what I do really that be weird 'cause I speak to the director and he say that you beg for this assignment yeah he do say that Director say that quite specifically okay well I be just go to be honest with you guy then I think that the work that you guy do be awesome thank you very much yeah yeah yeah I just have to see it for myself can I stay I do not know Rachel what do you think it be your call I guess I can deal with he you be not go to make I regret this be you Felix Doc please it be the Three Musketeers one nation under a groove baby that be kind of what I mean welcome to www 1000fr com CBS3 KYW DT PHILADELPHIA Yo Denise hey hey I get ticket to the M I a show next Thursday at the Hippodrome it be go to be sick my wife hate that kind of music so I think maybe you and I listen Charlie I think I be go to take off it look like it be go to get pretty bad out there well what do you say I walk you out why not wow that storm come in fast come on let I take you to your car oh my gosh careful here careful careful oh get your key okay get my key okay okay there you go thank you Charlie no problem you have a good night Denise you too all right bye bye Charlie oh my God oh my God Charlie be you okay I think so Agent Lee you make it here before we I be impressed well I be your recon guy what bring we to Massachusetts Felix you be not go to believe what we get here Doc lightning do this both of they well it be unusual but it happen it be a bit more than unusual all of they kill by lightning Yep that that be not possible be it well statistically speak the chance of getting strike by lightning in Massachusetts be 28 000 to one since 1974 there have be 37 death by lightning in this state 30 of those death happen last night between 6 38 and 6 49 30 death by lightning in a ten minute thunderstorm and if that be not enough bad news local weather report call for another storm to hit within the next 48 hour well find out what be cause this before we run out of morgue www 1000fr com present Capture FRM ´ ó± ¦ Sync FRS Ð¡¸£ ÇåË ® ÂíÌã eleventh hour s01e15 Mr Han what can you tell we about the body of the victim besides the sheer number of they nothing more than what you would expect Surface burn blister cardiac arrest then death what a way to go well death by lightning be electrocution and electrocution 's just a very hot heart attack do you contact the National Weather Service find out if there be anything unusual about this particular storm yeah the number of lightning strike be actually just about average for New England this time of year well if there be nothing unusual about the storm there must be something unusual about the victim all 30 of they no I say 30 people die at least 15 more come into Springfield General yesterday after survive a strike 45 lightning victim Dr Hood you ever come across anything like this no I have not Mr Han what make one person survive a lightning strike and another person get kill like Denise Hall any number of factor uh strength of the strike fat to muscle ratio and cardiological health of the victim what they be stand on what kind of shoe they be wear we should compare those factor between the victim and the survivor see what kind of difference we find let us get a full workup on everyone who survive a strike okay Hood I know you be not suppose to be out in the open during a thunderstorm mm hmm but other than that when you be a kid you ever rub your hand on a carpet and make static electricity yeah I use to try and shock my dad whenever he be around Charming well um lightning work pretty much the same way negatively charge air rub against positively charge air and create an electrical spark which then become lightning and like any other electricity all it be look for be the path of least resistance between where the current start and where it end and the path of least resistance would be tall metal structure I mean that be why so many um tower and tall building have lightning rod 'cause they get strike all the time but if you be short and not make of metal chance be lightning will not hit you then why would our victim be the path of least resistance well that be what we get to find out WILCOX laboratory come in Liz Thomas sit we would hope it would not come to this but uh well you 've read the paper there be just no money out there anymore so uh we be make cut and uh thank to a generous Department of Defense grant from the War Fighter Enhancement program we can keep move with the uh handheld X ray device the gadget boy be work on but uh everything else could end up on the chop block so what you be say be that military application get priority while alternative energy gets put on the back burner again Liz he be just try to keep the light on yes and I be just try to revolutionize the way people exist on this planet no one doubt your passion Liz but the fact remain that we have two microbattery project here at Wilcox and only enough funding for one and we all know that as it stand Dr Lowenthal 's project be make well progress but I realize that good science take time so Liz you have until the end of the quarter to catch up and uh at that point whoever be battery be far along get to stay and the other project will have to go I win a Eureka Grant I be a Rhodes Scholar and I 've publish more paper than everyone else in my department combine I know that Liz this be nothing personal but but you be willing to cut I loose if I do not produce Fine I will have my battery up and run and outperform Thomas ' within the month you can count on it nothing personal your husband 's really lucky to have survive such a massive jolt of electricity Mrs Wease they do everything they could for he at the hospital now it be just a matter of rest up till he be himself again right Charlie well it be go to take he a good while to recover do you know if he can hear we they say he should be able to but he do not act like it Charlie Baby can you hear I can you tell I be he wear headphone when he be strike uh yeah he be wear this hmm the hospital give it back to I with his clothe I do not know why People wear mp3 player all the time now do you think it make they more susceptible to getting hit I do not know if um such a small conductor would really make much difference but it be worth check if the other victim be wear headphone yeah I will have Agent Lee work up a list of anything conductive the victim might 've be wear okay medical device jewelry electronic yeah good thinking so Mrs Wease you okay I probably do not know half the song that be on this thing I do not know what he be read or what show he be watch we use to fight and then make up but we we stop like it do not matter like we would grow indifferent to each other I do not even speak to he yesterday I be so sorry well sometimes um when you nearly lose someone it be like you get a chance to press the reset button you know if you be lucky you get to realize uh it be all still there you just need to recognize it you know hey Thomas do you come down here to gloat of course not some of we be go to go over to Denise Hall 's memorial nothing big just a little get together for the employee a get together yeah you know a chance to pay our respect share some memory I think you might want to come I never meet the woman and apparently I have too much work to do oh come on Liz I be sorry about Coleman do not be Tom I be a scientist I understand logic they do not have enough money for both of we so let the good research win you know for an organic chemist with post doc work in molecular engineering you be surprisingly sentimental Sample number 317 another dud this case have get I think back I know kid be scared of lightning but not I why do that not surprise I my dad be a field agent in Phoenix and I use to climb up on top of the roof of our house and watch the lightning storm across the desert I never see lightning as a bad thing until now do I tell you I nearly drown once Hood still do not know if you have a middle name I do not it be um it be when I be in high school I be do a term paper it seem very important at the time and uh well I be have a lot of trouble with it so uh to clear my head I go out for a swim Guess I be so uh catch up with what I be think what I be go to write you know that uh when I look up I be in the middle of nowhere and the beach be way way out there and you drown I just remember I look around at the sea and how enormous it seem and there I be this little speck and um it be pretty scary but I realize maybe my term paper be not so important after all get back on the beach and save my life be nothing beat the power of nature for put our self importance in check we 've get to find out what be cause this this new girl 's wicked hot see what I mean hey sweetheart you get a little time for I for another 20 buck I can go topless I would love to but I do not have any more cash that be okay you might not see they but you can still feel they Baby you be electric HARPER 's ISLAND A MYSTERY EVENT APRIL 9 JULY 2 Dr Hood Felix hey Thanks yeah Meet Richard Burke Dickie to his friend there be no storm last night where would the lightning have come from be he be in the car when he die yup well it could not have be lightne then I mean aside from a little gas mileage it be essentially it be a Faraday cage anyway a what a Faraday cage it be a metal box and the current can flow around it but inside the electrical field remain zero and you can take a direct hit you will be fine check this out Doc oh the current come through the ignition huh yeah battery 's completely drain so it discharge into he when he turn the key but a car battery only have what 12 volt of electricity that be not enough to kill someone no especially notif you what a poor conductor of electricity the human body be I check and rechecke all the datum on the 45 lightning strike victim any pattern no similarity in age race gender height or personal effect no apparent difference between who live and die it be all over the map I need to talk with the coroner no Dr Hood I be sorry to say all our test continue to reveal nothing out of the ordinary Dr Hood can you hear I Lot of static on the line okay will you hold on for a second um one thing we have not try yet be you in the autopsy room now yes you uh with one of the victim yes do I a favor will you get close to the body please do not worry I will stay on the line all right now what close like this yeah just like that thank you Mr Han can you cut I a slice of the skin please we will be over in a minute in what authority believe to be a freak accident the battery in Richard Burke 's 20 year old truck discharge when he turn the key kill he instantly with Burke 's death mark the 31st electrocution in the Springfield area in less than two day state police be scramble to find a link between Tuesday 's lightning victim and this new case as of right now however the two incident appear to be unrelated and law enforcement be not instruct resident to take any special precaution for the storm system due to hit the Pioneer Valley later this week ow Damn it Charlie I 've get breakfast for you and coffee oh my God that be the section of epidermis from Denise Hall electrocute by lightning this be the section of epidermis from Dickie Burke electrocute by a car battery on a cloudless night we get to test these sample for resistance to electricity if it be low then that would explain why these victim seem to be attract electricity well we be just a county morgue we do not have the kind of equipment to do that here it be okay you get a flashlight thank you get a piece of paper I could use I be sure you know that uh skin be about as conductive to electricity as a piece of paper which be not very something about our victim be mess with the electromagnetic field on our cell phone Let us take a look now this this skin be conduct electricity the same way as wire or a piece of metal would I would be willing to bet that the other victim would be the same the question be why so there be metal in the skin well if your skin have a very high metal content you would be pull current toward you 24 7 that do not sound very safe no it be not okay but how do you get a bunch of metal in the skin the only way to answer that question be to look much close at this sample Liz hey I know you 've be work around the clock I bring you some chocolate with this electron microscope we should be able to get a much close look at the skin sample than with an everyday light microscope how much close oh a thousand or two time give or take wow what be it well it be some kind of nanofilament oh um sorry no it be um essentially uh nanofilament be just very fine metal wire they look like they be embed symbiotically in denise hall 's flesh that be not all look it be grow Hood be you say these wire be alive it be alive all right so what be it exactly a virus engineer by the look of it but a virus nonetheless I be guess you can not cure it with two aspirin and a bowl of chicken soup no I would say not I mean by the look of it his thing build wire in your skin look what it be do here see it pull metal from surround tissue and turn it into material for its wire I be tell you if you could harness this virus and make it lay down micro Wires on command the market would be limitless medical device security sensor Micro Batteries you could use this technology to make an airplane that hardly use any fuel you could make a car with a battery the size of a baby 's thumbnail I mean this virus be a scientific revolution but be it go to spread because if it be we have an epidemic of electrocution on our hand well it be not in the mucous membrane so it be not go to be airborne like a cold but I would say it could be pass skin to skin yeah so it will take a lot long to spread than an airborne virus would I suppose that be something well on the other hand a lot of virus be very difficult to kill want some more cheery news the storm that be roll in National weather service say it be go to be a big one Rachel young okay felix how long have we get five maybe six hour it be charlie wease they just bring he in upstairs he be in critical condition I be jacob hood I work for the fbi I be dr Heisey with the emergency room mean I have to treat this man now Doctor charlie wease and anyone else who survive a lightning strike in the past two day have get a virus that be sap the metal content from their body that be why his hair 's turn white it be an extreme copper deficiency you need to infuse Mr Wease and all the other patient immediately with copper zinc how about I examine the patient myself dr Hood thank you okay but do it quickly before his system shut down entirely please anyone deal with lightning victim do not touch their skin directly it be contagious Hood yeah Felix do some dig there be three company in the area work with nanotechnology okay so we need to take blood sample from employee from all of they test for the virus but we do not want a panic on our hand employee freak out leave before they get test no I will have the megahut create a backstop get you some lab tech from the bureau okay give the ceos just as much info as they need and use corporate drug testing as your cover hmm okay uh doc this thing be contagious that be right so use rubber glove Rubber glove use a whole rubber suit if I can find one might be difficult we will be collect blood and hair sample from all employee these sample will then be test for evidence of substance abuse you get a problem with that yeah move on these test be mandatory for your continue employment here at wilcox lab if everyone cooperate we will move quickly thank you people ow the doctor say if I read to you you might come out of this soon but I do not know what you would want to read any more remember when we read to each other on sunday afternoon that be nice be not it we should do that again charlie help I need some help in here help Damn it excuse I doctor why be that man not on life support every time we hook he up the machine blow out we can not afford to lose anymore can he survive without it not for long you be right about the metal deficiency though his body be out of almost every metal in the human body except calcium so you infuse he right we infuse he with a metal solution just like you suggest but it do not seem to do anything for his deficiency or any of the other victim they just keep get bad all the metal just seem to be getting drain out of they we have to find his wife right away I will alert hospital security hey doctor your hospital get a burn unit Best outside of boston your security do they carry metal detector I think so what be you get at okay well we find a network of microscopic wire in the victim 's skin I think that be what be make charlie wease sick what I want you to do be I want you to find those wire use the metal detector I want you to remove they by exfoliate away the epidermis down to the dermal layer his wife 's too where she be you need to find she this thing travel skin to skin so she probably have it it may even be her skin that short the life support you want I to give my patient second Degree burn nearly destroy their skin and leave they with a long and painful recovery Rebecca wease be be treat as we speak and felix have 28 positive for the metal virus yeah I be pretty sure this be ground zero well uh I 've have to make some cut recently but uh our high profile project be an x Ray gun that help our troop see through wall in combat what about the hot wheel oh that be to remind I of my favorite project of all do you know how a um pull back motor work you pull it back two inch and it can power itself across a room it be genius but uh if you try tfit that mechanism in a full Size car the gear train would have to stretch a block it would never work you know what would work a teeny Weeny little battery but uh something so small you could only make it with a nanotech virus be I right someday a battery small enough to fit inside this toy will be able to power an 18 wheeler with no smog no petrochemical and no noise it be amazing if I be lucky enough it will be my company that figure out how to do it my virus if the economy do not put we out of business first well I be sorry to tell you but you may be out of business before then your nanotech virus s kill people that be impossible our virus do not use a human host wait a minute be that what your people with the needle downstairs be all about I tell my employee they be be drug test half my physicist probably think they be go to be fire tomorrow morning we take measure to avoid a panic I be sorry mr Coleman but the test be come back positive for antibody from your virus see what be happen be people be die because nanofilament in their skin be turn they into human conductor there be a new storm come and that could mean new victim so what can you tell we um it be a long shot but I can only think of one person who would sabotage her own work just to spite I be that everyone uh everyone except for um Dr Elizabeth hansen lab 18 b thank you Agent lee yes I 've get a really weird result here you have the sample to back this up thank you Liz my god be you all right I think so I get a shock from the microwave liz the fbi think you sabotage the project they say that uh the virus escape and now it be hurt people maybe even you dr Hood hey doc none of our tech guy know exactly what this be but I think you should have a look at it can we use your lab do you have an image of the virus you be work with something from the very beginning of the project yes that be the original virus well this be the virus take from 28 of your colleague that test positive and this be the virus take from one of your colleague that test negative oh my god what be it it be mutate go through three stage from benign to deadly Virus mutate naturally that be why last year 's flu vaccine will be worthless by next winter so these two virus be mutation of your base virus yes but it should not have mutate into a human virus so quickly so how do virus a become virus b and c Radiation you would need a few hit but it be the only thing that would explain the rapid cellular change and whoever expose the base virus to radiation got infect with an early mutation of it and that be probably what protect they when the strain turn deadly it be like a vaccine yeah so whoever this version of the virus come from be our patient zero that be right thomas lowenthal I do not believe it you say you make x Ray gun here right they have to produce some kind of radiation do not they hansen and lowenthal both have lab at the basement level of this building if the mutate virus originate down here how do it get all the way to charlie wease or 30 other people you know what when I be set up the blood test the hr rep tell I that employee have a mandatory retreat about three week ago Hansen lowenthal and charlie wease be there along with 50 other people two day of trust fall and rope course would be enough to spread the virus to anyone in the company but not all the victim have contact with wilcox employee what about dickie burke the guy from the strip club right the clam digger be the close strip club to wilcox lab you know guy that work here hit that place all the time yeah Felix call the club shut it down and call the cdc but do not call it an epidemic God know how many people have be infect with this thing let us hope they do not want to go out in this storm with sectionsOf both the turnpike and the i 91 report intermittent flooding as a result of heavy rainfall as the storm intensify concern over fatal lightning strike in the area continue and law enforcement officer be advise hampden county resident to remain inside for the duration of the storm if at all possible we would like to remind our viewer that lightning can travel into the home via telephone wire electrical outlet hey what be go on County 's turn off nonessential power just come in through the radio folk be suppose to go home and stay there they say why something to do with the weather the lightning listen first charlie and denise then those drug test now this it be like the end of day let us get go Fbi stop stop Dr Lowenthal Rachel Watch stay back thank do not mention it I 've get your back guy we should get in Thought he do not have the virus he do not he have bad luck Agent young dr Hood Hi dr Hansen how be the other patient well the treatment 's working the virus appear to only colonize the outer layer of the skin and the county 's authorize mandatory testing and vaccination that should stop it from spread How 's thomas Dr Lowenthal do not make it we find the prototype x Ray gun on he and the intermediate virus be still present in his lab work he be sabotage you dr Hansen be they have a memorial for he at the lab Monday I would like to go to that pay my respect share some memory really I know I do not um seem like the most personable employee at wilcox in fact I can be kind of a bitch ah I be sure you be not that bad I be but the microbattery project be my passion in this life and even though dr Lowenthal be a two Faced bastard he provide I with excellent competition Agent lee Agent young dr Hood we all test negative for the virus Nice work on this case felix and I be glad to hear your skin be not infest with a deadly nanofilament thank you kind of creepy to think about be not it little metal wire alive in your skin I would be careful there if I be you you never know if those little metal wire be hang out on your jacket your shirt your tie what be that hang from your hair by the way rachel Wise ass welcome to www 1000fr com 42 year old male show up at the law office this morning fine until he begin complain of a foul taste in his mouth and feel dizzy bad taste in his mouth right before the dizziness so he go to get a drink of water and ten minute later he be on the floor of the man 's room he stop breathe www 1000fr com present Capture FRM ´ ó± ¦ Sync FRS 33 apparently she start complain about some sort of bad taste in her mouth then she start get dizzy and I be think it be maybe some sort of poison this be like classic SLUDGE syndrome hey take she back I will check the poison index check symptom right now I be connect to the poison index symptom include salivation Lacrimation with loss of bladder and bowel control hey we get a poison cluster here no question about it Test come back positive for anthrax it be the real thing an entire school for rock musician my dad would have an aneurysm he use to yell at Bon Jovi on the tv well he would have love Beethoven long hair dress like a tramp love to throw food and trash furniture have no one be back here since uh since they evacuate no uh not here not the victim 's home his workplace or the bus he ride to work this morning yeah well an anthrax scare will do that well we be five mile away from the White House you can not blame Homeland Security for get jumpy speak of which should not we have mask on if you like Hood look a friend of mine be a world expert on the Ebola virus and uh they fly in a patient charter aircraft private airstrip whole runway under quarantine the crew be wear full body spacesuit she meet they at the airport wear street clothe and a pair of kitchen glove Disease be not the weapon Fear be the weapon you know there be a band call Anthrax I be more of a Cradle of Filth man myself you be joke right you see this the student repair their own instrument so Dr Hood Agent Young Special Agent in Charge Joe Brennan I be uh lead this case for the Joint Terrorism Task Force I be the one who call you in for the science consult Hmm Word at the Bureau be that uh you have yet to be stump so uh your perfect record go to remain intact I be not really one for statistic can you tell I be your um anthrax victim a drummer yeah yeah he be uh how do you know that well anthrax be cause by a bacterium that live on uh grazing animal and these um these drum be cover in goat skin you see if you scrape off an infected skin to replace it chance be you be go to inhale some of the spore that be why import skin be inspect and license I suspect the person you need to find be the person that make this drum because he use a hide that be not inspect so we be safe here as long as you promise I you be not go to play the drum I be sorry Agent Brennan but uh I be go to have to take Dr Hood to Philadelphia yeah no problem I will have the uh lab boy remove this drum right away so what be in Philadelphia Trouble you ever hear of the Toxic Exposure Surillance System yeah it be a real time database of poison victim they keep a track of event that cluster in time and location well that be Felix on the phone they flag a pattern just under two hour ago People drop all over Philadelphia with identical symptom the mystery lie in the timing and the complete absence of any connection between the victim and we do not believe in coincidence do we well to quote Mr Ian Fleming once be happenstance Twice be coincidence the third time it be enemy action Happenstance be that even a word you be you be a loud one hey Mrs Wilson hey be anything wrong I I be fine when I leave the house this morning I have to stop and sit down I 've get a taste like I eat something bad why do not you go home if you do not feel good oh no I would rather be here I be not one of those people who live alone because they like it oh here let I take that honey oh you sure yeah the Sanduskys be come into town today pick up Otis at 3 00 so I be go to get he ready to go home he be go to miss Winston when he leave that be for sure you should have see the noise these two be make this morning when they be play yes be not that Mrs Wilson Mrs Wilson Mrs Wilson Somebody help I be think organophosphate poisoning I be treat with atropine and pam 2 chloride now my first thought be it might be some kind of nerve agent but it be way too slow which branch of the military do you serve in Dr Lieber the Army who tell you nerve agent would never be a civilian doctor 's first diagnosis well I do not know of any nerve agent that make a patient explode Technically it be a fireball not an explosion but you be right five new case include the explode woman they all live in different part of town and they all work in different part of town they all drop in different part of town if there be a link it have not show up yet can we talk to any of they well not if they be all intubated and sedate like mine okay let us uh put everything together and see what we 've get you you can not move they not the people just the clothe and effect get a hold of Felix tell he to collect everything see if he can find somewhere close by where we can work got it who be he Agent Lee advance scouting and support no he you know there be that moment at the beginning of every disaster when it be like a genie fly out of a bottle you get one chance to grab it by its neck before it be out of reach and out of control he be the guy who do that SLUDGE go ahead and curse for real Hood it help just let it out I 've hear bad it be hilarious that be an acronym for the symptom Salivation lacrimation urination diarrhea okay I get it all the patient be affect the same way I mean organophosphate poisoning 's not uncommon it come from exposure to pesticide or fertilizer but it be usually chronic and low dose it be not acute and not five case all at once no so the question be why would all these victim be expose to a high dose Sarin gas maybe yeah well that be the right kind of thinking 'cause it do affect the uh central nervous system but I think the doctor 's right it be too slow acting to be a nerve agent maybe there be some other way the poison could be weaponize or maybe it be just an accidental release we have to get more fact before we can make a picture I be preppe to work onsite security for the big G 8 summit in d C when I get the call about this I be really hope I could meet the president I be sure he will be disappoint the G 8 ' this week do not you watch the news only when there be no cartoon on all right then each bag contain the clothe and effect of one patient you use glove to handle everything yeah just like you say well if it be poison there could be some trace on the clothe if it be poison should not the blood test have pick that up you test for specific thing it be like a Catch 22 you need to have an idea of what you be look for so you can choose the right test to find it yeah well in this case um it could be any number of factor Snake venom uh pesticide even some of the new uh Alzheimer 's drug in high enough dose do any of those thing ever cause a person to explode no not really it could be something new you need anything else yeah a map of Philadelphia suburb I be on it hey Felix nice work collect up all the evidence and improvise a work space so quickly maybe next time hey Felix nice work you know back in the ' 90 I hear of uh certain government who would try to take down their enemy by use poison clothing that be one designer label you would want to avoid there be one who be a civil right worker European lady check into this big corporate hotel and there be this pretty fancy bathrobe wait for she in her closet so she put it on wear it for about an hour and she nearly die do she explode no Most death from acute o p poisoning um happen through muscle paralysis nice yeah everything close up and you end up asphyxiate but even a small amount be enough to damage you for life so even if our victim respond to treatment they could still wind up damage yeah we have to get on top of this pretty quickly the soon we find out what be happen the soon we can help they this be Rachel thank for let we know Mrs Wilson the fireball victim she just die well I hate to say it but with 80 burn her chance be never very good now I guess we well start look through their stuff see what kind of picture emerge who live where who be marry who use nicotine gum do leave a bad taste in your mouth yeah what we be look for really be uh thing the victim have in common a place a habit guilty secret that be the kind of thing that be go to help we find our poison okay Mrs Wilson be a widow on a fix income Brown eye organ donor member of the Philadelphia Free Library and she work part time at a doggy day care Hood it be nothing whatever cause the fireball be consume in the flame okay Ames let us go over the agenda first we pick up your poor sick brother from school then we get to go to work with Mommy Cool and we get to ride the train and guess what you might get to watch the movie with the other kid today Awesome I need your cell phone your wallet and the Medic Alert bracelet anything they can use to identify you do anyone have a 20 on Andre okay if he be not here in 15 minute we go without he you know what we be about to do demand absolute discipline do everyone understand that 'cause any deviation from the plan will not be tolerate and will be deal with by I put a bullet into your head now if anyone be feel nervous have second thought if anyone want to back out sorry it be too damn late okay 986 River Street and 74 West Norwich Norwich 856 North Columbus and 2843 Eureka Terrace Eureka last one wake up at 8209 Cyers Lane and go down at 4413 East 61st Street I love Post its one of the good invention of the 20th century what do you think Hood yeah I I kind of like the fact that you can stick they onto anything about this oh yeah the yellow flag be the victim ' home and the red one show the place wherthey fall no pattern exactly no pattern can be uh quite significant sometimes it be a matter of look for what be not there anyone see any car key no no I neither everyone here live on one end of town and work on the other so if we uh if we just draw a line from every home to every workplace what do we get a mess up map I will buy you an atlas Subways there be more than one subway pass here and token well I will bet that everyone here use the transit system at some point in the morning they would have pass each other roundabout here in the center of town oh wow City Hall station that be the busy stop on the whole Philly subway system we have to speak to someone who know about the Philadelphia let I get that for you Doc no I get it call the Philadelphia Police Department have they alert the SWAT team can I tell they what they will be deal with I do not know yet could be a leak or a spill could be snake on a train okay baby doll Mommy 's get one last thing to do hi if you be call about temporary employment I be sorry but we have everyone we need for the next event but please leave your name and number and we will put you on our list thank you for call the Broad Street Theater Great Bingo we be do baby you want to read out the sign as we pass by remember we have to get off at City Hall this be go to be such a fun day Captain Ashton yeah but you can call I Clark hi I be Special Agent Rachel Young this be

that be after autopsy Search turn up no drug no paraphernalia but I do find a couple item that look like they 've just be open what be that it be a promotional box of perfume it say Touchant under the

in Seattle really wow God I be sorry be he feel well good yeah I be great tomorrow night yeah sure what time okay all right I will see you then bye yes smell like Paris in here do not it yeah definitely of course perfume be one of the most ancient of art form the three wise man bring frankincense and myrrh to Jesus before that the Egyptians entomb their pharaohs with aromatic but it be create to cover bad smell right it be also create to ward off thing like the plague yes yes this be one of our chemist this be Renny Boyle uh yes but of course today most fragrance be use to flavor food 60 actually Less than 10 be perfume but this of course be where the true art still lie and the regulation stop excuse I you do not have to list ingredient on perfume so you can put anything you want in there pretty much recently they find very high estrogen level in a body lotion they have to take it off the market because it be cause cancer yes yes but here we use only the pure of ingredient now for example our new fragrance have over 650 different ingredient and very few of they be synthetic that would be uh fervor yes where do you get that that be the promotional package that go out to all of Scent 100 Scent 100 uh yes I be sorry it be a list of 100 of the fashion industry 's most elite we send out a very limited release of the fragrance it uh create anticipation so um Hailey Vaughn would have be on the list yes that be right yeah she be one of very few just a handful omodel on that list very lucky girl Hailey Vaughn be dead sir I see well then I think that you well speak to our attorney there be nothing dangerous about our perfume oh well maybe not to the person that wear it but what about the person that smell it we will also need the list of 100 people so we can recall the box as a safety measure seem a little premature at this point we do not want to cause unnecessary panic be you worried about the public or your company 's bottom line we can get a court order if we need to I be pretty sure you do not have enough for that I be absolutely certain that this be an unfortunate misunderstanding I be the primary nose here at Touchant no ingredient go into one of our perfume without my knowledge okay it be take I two year it be take I hundred of clinical test to perfect this scent Good then you will not mind one more test Fine I will have Renny draw up a sample of fervor be that it almost if we do find anything dangerous in the sample your company will be our primary suspect thank for your help Kristopher if there be anything to this you will take the fall and you will take it alone Hey Agent Young 's at the coroner 's office extra pair of hand Felix could you do I a favor could you please write down a couple of thing for I on the board Sure if you do not mind thank uh huh okay Vanilla Vanilla um Honeysuckle Jalapeño pepper it be a perfume recipe Civet musk what be that Civet it be kind of um half cat half fox and they use the musk in perfume to make uh make it evaporate slow make the odor last long you know they also use beaver gland and whale fat in perfume too not so much not anymore I mean aside from the whole endanger species thing there be a fear that if the animal be disease it could carry on in human so technically if diseased oil be in the perfume that could cause people to go nut I mean that be what I be think yeah I will run another test for contaminant while we uh break down the rest of the perfume 's ingredient how many more we get uh 650 something I should write these small you want to see I yes Renny the police that be here early do you have any idea why they be not police they be FBI and they have a crazy idea that our perfume be make people violent which be completely unfounded right right all the proper test have be run have not they I have do everything you have ask I to do I always have then there be nothing to worry about be there if you say so sir may I go back to work now yes it be open good evening evening sit on the bed please I would like you to indulge I that be what I be here for Put on that perfume please not bad I be glad you like it all right let us begin final autopsy report find the same skin pigmentation mark on Hailey and the runway model it all point to the perfume be the common denominator what be you think Hood he be use pheromone Pheromones that be what give people the hot for each other right well yeah only a select few I mean pheromone they use gene typing which be like blood type which mean only certain pheromone attract certain people whoa whoa whoa so I might dig somebody and you might not base on the way they smell then there actually be something to chemistry between people well that would explain why only certain people be become violent okay but it be more than that he be get to be use it in conjunction with something else we just do not know what yet I know you want I I be only here for you Quiet please Quiet try to concentrate okay I have another appointment and um this be get all too weird sit down sit sit down sit no get off you be not get off I go anywhere we will get the book after they tag it meantime they can run ballistic on the bullet look like she carry the gun in her purse weapon be a 22 what be her name Lyla thank you lyla hi my name 's Jacob Jacob Hood I be not a cop I be a scientist and um I think I know what happen listen I know that he attack you first can I ask you a question please do he make you wear perfume yes can you show I do you have mark on your wrist okay he be go to kill I I do not know what else to do I understand he be just sit there write all this stuff in a notebook and then why do he do this to I he be conduct an experiment and it go out of hand so I be some kind of guinea pig no he be so what be this um this be something I find in the perfume in the hotel room the real perfume all right bring on the fancy science Doc I can handle it it be a neurotransmitter molecule little less fancy it be like a um instant messenger for the brain there be about 300 of they and they tell we uh what to think and feel and how to act we only really know what about half of they do and what do we think this one do well we think this one make people crazy okay well why be not this one in the sample that Merced give we because the perfume Merced create be clean do we think that someone else put it in the promotional package that be what I be get from his note after we visit he he be worry there be something wrong with his masterpiece so he decide to test it himself the hooker that be right Merced be innocent so who put the hot in the perfume we do a patent search on the base element of your fervor perfume it turn out there be a patent challenge your chemist Renny Boyle claim to have invent it in his own time Renny be the lab tech who give you the sample the clean sample More like a clean up sample think it be fake then he be liable for the violence it be look that way but why it do not make sense this be a multimillion dollar company be not it 50 million a year actually well we need to talk with Renny find out how he come up with the formula if we want to contain it he be not here he call in sick his computer 's be wipe completely clean I will put out an apb on Renny the mark the mark on the skin that must be the key do you run clinical trial here yes we have a whole line of cosmetic that be what we need to look at right now here be the rest of the result from the self tanning lotion trial but the formula be miss okay okay how do you effect a color change a pigmentation change in the skin one way the simple way be a colorless sugar interact withthe dead skin cell but you could you could go directly through the brain affect the neuron in the body that tell the skin to get dark like the neurotransmitter you be talk about exactly so this be some kind of side effect from a self tanning lotion Touchant be develop could be accord to this subject great tan but I feel energetic and arouse this be not suntan lotion it be ber love potion well okay well my guess be he discover it by accident but mix it up with pheromone deliberately that would increase the effect of both of they lower the inhibition increase the sex drive which then lead to violent urge you know what I think this could have be market as the world 's first scientifically prove aphrodisiac if it have not be for the violent side effect we need to round up the rest of the perfume box right away I need those 100 name yeah NYPD 's go house to house and person to person go through that Scent 100 list we get almost all the box account for soon as I be do here I be jump on the task force that be track down Renny Boyle that be good work Felix thank you listen you do something else for I I want
