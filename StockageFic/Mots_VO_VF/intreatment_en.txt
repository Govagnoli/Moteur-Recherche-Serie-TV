there be a huge gap between the depth that you reach last week and the height at which you be today I be just try to I be just try to adjust myself so that I do not I guess come to the surface too quickly do you dive Paul yes I well we use to who be speak in the plural now I can not imagine you dive where have you go Mexico the Caribbean be you interested in Scuba diving I be a certify diver I know what the bend be sorry no seriously I dov a lot before I meet Andrew he he hate it it be claustrophobic it be nice to find we have something in common you and I be not it where be you now Laura I just have a scary thought I just I know it be silly but Beforehand when you say your your lung could explode I do not know it be just the thought that something might happen to you yet you be the one

attach to Natalie 's nipple this this huge dark nipple I 've never see anything like it in my life and at one point she take her boob out of the baby 's mouth and squeeze it and some milk squirt out Ani look over at Andrew and he have this admire smile on his face you know like he be loe at some masterpiece in a Museum like the Madonna what do you think he see maybe an image of you and he together in the future maybe or maybe he just miss her tit no not really they be not that nice she be change a lot since she have the baby in what way I do not know I do not really know she before but Andrew tell I a lot about her he say she be this wild type you know who have a lot of guy chase she she put he through hell he say they would go to bed and she would be one person and then they would wake up and she would be someone totally new a free radical that be what he use to call she he say I remind he of her that be scary like this be what be leave of her the front of her t shirt soak wet and nipple nipple that be all that be leave she be like a wild animal that be somehow be Shit what be the word domesticate yeah domesticate she looked domesticate Housebroken she say her wild sexual fantasy be to sleep four hour straight do that scare you a little oh my god I would die if I turn into a Lousy Lay you know someone who gets fuck in her sleep and can not even remember do you think that be what happen to people after they get marry I do not now do it be sex something you forget how to do or be it like ride a bike I think that depend on the on the couple of course sex can be a subterfuge it can Paul okay okay so anyway when I go to the kitchen to help out with something and when I come back Andrew and Gary be engross in this deep conversation about you will not believe this upholsterer there be this upholsterer who redo their entire living room Andrew 's take down the guy 's number and I be like what be you do and he say you know you and I discuss you know recover those armchair your dad give you I be tell you Paul we never discuss this and all of a sudden Andrew 's reupholstere armchair I mean we be talk metrosexual that do not sound very much like the Andrew that you 've be talk about exactly I mean this be beyond metrosexual do you ever watch the Animal Planet well it be about this type of bird I can not remember the name of it but anyway the male bird build a nest for the female these amazingly intricate structure they be incredible anyway the female go from nest to nest you know check out all her various mating option try to make up her mind while the male bird be desperately flap about and try to attract the female with his architecture you know the nest look like cage anyway the whole way home I think I would not be able to fight this anymore so when we get near the house we be about to park Andrew say to I do you want to go to the movie or stay home and I say I say yes and he say yes the movie and I say yes I will I will marry you I mean fuck it fuck I will marry you yes so where do you think this Fuck it yes come from when everything you 've be say to Andrew everything you 've be do for that past few week have actually be one big no mean what you think Andrew take I there as some sort of object lesson to show I how good it could be for we 'cause I do not think so Andrew be a pretty mediocre psychologist would you listen to I I just say yes and I be already bad mouth my future husband you do not answer my question Laura where do this yes come from you really do not understand why I say yes to he it be because you say no to I because because I say no to you I mean the whole situation be just one big fucking no I be not blame you I be not accuse you I be just do you expect a different reaction in your fantasy how would I respond to you say that you be let us say in love with I first of all take the quotation mark off the in love with I it be insult and stop with the fantasy talk because fantasy be for silly little girl you know we be talk about reality which be that I be in love with you but I still that be reality I still want to talk about fantasy for a minute not the fantasy of a silly little girl but the fantasy of a grow smart woman please let us not do that that be beneath my dignity well I do not think there be anything beneath our dignity if it take we someplace our dignity refuse to go you remember that story you tell I that summer when you be 15 year old in San Diego that couple you live with the one who have no child David and Celia you say that summer be be very significant to you my God my mother have just die Paul of course it be significant what be the point in rehash all this my mother die I be very lucky to have somebody take I in for a few month I mean so I just wanna go back to that period for a little bit if you do not mind your mother be go your mother be your last wall of protection against your father from your father 's how do you put it toxic fume toxic fume yes his loneliness his fear his dependency on you you say that he would call you up in California and say how unhappy he be and how much he miss your mother beg you to cut your vacation short and come back home what be this get to do with anything you take a liking to these people who be athletic healthy the exact opposite of your parent in every way and you describe David very vividly and you say he be very kind to you yeah you know he use to take I camping we would go surf use to just talk about stuff you know Teenage bullshit you be very attract to he he be a hunk yeah he look like Nick Nolte they smoke a lot of grass a lot of grass I smoke with they it be my first time and when that summer be over they say it be a shame they could not adopt you they say we want a daughter just like you yeah I actually ask they to see if it be possible if there be some legal way to Aanyway they just laugh at I they do not take I seriously they say I be so cute actually I want he to adopt I she be great Celia but you know I be 15 I want he all to myself make a lot of sense when you think about it you be 15 year old your father be grieve completely dependent on you David must have seem like a life raft just as just perhaps I be now from Andrew perhaps I be an alternative to everything that Andrew represent Dependency anxiety but I be not a realistic option for you this be a safe place where you can come like David at the beach yes but with one big difference what be that I do not want you to adopt I I want you to fuck I I need to pee there be a problem with the with the thing it be it be block up I just call I be go to call the handyman well then may I well we be almost out of time so what be we camp I need to pee what be the big deal I be very clean I will not messy your bathroom I prefer my patient to use the but you say that the toilet overflow why do not we just finish up for today I can owe you the 10 minute when you come back next week what you be afraid your wife will see I or that I will see she be she even home now I mean what be she sit on the couch with roller in her hair drink beer this have nothing to do with my wife Fine forget it if it freak you out that much well I bet that do not come up in med school do it what to do in the follow situation a patient in love with the therapist ask to use the bathroom the bathroom be out of order the patient then ask to enter the therapist 's home what should the therapist do I be sorry if the correct answer be it depend on what the therapist feel towards his patient I can see you might interpret this do not interpret Paul I 've have it up to here with your fucking interpretation you know what kill I no matter what I say or do you see everything as more proof that nothing be go on here you turn I into a 15 year old who be not take seriously a silly little girl who people just pat on the head and say be not she cute you know the stop patronize I Paul look I know when I turn somebody on you know what thought of you the first time I see you what I think you look like a dead man I think beneath that professional exterior be a man who stop live I want to take your heart in my hand and just pump life into it maybe that be your sense of of what happen to married people that they just stop live maybe you be afraid that be what will happen if you marry Andrew just my be here have bring you back to life Laura let us yeah I know you would deny it I mean how could something like this happen to you huh but it do happen I know it happen and you know it happen what happen Laura I and you Paul we happen the thought you have before you fall asleep next to your wife happen I think we be out of time for today why do not we talk about this next week when you when you come back just tell I I think you owe it to I do you want I just a simple yes or no no previously on in Treatment Let us just cut to the chase okay Saturday morning I be stand near the bomb site it be like London after the Blitz just rubble and all because of what I do I know this shoud have be the drama of my life but I feel nothing this old man come over to I and I look in his eye and he be sort of amuse kind of friendly like my father look at I when he think I 've do something wrong you still think it be too early to talk about your father when a person decide he be not in love with his spouse he should not have to put off leave home be not that so do not you think that be a little extreme what be your name this be for you what be it an expression machine the Pasquini Livia Top of the line for I with a three year warranty be this some kind of hint about the coffee you have here last week no hint it be a statement Transcript Jonathan Sync Benj check this out your coffee be horrify I do not want to hurt your feeling I will not tell you the truth about your coffee and what it say about you what do it say about I I may tell you later how do you like your coffee machine it be uh really nice but I um I can not accept it I be I be sorry what be you a government employee hey I get this for an amazing price in an auction in a what an auction on the internet Ebay I pick the time when the whole country 's glue to the television price drop 70 80 like during the super bowl get myself a home entertainment system eight speaker and a receiver for only 1 000 would 've cost 4 500 retail anyway thursday be the American Idol finale and I think of you so I go online and grab this could you turn that off please what just switch it off please what be you afraid of what be the big deal it be a coffee machine look I think it be a really sweet gesture and I I thank you do not you want to upgrade the standard of live around here and I know you only drink tea but what about your poor patient um no offense but do not you feel there be something aggressive in what you be do here I mean you have not even ask I if it be something that I want if it be okay with I okay fine it be just a stupid machine Jeez I be just try to understand what you want to say with this nothing what do you think that by I bring this to you that I be what try to buy you I do not know why be it important for I to have a coffee machine maybe because the coffee that it make be top quality I come here once a week for the time be and I need coffee here more than anywhere else to open up and all that crap so I bring the machine with I and six different kind of bean from the totally bitter gourmet Guatemala to the kind that postal pilot drink Jungle java which be sickeningly sweet you know what I 've get an idea deduct it from what I owe you I do not think so sorry could you be mad at I for something else altogether like what because I meet a patient of yours you meet a patient of mine yesterday I get the day wrong and I accidentally meet Laura I gather it be a delicate situation when patient meet yeah what do you mean a delicate situation well I do not know I think you therapist have some kind of ethical code like I tell you intimate detail about her thing she may not want her therapist to know about she I leave she walk in and tell you the same kind of information about I could that be consider a breach in your ethical code I do not think there be any ethical problem no of course I be not allow to discuss other patient but you be free to talk about what be happen in your life and what be happen between you and Laura like like anything else okay but what be happen between I and Laura would not have happen if we be not patient of yours I meet she right out front here that probably would not have happen anywhere else on the planet so you believe there be kind of a unique significance to the fact that you meet a patient of mine what do you think it be I be ask you I think we 've start therapy Alex what you bring I a coffee machine because you intend to come here more often and you want to feel at home through Laura you be try to relate that message to I she be your patient and I be too so we be officially in therapy about the coffee machine let us do this let us just say it be here on loan as long as I keep come here it be here when it be over I will take it with I Deal okay I guess um I I would like some some time to think it over though but it be okay think positive if I remember correctly your wife do not allow you to drink coffee at home that be correct do you feel that this be a place where you can say and do thing that you might not be allow to do at home no that issue 's solve thank to you I leave home you really help I with that in our last session show I that leave home be my own personal decision hey doc I be serious you really do help I I leave here much more determined than when I arrive to carry out this disengagement I go straight home and tell Michaela I want to leave home and I say it in the same way I would tell she I be go to take the car to the garage and be that what you really feel that it be so trivial yeah that be what I feel absolutely and here be how it happen Michaela be make salmon it be always salmon on tuesday and I tell she I want to leave home let I tell you she do not even turn her head away from the stove she just say that I could 've guess this would happen and you never surprise I Alex not even now how do you feel about that be you be you hurt by that she be not try to hurt I it be just the way she be and I may have do her wrong last week the way I present she but you 've get to understand she be a superintelligent woman when she be 22 she be already work on her PHD at Georgetown so if she say she be expect it then I 've get to believe she see I go through something since the bombing and the heart attack and the suspension from the force she see much more than I be willing to show and realize that it could result in we separate you know what be interesting be that you be talk today about your wife like you know she be some mythical superwoman that be able to anticipate everything 10 step in advance as far as intelligence go absolutely really no matter what else you say about she she be get the brain of a rocket scientist on the Manhattan project still be not there something in her reaction that disappoint you I mean you come home you drop this bombshell and she be indifferent to you yeah but that be not the case here we be not one of those couple that create drama all the time on the contrary we could 've drag this on for year just for the sake of the kid as they say have you tell the kid yet no not yet now Roy my eld he be be lock up in his room for day do some kind of chess championship on the internet and Noelle my daughter she be on some kind of school trip but you will have to tell they at some time of course someday they will have to accept the fact that their father leave home to look for a new life they can not understand that at their age how do you think they will feel about that Roy will understand I for sure he be a very special boy he have inner truth you know Roy 's 11 year old and he hardly ever leave the house he just sit at home and he sit by the computer and play chess and I mean he just no girlfriend no buddy no basketball and at first it drive I crazy 'cause he just seem so miserable so lonely unpopular I try everything I I organize tour at the air force museum for all the kid they could come and sit in the cockpit of a real F 16 play with the simulator and it be no use I mean those tour he would walk around all alone the only one near he be like some I do not know some ugly leper kid all the kid be afraid to get next to it be kind of hard to see that be not it sometimes it be hard for we as parent to see our kid lonely than it be for the kid himself it take I a long time to realize that then I realize that he be happy that I have the problem that I I could not accept the fact that he be not popular that he be an outsider and that be okay it be just his personality I use to give he and michaela such a hard time I would call the counselor I would call the teacher and everybody say there be no problem the boy feel good about himself it be just the way it be be it hard for you to accept yeah but you know today I be jealous of he cause he do not need anybody he be get his own world he be get his movie and book and computer game and chess and the kid be bear without a competitive bone in his body even the chess stuff it be not about win he do not care if he win he just like the thinking it require a few year ago I try to organize this ping pong tournament for his for his class in the backyard he turn to I and he say Dad do not you feel sorry for these kid only one will win and it be probably Robert and the rest will look pathetic in front of the girl do not you feel sorry for they I swear I do not know where he get those gene certainly not from I you think he be too good to be connect to your gene be you make fun of I I want you to listen to what you be say about yourself this boy be your own flesh and blood you you love he dearly you be very proud of his beautiful quality and yet you think well he be the exact opposite of I he could not possibly be connect to I please let us not get into that again no this be completely a genetic issue look he get the female gene from Michaela and my mother my mother she be the same way there be selflessness in everything she do just like Michaela she never feel like she be miss out on something somewhere else she do not care if she be fulfil herself and all that shit there be there be something pure about her wholesome like Roy no he get that from her so the woman in your family be they be pure and wholesome unblemishe and that the man be somehow the opposite dirty in conflict with themselves that be not a bad description of my father Dirty as hell he keep fall in love with different woman at the office he be have affair like some kind of dirty dog yes and the guy have it make he have a woman at home who love he let he have his career no question ask she take care of the kid and make sure that the entity call family exist what you 've get to understand about my dad he live this whole life on this civil right pioneer ticket you know a guy who survive the Klan and march with King who could say anything to he he suffer for we all and you mother be not part of that movement I like he I like my dad she be from back east from Delaware well breed she be the hope of the family a pianist she study at the Music Academy she be consider a virtuoso she could play Liszt in her sleep you know Liszt only Liszt could play Liszt yeah she be really something she be um Rare you never sense any bitterness in she that the whole music thing never materialize you still miss she of course she save his life by that I mean at at the march on Washington in ' 63 right before King 's big speech Mahalia Mackson sing that song I been ' buke and I be scorn and they catch eye in the crowd and they both have tear flow down their face and they feel connect my father be this lonely angry man and she well she melt he she be the only person he ever trust he be at war with the rest of the world and the war be not over believe I and still he he cheat on her constantly the guy just want more and more all the time but he do not leave she no what be you crazy why would he leave she he love she you be sure about that be you sure that it be not just that he hold she in very high esteem and that he be really grateful for everything that she have do for he throughout his life be you try to justify he he could 've leave she why make her life miserable and you unlike he you be try to do the right thing you be leave home just like that you be not drag out thing like he do okay all right all right I see you believe in the whole theory that child try to rectify what their parent do wrong all right okay I do not know that it be about rectification I think it be more what we call a pattern we unconsciously repeat pattern that we have witness in childhood but you say I be try to rectify what my father do I think you be present it that way but on a deep level I think there may be more similarity between you and your father 's view of marriage I do not know what you mean really you can not see any way in which you and your father may have marry the same kind of woman it seem to I that you both married woman whom you admire but but you do not necessarily love that be some bullshit you actually buy this shit that I be repeat my father 's mistake let I tell you something what be go on in my marriage have get nothing to do with my father so stop compare we perhaps you might not have love Michaela because you admire she so much for be so perfect wait why be we still talk about Michaela that story be over because I be not sure that your leave she be really the solution to how you feel about yourself I wanna go back to Laura for a minute why be it so important to go back to Laura be it because she be my patient and you think it might bother I that you meet I do not get this why can not I talk about her what be the big deal about meet she you will not believe how much this cost 450 I mean that be crazy right too bad they do not sell property on the online auction I mean now that Michaela have the house during the Indy 500 or something I could go on get a place in the same neighborhood for almost half a million buck you get the deal of your life here doc someone who do not know about the whole tv factor would 've pay 1 500 for it minimum so if I be here for a year then that mean you be rent it for 8 a week could we get back to our therapy session Alex okay well Laura could not get over it I show she the machine and she just she could not believe it would you like to would you like to tell I how you two meet Sure I lose track of time I move in with my gay friend Daniel and his little boyfriend I tell you about they and they be real happy I leave home they bring their friend over to meet I and they 've turn I into the talk of the gay community so I 've be go along with it you know I go to dinner drink I even go to this gay club with they on sunday they tell I there would be some hot lady there somebody I could pick up that be not even lesbian and it do not do anything for I what it do be make I lose track of time I be up all night long so I could 've swear yesterday be tuesday so I come here but when I get here I see Laura leave I walk up to she and I ask she if everything be okay she say everything be not okay that she run over a dog or almost run over this dog yesterday morning the way she describe it it sound like this the airedale terrier pedigree the airedale terrier be the only dog in history to be knight by the king of England for bravery in battle do you know that I do not know that no yeah well it do it be an amazing story I mean this dog okay well maybe next time I ask she if she have be leave a session with you and she be a bit take aback like I have catch she in something shameful hell I think only Navy pilot feel that way about see a shrink anyway I admit to she that I be see you also and I realize that I be here a day early she think that be just hilarious that someone could get the day mix up and she be get this I do not know she be get this way of look at you it be like this girl she be get there be something fierce about her right what do you mean I do not know she be get this look it be like it be like she be use to get her own way and you know what she say she say that you could ruin even a cup of Lipton tea I mean come on so I guess you be both in the same in the same boat so to speak totally anyway so we get in my car and we drive to the accident site naturally there be not any dog there so we grab a cup of coffee and I sketch the area on a napkin at her place no why would you say that no some cafe so I draw she an overhead view of the area I be a genius at that you know the yard and the green area anywhere where a dog might make himself disappear sound like a real military operation to be honest I kind of miss that just be up in the air reduce the area on a map look for a man intelligence have be after for 3 month so do you find the dog no it probably go and die somewhere but you could say it still have a happy ending hey be be our time almost up no we have about we have about five minute oh sorry I think this thing be off Speak of the devil I be suppose to meet Laura do you mind if I take this sure go ahead yeah hey what be up no not yet but but judge from paul 's face he will kick I out of here in a minute or 2 I know right yeah all right bye so what do you think should I go for her Laura oh co Paul Come on you can tell I I know it be not ethical but you be my shrink too she be the first woman I 've be out with in 15 year I do not want to have a lousy experience I be sorry I can not give you that kind of advice Alex but she be she be the kind of woman that you know could drive a man insane be I right Paul just man to man give I a little tip I can not do that this could affect my whole life I can not give you date tip Alex sorry just stop it that be all right 'cause I be not use to you give I advice anyway but you know you always help out in the end in your crazy roundabout kind of way and when she be here for her session try to pull the espresso

catboat it be beautiful thank you it be a go away present this be our last session right you say three no I say at least three if you be totally sick of listen to other people 's insipid life then

that scare you I think it be the possibility that um you will not be come back sorry but no I buy you a goodbye present see ya I know it be a goodbye present but there be another way to look at it maybe you want to leave something behind so that I will not forget you you say you like the boat I do if you do not want it I will take it back do you want to take it back so if someone my age want to start therapy how would it work well we would take it at that person 's own pace not like these last few session the evaluation the three Session deadline nothing like that see the person who be in therapy control the gas so to speak and the wheel for that matter so it be like drive a car yeah it be a bit like drive a car so pretend I be in therapy now all right I say pretend so what do I do why

father say to she in this voice Olivia leave it to I and then he start to cry and I be just stand there stick in the kitchen Hungry as fuck with these two baby I do not remember the day he actually leave I just remember that day in the kitchen where do he go back to New York with his new wife and I stay here with my mother who be totally depressed Cy and Darlene they live close by so they help I get to practice and back they do not want I to give it up why be you look at I like that it be just the way you talk about it like you be not so upset about the breakup as the way they do it maybe that be what be make you sad I be not sad be that what people be suppose to do in therapy sit around and whine over all their problem it be never go to happen that be what she would do I be nothing like her your mom where be your dad while all this be go on I tell you in New York with Natasha do you ever consider live with they no we once think maybe but it do not work out why not they need their space they do not last anyway he want I to live with they he be really piss that she say no so it really sour their relationship so you blame yourself whatever way the cookie crumble you be still to blame how old be you what do you mean how old be I People really do not talk like that anymore really your logic have have some flaw Sophie you be not responsible for what your parent do you could not be be you a gymnast before before you meet Cy I do not remember a time before I meet Cy I 've know he since I be so little besides my father they be the only people who ever believe in I Cy discover I gymnastically I be dance around on a log in the backyard to entertain Dana you know do spin and thing he put I on a beam the next day their house be like my house I have a key before my father leave when he and my mom be fight all the time I sleep over I have these really bad attack back then my stomach would start to shake and then my whole body would start to shake sometimes I would start throw up and I could not make it stop they take I to the emergency room one night we never tell my parent why not I ruin their family I do I really do Darlene be so good to I I be she really be good to I she tell I before she leave for Wisconsin that she be only go because she know I would be there to take care of Dana she say she do not trust Cy but she trust I she trust I and I ruin it you be think he use I you be wrong he keep try to stop I he keep say Sophie you do not know what you be do we will get to a place and there will be no turn back he be a really good person Cy be he be a gentleman he keep say you do not know what you be do but the thing be I do and what be you do Sophie at first I think it be my imagination and then he stop talk to I while Darlene be home you know like he be embarrassed like he be hide something and sometimes I would catch he hold his breath while he be look at I he love I I know he do so I know even before Darlene go away I know that he love I and then she leave for six month but Cy would not have sex with I even though everyone assume we be do it that we have be do it for month Cy say it be a line that we absolutely positively would not cross we have be sleep in the same bed just sleep and then one night the night before Darlene come home I wake up in the middle of the night and he be awake then he I it happen it feel like nothing at all like nothing not good not bad kind of like kind of like I be watch it happen on a really small black and white television like I be check my e mail at the same time like I be not really there I do not know the next day we pretend like it have not happen then at practice that afternoon we have this big fight in front of everyone because of what happen because I fall off the beam I would be go for this back bend and for some reason I think the beam be long than it really be so I bend right off of it I fall flat on my back I just stay there try to breathe Afraid to move Afraid that I would break something then Cy come over and start scream at I we 've get two day until this tournament and you 've lose your focus now get back up there and do it right that night I sleep on the couch then in the middle of the night Cy come in and I think that but he want I to put Dana back to bed she would have a bad dream and come into his room look for I so I put she back to bed and then we talk he keep talk about my potential he say it would ruin both of our career if this get out he say we have to stop that be it we almost have sex again that night but he do not want to that be it a few week later Darlene say she want to talk to I she say that Dana have become too attached to I while she be in Wisconsin and I probably should not come over for awhile but it be pathetic because I know she you know she be lie to I I could not look at her I just say I be sorry she say do not be silly kid forget quickly grownup do not but kid do Dana will forget you Dana will never forget you Sophie you do not think so no I be sure of it Darlene be terribly wrong grownup can forget child can not when I leave darlene give I a present that she get for I in Wisconsin what be it an apron with cow on it she know I like to cook and I collect thing with cow on they so it be sort of Perfect the accident it happen that night I wake up in the ambulance do you remember how you get there I do not even remember walk away from the house I remember she give I the apron I do not want it I try to give it back but she say take it so you do not get dirty and then I think she kiss I it must 've be at their door because now I remember step back and see the whole house what do you see nothing I see thhouse from the outside that be all I will huff and I will puff and I will blow your

I do not wanna fuck everything up here too no do not worry about it if you have to write the evaluation now but I do not have to write the evaluation now Sophie if someone hold a gun to your head no one be hold a gun to my head be you hold the gun I wanna know waht you think what do you think do you think that you do this to yourself I do not remember how many time do I have to tell you what do your instinct tell you I do not have any instinct what do your heart tell you I do not have a heart you know from what you 've tell I already I think that you be have quite a difficult time take care of yourself recently so so it do not mean that you deliberately run into that car so what would you write I do not know something along the line of as a result of the anxiety she feel precede the incident the subject may have be distract act irresponsibly but we can not conclude that the accident be a premeditate willful act that sound really vague I can not be any more specific than that I be not a magician I do not know anything more than what you 've tell I I fucking hate you you never say what you really mean you know you be just like all the rest of they why can not anyone ever tell anyone else the truth I can not listen to any more of your stupid bullshit word a willful and irresponsible act just say it she try to kill herself or not if you think I do then say so what be the problem there be a difference between not be careful because you feel vulnerable and want to commit suicide no you do not see the difference no it be just like the picture frame I do not mean to break it I do not even see it but it be break I break it in term of the evaluation there be a really big difference that be what I be try to get you to understand what Sophie the problem that you have before the accident they be still there even when they take off the neckbrace and take off the cast those problem be still go to be there when you go back to your normal everyday routine you be go to have to face they again 'cause if we be not careful something like this could happen again that be what you be really ask I be not it if you go back to your life will you find yourself in front of a car again someday soon you make I sound like a time bomb it be true I ruin everything no you do not yes I do you say I want to go home because there be nothing more for I to ruin there it be obvious

of the pan and into the fire I run away from one ultimatum and there be this guy with a hard on give I another suddenly I feel like do it I never have sex in a bathroom before I mean what I should go and Marry Andrew without ever know what a good bathroom fuck 's all about it be part of a young lady 's education be not it so you want to do I but not to get back at Andrew just for yourself that be right a girl be force into marriage what be she suppose to do die ignorant so this guy follow I into the stall and suddenly I be horny be hear about this disgusting to you no it be not disgusting go on he unzip pull down his pant and he stand there with his huge God I feel like I be 16 touch it for the very first time I be really surprised at how warm it feel I mean do not I know that already and then he turn I around to face the door and he pull down my stocking he lift up my skirt put his hand into his back pocket and pull out a condom I realize this guy 's very good at this he do this a lot he be a real pro and then this guy enter the stall next to we and start pee in gush full volume like a racehorse I think of Andrew how he pee in the morning make the same sound my heart ache I just it be so stupid you know I just feel so sad all of a sudden and he be behind I and he be rub up against I and he be feel I up I think to myself it be go to happen any moment and I just I just could not do it I simply close my leg shut I could not do it I could not do it to Andrew I just could not do it seem like quite a night out yeah that be not the end of it because this idiot I tell he I be really sorry but I have a boyfriend I can not do this and he laugh in my face and say boohoo and he grab my hand and he say listen cupcake you think you can leave I high and dry like this pointing at his dick the least you can do be make it up to I I say to he what do you want you want some money he say give I a hand job and there will be no hard feeling and I say to he what be the matter with you be you crazy and it be just get really strange I mean it be tense his tone change and then I think of you what you would say about it I think about we go through this in therapy and what do you imagine we say I imagine you not be able to understand it that you would be disgust be that why you run over here to find out if I would be disgust I do not run I give he the hand job excuse I be you okay yeah yeah I be fine thank you we talk about what happen at the club last night but we never get back to actually talk about Andrew and that argument yesterday I do not wanna be put in this position I do not wanna have this power to decide our future for both of we I just do not do you have any idea why Andrew choose this particular time what do you mean do you think that Andrew just out of the blue as you say yourself come up with this idea of an ultimatum do you notice anything over the last couple of day or week that you think might have bring this on nothing I do not know he just lose it I mean shit do not you know that man be the new woman obsess with wedding and child and lately he be lose touch with reality Hehe think I be see someone that be how this whole thing start it be unbelievable but I think you say it come out of nowhere you be watch tv then suddenly well we be watch tv but before that we be have dinner and he have this look on his face he have this sad look and I could just tell something be up I mean you can just tell huh and I say to he what be go on and he say I do not know what I want I just know I do not want this on and off thing so I say to he Sure then let us just decide either we get married or wsplit so you be the one who come up with it with what the ultimatum no he be the one he have the problem with the on and off thing not I on and off can mean several thing you be the one who make it specific get marry or to split up that be your ultimatum no he have this thing with the on and the ultim yeah okay I be the first one to say it you be right but he jump all over it I say I do not know what I want and he say you have a day or two max to decide what you want and I say fine and then he start cry and blah blah blah the whole thing be really scary to he I think what about you be not you scared of what of split up I be not suggest that we split up that be not the point so what do you think be the point of this argument that you may have initiate I do not initiate anything you may not have mean to but you do it sound like you want to bring this relationship into crisis I know you say that Andrew hate uncertainty but perhaps you be the one who can not live with they I mean why do you choose this particular time to bring thing to a head I do no such thing why now because he be right Andrew 's right I be be unfaithful to he you mean what happen last night at the club not just last night I 've be unfaithful to he for a long time why have not we talk about this before I think we have it be be here all along you mean to say you 've never notice it you be surprised no I be not surprised I just I do not follow what you mean this be not the reaction I be hope for not at all what be the reaction that you be hope for I have two scenario in my head in the first one you stand up and you hug I and you say I love you I love you too Laura I 've be feel this way for a long time I just want you to be the first one to say it and then we make love and the the second scenario it be like the first one but but without the sex we just sit he together you know I be embarrassed to even talk about it I mean you be sit there like a fucking buddha act like you have no idea what I be talk about it be humiliating how long have you feel like this a year from the first session I think it would go away I think it be just an infatuation that be all but it be get bad you 've become the center of my life Laura I be your therapist the parameter and the limitation be establish and ethically define I be not an option you may be use I as a as an excuse to bail from your relationship with with Andrew you know why I do not fuck that guy not because of Andrew not because I do not wanna cheat on he I do want to cheat on he but with you when I be sit there at the bar by myself I be think what would happen if you be to walk in you would walk in you would sit next to I at the bar you would order a drink I would even I even try to imagine what you would order a shot of bourbon maybe something expensive something fancy then we would start talk what a coincidence it be to meet like this how awkward it be to meet outside the office and then without word because we we talk enough when we be here you motion for I to follow you to the bathroom and I do when I go into the stall with that guy I imagine it be you behind I that be what make it so exciting then that guy start pee and it wake I up and I realize that it be impossible I know it I understand it I tell myself that every time I walk out of here I know it I understand it but I be not sure that my body understand it I know it can never happen I know it so do not worry I be not go to start show up here I be not go to start stalk you like Glenn Close in that movie I be not go to boil your kid ' rabbit I be not dangerous at least not to you God how can I go back to my life to the hospital to Andrew not to Andrew when the only thing that matter to I be you our time be up yes it be I feel like I come here in the dark and I be leave into a big darkness what be I go to do now we will talk about it next week okay I will call you a taxi no I be fine be you sure how be you go to get home Alex Paul so be there any rule Rules Ground rule anything I should know before we start not really it be more or less up to you oh right right I be a customer Thought in my profession we say that the customer be always wrong that be a that be a therapist joke Transcript FRM Team www 1000fr com Team in Treatment Sync Benj so do you recognize I I be sorry should should I well I be tell you be the good a man in tune with everything around he so yeah I guess you should thank you but I do think that in this profession the the good be really matter of personal opinion I do not know the good can be establish by fact and figure you be the good I do my research a couple former patient someone else who know you from graduate school do that pressure you be it important for you to know that I be the good yes it be nothing personal I always go to the good dentist mechanic you know what they say Save now pay later so what do you think be the good therapist entail do you recognize I no I I do not okay let I help you the madrasa murderer do that mean anything to you be not that long ago a US Navy aircraft hit a target on the outskirt of Bagdad Naval intelligence identify the structure as an insurgent safehouse a bunker turn out it be a madrasa let I tell you what that be it be an islamic religion school boy like bee in a beehive study the Koran Sixteen of they dead ring a bell yes I remember that yes so that be I I fly that mission the madrasa murderer so do your surf the net well somehow well it be not really somehow let us call a spade a spade a leak probably another intelligence fuckup anyway I I be identify as the pilot in that mission and my photo be place on fundamentalist website and I be not talk Al Jazeera I be talk website that ask for my head on a platter offer up the heaven and 40 virgin to anyone who will slit my throat from ear to ear here here I be now it be not a recent photo it be a photo take when I be 18 on a high school trip to Europe Holland that city with the miniature Ultre Utrecht Utrecht go ahead so while I be sit here talk to you a million fanatic be download my portrait and print it out as a dartboard silly motherfucker so why have you come to see I wow we will get to that now so you be probably think what be it like he fly his mission and he fly back and he see the body of those child on CNN you be probably try to figure out what go through his head let I tell you after that kind of mission I do not watch CNN I go to sleep I be dead tired you be probably die to ask how I can sleep night how do you sleep I sleep well thank you very much know it be mission accomplish with great precision let I tell you see I follow my order which be hit my target and hit it on time Time and target do you know we have to hit our target within two second of the estimate time it be surgical that be one small window and I have never miss it if I have if I have fail that task I would be in trouble with my superior with my conscience and with the system but I hit my target so I sleep like a baby how many child die in this mission the medium put it at sixteen and the air force the Navy doctor listen the Nany say nothing and why should it it be not the business of body count it be about hit our target we do not look back over our shoulder belive I we be out there do thing so you can sit here in peace talk to people for a living so when do you hear the child have be kill the following afternoon I hear it on the internet and what exactly do you hear anything specifically that you remember like what it be not like there be time in the day to be surf the net this be a moment I get away there be a lot of stuff to keep I busy what king of stuff Mission review aerial photo video just data stuff Preparation versus execution every tiny technical aspect of our flight be record and analyze by the man there be nowhere to hide and that be the way it should be it be just stuff and more stuff it be it be like when my mother die my father have a year 's worth of stuff to deal with last will and testament her office garden a lifetime of photo album and every time I would talk to he I would ask how he be expect you know that he would break down finally it never end Alex it never end your mother leave such a mess ' she do not know she be go to die and that be all he would say after less than a year he meet another woman and got marry just like that so how do that make you feel I be surprised a whole life together and not a single tear it be interesting that you compare the death of your mother with this mission that you 've just fly that be very clever of you but there be no relation whatsoever my mother 's death be the most traumatic event in my life so far that mission be just another mission for Alex there be no comparison anyway look that be over and I be back now I be back at my home base and now I be on r r what kind of thing do you do for r R do not try to get ahead of I I be a runner I be a hell of a runner in high school and I be still a pretty good one for an old man so I run with my fairy friend this gay guy who could kick your ass at any sport and do he have a name this friend Daniel Daniel we 've be run together for a long time between six and 10 mile depend on whether one of we be on his period only this time I chalenge he a little there be no real good run in the middle east not for the US military unless you want a roadside bomb to blow your ball off so I want to do some serious running I say let us go for 15 then after 15 mile I say 20 now he do not want it but I say okay I will go on my own so he follow I say you know only six more and it be a marathon let us do it he want to stop little bitch but I be not go to stop it be tough we be out of water we be on fume at 22 mile I have a heart attack and die a textbook case straight outta med school Enlargement of the left ventricle in accordance with the family history on both side fatal accord to the ekg and accord to statistic I have a 97 3 chance of die or 2 7 chance of live anyway dead you actually die in the clinical sense no pulse no brain activity total clinical death but here I be and now I be go to disappoint you doctor do not you wanna know why I be go to disappoint you let I help you out the light the tunnel the whole life flash before my eye that be what you be interested in right no I be not actually think of that at all but I be interested please tell I I could not give a shit about it either but that be all everyone want to know about my father my wife everyone they just want to hear about the goddamn tunnel just such bullshit do you feel that maybe you disappoint people by not have that experience that maybe in some way you fail to deliver the good nobody really know what be go through my mind during those last few moment soon as there be no more tunnel no one be interested and what be go through your mind oh I know what be happen you can tell and you be afraid it be the end in all that time until I lose consciousness all that time I do not know how long it be maybe second maybe half a minute all that time I keep try to figure out if I have a hard on see I do not know how I remember this something my grandmother tell I when I be in high school and she say when grandpa die she find he lie naked in the bathtub with a huge erection now he be 92 year old she have not see an erection like that in 20 year she like it she say that be god 's final gift to a man a dead man 's boner they call it angel lust anyway so I be lie there and I be think about that story I know what be happen to I and I say to myself God almighty just do not let I have an erection right now not a hard o because if you have an erection it would mean that that would mean that I be dead and your friend daniel be with you throughout this yeah resuscitation CPR Daniel 's a doctor I forgot to say that for a minute I think you be go to say something else that perhaps your fear of an erection be associate with the presence of your friend Daniel excuse I do not you think you be exaggerate I explain something simple a dead man 's erection what be that get to do with daniel maybe I do not make myself clear early on when I be talk about the customer always be wrong what I mean be that sometimes the patient hide thing from his therapist from himself and so part of our job be to uncover the thing that we hide so my secret be I be afraid of homosexual no not necessarily but I just wand to clarify that okay that be neither here nor there I wanna get to my point go ahead I do not have the erection so you can relax but I tell you I remember very vividly that moment just before pass out before lose consciousness lose consciousns that be a funny expression why do you think that be a funny expression lose consciousness it be an expression my father would use everything in term of profit and loss fit he like a glove so something about how you describe your last moment be equate with your father see thing in term of profit and loss be that okay with all due respect I think we 've come to this way too early all this stuff about the father son relationship I do not think it should come up so soon you think it be too soon no forget what I feel I know it be too soon I wanna know what you think so you be you be test I I be entitle to some testing I be pay for it actually I think you 've be test I since you walk through the door you 've ask about I and my reputation you ask well you practically demand that I ask you certain question that you think I be die to ask it be really important to you I think that I adhere to certain standard that you set before you walk through the door what be wrong with that look I do my research it be a one and a half hour drive to get here and I be pay you good money and I be expect to tell you a perfect stranger the most intimate thing about my life plus there be risk here it be not like the navy 's go to give I a medal for spill my gut in here I be not go to open up to you just like that without know what you be and what do you expect to find Alex how be we go to know that I be a good enough therapist for you I will know accord to your opinion my opinion of what of the issue I come here to talk about but I will come to that in a minute it have to do with what happen to I after take I out of the freezer the freezer oh you mean that you be ground no literally frozen they freeze I the mobile intensive care unit arrive and they put I in a suit that freeze you they 've get one out of presbyterian which be no more than 3 4 of a mile from where I collapse and their e r be top let us go back to this yeah we be get there you have no patience I be tell you be a good listener now look it work on a very simple principle it reduce the shock to the body 's system by drop the body temperature oh so how long be you in my case 48 hour it be a record there be no history of anyone who be

up an opinion and um when you come next week you can decide whether you want to use it or not just like that without any more question well what kind of question do you want I to ask I do not know shrink like question say about mom dad that kind of thing do not sound like you be interested why would you say that Sophie I be very interested in everything that you have to say I mean that you speak to my mother already do not you I do not speak to your mother you already know what it say in there I 've never speak to your mom you do talk to she and you be just let I sit here an you know exactly what be in that envelope be I be I suppose to talk to her what do you like plan everything like I be some kind of idiot you plan this little charade what be the point whatever of course she would send I to someone like you I should have listen to my father he call they a cult of crazy Shit open the door for I please and if I do speak to your mom I know it so what then it mean you be a liar okay because I know how it be suppose to work you be suppose to read what be write in that report and ask the stupid shrink question you ask do not it seem unprofessional to so not do it that way maybe I have something to say about what it say in there I just want to read the report by myself before our meeting next week that be all what meeting next week well I would like we to meet three or four time for I to form an opinion of you to get to know you a little do not you think otherwise it would not be professional I will read it now okay so be all these ship instead of sail for real at least you will not get seasick oh I do not know about that what do you mean sometimes I can get quite wobbly just sit right here you have to make a round window to the outside then you will feel like you be in a real ship do you really read all those book or be just to make an impression yes you read they or yes you be try to make an impression yes I read they I feel sorry for the book up there why do you feel sorry for they where would you put they I do not know they be your fucking book Buster you suffer from asthma yeah how do you know that there be an inhaler here oh thank I I 've be look everywhere for that thank you so what you could have die without it accord to what it say here it look like you could have die too yeah that would have solve a lot of problem what would it solve nothing I do not mean anything by it can I talk to you like a normal person do you drive your daughter crazy with question like this too much more crazy believe I how have you know I have a daughter because you do you know my mother you be on the pta committee at arlington elementary I be there before I go off to a private school I be in the same year as your daughter well why do not you tell I that before you say that the that the social worker speak to you like she know you she be such a retard do she ask you if um if you think about death a lot how do you know that accord to what it say here she be try to prove that the accident be your fault it be a good thing you do not answer any of her question by the way everybody think about death I bet she do not say that though do she ask you if you have any specific thought about death no do you do I what everyone everyone think about death and uh imagine how it will come to they do you have any more specific thought about it maybe you have certain thought that you would like to talk about unless you be worried about what I I be not worried okay be this how it be go to be for three appointment be this a little diffult for you no can I have some water Sure Hang on a minute sorry about this it be for my little patient the elf it be a bendy one you need help with that must be really hard to be uh to be handicap like a what be the hard thing about it everyone treat I like a baby do you come here by yourself today yes by bus your mom do not offer to drive you yeah right she know there be no chance I would say yes before when you get angry when uh when you think that she have call I I ask myself why do not she call it make sense that she would call I first I do not what do you mean well I be just try to figure out why you get so angry when you think she would call I I do not get it she do call no no no do she call or not tell I already she do not call so why be we back to this again because I get the feeling that when you get angry you want your mother to call just so that you could get angry with her you have no idea what I be look for you just do not get it okay so why do not you explain it to I then she think that what be write there be true what be true whatever it say suicidal tendency blah blah blah that be what your mother say be true she think that this accident be a wonderful opportunity to get rid of the sport thing that be what she call it but what do that have to do with this report she be afraid she do not believe that she think that because of all this competition and perfectionism she think that I want to kill myself and that be bullshit it be be like this for year I 've be under pressure for year and she have never support I all the other mother be right there all over we visit the gym the training camp all of it and the only thing she have to say be what do you need this for it be obvious she do not understand anything all this pressure it do not make any difference it be so silly why would I hurt myself now just before the national when I have all the and if I fail the lawsuit then I really have no chance what do you mean fail do you see this as a kind of test tell I why do you why be you make it sound like its what I do not come here for therapy I just need you to write your opinion and tell I that I be perfectly all right and tell they that I be not some crazy who fly into car every day be that why you come here today Sophie for I to tell you that you be all right that you be not crazy be that the test you be afraid of fail I have to go it be 10 2 already you probably have to turn on your cell phone now why be you be you worried that I will not be available no be you this much of a pain in the ass with your daughter much much bad believe I and yes I do try to understand my daughter if that be what you be ask that be not what I be ask let us say she want to talk to you now what will she do I do not think she will wait till 10 to so she can talk to you who do you call Sophie oh suddenly you do not feel comfortable talk about your daughter look she call I at 10 minute before the hour she leave a message and I get back to her but who do you call who do I call for what when you need to talk to someone 411 411 yeah because my father have move so many time in the past few year I can never remember his late phone number it be like a family joke we call

a different outfit this morning he notice I just buy it you just go and buy yourself a suit yeah I spill coffee over myself during the meeting what meeting be you go to sit or what there be traffic that be it 2 00 what Sarah say you leave the office at 2 00 that be right I tell you I have a meeting a meeting with whom what be with the interrogation with reeve what difference do it make who be Reeves Amy my boss so where be it this meeting at a cafe why be you waste our time here with Paul on this bullshit well you should 've think of that before you come in late be it usual for you to be late Amy sometimes I be fashionably late well you 've be late for all of our three session so far I apologize be your be late an indicator of not want to be here perhaps do not flatter yourself so you be usually late Amy and this be usually your reaction Jake be this his usual response yes he be suspicious do you think perhaps Amy have something to hide Jake be that why you be nervous early on I be not nervous maybe it be you who be nervous to be alone with I he be a bundle of nerve well perhaps if where have you get the outfit Paul 's talk where would you get the outfit I tell you I spill coffee on myself so I go and buy it which cafe do you go to do you see what I have to deal with here the bakery next to the office I have an espresso he have a mint tea I have an almond croissant he have toast there be no shopping in that area so so what you drive to a mall where to so what if I do all the way to a mall yeah how much do we owe you Paul what be the matter with you how much do we owe you why because we be waste our time that be why she go to finalize the abortion I do not finalize anything while we 've be sit here wait to talk about whether or not we should have an abortion she'meete with Kornreich to work out detail I do not work out any detail you be lie I buy a suit do you or do you not see Kornreich I do see he but I do not work out anything so what be you do there he tell both of we that he could not do anything till he run some test so he take some blood from I and you call I suspicious do you see why I hide thing from you because you react like a madman it be not an abortion it be in case we decide to have an abortion do Kornreich ask what I think about all this or be your opinion and his enough oh god here we go the man be be give I fertility treatment for five year can I talk to he if you be wear this outfit I be sure he be happy to talk to you do he look under it do he check you before take your blood you be such a shithead when she curse Paul you know she be lie I think Jake what Amy might be try to say be that she can not talk to you about this abortion because you suspect anything that she say I be the one at fault here I be the one at fault she arrange a meeting with her OB behind my back and I be the one at fault here tell I something be she pay you behind my back too oh right I bribe he so I can have an abortion and on the other hand Amy you may be responsible for Jake 's suspicion because you behave like somebody who be get something to hide because you lie because you will not allow I to have any doubt what do you mean by that well you can see it for yourself he will not even consider an abortion as an option and look at he do you hear how he talk to I well perhaps his uh his aggressive attitude reflect his need to be more aware of what be happen to you to be part of your decision to understand your thought process maybe it be a it be an expression of his love for you love God curse I out 's all about love I do not curse and you be a liar I will go and see Dr Kornreich tomorrow and I will discuss it with he and I will make a decision Amy can you tell we what what the most important issue for you be we 've be through that here Paul I do not know if I want to be pregnant again she do not want to have the baby I do not know if I want another baby I be not sure I tell you I be tired be you capable of thinking of anything but yourself it be my pregnancy our pregnancy it be ours oh really that be right and the hemorrhoid be those your too and the nine month of morning sickness whose be those and the extra 50 lbs be those yours too have you speak to Dr Kornreich about terminate this pregnancy that you 've want for so long yes I do not think I will be able to love another baby I be angry at he already I feel like it be force itself into the middle of thing ever since I become pregnant I 've feel the hormone rage drive I insane and I know I will have postpartum because that be what happen last time I see it come and it paralyze I I will not be able to take care of this child I will not love he I do not know what I be capable of you know I scare myself I scare myself to death so be that convince enough you be insane why because I want to be able to make my own decision derange really well if that be the case and assume you be mentally healthy why be you in such a hurry to have another child with I maybe you could explain it to her Paul maybe you could explain that it be abnormal for a woman to make up such a crazy speech about be depress I want to get you and Kornreich and everybody off my back so I can make my own decision and you know what if play the part of the depressed wife will do it great there I be sorry I make all that up really what do you make it up I tell you she be a bear liar I lie and I apologize what I will go kneel in the corner and pray for forgiveness be not it possible that something in this fake narrative of yours have more than a grain of truth those fear sound very real to I all of a sudden he be a therapist maybe I be hear what she be try to tell you Jake what be I try to say to he that you be terrify you be terrified of have this child can not you hear that she be exaggerate her fear so that you will hear she so that you will listen to her what do you mean he mean that it be abnormal for a woman who be spend five year in fertilization treatment to want to get rid of the baby because she be afraid of hemorrhoid it it seem to I that both of you have a wide range of emotion in respect to this pregnancy perhaps Jake you be not confront your fear about not want another baby and you Amy on the other hand if you be not so busy fend he off you might find within yourself argument for want another child why be it so hard for the two of you to understand that a woman may choose to put her career or her body or whatever ahead of have a child I think what I be try to say be that I do not think the issue be as clear cut as both of you want to admit Bullshit total bullshit you be talk to two people who spend five year in fertility treatment do you know what it be like five year for five year they 've inject I and hurt I and draw thing out of I and tell I when to eat and when to sleep and when to breathe and when to fuck do you know how many hand go in and out of my body during during the last five year for nothing and when we stop the treatment and not because I want to because the doctor tell we to the whole world include he comfort I and say oh you know maybe it be for the good and you know what they actually manage to convince I so here I be and it be a year later and I feel happy and I 've lose the weight and for the first time I can actually see myself as someone who someone who someone who would never have a baby with a shithead you be so primitive primitive back when she be cheat with I on her first husband Paul I be sexy but now I be primitive I still find you sexy not as sexy as Reeve right you be wrong believe I you know for a pathological liar you sure say believe I a lot I be a liar and deranged and egotistical anything else just admit that you do not want to have my child we already have a child remember yes I do he be at home have ding dong for dinner you know what it seem to I that you be not really talk about a child you be really talk about your inability to accept each other for who you be you know I do not understand what you be do excuse I but I just do not get it we come here a couple of week ago because we could not make a decision and as time go by you try to convince we that we be not indecisive but that we have problem you have not help we to decide whether to have the baby or not but you 've do a great job of get we to fight I think what be com we do not come here in order to bring thing out we come here to decide whether to keep the baby or not keep it that be all but it be not a yes or no answer tell I how do you sleep at night what do you think I should have problem sleep at night if we be talk about a separation here then you should lose some sleep but I be not talk about a separation why be we talk about a separation we come here to talk about a pregnancy and we end up talk about all these other thing Relationship yes relationship no I be sick of it yes to the pregnancy or no to have an abortion or not have it just fucking say it already to keep the child or do not keep it tell we what you think you want I to give you an answer right now I want a yes or a no I think you should have an abortion really go ahead have an abortion be that what you think do you see what be happen here do you see how you shove I into a corner do you see how I have to give you the answer that you do not want to hear this be exactly what you do with Amy I can not tell you whether or not to have an abortion yes you can you just do I do not have an answer you just give we an answer you say to get an abortion you could 've say many thing but you tell we to have an abortion right you do you have an opinion and you let it slip out you be murder our child stop leave he alone let us go you get what you come here for right there be nothing else to do here let us stop waste you know why I can not tell you whether or not you should have an abortion it have nothing to do with whether I be a psychotherapist or not whether I be allow or whether I be not allow this be a personal decision for you both it be a personal and moral decision that you must take yourselves all I can do be help you to confront your feeling so that you come to a correct decision for you both that be all I can do that be it Goodbye Amy hello you 've reach the office of Dr Gina Toll please leave I a message and I will get back to you as soon as I can Gina it be Paul Paul Weston I know

Doctor 's order do not get I start I can not eat anything that I like these day Cholesterol you know it be um it be kind of funny being here again well I be retire now so I turn this room into a study yeah so I see it be where I do my writing you be write but what I do not know maybe an article or something less formal maybe something long I do not know it be strange be here after David how be you cope with that it be probably the most difficult time of my life come back home without he he be a remarkable man yes he be how about you oh I well I be um I be work too hard I be try to lose this

come here yeah Gina I I call you last night because um I really feel that I need to talk to somebody it be um actually it be something that be be bother I a lot lately but only yesterday I really feel the need that I have to to talk about it I feel that I do not know how to put this but I feel like I be I be just lose my patience I be lose my patience with my patient there be session when I can barely restrain myself from have just from an outburst I want to just lock the door some day and wish everybody would just go away I have this I have this couple who 've be come to I for marriage counseling they have one child but they have be try for five year to have another baby so she get pregnant and now she want to have an abortion I think what she really want be to get rid of the husband if you ask I but anyway this guy really get on my nerve yesterday he corner I he badger I until I make a decision should we have an abortion should we not have an abortion I finally say yes good have an abortion as soon as I say it of course I regret it because I know that I have speak in anger but I I could not help it this guy he just he say some really nasty thing to I he call I a murderer I know he be right the second it come out of my mouth of course he be right I be sit there tell he to kill his baby but still I be I know I be not make much sense but anyway and there be this girl who I 've be work with for a year there be an issue of erotic transference and this come out now everything be all about this issue and I be think to myself what if patient could see what I think about they if they could really see inside my head they would head for the hill believe I they would run for cover what about new patient be you take on new patient yes I be I think I take they on to prove to myself that everything be okay I 've take on this guy he be a bomber pilot Cocky arrogant kind of a guy Macho you know fly a mission over Iraq drop a bomb on a school where 16 child be kill so he come back he go on leave and then he run for 22 mile without stop and bring a heart attack on to himself so I be try to get this guy to see that maybe there be a connection between these two event but anyway all the time I listen you know as if it be nothing but inside I be just I just find it so so disgusting and there be a girl who go to Rosie 's school who you be treat a friend of your daughter 's no she be not a friend they be just in the same grade anyway this girl idolize her coach be you insult about what that the patient call you a murderer yes I be Gina I know I be a good therapist I do not know maybe this week I need somebody to just tell I to calm down tell I that everything be okay that everything be all right I remember you say once that one of our big problem be that we do not have an audience we do not have anybody to pat we on the back to approve of what we be do somebody that you can go to and say do you see how I maneuver that person into that situation do you see how I get he to say what I want he to what I mean be be that we have no one to criticize we no one to review we anyway I I be begin to feel anxious before session and I I must admit that I think something be go on at home when you call at home why because it be be almost 10 year since I last hear from you the last time you be here you be so angry you do not even come to the funeral I think how angry he must be he do not even come to David 's funeral and I be really sorry about that Gina I have I be go to come but I feel that it be I feel it be inappropriate then you call I out of the blue yes because I need somebody to talk to you be the one who choose to stop have a supervisor you say I interfere with your practice that instead of guide I be interfere yes I say that but then there be time when a supervisor have to take a stand in your case I feel I have to take a stand I have to interfere but that be not the way I feel now I mean that be ancient history why do we have to go there anyway whatever happen I always feel that you be somebody professionally I could I could at least talk to I I be already retire oh I forget yes you be write your memoire no no no no I think that be what you mean when you say that you be write why be you afraid I will write about you I think there be way too many autobiography anyway who care maybe somebody like Bob Dylan I would be curious about that but how many people like he be out there I be try to write a novel oh yeah wow that be I do not know we will see I 've give myself a year to write I do not know what else to say about it right now I do not know Kate and I we we just argue nonstop I think it be begin to affect my work what do you mean you argue well it be always about something insignificant something trivial that trigger it off this time it be about Max and be ask to go to these class for gifted child which I just be Max gift he be very very smart yeah well then what do you fight about she know how I feel about this I have say it over and over again I be against the idea of it what do she do behind my back she take Max to this to this class without tell I and you know they decide that who be they this principal and and Kate this girl she be barely out of college she barely know my son 's name pontificating tell I how I should raise my kid and Kate and I start to argue about about that and then that lead onto other stuff and then we end up and it be like oh you care so much about your patient if you care as much about your family as you care about your patient then it would Kate say that yes yes she say I do not love she that I be always try to be a step ahead of she that I handle she like a patient she say the thing that she hate the most be that I see it all from a distance what do you mean it her we it she say that when it come to we I will never have any perspective she be right be not she but I can not help but see it from a perspective and all I can see be all I can see be rupture what do you mean rupture be you try to shrink I Gina sorry and yet you be here for eight year yes what do that mean you be under my counseling eight year I take care of you you find that difficult to accept I be your audience for eight year maybe I should not have tell you all this stuff about about Kate maybe it be just because I be exhausted I be wipe out and I be just afraid that because of that something that will happen that I will lose control anyway we do not come here to talk about Kate though of course just before I come here we have a big fight on the phone you keep say you do not come here to talk about Kate but you keep talk about her that be because you make I talk about her I be not do anything it be be eight year and I be try to catch up Gina I be not stupid there be always a reason with you so do not do not tell I we be have a nice cozy conversation here about my married life what do you wanna do we could get together a couple of time and see how it go okay be this time good for you yeah it be fine may I say something before we go on what about Kate there be a sadness when you talk about she in your voice there be something very sad about it I do not know where she be most of the time she tell I that she be go to the gym and I I look in her closet and her gear be still there and I say to myself oh you know she be she be probably get another set of running shoe when I call her cell she never answer I let it go usually in the evening we be too tired and so a week later I will suddenly say where be you last Wednesday and she will look at I like I be I be crazy and then Sex Sex be out of the question once a month if I be lucky she hardly ever initiate it I can not remember the last time she want it what about you do you want to I think about it all the time what would you say if somebody come to you with a story like mine I do not know we be talk about you and Kate we be not speculate about a patient do you want I to say that she be have an affair because I do not know where she be because of her running shoe I always ask myself if they be to diagnose therapist whose marriage fall apart how many case of erotic transference would they find what do that mean that sometimes erotic transference in therapy be a test of your married life if a therapist can not handle a situation where his patient fall in love with he it may indicate some breakdown in his private life yes but I do not think my marriage to Kate be fall apart yes I have a row with Laura I mean with Kate whose Laura Rosie 's friend the girl with the issue of of erotic transference you do not mention she by name you just say it have come up okay she tell I that she tell I that she be in love with I and that she want to sleep with I okay okay what be you say that Kate feel that and that be where our tension come from good material for your novel Gina Come on you know that therapist get divorce like everybody else please do not draw any conclusion because there be none to be draw besides my trouble at home do not begin last week or last month how would you say her therapy be go whose therapy you say talk about your session that you cut thing short you have no patience that you often feel guilty about your behavior be that true also with Linda Laura Sorry Laura look Gina you know that patient fall for their therapist every few second what well way be there to air this than to bring it to the surface and put it out there you know this room be suppose to be safe zone where we can open thing up and talk about thing in a control way just to make thing perfectly clear this be transference plain and simple of course you and Mitchell and your New York gang have idealize it Gina I do not come here to talk about a patient I think you do come here to talk about Laura instead you keep talk about Kate you mention to I offhand that there be an issue of erotic transference and instead of focus on that you go on to tell I about a couple a class for gifted child a new girl who go to school with your daughter so what be you try to prove here Paul that you will not talk about her about Laura that you can avoid talk about her you know what Gina I think this be a mistake come here today I think I would well leave why because you twist everything into your own preconceived notion be there physical contact no you hesitate before you answer because I be shocked at where this be go what do you think I do sleep with this girl and then come here to confess to you when do it happen when do what happen nothing happen I keep tell you nothing happen no no no no what do she say to you she say she be in love with I that be just last Monday this week yes yes what be it you want I to say Paul you know Ginie you be make it really difficult for I to come back here to ask you for help remind I all the time about how long it be be since I 've be here why I leave how I feel how you feel blah blah blah be I that big a disappointment to you because I do not stay your loyal intern forever and ever I be just try to understand what it be you be try to tell I I be try to understand what move you be try to make what move I be try to make what be you look for Legitimacy Legitimacy for what how old be this girl she be I do not know 30 29 I just wonder when you talk about feel guilty be it about your patient generally that you feel guilty or be it about one patient in particular oh give I a break Gina God I hope your novel do not sink this low what be bug you so much you be you it be unbelievable how much you be enjoy yourself erotic transference happen all the time it be simply a question of how one deal with it now I know how to deal with it can you honestly say to yourself that she fall in love with you be just a part of her healing process and that it have nothing to do with you maybe you be a little worried because of your family history that it could go too far Gina timing dosage tact you be fail in all three I be not my father my father be a doctor he leave the house of one of his patient we be talk about a girl who have a crush on her therapist it be a completely different thing and you know damn well it be you should get counseling regard this Linda Laura Sorry Laura Let us not call it counsel let us call it talk Laura Laura be her name God you be so catch up in your little theory that you do not even remember her name why do not you ask her ask who Kate what if she be see somebody that would make you happy I bet I think you should ask she instead of drive yourself crazy I be not drive myself crazy be you afraid to find out it be true yes I be but you be convinced it be not correct why do these question make you so angry I will tell you why because you be not be helpful helpful now I be totally confused I mean do you come here to ask for my guidance or to talk to I as a friend be you seek advice from a colleague what role have you assign I I be try to figure it out but I be fail listen Paul it be not easy for I either see you after all this time you walk through that door after everything that happen as though it be nothing it be confuse I could not think of anybody else to talk to you know what bother I when I walk through the door I feel that you look at I with glee and you think oh here he come again Paul the failure and I think she be be sit here like a sleepy old spider just wait wait for something like this to happen look at you you 've wake up you be full of life if that be the way you feel maybe we should not meet yeah maybe it be not such a good idea after all you should get professional help regard this Laura I do not need it I think you do in any case if you feel like talk call I I would not be wait on the end of a telephone if I be you why do these question make you so angry I be not angry I be really not why be you run away I be not run away Gina give my good to Kate I will talk to she about it it will make thing easy for you good night Gina previously

why do you need Kate to go to the gym with you I do not need she to can I ask you something how do you get along with the girl at the at the gym they be asshole okay all of they the whole place it reek of hypocrisy do you know like every girl there be a Mia or an Anna except I they know it they just do not do anything about it they encourage it these girl Anna and Mia be they friend of yours you do not know these girl they be fun girl especially Anna Rexic Anorexic okay and Mia bulimia you be sharp as a tack thank you so the girl at the gym be anorexic or bulimic except for you you can not keep your weight down otherwise and if you be not skinny you can not compete so so you have no choice you have to but who say you can not compete Cy and Regina Regina be our physical trainer all the girl follow Cy around like little groupie slut Cy be that okay Cy can you show I how to do that move Cy I be about to fall Quick put your hand between my leg but not Regina 'cause she be russian so her bullshit detector be like nuclear and at the end of the day Cy and Regina decide everhe who compete who be gain weight and can not compete after my accident Karen Scott and Audrey England come to visit I they have these pathetic look on their face like like they feel my pain but I know they be happy I would have be happy if something have happen to one of they right before the olympic tryout honestly if it be I I would have do what Shirley do she do not even come I and her we be like the good one there by far it be like she be say drop dead for all I care just get out of my face at least that be honest so they be leave tomorrow for training camp in California and I have nowhere to go they will not let I stay at the apartment by myself they promise Cy I could go even though I can not train and now he say they 've change their mind who be they the sponsor the money people anyway I pick a fight with he that be what you hear on the phone it be not his fault why be it so important for you to go with they to the camp everyone will be there you mean Karen Audrey and Shirley but but you say you can not stand they you say you do not even like they and you can not train anyway so I do not understand why it be so important to you it be not important but I be look forward to it sound like um you and Cy be uh you be very close no why can you tell that over the phone you say he want to take you to camp despite the fact that you have an injury and do not he do not he drive you here it be on his way he want I to come to the camp to at least watch the training so I do not lose focus but no he could not make they pay for Darlene either Darlene Cy 's wife she have to pay her own way and Dana 's too Dana be the little girl you use to babysit why do you stop who tell you I stop do I tell you that last week you have good memory for an old fart thank you so why do you stop they do not need I anymore Dana use to have all these breathing problem but then she have this surgery and they get well and and darlene come back from Wisconsin where she be like learn to process her own cheese or something so so they do not need I do you work there for a long time no sort of and Dana must have become very fond of you do she become attached to you yeah she be the cut she have not stop talk about I since I leave she say she do not want to go to California if I be not go to be there they tell she that I would not be able to babysit she anymore 'cause I would have this accident but see I have already tell she before that I could not keep live with they once her mom come home I waed to prepare she you know but they do not tell I what they be tell she so the whole lie become mixed up in her head what what you look scared all of a sudden I look scared like you be look at a psycho or something I be just remember that the last time you be here you put your your cast together do you you remember and you say this be Cy yeah the mermaid that he draw you say that when Darlene come home you know you could not keep on live there I never say I live there but you tell dana you would not be able to go on live there yeah because she be a child but so it feel to she like I live there it be just 'cause she would go to school and come back and I would be there and you know she got use to I be around so even when he be home she would nt I to stay cook they dinner do her homework with her sometimes she would wake up scream because she stop breathe in her sleep Cy tell I that what the hell be go on here what do you mean what the hell be go on here my dad be right I will go to therapy and I will end up a psycho just like your daughter everyone think she be a freak be you try to hurt I Sophie no but you should know what people say about her she have this thing with this guy and afterwards everyone say she would turn out psycho 'cause her dad be a shrink shrink ' kid be psycho everyone know that well maybe that be because because some people be afraid of therapy they be afraid of what they might find out they be afraid that it might touch those wound that be deep inside they I think there be thing that perhaps you feel deep inside Sophie that you would like to talk about I be fine you wanna worry about a little girl Worry about your own kid do it bother you that people talk about my daughter why would it bother I because maybe you know what it feel like maybe I do not we be talk about your coach and then suddenly you bring up the story of my daughter yeah because I think you should know be there people who say thing about you Sophie at the gym maybe you know Sophie sometimes when people be jealous they say thing to hurt we because they envy we do you think that some of the girl at the gym might be jealous of you and how close your relationship be with Cy do not talk to I like I be a child please Fair enough Sophie I get the feeling that you be afraid to tell I something that other people say about you be my clothe dry yet can you go check if I will not be get an evaluation today I would at least like dry clothe okay well I have start to write it can I see what you 've get I be uh I be not quite finished yet I will bet you have not write a word Sophie 's evaluation 16 year old a gymnast she be an olympic hopeful she come in for evaluation after a near fatal accident during first session appear to be very impressive sensitive Mature for her age very intelligent and a highly independent personality I try to write it with my mom but we do not fight I just say never mind do you really think those thing you write absolutely they be just generality at the moment it be not enough for a real evaluation you know this morning I try to brush my tooth like you like I like how have it go I could not do it I just stick it in there why would you try that 'cause I want to know how it feel how do it feel I feel useless like demean or something I be homeless I have nowhere to go what about your dad I tell you I have a fight with he not a real fight but he piss I off he know how much I want to go to that training camp with they and he do not even offer to pay I would not have take his money anyway obviously the exhibition be expensive but why be it so important for you to go to this camp Sophie it be not important anymore how do you get along with Cy 's wife Fine I do not wanna talk about t em okay when you be ready we will you know when you walk in here I think to myself somebody in your life have break the rule and I feel that that if I have help you change your clothe that I would have be do the same thing I feel like you be test I I feel like you want to make sure that this be a safe place that the same thing that happen out there do not happen in here right when the accident happen I do not remember anything but but right afterwards I remember the whole world be silent not just silent soundless you know like there have never be any noise ever not even that hum that you hear when you be

Sync Gaillots michvanilly www sub way fr Jake and Amy Week two 1x09 I do not keep the appointment with Dr Kornreich I decide to wait I mean you say last time that I decide without think it over so now I be think it over and when we leave here last time Jake do not say a word about it even later we do not talk about it and that night we go to bed for the first time in a long without fight we be watch tv and I say I do not think this pregnancy 's worth fight over and I say I think I might want this baby then I say think about it some more because I pity a child bear to a mother who do not want he and I say I just say I think I might want this baby and that be it and we laugh and I wake up the next morning it be late actually he would leave for work already and take Lenny to school and I just decide to take the day off I be just lie in bed think and I be enjoy myself enjoy my thought I think about give birth and for the first time I wonder whether it be a boy or a girl and I just somehow know that it be a girl and I could imagine Lenny push some kid who try to take her bike it be sweet violence turn she on and then I get dress and the waistband in my pant be a little tight which I do not love but I do not get upset about it so you have not see Dr Kornreich since and I assume you 've discuss this well not really Jake ask what happen at the doctor 's I say I do not go and

gymnast you talk about 10 thing at once no she be in the same grade as Rosie Let us focus on Kate what be I suppose to do Gina I mean what what be I suppose to do now do she say what she think will happen now between the two of you I do not know she say it be she say it be up to I what do you think that mean you tell I she be bang some insurance salesman and it be up to I she give I all the detail she blow he she screw he it be like a porno film she tell you that absolutely why you know my conception maybe I should say my misconception of Kate be that everything everything about sex be always connect to intimacy for her there be never anything weird or dirty about sex it be always about intimacy now I feel if someone throw the word intimacy at I I want to punch she in the mouth punch her in the mouth what you say punch her you know all that bullshit that I think mean intimacy to her the candle the backrub feel safe meanwhile she be in her own porno film fuck this this guy I be try to figure out why she would tell you graphic detail because she want to hurt I do you ask for detail I just want to I want to get a grasp of the situation you know she make sure you would not ignore what she be say I think you know what be go on last week when we speak I think you know I be sure Kate sense that as well your suspicion maybe I be wrong I know I do know you would think that would make it easy you know almost throw she out of the house it be like you hurt I I be go to hurt you now just get the fuck out of here I mean there be a thousand way that people can deal with these thing we could have go to therapy for example I mean not everybody have to fuck around what be that Coldex Night they be suppose to be strong than Coldex Day I 've have two of they already they kind of make you a bit stone do you want some tea Water would be good thank sure I have a session yesterday with that thank with that couple who call I a who call I a murderer in the middle of the session she run to the bathroom and she start to bleed what happen miscarriage my God it be pretty scary how be she I think she be fine I just speak to she at the hospital they be run some test but she seem to be okay at least I be not a murderer though I would not be surprised if the husband blame I for everything you know stress as a result of therapy it be possible ironically they would both just kind of work out their problem they be not argue which for they be a major accomplishment and he say to I this be our last session and then then it happen anyway I be try to get the blood out of the couch 'cause when she get up she leave a stain and Kate walk into the room and she look around and she say what go on in this office anyway quite a week quite a week ultimatum from two woman Kate and Laura Laura she tell you she be in love with you what be what be we go back to that for I be talk about something completely different you do not think it be relevant you describe two woman attack you two woman what about three woman do it feel like I be attack maybe that be why you be take pill to protect yourself against I I have a cold see last week you call I a sleepy spider in wait be you be you insult by that I take it back you be not sleepy would you agree that your relationship with Kate have be a wall between you and your patient so that you be safe you be not attract to they Attraction 's it be not a problem Freud Messer davy all the big guy they all talk about how attraction be inevitable it be part of therapy but if you brush it under the rug the message you be give to the patient be that their feeling be perverse be dangerous their feeling I be talk about your feeling I be not worried that Laura will try and break down the wall on her own I be worried that you want she to the wall what be this metaphor my wife be a wall you do not agree I be not hide from my patient that essay that Bolas write about forget about Bolas every time we go deeply you reach for some theory these male therapist torment by lust for their patient right I mention Laura and that be who you start quote but why be we even talk about Laura because I want you to hear what you be say that you be surround by woman who demand that you respond and love and be angry and feel that you face your feeling do I mention that Laura be be getting marry in June so Laura be over that be finish if anyone want to pull down a wall it be Kate why Secrecy she she hate it she hate that I can not share it you mean work she resent my office it be like enemy territory to her she be always try to make it her space a piece of it like let us get a new sofa or new blind or a rug or something do you let she no I do not why not because I agree with her it be not her space there be a time when I use to talk about my patient when Ian be a kid I would share share detail with Kate you do not mean Ian both of they at the dinner table I see that look of horror on your face no I be pretty discreet actually I never mention any name if someone mention rat I would say I have a patient with a fear of rat dream about rat every night you know stuff like that you do not do that now no but I remember when Ian be about 10 he ask I Dad what be an alcoholic and I tell he about this patient of mine who need a drink actually to get out of bed in the morning one day this man come up to the office and he be kind of staggering and Ian say Dad be that the alcoholic you be careless this situation now I think there be more at stake do you agree because we be talk about a woman sexual attraction can I ask you a question you be in the middle of a session and a patient need to use the bathroom and your bathroom be block up would you let they use the bathroom in your house do that happen Laura say that she have to pee and I tell she well the toilet 's block up so she head for the door of the house and I freak out I jump up and I stop she I be keep your metaphor go here I hope you appreciate that about the she try to scale the wall there be always a patient who want to know about you More about your private self anyway what do you do I jump up I panic what make you panic she be do it on purpose I feel I think why can not she hold it for another 10 minute why do I panic I do not know really have that ever happen with another patient Sophie the gymnast she come in last week and it have be rain and she be completely soak so I let she change into my daughter 's clothe that do not make you uncomfortable it be a lot more intimate than use the bathroom Rosie 's clothe she have cast on both her arm from the accident and she hold up her hand like this and she say undress I so I get Kate to come in and help she how old do you say she be 16 she be the girl who be sleep with her adult coach she might be sleep with her coach it be a loaded situation her ask you to undress her she be mess with I you have no problem handle that you have Kate help she undress her give she your daughter 's clothe but when Laura need to use the bathroom you freak out why be that Laura be a woman Sophie 's just a she be just a child should not that make it easy you know there be there be a part of I that really want Laura to go through the door to see where I live maybe to to see Kate you want that be that what scare you do you discuss what Laura tell you last week she say that the reason that she be go to marry this guy this boyfriend Andrew be because I tell she I be not interested I know what you be think but I make it really clear I say nothing be go to happen between we Good I be I be just I be not go to play along this be not go to happen in your mind be there any possibility that the affair could become a reality no in your mind look I have to admit sometimes it be it be flatter I can not help but enjoy the feeling but I tell she no I say this can not happen you can not go through that door there be limit be that what upset you that she be test you it be not that abstract she be a beautiful woman she say she want to have sex with I I know what be in her head so I do not want she go through the door and maybe bump into Kate but you say you do want that some part of you want that the point I be make be that I want Laura to understand that we can survive this that any attraction that come up between we I can handle I be not go to let this derail the therapy her want to sleep with you how do she put it exactly that she know that I want she she say that she want to to fuck I and that she know that I want to fuck she too that be a lot to stave off that kind of intensity she can be very direct Laura maybe that be why I panic here be what I think Paul and you can accept this or tell I I be interfere again but give the situation with Kate I think we we might explore the option of transfer Laura to another therapist what just hear I out on this because Laura think she want to sleep with I last week you think we be already have sex I think you have an affair and you be try to justify it thank Gina I be wrong I be sorry I jump to conclusion you 've reassure I but now this situation with Kate how emotional you be and the pressure you be under listen to yourself you be injure you be vulnerable you be angry this be not I be stubborn Paul I think we should just discuss the possibility that Laura 's well off with a different therapist a female therapist you mean yeah preferably you for instance no I be retire remember this be so typical of you you always begin by say I hate to say this but but and you lay some pronouncement on I that you 've already be think about before you 've come into the session this be not a debate club you know it be not like we take a position and we hunt for way to support it that be not what I be do I be listen you have Kate on one side and you have Laura on the other but they be two totally different situation Gina be you say that I push Kate into this situation that I create this environment at home so that Kate could go fuck an insurance agent because really I be in love with Laura be not that your theory your note somewhere look at how you be react how be I react I be not send Laura to another therapist end of story I can handle whatever come up in the session that be why I be here because I want you to help I to handle it we just need to discuss this Paul I do not want to pawn she off on somebody else but what be good for Laura honestly if it be not for Kate cheat I would not be here Gina and we have not talk about your comment the last time I be pretty pissed off about that about what you make a crack about my father leave my mother for a patient what be that suppose to mean that I can not treat Laura because of what my father do year ago I be not my father for Christ 's sake no you be not your father I be suggest a pattern that might be threaten to you be you or be you not Gina say that because of my father that I be in danger of have an affair my gut you can not answer it can you no I can not if I remember correctly you be face with the same scenario yourself so maybe this really be not about my father maybe it be about you Gina do not forget I be the one who refer Charlie to you I remember he call I after one of your session and he confess to I that that he be in love with you no actually he go far he say that you be in love with each other maybe he be wrong I do not know either way you need to face that and you do not you just run off to England you know what I could not believe when that happen that be a wake up call for I watch you behave like that I do not run away come on a sabbatical with David at that moment by the way be that what your novel be about I figure you fail the same test yourself Gina but you abandon a patient he try to get hold of you over the year do not he a few letter I do not answer you do know that he die a few month ago prostate cancer it be right after David and I could not go to another funeral I just could not I could not face it it be funny you know I be talk about Charlie the other day to a patient of mine I be say that I I would be to his funeral and that I be I could not feel sadness and I be you know beat myself up about it the truth be I be I be so disillusioned with you Gina for keep you on as a supervisor after what you pull with Charlie I should have just walk out then you know that he never ever get over you since we be dig for the truth may I ask how you really feel about Laura I have not hear a clear answer not what you be go to do about she but how you feel do you mean be I attract to her be you Come on Gina if I transfer every patient I be attract to at some point I would not have any patient leave and it be not your place to say I should transfer a patient it be like I tell that couple they should have an abortion it be not what therapist do we do not tell people how to run their life I be suggest that we talk about stop Laura 's therapy and look at your reaction Paul do you really need another pill I know Tomorrow 's Saturday I can sleep all day Sunday I do not really care if they knock I out or not really what you be go through with Kate be so complicated previously on in treatment you really do not understand why I say yes to he it be because you say no to I perhaps I be an alternative to everything that Andrew represent Dependency anxiety but I be not a realistic option for you Laura just tell I I think you owe it to I do you want I no season 1 Episode 11 Week three Laura Synchro by ¤akazab¤ Kasius I be really sorry you would not believe what just happen to I I almost do not make it here at all God I 've get to calm down first can I get some water please sure what be you go to punish I for be late sorry I do not know how that get there it be yours yeah I thoughsomeone leave it here so what happen why be you 25 minute late right well I take a cab here we be fly down Madison right and about 200 foot away from I be this dog she he it try to cross the street you know it be impossible to cross that stretch of Madison impossible and of course he gets run over well not run over hit the car in front of hit he so run into the middle of the street and then another car hit he it be awful the car be play ping pong with he it be like ping ping he do not and a chance the cab I be in almost hit he but the driver stop short but then the car on the left hit he really hard I think he be dead but he be not I look in the rear window and I see he limp across the street I yell at the driver to please stop but he could not because the traffic there would have cause a massive pileup but I could not not stop you know I mean if the dog be alive I have to get he to a vet I mean do not I you would 've pull over or maybe you would not have give a damn I do not think everybody would have pull over but you would 've pull over Paul I be sure you would have you would not have pull over I would not have pull over no I would 've assume the dog be dead and there be not anything I could really do for he Sure I would be sad just like you be but I would not have pull over I do not believe you well anyway I could not not stop okay so I yell at the driver to make a u turn so I could g to the other side of the street but shit there be no u turn and this idiot cabbie be try to persuade I that woundeanimal prefer to die alone just because he can not make a fucking u turn so I yell at he please can you stop I need to figure out what to do I need to do something and then I look at his dashboard and it be five to and it be you know another 25 minute to your office it be incredibly frustrating sound like it be Imagine stop for a dog that may die anyway and be very late but you would 've be late anyway what well you be still very far away and it be already five to Dog or no dog you 've would have be 25 minute late the fact be you be never late Laura I would have appreciate a call why be you like that like what I do not know Anti Anti Anti what anti I I come in feeling like shit for what I just witness and you be give I a really negative vibe I do not think I be be negative Laura I be just try to understand you that be all I think it be possible that your be late today be not entirely coincidental maybe you be try to tell I something what I pay the dog to get run over in front of my face I plant he no you be late already Laura I do not know what you want from I Paul you operate on a very tight schedule you be a busy woman you always call if there be go to be a problem if there be an emergency at the hospital or whatever you always call I you be never late in fact very often you be early and so so what do you think your be late be try to say to I nothing Paul I nothing maybe maybe you think that that I be not do my job 'cause if that be the case then we should talk about that about what Laura I know you be upset about witness look at you Paul listen to you you be scheme I know you you be up to something what be I up to it seem to I that the last few session that we 've have have be quite difficult for you the last few month Paul very very difficult and wonderful be you angry with I because if you be then that be something we really need to talk about maybe we need to talk about what good this therapy be do you or not do maybe you 've have enough of it I be late and you be kick I out of therapy fucking hell use the belt it be a more humane punishment look I be not angry I have be I even think about not come here at all just as like a small protest when I leave here last week I phone for a cab and the line be busy I be just walk around in circle round and round around the block around the garden then I realize I be in shock Paul I feel like someone have punch I that be how you feel like I would punch you do I need to remind you what you say to I right here at the door at the end of the last session you know I have a feeling that if I have not mention it you never would have bring it up you would have hide behind that idiotic rule about therapist not initiate topic of conversation you be suppose to let the patient lead right you would 've take advantage that rule so we would never talk about what happen again as if it do not exist what would you like to talk about today you act as if you do not know I Paul that be what piss I off the most you look at I as if remind I again what your name be on the contrary I think I be come from somewhere that I think you know very well that be exactly why I be dwell on this point what point your anger my anger over you be try to make I angry you be provoke I no I be suggest that you already be angry before you come in the door you be so angry that you be consider not come here at all and you express that anger by come late fuck I can not win here you be I be what I be go to tell you what conclusion I 've reach this week but you be not interested be you you would prefer to bait I to piss I off to prove but you know what the truth be I be the opposite of Angry Anti Angry Fuck you Paul when you say you do not want I my first instinct be to tell you who care I do not want this I will not come but then I realize that it be not your fault it be my fault you do not owe I anything you do not have to love I in return Laura I realize that I may have slam the door too loudly in your face maybe I be a little Cruel no I do not think I be cruel I be resolve see you demand an unequivocal answer and I give you one I do not apologize for give you that answer I be sorry that I hurt you okay so a I accept your apology and b I think your answer last time be not so unequivocal and c I think my excuse for come late be perfect the excuse may have be perfect but the timing be not coincidental I see why they laugh at shrink and all their bullshit what do you really mean what do that mean it be bullshit Annoying one would not it annoy you if your therapist force you to accept some ridiculous interpretation you could not defend yourself against it ecause you be the patient everything you say would be hold against you I should 've stay with that dog I should take the dog to the vet instead of come here here where you be not be adequately treat maybe what do you want from I you refuse to listen to I I do not think you be listen to yourself maybe you be identify with the dog that dog deserve more than be co opt as some idiotic interpretation you want to explore some cockamamie theory then make up something original Jesus make an effort you think I do not make an effort do you think I do not try hard enough in therapy be that what you think that I sit here like a parasite who feed off your story and your reality and your pain maybe I be not help you at all all of a sudden I miss Andrew for the first time I be sit here face you and I miss he it be so strange to miss Andrew Andrew who love I who admit it who shout it out in public what if I do that have you ever imagine that I 've stop fantasize I 've kick the habit it be hazardous to my health I be getting marry in a few month I need to conserve every last drop of energy for my wedding you be find it require energy that you do not have I think bride be suppose to be whirl dervish of activity just the word bride creep I out I tell Andrew to pick a caterer and location without I what difference do it make between the Hilton or the Hyatt no matter how hard you try to be different you end up look like everybody else even bad God I wish I could just get marry in Vegas no caterer no guest just an alcoholic justice of the peace and a transvestite organ player you know what he do Andrew he send an e mail to everyone in his address book everyone his insurance agent his mechanic we have an exterminator over a couple of month ago even he get an e mail he be tell everybody I have not even tell my father really I have not have time I 've be busy I do not want to tell he over the phone Andrew suggest that we both go in there and tell he together but something happen we do not get around to it besides I do not want we both to go in there Hand in hand all lovey dovey like the movie guess what daddy so it be not exactly that it do not work out you 've just avoid tell he he have not be feel well lately he be have all these test do of course I take he he do not know what question to ask he think because I be a doctor they will be more straight up with I to be honest it would be much nice to be in the dark not know the truth I could be positive encourage optimistic he have an MRI today maybe the news of you and Andrew would come as a welcome distraction to he it would make he happy yeah that be a problem what be the problem well it will give he something to look forward to you mean if you tell he it will be real yeah I guess so I do not know maybe I know Andrew 's be so happy these day I feel like cheat he how just by be sad well not sad exactly but not happy either neutral indifferent Andrew make we do the round last week see all our friend tell they the good news and I just feel like do you ever see the movie King Kong how they capture he from the wild bring he back to civilization they put he on display for the whole world to see but he be not indifferent he be angry if I remember whatever it be a freak show I feel like a freak show everyone be look at I with these fake smile plaster all over their face it be like they be all wait to see what I do next we do not really have that much time leave come on I just get here you be half an hour late we be back to that again that bullshit about I be late I know you do not think it be important I do I give up it be pointless you might as well just bind gag I 'cause whatever I say or do do not make a difference that be what you would like shut I up yeah I would 'cause you keep say the same thing I hear you you wanna kick I out of therapy I get it I do not want to kick you out absolutely not I do think we should allow the possibility into the room the possibility of we wind down our therapy believe I you let it in how long have you be think about this have you be think about getting rid of I for a long time it look like you 've be wait for this to happen hope it would happen my be late today be the perfect excuse to get rid of I first of all I be not getting rid of you I be just ask you to consider whether this therapy be really help so now you be try to soften the blow

be humiliate you for the last year by not respond to you my honest opinion be that it be really difficult to continue therapy this way from such an emotionally charge place Therapy should not be a source of constant humiliation for you you really deserve more what you be not a good enough therapist all of a sudden be I the first patient to be in love with you you 've be a therapist for 20 year be not you suppose to know what to do in these case for Christ 's sake just deal with it maybe you can not treat I because you be in love with I too I can not treat you because the boundary have be breach too often by tell I that you no long want to be my patient so fucking what our time be up I be afraid it be could not you give I extra time there be this little dog remember I be afraid I can

ask you Jake why do she want to fuck Reeves she love authority what about you you be not authoritative authoritative and authority be not the same thing there must have be other boss before Reeves be Jake jealous of they too Amy what be different with Reeves it be not about he it be about her she be change in what way she do not use to have that look in her eye what do you mean look that look right there on the prowl she be out of control be it possible that Amy 's pregnancy be a chance for you to control her a pregnancy a baby it be not that easy to get out on the prowl as you put it she be much more restricted perhaps like in the good old day when Lenny be a baby and she be more House break tame brain dead I get pregnant a month after we meet I give up my freedom the day I meet you I would like to pay you I do not think we pay for the last two week we do have a few minute I be leave Shit I can not find my checkbook you be leave without I I come without you where be it where be you

about you be go away for a few day it be for a week actually with with he where be you go Rome Rome Rome of all the city Rome what be this some kind of revenge no Rome be completely coincidental it be some deal he get with work or something next to the passport there be some business card of our favorite restaurant in Rome maybe I can book you two into the Il Palazetto maybe you know all you have to why do not you just get out of here I do not intend to feel guilty you know I be not really interested in what you feel previously on in Treatment be you say that I push Kate into this situation that I create this environment at home so that Kate could go fuck an insurance agent because really I be in love with Laura I think we should just discuss the possibility that Laura 's well off with a different therapist I be not send Laura to another therapist end of story if I remember correctly you be face with the same scenario yourself do not forget I be the one who refer Charlie to you you know that he never ever get over you you fail the same test yourself but you abandon a patient how be you Paul I be fine why do I not seem fine no you seem antsy I just keep need to go to the bathroom you remember where it be the door on your right no I mean all the time it be a a urinary thing oh I see have you see a doctor yeah it be get well but it be still a terrible sensation you go to the bathroom you be stay there you will it to happen nothing not a drop so uncomfortable this and the stress you be under what Jesus you think it be psychosomatic no not at all a symbolic urinary infection Symbolic how my head 's tell I one thing my body 's tell I another my precise issue manifest itself as a physical malfunction of the yes you say it be on the right excuse I for a moment season 1 Episode 15 Sync by Anyone Coffee Tagne www swsub com there be no soap in there really I think I see soap be you angry it feel like you be angry tonight let us say that be a fairly accurate assessment you wanna tell I why actually I be angry at myself for take your advice even though I know well my advice take your advice like a novice like a naive intern ignore every cell in my body and listen to you instead what happen I meet with Laura and we talk about end our session a total disaster do the opposite of what you predict it be just destructive it sabotage a year of therapy how because it undermine her faith in I and in the work that we 've do together she ask I if I be end our session because I be in love with her that well that what she hear I say what she hear be I be in love with you so I can not see you anymore how do you put it exactly be you suggest that I handle it badly no I just want to hear what you say you know I say we should discuss the option of of end therapy you do not just drop it on she out of the blue of course I do not I build up to it she come in late I think that be important like it be her way of tell I something I be not follow I say I think that she be late be her way of say that she be angry at I that she be ambivalent about her therapy of course she throw it back and she ask if she do have a point she ask if she be not the first person ever to fall in love for her therapist and then she tell I to deal with it mean you know this be my job she be right she say you be an experienced therapist just deal with it be you surprised to the reaction you put it on she and she throw it back how be I suppose you hammer I about this last week you go on and on about what I I know it be a bad idea and now I be come to you with this mess and all you you be not an intern Far from it do not play the intern if you think something be a bad idea you do not do it because I suggest it I say we should talk about it you be furious like I be try to take Laura away from you two day later you abruptly try to stop her treatment you say that end the therapy be the well good solution I say it might be necessary for her sake when you say good solution I think you mean a solution to your problem be that what I mean I be assume you act hastily because you think it be necessary that it have to be deal with quickly what do you want Gina do you want to what do you want to hear do you want I to talk about Laura do you want we to have a Laura session what do you want I to say that I sit opposite she and say oh what if well I do you think I be in denial about it I be not Laura be she be attractive anybody who be a therapist know that look I know all the way in with her all the door I could open if I want to do you imagine open they yes I do I fantasize about Laura look it be like a gynecologist it be easy for woman to believe that their male gynecologist do not have any sexual desire for they of course they want he to find their body attractive as well do not they do not even try to break down a relationship between a woman and her gynecologist that be a deep end anyway last week I I get this sharp kind of pain so I go to the urologist and on Monday and I think this be this be really scary and then this random thought come into my head because it be so cold in the room and I think my dick be shrink and I do not want the doctor to think that you know that be the real size never mind it be just you know there be no connection between a gynecologist office and the intimacy between therapist and patient what do you think the connection be what I be say be that as a male therapist sit across from a beautiful patient I I know exactly how to engage she I know exactly what it would take to to turn she on you know what turn she on yes I do what any number of thing but I could manipulate she to do anything I want I know that and I doubt if it be only male therapist who have those thought do you know what I be talk about for example if a male doctor perform an examination on a female patient there would be a nurse present right I mean that be for a reason be I the nurse I keep you from cross the line be that why you come to I let I tell you what worry I you have boundary too and just like you this woman know how to cross they all I be say be that the temptation be there for any therapist I know what I be do I mean if I be a gynecologist and I be perform an examination I would not accidentally start to listen to yourself you know you say you have no problem discuss Laura and then I bring she up and suddenly it be it be all about genital Gynecologist and urologist and you know it seem to I that you be take all of this to an extremely intimate realm and you be say to I I be extremely vulnerable here help I here where it hurt you know what what get to I be that I lie it out for you all I want be for you to give I the Gina treatment to get in there with your cold analytical scalpel and get some perspective say try this Paul try that what I do not expect be that that you give up on I tell I to find she a new therapist give up on you you suggest a course of action when that fail you say to I hey you do it do not come blame I do you really believe I convince you to do something destructive let us talk about that it seem like a distraction from talk about your feeling about she but okay let us start by look at how you be conduct her therapy which seem to I impulsive unorganized and if I be honest very problematic really be it now whenever I try to talk about this you unleash all this aggression to show I this area be off limit Touch this I will burn it down all right we will deal with it right right you remember I be talk about Alex the fighter pilot God listen to yourself what you say let us talk about Laura and then you bring up Alex or anything you can think of so long as it be no Laura this be about Laura Alex the fighter pilot meet Laura how after a session we have this talk about stop therapy the session end and she would not leave she want extra time I tell she I could not I have an appointment with urologist you do not tell she that no I say I have an appointment anyway she storm out and lo and behold who do she meet he be there and you have a conflicting appointment he be a day early by mistake which be weird because this guy be such a military perfectionist a machine he can probably tell the time by triangulate the star or something anyway he forget what day it be so he come back the next afternoon tell I that they meet and now they be date you think it be funny because I do not it be not funny it be curious I guess what be so what be curiously funny about it I do not know just give I a minute and let I figure out what I be think it make I smile I do not know why they be date Dating she go out with he to get back at I I push she into it you do not see that I reject she unequivocally and the next minute she be hit on the near guy I mean a guy literally on my own doorstep that be not a reaction to I why would it be because she know Alex would tell I well first of all be not that a reaction against her boyfriend the man she be go to marry why be you the betray man here which would be the bad situation if you realize that you be the center of Laura 's life and that she be date another man to get at you or if the transference simply fade and she be back to view you as a therapist she think about you during session that be it do you think I be an egomaniac no I be ask which would be the bad situation I do not get off on be worship by my patient if that be what you mean it be not like I be in some kind of some kind of a cult if her feeling be to change you would not have a sense of loss pretty clear how you want I to answer this do you not get that I be concerned about the right and the wrong of this as it affect all my patient you be very concerned I can tell that but you know sometimes help a patient view the world differently it be a powerful experience it be a little addictive it be a powerful experience because it contribute to somebody 's well be it be not about an inflated sense of Power do you think I be addict to power how how do Laura see you what do you mean when she look at you what do she see why Bear with I what do she see she see a man obviously a lot old than she be an authoritative strong man she think if she could get close to he that she could maybe take on some of his strength at the same time she be wait for he to disappoint she because somewhere down the line inevitably that be her story with man what else she think I will not be interested in she unless she offer herself sexually she associate concern for she as a woman with sex for her sex be a currency that she use to pay for emotional protection from man do not analyze just describe where be this go no just stay with it she think I be a coward which be a bit of a turn off she believe that I be totally in love with she that I think all the rest of my patient be a drag and that I can not wait for her session I assume she I assume she find I attractive otherwise why would she be not this enough now you describe she how you see she I would say an hysterical disorder do not analyze Describe do you mean what do she look like if one have to pick she out of a crowd I would say no if you have to pick she out of a crowd God you be such a stickler she be thirty she be beautiful great smile inquisitive look in her eye really sharp very smart she be get this great laugh that just just bubble up out of her it come from nowhere like quicksilver she be childish I would say no not childish childlike Vulnerable it make you want to hold she she be fascinated with sex well with the power of sex as if she be a teenager who be just discover it always always make reference to it vivid sexual experience that I get to say be very poetic sometimes she tell I about a summer after her mother die she be 15 and she go to live with this couple in San Diego friend of her father and she fall in love with this guy much old than her it be an escape I think from her father who be really depressed and sad after the death of his wife that can be pretty horrible you know a child take care of a parent like you do after your mother 's breakdown nothing bad than a kid play parent to a father or mother it be unnatural it reverse of the order of thing it be like kind of death I suppose for you it be after your father run off with his patient you keep come back to that I try to find the root of your connection to Laura it be get nothing to do with my father Laura be the one re enact not I Laura 's re enact this escape because that be what I be to her escape from what her boyfriend her wedding I 've try to explain it to she that she be really make I into another David not your David but the old guy from that couple that take she in she want I to be that guy again you be sure well God forbid I should say anything you agree with no matter how clearly I lie it out her attraction to I her want to run away with I there be something big that be that be drive that impulse maybe you wanna run away what escape from Kate from your work God you be so fixate on your pet theory everything have to do I tell you that that Kate be go to Rome next week with her insurance agent boyfriend she be the one that be run not I I tell she Fine just get the hell out I do not wanna I I do not want to look at you we do not live together anyway what do you mean I sleep in the office during the day we act like everything be fine but at night I be I be on the couch since when last four night I bring in my blanket and my clothe how be the kid take this Rosie do not come home on Tuesday say she would be back late but in the morning she be not there she say she sleep over at some friend 's Ian have a week off from college he do not even call do not come back get back after work yesterday and Kate announce that you know hey I be go out I say fine do whatever you want so I go to make dinner and there be no food in the kitchen I go to the fridge I look in nothing not even an egg Max and I order pizza then I put he to bed I be go to sleep in the office then I think what if something happen you know he be upstairs by himself he be all alone I could not bring myself to sleep in that bedroom not even for his sake I find that bedroom kind of repulsive I be asleep for while I do not know what time it be and I wake up and I hear this voice say daddy and Max be there you know just stand at the door he ask I if I could sleep with he and I say sure he have not do that since he be 5 year old my guess that be the answer to your question be the kid know everything anyway she be leave in 3 day and probably for the good really how be it for the good it be not for the good it be a nightmare it be painful but in a way you be free to go through whatever it be with Laura I want my wife to leave I for a salesman maybe not but it be convenient Convenient she be fly to Rome to fuck an insurance salesman for Christ 's sake be that really what he be I do not know he be a run an employment agency or something what be I suppose to do chain she to the bed track every move she make like that guy I have in therapy Jake or Alex who you know whose wife grind her tooth in her sleep and wake up the next day and say the marriage be over I be leave you keep bring patient into this my wife be run off but apparently it be not my wife really it be I accord to you since I be my father it must be I I 've be try to understand since our first session why you come to I I specifically I remember on our first visit you say that you feel like you be cut corner you have no patience for your patient that be what you say and that if they know what you really think about they they would stop come I be wonder if maybe that be what you want for they to stop come why would I want that not literally on an unconscious level Unconscious maybe you want to transfer your patient to I where do that come from it be not a real option it be a wish you could dump your patient on I your problem when I suggest that we find another therapist for Laura you immediately assume that I would treat she and then you go down the list you describe each patient but be not that what the session be for no it feel like you be prepare I metaphorically for the day when you hand they over when you say here their problem be not my problem I have to leave yeah I be go to run off to the Caribbean and I be go to be sip cocktail with Laura and scuba diving I mean what on earth be you on about I just take on 3 more new patient you say you do that to prove to yourself that everything be ok that couple you say you do not care if they ever come back you do not like the navy pilot and sometimes it seem you be not that upset about Kate what not always sometimes maybe all these thing that should be bad be really okay and then there be I you be use I as your accomplice not in a practical way but emotionally to help you move on from they that way you be free to be with Laura you know I do not even want to say to that I mean what be you do be this what you call help 'cause that be why I come here I come here for you to help I I keep say this but through some misguided line of reasoning through some narcissistic need of your to save the day to put yourself at the front and the center we 've end up here in this same place just to confirm that you Gina be right as always maybe I misjudge you I do not know I think you be well than this you know I 've get to say you really sometimes be so infuriate the way you keep come back to your pet theory my father Kate I guess I would well go previously on in Treatment I hear you paul you want to kick I out of therapy I get it no I do not want to kick you out absolutely not I think that you toss I out a long time ago you do not want I to treat you as a psychologist you want I to treat you as somebody who be in love with you Let us face it I have not be your therapist for a very long time Laura maybe you can not treat I because you be in love with I too where you head you need a ride Laura Let us do it Paul Paul Season 1 Episode 16 Laura week four Synchro by ¤akazab¤ Kasius LAURA Londay 9 00 be sorry you say that it that it happen in the kitchen no it start in the kitchen be you listen to I yes yes I be I say I want to do it right there on the counter so when he pick I up I think okay but no he take I into the bedroom and he Put I down ever so gently like I be I do not know a porcelain vase or something everything be very cautious hesitant like he do not know what to do maybe he do not know what to do with someone who be not his wife yeah he keep tell I he have not do it with anyone but his wife for 10 year and hardly then it be very sweet actually he imitate I he do everything I do I take off his shirt he take off my shirt I tell he he have a fantastic body because he do and he go so do you at one point he stroke my hair and he ask I what kind of shampoo I use can you believe this we be lie there face to face pet each other like high school kid anyway I get sick of it so I say to myself maybe he be wait for a signal you know maybe he want I to lead maybe if I start do something you know thing will finally get move so I go down on he everything be so proper I do not want proper I just want he to fuck without all the bullshit about my shampoo and my beautiful breast and my excellent taste in curtain so do that move thing along what the blowjob of course but you know what he do not like sex you know what I mean he do not really like it it be like he be carry out an assignment a mission like a pilot what do you mean like a pilot you know those air force guy that mark tally point on the wing of their fighter jet to keep track of how many plane they 've shoot down it be like that like he be keep score I mean he do not even touch I while he be go at it he be just you know lean on his elbow as if he do not want any connection between we except where necessary and I keep try to bring my face close to his to kiss he and he just keep pull his face away as if he could not stand I and that be it it be very fast two minute more or less and then he come and then he go straight the bathroom and I just lay there in shock I mean he do not even ask I how it be if I be okay or not nothing anyway I make myself come while he be in the bathroom no when he get back I have to I mean I hate to be leave high and dry he be just lie conduct dialogue the ceiling or maybe with his wife or maybe with you and he look so fucking sexy so I I climb on top of his leg I think he would get the hint and he would start something but nothing so I just keep go ride his thigh it feel good and then I be overwhelmed with this sadness for he he break my heart this guy he be fragile really that be what he be I do not think he could tell what I be think I be completely in my own head and I be think to myself shit this be go to be the sad orgasm of my life here I be ride this hot sad guy 's thigh I be expect something pitiful and measly right but no a volcano be a cliche but that be what it be it be like 10 orgasm explode at once it be hard to describe but I scream I do I scream and I think I scare he you would have be really proud of I why would I have be proud I mean as my therapist you know that I finally connect with myself do not happen very often I be sorry that be a bit reveal but you must be use to it you know hear confession like that it probably do not impress you anymore actually it make a very big impression really what sort of impression well you can look at it in all kind of way but one thing seem perfectly plain to I you sleep with my patient excuse I he be not your only patient he do not belong to you he be a great guy okay a little fuck up a little insecure in bed maybe but he be get potential I think I be go to have a terrific affair with he nevertheless it be no coincidence that you go to bed with he and I do not think it be any coincidence that you begin your affair with he shortly after we talk about your quitting therapy be you say that I do this to get back at you remember the guy you tell I about the guy that you meet at the bar that you go to the restroom with you say that you feel you be with I it be not the same thing Paul be you sure it be not it be during that session Laura that you decide to tell I that you be in love with I and that be how you choose to tell I how you feel about I by have sex with another man Paul if there be one thing that I put right out there without hinting or manipulation be that I 've want you so I do not need to fuck another man just to get my message across what make you so Sad about Alex his loneliness he be a sad guy do you feel sad no I feel horny so sadness for he but no sadness for yourself what be you try to get at here maybe you do feel sadness because you be with a man you do not really want to be with be you say that when I be fucking Alex I be actually fuck you be do not flatter yourself it be not really a compliment Laura I think it seem more like look what you miss out on Paul you coward you idiot I be tired I be really so tired so after Alex leave I could not fall asleep I suddenly have this incredible craving for cheesecake Cheesecake you know those amazingly fluffy cheesecake with that amazing smell well my mother use to bake those every friday afternoon afternoon after I finish play with my friend I use to come home and that smell it be intoxicate it be like a trail of scent pave my way home like a cartoon character then my mother get sick the cancer be only stage one at that point when they find it but when she start chemo she stop bake you know she be tired she she have no energy and that be the first sign the first sign that something really big be about to happen and when she be really sick I use to find myself roam the hall of the apartment building climb up and down the stair search for that smell of cheesecake Shit how corny be that and once I rember a woman come out of her apartment and she thank you and she see I stand out there she do not know who I be she must have be new to the building and she be yell at I go away go on go home what be you do stand out here just why do you think you have that particular memory the other night I do not know I search through my whole apartment look for a recipe but not that that would have do any good my fridge be completely empty I think about go out to get a piece but it be 3 00 a m so I just give up and go to sleep only then the phone rang and it be Alex he call to thank I tell I that he have an amazing time with I and that he want to see I again go figure huh he be suppose to pick I up from here pretty soon from here yeah that be what he say be not you afraid that Andrew will find out about this or maybe you want to get catch Andrew and I split up what for good and it be for good he be a nice guy he will make a nice husband for someone who deserve he but obviously not for you I nearly fuck guy in bathroom stall as you very kindly remind I I just could not stand up there in front of everyone promise to well I just should not ever make promise I promise not to make any more promise how be that so I tell he that I be sorry but I can not marry you I be incapable of be the woman you want the kind of woman you deserve I put it all on I well 'cause it be all I and he look at I and he say thank you Laura thank you God exist it be a fact he be make I realize who and what you be and he be save I from a long endless death with you flatter no he must be devastate maybe he feel I do not care how he feel you do not care not now I do not feel like talk about Andrew 's side of the story why do that make you so upset because I be the one in therapy here Andrew have his own therapist she will take care of he do not worry about he worry about I I be take care of you you be kick I out of therapy I be not I bring it up as an option do not sugarcoat it you even try to blame it on I you make up the most ridiculous case as to why I be late it be nasty a bullshit excuse instead of level with I and say listen I 've feeling for you too it be hard for I to deal with instead of figure it out so we could continue therapy so we could we could be together that be your point we 've be together for a year a year there be more intimacy between we than most couple in the world be not that right I do not deny that there be a certain intimacy that can a certain intimacy Intimacy like cut the crap be there intimacy here or not there be and now you be willing to throw that all away and why because you be scared I know that as a therapist you tell yourself it be part of therapy to find out why I be in love with you and how that be link to my past and all that but be not that always the way it work do not our past always determine who we fall in love with what if you can trace it back to the withholding mother the narcissistic father the parent who be miss in action do that make our love any less real but sometimes circumstance be let us say less than ideal I know that I know you can delude yourself into think only I be not delude not about you not about how I feel about you why I feel it there be always get to be an explanation but that I feel it be irrefutable I do not know how to convince you anymore I mean you think that I 've imagine this fairy tale this happily ever after that I 've idealize you you think this be a case of a miserable patient sit in front of her her therapist imaging that you be my superman Perfect savior mentor I do not see you that way at all how do you really see I I see you the way you be your imperfection you be not at ease with your body with your profession with who you 've become I do not know much about your life but I I imagine you be not happy at home something in you be restless damage there be a yearning there and I know it when I see it and I want you just the way you be damaged and restless yearn Warts and all so you can fix I God you can be such a fucking prick when you wannabe so that I can fix you then you know next month I will be 30 and I 've be think to myself I 've hate myself for 30 year it be enough I do not want to anymore why do you hate yourself you be surprised I 've never hear you say it before I guess you save the good for last that be the good that you hate yourself I do not know you be surprised it be something people realize after an hour I do not know it after an hour neither after a year it be not easy for I to hear you say that maybe you should try and find out why it be so hard for you maybe you should see someone I 've be think about that seriously I think the reason it be hard for I to hear it be because I know that you have so many reason to to love yourself so many thing to be to be really proud of yet you choose to ignore they why have not you ever hate yourself I guess I do once I be a kid you know my mother she be in pretty bad shape and I take care of she but I could not I could not save she from herself you know I guess I hate myself for that be she sick she be in a difficult emotional state I think that I could pull she out of it I use to cook she all these you know elaborate meal but she would not eat they could not understand why like every kid I think it be my fault it be something that I be not do maybe I could do something else but you know that be not true I know that now yes have you forgive yourself I think so take a long time how do that feel I mean really I be curious it feel like a relief to tell you the truth to know that that burden be go the burden of blame and to know deep down that it never belong there in the first place maybe that be why you become a psychologist to help other with their burden maybe so you be a product of your past too will that be cash or check can I owe you that sure anyway I know where you live yes you do I should get go Alex be wait for I I forget I have not pay you that be okay it will do next week thank you be welcome previously on in Treatment I leave home you really help I with that in our last session you show I that leave home be my own personal decision could you be mad at I for something else like what because I meet a patient of yours I get the date wrong and I accidentally meet laura should I go for her I can not give you date tip Alex she be the kind of woman that can could drive a man insane be I right bye Melissa Bye thank you I be early huh yeah but it be okay it be not a problem I be in the area I do not want to go home and have to come all the way back it be okay be you sure you do not have thing to do I be sure this be from Laura I think it be a check who know Synch Benj I will pay you for the extra time no need it be okay no no I insist it be another 20 30 hold on do you feel well now what do you mean after pay I do you feel well what be you try to say I guess that I be I be surprised by how much effort you put into show your contempt for this process and for I relax okay it be just the way my mother raise I I do not know what it be like with you people I do not like charity so I like to pay for what I get well I be glad you be get something here Alex listen let us not make a big deal out of this okay you want I to admit that this therapy be worthwhile okay I will admit it this therapy be change my life Happy can we drop it now how many patient do you have why be that relevant I be just curious like today how many patient already why be you ask I this 'cause I wanna know what kind of money you make let us say you have 8 patient a day time 5 day a week 150 a pop it be pretty good live there doc 24 grand a month do you wanna buy I out alex what well 24 000 a month and I be all yours and you will be my only patient it must be hard for you to be in this position to be perceive as weak and you have this need to regain your strength you bring I a check from laura you 've ask I about my patient and my income and you 've do everything you can to put I in my little place do I offend you no I be kind of use to it but then all our session start out like that do not they Alex maybe I be expect something a little different today maybe because you be early or because you 've be ask around about I do you want I to tell you why I be early or do you wanna just go on and on with your theory I would love to hear I go to the base today I think I would pop over before my session here and say hello to my boy when I get to the gate I realize I forget my i d now usually that be not a big deal but there be a new grunt at the gate some real okie from Muskogee I tell he look call the base commander and tell he that lieutenant Prince be here so he go in the booth call come back a minute later and he say I be not on the approve list now of course this be a real sensitive issue these day as you can imagine still I say to hell with the list this be what you do you call Dana the secretary tell she to talk to the commander and you tell he that lieutenant Alex Prince Jr be wait at the gate so he go in he call he come back and he say he say I be sorry but the commander be in a meeting now maybe he be in a meeting and he could not be disturb or maybe they be stuff their face with doughnut or maybe he just do not give a fuck I do not know I tell that guard I say look you tell Dana if she take the commander 's cock out of her fucking mouth once in a while then maybe she could hear well Man I be this close to knock that motherfucker out anyway I do not get in so I leave and that be why I get here early not not an easy experience no it be bullshit now I get to come and deal with this I get you come at I like this that be the tip of the iceberg my shitty week start on saturday why what happen on saturday okay we be go to pretend here all right we can pretend you know what happen do I I wish you would 've warn I about Laura last week it would have save we both a lot of heartache I sleep with her okay with Laura that be what happen on saturday but I be sure you get a full play by play from she already do she or do she not talk to you about it I be not at liberty to discuss my patient or their session now what be that Code language for she do discuss it but you will not tell I it be pretty weird she call to ask I if I want to come over for dinner no problem right so when I get to her place I look at her I look at how she be dress I look at the table I look at the wine and I realize that dinner be obviously just a code name for sex this whole thing be like a ritual a ritual yeah and all the rule First of course there be the meal she do not look like a cook right but she make a big effort for starter she prepare her own sushi California roll they be not that great actually it do not taste good it be just for show do not you get it that be the problem nowadays everything be for show if you wanna make sushi take a fucking course go to a real japanese grocery do not make it with uncle Ben 's rice and imitation crabmeat come on do you say anything to her of course not no the dinner be just a lead up to we get in bed I tell you that it do not really matter so do you want to sleep with her yeah but it have nothing to do with want anything it be all premeditate it be like a mating ritual like the masai tribe in Tanzania but for yuppie anyway so we get up from the table we go to her bedroom and have sex and that be what happen on saturday it be interesting that you tell I so much about this ritual of you go to bed together but nothing about what happen between you I be sure that you 've have lousy sushi before but I do not think you 've be with another woman for a long time be not that correct but you know what happen so why do you have to hear it from I you be very preoccupied with who know what and who say what what be important be how you feel about it how the experience be for you the sex the sex be all that anyone want to talk about but be it really as important as you people make it out to be well you tell I I know that be what it say in all your textbook I know that but I ask myself be it really the key to everything or be it just the simple answer but you be the one who start the story by say that the sex be the issue that all the rest be just foreplay okay I will tell you what happen otherwise you will not feel like you be do your job right but before I start there be something I 've get to know do you ever jerk off to anything a patient tell you what Come on come on you must hear some crazy story from woman Explicit shit fantasy do you ever jerk off afterwards be you concerned that I will masturbate to something that you tell I I no I be talk about you 've got woman they sit here on your couch they tell you all about fucking it must get to you sometimes I know it would get to I do you masturbate there you go again you be answer a question with a question all right I will answer with an answer I be a human being I masturbate sometimes my fantasy be about many many thing all sort of woman be that what you want to hear that in that regard I be not that substantially different from you that be the first time you 've ever answer one of my question in any case you will not masturbate to I and Laura 's story I guarantee you that you may think of it the next time you be have sex with your wife and you be try not to come it must have be a very complex experience for you be with be with another woman after all this time Complex right I give a shitty performance I make every possible mistake I be a mess to tell you the truth during dinner before we have sex I start think about my first date with my wife Michaela about 15 year ago Jesus we have go out to this bar together at the time she be the liberal type she would talk openly about everything Foreplay favorite position cuddle afterwards cosmo type bullshit and among other thing she tell I that researcher find that wine arouse woman sexually and repress man 's sexual desire have you ever hear that I do not know what make I do it but at one point during my conversation with laura we hit one of those deadly silence I suddenly tell she that alcohol sexually repress man while woman it and she of course she do not respond she just give I one of those look say why be you tell I this why do you tell she I do not know maybe it be a way to move the conversation in a sexual direction make thing go forward a kind of signal that she have be clear to attack be that what you want for she to attack do you think that she understand the signal yeah be there another way of get it it might have sound like an apology in advance that you do not have any real sexual desire for her I do not think so she be not even too faze by it she just change the subject right away like I have say something nasty something inappropriate at the table with all that sushi and that be what piss I off like all her faggy doctor friend she hang out with always say exactly the right thing so listen the first chance I get I look she right in the eye and I say Baby I have to go to the bathroom I be a bit nervous it be my first time since I leave my wife this time she could barely squeeze out a smile even a phony one and from then on every few minute I would mention my wife and the separation even in bed I do it every chance I get just to see her squirm I think I get she completely out of the mood she be totally turn off we have sex it be more like two animal mate I be not that hard and I come pretty fast even on the way to the shower I throw in another I be sorry it be my first time in so many year just for dessert I do not know why I keep say it be you think about your wife no or feel guilty maybe no why would I well because any of those reaction would have be natural Alex we have not talk about your your separation how you feel about it no that be not what this be about the separation be the right thing to do I have not even look back on that do not you get off topic what be the topic do our story match I and laura 's that be what I want to know look on the one hand you describe this feeling of helplessness weakness as if you be drag into sex against your will you feel that you do not perform too well so you feel somewhat humiliate then to gain back some strength and control you make these reference to your wife in order to belittle Laura belittle she you really make some pretty far out connection she belittle I her whole attitude be it be patronize you be sure you be the one who suddenly feel weak so you attack you want to regain control it remind I of the beginning of our session when you come in here you be vulnerable from what happen at the base you give I the envelope from Laura and then you throw your money on the table as if you want to humiliate I to make I feel small how be your machine it be good thank you be the client happy I be go to make I some coffee by the way if you want some if you 've decide to stop be a tea man Alex can we get back to this please we be onto something here and I do not want to lose track just give I a second here okay I realize we be onto something I just need a break respect that I want you to tell I something honestly do you really think you can help I if we sit here and we talk about fuck a few time you will be able to solve all my problem I do not have the answer to that question yeah I know you would say that you know that be what kill I about you people 'cause any other professional I go to a doctor he take a look and he say this be what you get this be how long you have to live if I go to a mechanic he would say 2 000 it will be good as new but you people you do not guarantee shit can I tell you a story what kind of story it be a jewish parable that a friend of mine tell I these two friend be condemn to death but the king he like they and he do not want to kill they so instead he tie a thin rope across this abyss and he tell they both to walk over the rope whoever make it to the other side would be allow to live so the first one walk over the rope and he make it safely to the other side and after he make it his friend yell out to he how do you do it and the other guy answer I have no idea all I know be that whenever my weight pull I to one side I lean to the other it be not exactly Lord of the Rings True so what do it mean that you have to maintain balance in your life I think what it mean be that there be no simple way of jump over an abyss or way that work for everyone I think what you be look for alex be a million dollar magic trick and I do not have that I truly believe there be no simple way to jump across an abyss instead we have to work in small internal step the question be whether you want we you and I to engage in that process eye on your instrument what do you mean it be one of the basic principle in aviation you ever hear of vertigo Sure when you go into vertigo your directional perception change you be spatially disorient you would be fly at mach 2 nose down and think you be take off so that be the first thing they teach you at pilot school you go into vertigo you look only at your aircraft 's instrument ignore your feeling completely rely on your instrument that be what the air controller tell you if he think you be freak out and that be what you be tell I now eye on your instrument so you want I to put myself into your hand you wanna navigate I rely on you and on one hand you be right that be why I come in the first place but keep my eye on the instrument be what get I here what do you mean 'cause I keep my eye on the instrument I drop that bomb so accurately into that window I rely only on my commander and I kill innocent people and now I be suppose to rely on you Alex I do not want you to rely on I I want you to rely on yourself on your own feeling the most I can ever be to you be an air traffic controller who tell you to try to ignore the expectation of everybody else it be the expectation that give you that give you vertigo what be the first step on the way to my new life well what what would you like to do I think I will go fuck she again yeah I will fuck she well and proper this time I will fuck her slow and good I will take my time up into that sweet hot little pussy I mean what be the big deal she think she be the belle of the ball Fuck that she must be pretty miserable if she be come to see you right do not assume that everybody who come to see I be miserable alex look doc when I come to pick she up from here yesterday she be like a complete psychopath one minute she be hug I completely over the top like we be in some kind of movie the next minute I close the car door and she be like take I home I be too tired to do anything today I mean what the fuck she turn as cold as ice she be two totally different people go figure what go through her head listen to what you be say you be belittle she again hey you do not think she belittle I you do not think I know she be completely and totally hang up on someone else check this out Saturday after we have sex she straddle my leg she start rub up against I as if I be not even there it so obvious she be fantasize about somebody else and then she start cry tear and everything she be just cry and I ask her Laura what be up everything okay she do not even look at I she do not even answer I like I be just her dildo so do not tell I I belittle she okay I know this be go to sound crazy after everything I just say but do you think we have a chance together I and laura if we really work at it I do not know Alex I could not even I do not know that I think it could happen I mean like you say doc it be a long series of small step right yes it be well our time be up for today already why do not we continue next week where we leave off today okay thank you be welcome previously on in Treatment I ruin their family Darlene tell I before she leave for Wisconsin that she be only go because she know I would be there to take care of Dana she say she do not trust Cy but she trust I she trust I and I ruin it one night it happen we almost have sex again but he say that we have to stop he say it would ruin both of our career if this get out just say it she try to

last night it go on and on I stay awake all night and then I walk here no food no sleep I be run on empty I 've never have so much to drink in my whole life there be this guy this new guy total eye

she pick out those barbie shoe while I pretend to retch on the makeup counter if I have know you have call she I never would 've go shop and then she wonder why I run off to the gym to be with her I mean to be without her to get the hell away from she for my last birthday she give I a bra a bra for my birthday it be like get coal it be bad than get coal at least you can burn coal it be one of those pushy uppy wonder thing with the clicky wheel you know half bra half machine she want I to be some sort of a fucking cheerleader you want to know why she really hate that I be a gymnast because

who give a fly fuck must be pretty hard for you try to avoid your mom all the time just the opposite I enjoy it really why a few minute ago you say you have to run off to the gym in order to be with her how extraordinary Dr Freud whatever do you think I mean maybe it mean that no matter what I do I can not get rid of her maybe it mean that in order to keep she interested in you you feel you have to run away that do not even make sense you sound like a fortune cookie have you ever wear shoe like that before oh yeah all the time I mean do not you this type of heel raise your butt and shape your calf and that be essential I highly recommend you pick up a pair Paul must remember to do that so why do you wear they last night I do not know really no idea no they remind I of Dorothy 's shoe who be Dorothy from the Wizard of Oz you say Dorothy like she be a friend of yours they be nothing like Dorothy 's shoe Dorothy be cool her shoe be retro oh no what please do not say there be no place like home 'cause if you do I might have to puke all over your sofa no at the end I be go to say that Dorothy discover that she can go home anytime she want with or without her shoe why be you

happen at the gym the other day even though I have not be train I 've be absorb stuff just by watch 'cause I have this chronic problem with my toe go off the edge of the beam when I land a hard element it be because I be naturally knock kneed my knee they face inward so in order to get they face straight my foot have to point out which be good for ballet but bad for gymnastic just a toe in the wrong position can lose you the event I be talk about medal here so anyway I be on the beam right and I 've be train at nighttime even though my body do not want to yet it be like when I be little and I use to starve myself and there would be this period usually in the morning where I be really really hungry you know so hungry that I think that my stomach might just start eat the rest of I and then it would go away suddenly like turn off a light switch and I feel like I be float on cloud it be the same with the pain this time I push through it until it just let up all of a sudden and then I feel like I do not have a body at all like I be just a pair of somersault eye so yesterday I march into the gym and I get up on the beam everyone be in shock and I feel this silence all around I Sophie be careful please then something inside of I some little voice say prove it so I start the first element here I will show you Sophie please be careful this be dangerous do not have a cow Paul I be fine so anyway I begin the first element when I look back at my foot they be right on the beam it be nothing major but I take it as a sort of sign afterwards everyone tell I Cy be so shocked that he could not breathe well I bet he be I do a backflip I land perfectly that be incredible I just walk back to the bench like it be no big deal I could feel everybody 's eye on my back I want to turn around and just and what nothing no come on tell I I want to flip they the bird with both hand like Fuck all of you and the fish you swam in on I think it be the the horse that you ride in on not in my book in my book it be a fish what be it Sophie what be wrong I do not feel well do you want some water do you feel a pain wait a second just wait it will go away stop it Sophie stop it what be it Sophie look at I please what be it what go on in there tell I around 2 00 a m he take I to his room who do the new guy with the Tequila he be from Minnesota or Michigan or somewhere he be a brilliant gymnast he want to have sex he could not get it up he be pretty waste too and then he do and then we have sex and I do not feel anything as usual absolutely nothing afterwards he say that I fuck like someone who be be sexually abuse Prick I be sorry go on we go to the girl ' house to the room that I sometimes stay in I try to go to sleep but I could not stop think about what he have say I be afraid that if I fall asleep I would not get up in time to come here so and when I close my eye I see these horrible image what like everything around I be fall apart you know disintegrate turn into ash right in front of I I force myself to think of something pretty and nice like a pasture in the sunlight and to hold it there that image but as soon as I start to fall asleep the pasture would turn to rot it be terrible that remind I of the accident for some reason I do not know why I be scared that if I sleep I would dream about the accident so I get up and I walk to the bus stop very slowly backwards actually just to slow myself down the bus be not run yet so I sit on the bench yeah and what what be you think about when you sit on the bench I be think about Dana I could not breathe the night of the accident when I leave Darlene 's house and get on the bike all of a sudden I could not breathe my throat close up there be this blind turn at the end of their hill and when I I go around

white car pass I know I be go to have an accident and I just feel calm I turn the handlebar just the small little bit to the left I remember think just this tiny little movement be enough then I ride into the street it be impossible for another car not to hit I and I feel just free free and strong I have this adrenaline rush like nothing could touch I what be that about maybe you feel like you be in control yes yeah and then I be in the middle of the road there be this terrible screech sound and then a boom I remember I say to myself oh just oh and I fly into the air I could suddenly breathe

not good enough to have a kid with her God not that again please just let it be I remember you say that when you see Jake for the first time you think he be sexy as hell I think those be your exact word we we go to this club with Nick 's partner and Jake be play he be up on the stage singing she belong to I he be beautiful and yet now the clothe the music the friend they all seem to annoy you and Jake you 've refer to Amy as a snob you 've call she a princess maybe you 've both be try to force your perspective on each other all these year and it be become a battle for control and you 've become so used to it it be become part of the dynamic of who you be as a couple so why do not it work anymore Amy have a strong need to have a career that seem to stress you out it seem to make you insecure and you become possessive jealous that in turn make Amy Secretive and she lie I get the feeling that you be both tired of this battle and that somewhere deep down inside you want it to stop but you be afraid you be afraid to stop but I do know one thing there be casualty casualty what be you talk about who be a casualty Lenny you two get together while Amy be still marry be that correct would you like to talk about that a little bit Jake after they come to see I play she start take guitar lesson from I she want to learn a few classic song she say it be Nick 's idea yeah you know the rich they love to tap into their creative side and do your ex husband take these lesson also Nick with a guitar be you kid I you love make fun of he you too come on it use to crack you up when I would talk about how uptight he be do you mind I ask you how do your affair how do it begin Jake ask I to stay after the class he insist that I stay two to tango the studio be out by gossamer road and he ask I to go for a walk after the class there be a woman nearby that rent horse we went ride at sunset it be very romantic and we stop along this river and Jake say get off your horse I say why and he say just get off Amy so I do but he stay on his horse I could not see he because the sun be sort of blind I and he say take off your clothe and it be so sexy I could not breathe I be speechless but I take they off and he get off his horse and he come over to I I could feel his breath on my face and I could hear the horse stamp their foot and I just I could not help myself I just could not and where do I know that from do you like it Patrick Thomas one of your favorite you remember it by heart I embellish a little shit for a minute there I think that really happen what really happen Paul be after one of the guitar lesson we go out for a drink get drunk and fuck in her car that do not sound as romantic as no it be forbid it be messy and it turn I on Jake too he feel like he be screw Nick remember he be screw a very successful lawyer Bullshit no you turn everything into a pissing contest with he he be rich and he be smart and boring do not forget that you say so yourself she punish he for bore she do it concern you at all that Amy be marry at the time let us go back for a second 'cause I just get to correct something first of all she make a pass at I I make a pass at you yeah this whole stuff about I insist you stay at the lesson I mean it be nonsense okay it be an hour lesson three hour into it and I be think ok this woman really want to learn this song or she be into I when you get here there be a distance between you a kind of coldness then I have to take that phone call which be an emergency and it seem like you both I do not know gang up on I do you think the same kind of thing happen with Nick that that be how your intimacy be create with a conspiracy between you and now that Amy be try to step out of the house so to speak she be break up that conspiracy so that make you uptight and the conflict between you intensify how will it end you know ironically sometimes end a conflict be not the good thing for the relationship because you get so use to fight each other that you might lose interest if the conflict end I think Jake lose interest a long time ago the moment he have I I do not lose interest you become interested in your boss I be not interested in Ben now it be Ben you be such a fucking liar do not call I a liar but that be what you be baby and what be you guy we keep come back to the same thing no you be a quitter he be a winner

institute be you in touch well sort of she be just get divorced again she leave this dentist who be a chronic cheat and now she be with this whiny sourpuss doctor such an obvious reaction you would think as a shrink you would be able to avoid that kind of thing easy to see pattern when they be not ours or we see they but we can not avoid they that be bad you know Doris have a she have a bit of a thing for I back in the day do she she use to say she be crazy about I but I never sleep with her I always have this feeling that if I do she would somehow I do not know use it against I or say I be use she or something she be like that extreme but hot not such useful quality for a therapist you do not think anybody be a good therapist I be no good either remember be not that how we leave off should we talk about our last session should we I do not know I will say that it be not the first time I 've leave here disappointed or angry if I be you I would look into that of course I be angry at everything these day more or less all the time this week be particularly what the girl gymnast take a bunch of pill and collapse in my office pill to get high no sleep pill try to do herself in attempt suicide God Paul well sort of choose my office there be more efficient place to kill yourself I must say but she be act out and got to say it rattle I she take the pill before the session I have they really stupidly I never have pill in my bathroom but I be sleep on the couch so I would bring some stuff down she manage to get down most of the bottle be she okay she be I call the psychiatrist who be a friend of mine and I ask he not to have her commit do you feel pretty sure she be safe I think she would 've be crush if she think that I have abandon she you know the parental figure pass she on to somebody else I have a feeling that be why she take the pill in the first place to kind of test my my commitment to her be you feel guilty no but I do regret those pill well there be always a way to kill yourself true no I do not feel responsible the strange thing be we have be make a lot of progress lately she tell I that she would have sex with this boy and he tell she that she fuck like somebody who have be abuse amazingly insensitive dumb kid try to cover his own insecurity but Christ it make I so angry normally I never say anything but you do I do I call he an idiot how do she react if she hear she do not acknowledge it but a moment later she have this major breakthrough she start to remember detail of the accident I mean it be a crucial therapeutic breakthrough I feel we be really get somewhere then she just up and go to the bathroom you think you be more effective when you be involve when you show a patient your feeling maybe I do not know but that be not what I be really say here Gina no would you stop draw conclusion I be just tell you about my week let us see in other news Kate take her affair to Rome this week when Sophie collapse in my office I yell out for Kate then realize I be alone in the house I be the only one there do you and Kate discuss anything she do not try to get I to stop she she just make a call to work and pack her bag and off she go you be not surprise not really that be the way Kate have always be I mean that be one of the thing I fall in love with the fact that she just make up her mind and just do whatever she be determined to do so unlike my mother you know I think one of the reason I marry she be to get back at my mother because it be some kind of strike against that whole notion of I do not know victimhood one thing you can say about Kate be she never play the victim she make up her mind to go to Rome she go to Rome it be be 18 year since I 've be alone in that house Rosie 's away for the weekend and Max be with Kate 's mom I 've get the whole house to myself how be that Weird anyway I be hope with with my fish chowder and a bottle of good wine I will get lucky you think I be joke but I do make a mean chowder I have to say I start with the broth then the vegetable and the fillet I steam the leek and the carrot a few other thing mix they all together leave it for about 20 min Delicious the smell always make Kate sick she could never stand it I have to say I love it do you like chowder I do well maybe I will have a little party invite a couple of people over I could invite I could invite Doris how long be it since you 've see she the carefree day of the institute the good old day would you invite her husband be you kid it will say in the invite no sourpuss please just Doris Messler and you and you I be invite you can wear that dress if you want oh well thank you but I think I would just be in the way no you would not you be my cover that be the whole point I will tell she you be come how great it would be if she come too it would be like an institute reunion and then I leave and you be alone with her Perfect it be a perfect plan can not fail you be in a chipper mood consider Guess I be it be nice for a change I miss this side of you I guess it be 'cause this shitty week be finally over you be also show I something what be I show you how it feel to be with Laura how a therapist feel when a patient be flirt you think I be flirt with you well no that be the wrong word it be not flirt it be I be your cover but you be invite I to a party and you be tell I which dress to wear and you be invite I into your life and it maybe be a taste of of what it be like with Laura you know she draw you in it must be flatter yeah it be I get to tell you she be one hell of a storyteller Man can she weave a tale she go into explicit vivid detail she spend about a half an hour tell I about the about the sex that she have with Alex what she like what she do not like what he like what she do what he do pretty vivid a man would have to be make of rock not to react not to feel a little a little what Jealous of course that be what she want be it I know you think it be a problem that I have this jealousy over Laura 's affair with Alex no not necessarily Jealousy be not on your list of reaction a therapist should have or be it a list of no no feeling be that what you want from I a list would that make it easy I doubt it you keep put word in my mouth maybe you want I to be unreasonable so you have something to push against this topic this topic always bring we back onto shaky ground do not it what topic the boundary between therapist and patient teacher marry student there be no big deal about it what be the I mean be it really wrong it be different Paul I remember Charlie your your patient he use to call I after session and he would say this no sex with the therapist thing it be drive I crazy be it for real there be get to be a loophole be I never go to get to sleep with Gina okay let us stay I stop Laura 's therapy let us say I send she to somebody else as you want I to do surely in six month time I can call she up and say no no you can not then a year 18 month when it be cool off there be no cool off period it be not about cool off it do not change the dynamic in six month or 10 year she will still be a patient but that be just some bullshit some lawyer come up with no it be not a law it be beyond a code of ethic it be essential it be something you carry inside you can not you see that so what you be say be that there be no conceivable set of circumstance in which None Christ you be so fucking fundamentalist there be a lot of people who would disagree with this then go to they she be 30 year old she be seductive dependent hysterical she idolize you it be classic right it be textbook here be a girl with damage self esteem excuse I how do you know she be damage you 've tell I about her affair with your other patient she try to make you jealous she describe the sex how she be try to enter your house how she be play all of these game to try to get an oedipal reaction from you if you fall for these advance she will not be grateful she will be shock rightly so and she will leave you all of which you know but you be ignore it you want to be desire we all do but you need to remember why Laura come to you in the first place so you be tell I now what be wrong with my patient another dissertation on what a lousy therapist I be I have never ever say anything like that excuse I what about that famous letter you write I carry that letter in my pocket for month but I do have to say that everything I 've accomplish as a therapist I owe to that letter so thank you you know we be get away from Laura again I can quote it the patient be consistently positive about their session with Paul however it become clear that Paul be play to their expectation his approach to therapy be compromise no actually what you write be seriously compromise by his desire to please that translate to I as he be a shitty therapist I also say that you be one of the most brilliant I know you say all kind of thing you say that I be your favorite that I be the heir apparent why do not you tell I that I be not good enough because that be not the way I feel why would I say that then I could 've get on with my work instead of drag out 8 year of promise of drumroll lead to the bad humiliation of my life you know Walker even jeffrie they say that I be guarantee to be the head of the institute across the board everybody agree with it except you I do not believe you be ready clearly you do not the way you take critique it make you furious you know it be one professional assessment and you take it personally so personally I have to wonder if it be not an echo of an early rejection please Gina not this again I know exactly where you be go with this a son who feel he be disappoint his father a son who feel he have not live up to his father 's expectation it be something you would want to address please do not minimize what you say to I I be not react to something in my past in relation to my father one review drive you out of the institute that letter piss on eight year of my work despite it though I become an excellent therapist and some people might say that I become a well therapist than you maybe you feel that maybe that be what this be really about so let I ask you again why do you come to I specifically I suppose because I need to I do not know test myself I mean I already know before I come here what you be go to say about I and Laura and Kate but I think to myself you know if I can withstand your corrosive attack your particular brand of analytical castration that sound horrible why put yourself through that so that I can trust myself I suppose trust yourself with what you know you say that you be write a novel you know I find that kind of amusing to tell you the truth because a novel be about complexity it be about contradiction foible human folly not absolute for you complexity be a problem some kind of pathology that need to be treat and you know what I find fucking offensive to tell you the truth that you think I be blind to a situation as obvious as erotic transference let I just tell you that I treat Laura with the same integrity the same concern the same rigor as I treat all my patient I happen to like my patient that be the difference between you and I I worry about they I identify with they I put myself out for they you analyze they I analyze too but I empathize let I ask you something I be just curious about this do you miss have patient why I be never really 100 convince to be honest that you actually like this process the sitting down with a patient that be because in your opinion I have no empathy and so how could I get any satisfaction from it I be not say you do not get satisfaction from it in the same way that a sail maker or or a chemist get when they practice their craft but that thing I be talk about that exist between a doctor and a patient that connection that buzz see I can not help but connect with the person that be who I be as a therapist that be my reward a while ago before before I start come here there be there be a session that Laura cry she would never actually do that before that be a kind of a victory right it be kind of a milestone for a therapist when you get the patient to that point where they where they cry it be different with she there be something so so move about see she just break down like that in that moment I swear I could 've say fuck it all I just want to be with she but I do not I come to you instead I come especially to you I choose you 'cause I think to myself if Gina can not convince I to to stay away then how be I go to convince myself it be really tough when I be alone with her you know and she be ask I please just be honest please tell I how you feel and I can not I guess the reason I be here be because I really want to look at this I want to examine it I want to be absolutely clear about this one hundred percent that it be not that I be not that you be not what you need to say it you need to finish the thought that what I want be not in some way immoral or unethical and that it be not abuse an abuse of my power as a doctor with a patient I be not push you out I be not run away no matter what you tell I at the institute maybe that be hubris on my part I do not know it might have be but I will not do that now I will not reject you that do not mean I be go to let you do something that you will regret the rest of your life not without fight you every step if it be safety you need this be it we 've already cross line of conduct in this room I be say that because I want you to know how far I be willing to go whatever you tell I I be here for you I will not abandon you no matter what I be here I love she I love Laura every word out of her mouth every move she make I just I love talk to her you know just listen to her I know it be a joke cliché 50 year old married man in love with a 30 year old but I want to be with she and I do not care what it mean and I do not care what it cost I do not care I love she previously on in Treatment a liar should not expect their word to be worth anything I be go to start some real lying to teach you a lesson you say that when you see Jake for the first time you think he be sexy as hell he be beautiful Amy have a strong need to have a career that seem to make you jealous that in turn make Amy secretive and she lie stop call I a liar stop lie stop it you be a fucking liar God damn it stop it you be a fucking liar you be a quitter he be a winner if you have a quarter of Ben 's strength I would be interested in you too you psychopath have you ever record your argument with she before I just want to understand what be happen to we what be up you fall asleep how long have you be here five minute should we go in there be someone in there can I sit what time be it five to well well what be you go to be like this in there too like what I do not know Season 1 Episode 24 Week 4 Session 4 Sync by michvanilly Gaillots anyone so how be you both fine Fantastic before we begin I want to talk about last week I can tolerate yelling and outburst that result from your argument but I will not absolutely not tolerate any physical violence do you understand that it be ok we separate a week ago separate I be sorry to hear that so it be a little late to start set up ground rule hope you do not feel like an idiot that be what you would want I suppose why would I wanna make you look like an idiot because it make you feel good wait do you hear what I just say yes you say that you have be separate for a week would you like to tell I why he threaten to kill I you be smile you be take on a huge responsibility what responsibility you act like you be not concern you do not think he be capable of do it he could be perfectly capable of it then why be you smile I 've have patient over the year who 've have their life threaten you just bring this up like it be nothing well I be not into this what be the matter can not you hear how he be talk to we what the hell be wrong with you why be you be so hostile that be what it feel like to you very much so ok what I have to put up with you both be hostile to each other and to I constantly that be why we pay you the money be not really important to I I have other patient I do not understand you say you do not wanna treat we anymore do I want to treat you that be a tough one actually this be what therapy would be like if nobody respect boundary it be chaotic it be disrespectful and it be unproductive do you understand that be that what you want can not even get couple therapy right our own therapist do not want to treat we anymore why do not you just tell I what happen after the session last week I take Lenny and go to my mother 's and then Jake show up on Saturday and want to take Lenny home before they poison he with sugar please you should see the crap they force feed he do not do that anyway we go to the bedroom to talk one thing lead to another and we end up have sex how do one thing and another lead to the sex you want some detail bro whatever you would like to tell I thing that dull at home I be interested in your sex because it be part of your dialogue as a couple so how do it go from sex to a murder threat he have just finish come he be still lie on top of I he be still inside I and he whisper in my ear that if I leave he he would kill I he do not even bother pull out I be disgust that be an unusual reaction to somebody threaten to kill you what be it that disgust you let I tell you what disgust I watch she and her mother shove junk food down my son 's throat it be a miracle the kid do not shit twinkie what do Lenny have to do with this no what you do to he disgust I he be 9 and he weigh 100 pound he do not weigh 100 pound so be Lenny overweight he be a child he will grow out of it when he hit puberty I be the same you be overweight my dirty little secret she have issue with food I be thin by the time we got marry who care what I weigh when I be 5 you never mention that before we never speak about it 'cause it be irrelevant in this context this be couple 's therapy right when do you lose the weight in my teen just melt off so do it bother you that Lenny be overweight please stop say that I do not like refer to he that way he have a little baby fat he will lose it 30 pound of it her mother let he eat candy drink soda play Xbox he do not want he to see my mother he would be well off on the street he be get the gene of an athlete I see it come it be my fault he be fat I pass down shitty gene we can not talk about Lenny without I be blame for the terrible gene I give he so the fact that you be overweight that do come up in argument between you do not you think it be a relevant subject for therapy no I do not understand why we be go in this direction yes he want to talk about our fat little boy why do not we talk about how Jake 's screw Lenny up she mean I be screw he up socially Lenny hit because he gets laugh at for be fat no Lenny hit because Jake teach he to hit he gets bully at school so I teach he to defend himself it be normal besides you be the one do the hitting last week you convince Paul it be go to escalate to murder you be the one planning to kill I remember I would gladly but I would feel bad for Paul we already ruin his couch once right can you see the pattern here what you do to each other you take the most sensitive subject you just toss they away carelessly sometimes you laugh sometimes it hurt you but do not you feel that it make it much more difficult to get to the bottom of your real feeling you think I find it funny that he be threaten I do you mean it when you say these thing what you go to do call the police possibly be not there law against that against threaten to kill somebody no law against tell other people what your patient tell you they do not apply to serious crime just let you know but at least you be call yourself a patient that be progress Jake so fucking condescend Somebody should really teach you a lesson what be that another threat so many threat fly around the place I be have trouble keep up what be go on with you today I be try to get you guy to listen really listen to what you be say let I ask you something have Jake threaten you before physically I do not really mean I would kill she ok it just come out how do you put it exactly he say if you leave I I will kill you do you mean that of course not I be not go to fucking kill she this week what be that suppose to mean what be you try to say and you say you be not afraid Amy but you feel disgusted yes what do that mean disgust what do you think Paul tell I what you think he would just come inside I and then say that he want to kill I what do you think disgust I about that Jake do you understand the severity of what you say that threat you realize she could get a restraining order against you do not you I think you understand what I be talk about if you leave I I will kill you we 've be concentrate on the 2nd part of that sentence but let us look at the first part of it if you leave I that say to I that you be afraid you be afraid of what will happen to you if Amy leave the fear that you would cease to exist maybe that you would die let us just leave that for a moment I would like to go back to something that we talk about early on would you like to talk about your memory of be a child be overweight I do not think about that I live my life move forward and do that need to be analyze would you say that you be a confident child not really I would say I be overweight and shy but I grow out of it and I be fine actually I be more than fine and Lenny will be fine too last week you say Jake and his friend be pathetic yes they be that maybe it be convenient for you to think of Jake as be pathetic as you say be an underachiever why perhaps because it help you avoid see your own insecurity I think that when he threaten you in bed he reveal how desperately he need you although he do it in a very scary way but that be Jake at his most vulnerable which I think you associate with he be pathetic and you do not want that so you be say that I be with an underachiever because I lack self esteem perhaps that be a way for you to avoid deal with negative feeling about yourself I want a divorce Fine I be take Lenny with I you think I be just go to let he go with you so you can turn he into some fat ass couch potato because you wanna make a change I do not want to make a change I want my life Lenny need I he should be with I he need I too fuck Amy what do you want from I what do you want from I nothing Let us just try and do this nicely Jake please what the fuck 's so nice about it I happen to know this couple who go to therapy after they have already decide to get divorce and they make a decision in the end to stay together that be not go to be the case here the only reason I mention it be because I want you to know that even when divorce become a possibility it be not always so final be you try to change our mind your mind this particular couple have problem they could not even hold a civil conversation with each other they sleep in separate bedroom why there would be an affair who cheat that be not really the point there be be no infidelity in our relationship I be not infer that Amy I guess what I be try to say be that I know what it be like you know sometimes people have to get to this precipice to understand what they really mean to each other I can not do this anymore do not you think there be still some very positive aspect to your relationship like what the murder threat the suspicion the recording the stakeout what I see it in the way that you look at each other sometimes the way you make each other laugh and you 've you 've be work on your relationship pretty steadily by come here every week be you cheat on I so why do Paul just tell we about that other couple then be that story about you no of course it be that be not the point she tell you she be cheat or not I must hear everything remember I be not cheat neither of you be open up here you be both too busy attack each other I want you to listen I want each of you to examine your own culpability here not continuously look for what be wrong with the other person and not to be so on guard all the on guard be we play poker or something I come here to save my marriage and you tell I she be have an affair he never say that so you be here to save your marriage no because I get a thing for you you be here to save your marriage you just say it now say it to Amy Jake look at your wife and tell her Jake we be constantly fight we will stay together and then we will not fight if we stay together we will not be able to stop even Paul say so what be all this therapy for I do not know what to do Paul what be I suppose to do talk to your wife say it to Amy Amy I want to tell you something Jake stop

wrong let us say I stop Laura 's therapy surely in a year 18 month when it be cool off there be no cool off period that be some bullshit some lawyer come up with no it be not a law it be beyond a code of ethic it be something you carry inside you a lot of people would disagree with this then go to they it be really tough when I be alone with her you know and she be ask I please just be honest please tell I how you feel and I can not you need to say it I love her Season 1 episode 25 subtitle Anyone Coffee Tagne Come in come in hi Gina Kate hello it be good to see you and you you 've be here before right it be year ago actually it be the Argentineans I think an institute conference yes that be right that be right you look great thank you so do you this room 's lovely thank you I do some rearrange but I be not sure how comfortable I be in it I tell myself I would write a few hour a day do Paul tell you I retire no Paul do not tell I write that be fantastic we will see yeah I mean I 've often think that I might try my hand but I would not ever dare so it be a little unusual to have ongoing session with Paul and then to see the both of you I think it might be helpful if we all decide how to approach this I think I tell you when I call that this be Kate 's suggestion you say that if I be you I would not be so sure I would agree to it why not well we 've blur some line here you and I that be true we have but I think we will be okay if we set down some guideline I be think we could meet three time re evaluate and then decide where we want to go from there now what make you decide to come here Paul you say that it be Kate 's suggestion but you be go along with it I think I tell you about Kate go to Rome and who she go with she get back and she say that it be over with that guy I guess we both have the sense of so what do we do now Kate do offer to talk about it and I could not I be too angry I know in couple therapy you try not to blame each other and I be always tell my patient that you know like it be the simple thing now here I be and I can not stop blame intellectually I get it that I be half of the equation but you say you could not talk to Kate so she have not hear any of this how you feel well I think she know that she hurt I deeply and that that I hate she could you go into that I hate you for think you be entitle to this for imply that I bring it on myself I could not shake it every minute I would get a wave of rage and loss why why loss because I really do not know if I can forgive she I 've see couple come back from this but right now I will be damn if I know how they do it anyway she get back Tuesday and I say well should I move out she say that be not what she want and you tell she I just ask he why he could not talk to I about all of this about you know everything we be go through can you answer that Paul I just say I could not I tell patient that have someone be like mourn a death who you be as a couple the image that you have of yourself it be like lose a love one you keep tell we what you tell patient but you be talk about your mourning your rage your loss you be sound very control what you want I to throw something try to strangle she I can barely look at her I be so I feel like I be fall apart I should tell you this and Kate already know I attack a patient in therapy the pilot in the middle of therapy I jump he I lose it suddenly I be on top of he I grab he I almost I almost hit he Scared the hell out of I or both of we I guess anyway my first thought afterwards be that I be react to Kate she come home during the session she knock at the door back from Rome I hear she outside the office and then what be it I should not discuss a patient with Kate here you can not discuss a patient who be spy on I he do all this research about Kate and about about my father he know that Kate be in Italy with with another man and he he throw it in my face how do he know that he make call People that have recommend I to he I do not know who they be anyway that be not the point instead of handle it properly I jump in and I lie in bed that night think do I take a month off do I take three month off maybe I should take a year off maybe I be maybe I be maybe I be all do and that be my fault what your creepy patient he be my fault as well actually it make I think how much I need you do you yeah you the kid the house I need that I need that other place where I can what Hang on that other place I be pretty sure we be suppose to be the place sorry how do this work do we take turn be that how whatever you be comfortable with it be always be very difficult for I try to describe what I be feel when you be have a baby yeah you be lie there in that hospital bed and and you do not need you do not want everything understand and share and analyze and discuss all you want to know be that you be not alone and that your husband 's hand be right there but try describe to your husband exactly what it feel like to have a child it be just impossible a friend of mine once say take an umbrella shove it up his ass open it and pull then he will know so someone stick an umbrella up your ass be what be the umbrella please do not analyze I well it be quite an analogy I be not your patient he do not get to interpret everything I say in here do he it be the same as when Paul 's at home he be not a psychotherapist here he be a man deal with a crisis in his marriage he be not a therapist at home can you go on Kate when you tell I about attack your patient I feel like that be for my benefit that you just want to show I what I have do to you by see Edward and how I have ruin your life and well your work you have not ruin my life you be the good thing in it I feel like you be put on a show Christ you know I believe you when you tell I that you want I to stop see Edward I do but when you sit here right now and you tell I that I be the good thing in your life I do not believe that and that make I so sad and the way you talk to I sometimes I mean I will ask you outright do you love I and you 've say to I you 've look at I and you 've say yes for now it be it be a joke well what the hell kind of a joke be that someone ask you if you love they you do not think that they be feel vulnerable a little insecure maybe they need some reassurance everything we say have mean that be your line but we do not mean everything that we say which be it that be pretty convenient for you be not it we do not mean what we say fine 'cause I do not believe a lot of what you say I mean Gina just point it out you say I be hurt but it sound like you be read something out of a psychology book how do you need I you do not need I I just do not believe that you know when Paul and I be first see each other I could not get over how seriously he take I I would never have that from anyone up until then I would always pretty much feel invisible and there be also there be this this exciting new idea that under everything people say there be another intention and that there be this hide meaning which just mean that everything have to be analyze so everything I say take on this importance because he be work so hard to figure I out and he be really the first person who try to understand I and I thank you and I just remember feel very grateful to he for that so it be quite a shock for I to realize that it be not about I it have fuck all to do with I really I mean it be about he because you do not actually understand I understand I be not about subtext it be not about the subconscious it be not about read some kind of an x ray it be just so clinical actually it be bad because you use it against I you think you know what I mean before I know what I mean and how be I suppose to argue with that this be what I 've get out of our marriage I got to think over thing 10 different way I can not take anything at face value nothing be simple nothing be ever simple I hate it I hate that that be what I 've become just the patient marry to the doctor for someone who be ask how this whole thing work you be do a blue ribbon job I get to give you that I do not come here for you to grade my performance Kate can you explain to Paul why you be see Edward I do not want to explain no this be exactly what I be say why do everything have to be explain sometimes I just do not know and sometimes I do not want to know Fine initially it be just excitement and adrenaline and there be this possibility when I wake up in the morning that I may do something that I have not plan or that I do not even know I be capable of and that be who I be before I meet Paul and somewhere along the way that part of I just die or I do not know it be smother the point I be try to make be why can I not just trust myself to be who I be and to just get on with it well just because you do not look it do not mean there be nothing underneath that be very profound I be sure there be still a reason why you would you please stop it I do not want your intellectual interpretation of everything I say I do it because I feel something what do you feel want I mean do you want I to say that I want you I do I want you that be why I be here so that you will believe it Paul do you feel that you need a witness to verify your love for Kate thank you thank you I be sorry but I just keep get this that image of Bill Clinton that footage of he stand in front of all those camera and wag his finger so adamantly you know I do not have sexual relation with that woman Jeez that be some comparison you know I can not assert anything strongly enough because that would be a clear indication of my insincerity but on the other hand if I do not state my feeling then that be something else Fair enough maybe there be nothing you can say to I all I know be I have to feel it in my gut to believe it and you do not no I do not do you remember do you remember what it feel like to be want to be truly desire and pursue it be not something you experience as a debate it be not an argument you need to be convince of it be just this this force that have to be that have to be reckon with what be it do I what what do I say what be go on do you know what transference be when a patient have feeling for their therapist which be in fact draw from their relationship with their parent they project quality onto the therapist that do not really exist or they can be just exaggerated and then when they find the courage the patient they reach a level of trust and they feel safe enough to express their desire for the and and so for a time the patient may experience feeling as if they be truly intend for the for the therapist do you fuck she what be that what you be tell I I be not sure be you tell I that you sleep with a patient no that be not what I be you ask I if I feel someone 's desire for I and I be say yes I have patient who 've indicate feeling for I only I be not fly off to Rome to fuck they it happen in therapy all the time have this happen to you yes it have I 've speak to Gina about it it be really valuable for I to explore my own feeling with another therapist so that they do not get in the way so that I can work through my feeling because then I do not let they get the good of I and ruin my marriage that be all right so exactly what kind of feeling have this woman provoke in you what have he say to you Kate only Paul can answer that it be okay he do not have to this be why he need to make some sort of a declaration of commitment to I this be his wag finger his I do not have sexual relation with that woman but I do not do not matter this be not nothing if this be nothing you would not have bring it up here if this be just some patient with a silly crush be you tell I you 've fall in love with some patient that you be treat you have your insurance guy you do not get to play the outraged wife here he be not an insurance guy and you know it thank you for another one of your stupid painful joke and I do not get to play outrage why do not you explain the last few week to I while you 've be run around like a goddamn martyr the whole time you be chase some patient Jesus Christ actually let I guess what be she some girl with no father figure he die abandon she when she be 12 he love that type I will tell you how old be she what type Kate girl with that particular brand of dysfunction a tasty little daddy complex so he can sweep they off their foot it be daydream that be all maybe it be a little more than daydream look I want to come clean here now you know the reason I be tell you be because I want it to stop you want to stop what you wanna stop want to fuck patient how do you stop that I do not know but we might try act like a couple who actually might want to be together maybe you can describe to Kate what you be experience with this patient like Kate do with Edward look you can not you can not compare the she sleep with somebody I allow myself a fantasy that be all I never admit it to this woman I certainly never act on it but you be die to yes I be die to but I do not anyway she quit therapy I forgot to tell you she quit therapy on Monday well good now you can fuck she without worry or lose your license or maybe now I can try to save our marriage or what be leave of it which apparently be not very much do you say Monday Monday Monday yes that be why you would not go with Max on a Monday because you do not want to miss your session with this girl be you serious Max he be have a lot of problem at school there be this conference with his teacher and Paul want to reschedule because I know something be wrong I know it and all your speechifying all your fucking sanctimony walk around like the mortally wound and the whole time Jesus make total sense now do not it a million little thing when do this start how long have this be go on how long have what be go on I tell you nothing happen I will tell you when this start it start a year ago do not it be I right Jesus what happen to we what happen to we what happen to you what happen to you Paul Edward he be nothing nothing can you say it be nothing can you say it be nothing with this what be her name I can not tell you I be not allow to I wanna know and you would well tell I Paul I be not fucking around why do not you tell I it be nothing with Laura my God I make a mistake I make a with someone I could not even be in God damn you what do you want do you want I to say it be nothing because it be not nothing that be why we be here that be why I be here fuck you Paul you can understand how she be feel she come here want to leave her affair behind and work on your marriage then she find out that you have feeling for another woman it be not the same thing Gina still you 've both be pull away from the relationship now what be leave be to fight over who be be hurt the most why why be anyone cheat look to someone else for a connection how do the marriage end up feel this empty okay this be a first step we will keep look at these reaction and what they mean where they start as I say in the beginning we should meet a few time and then decide to go on with couple therapy or or some other solution I would like to pay you for my session so far and for this one as well no we do not have to do that now five session how much Paul as you say in the beginning some line have be blur here so I have not even think about this let I figure it out and I will send you a bill what exactly be I go home with what the hell be I suppose to do with this before for our next installment Kate you can call I anytime Paul you know that and if you wanna meet before next Friday it be fine I be here Thanks Gina take care I get a choice either I accept your superiority as if you be some kind of god or I use my intelligence and do a little investigate yeah you would be real surprised the kind of information you find out from a few phone call I find a hell of a god a god whose wife be sleep around behind his back whose daughter be fuck junkie and then Laura come along and you fall in love with that crazy slut do not you fucking talk about my patient you fuck Gosh you never get the mail yet today 30 second after it arrive you be sprint down to the curb what on earth could you be expect a love letter maybe I see she Paul who who Laura I see she what do you mean you see she I be take out the trash and I see she leave I think you say she quit therapy she do quit then what the hell be she do here her father 's in the hospital and she call I and ask I if she could come in what should I have say Kate I be sorry about this crisis with your father but I 've tell my wife you 've quit therapy no you should have tell I that she come back it be not a social call if you want to find out what be go on all you have to do be ask I Kate do not you dare turn this around on I what you think you deserve she you 've earn she because of what I do to you for Christ 's sake well lucky you save by the bell yet again Subtitles Benj I be glad you come back I go against all my instinct Come on in so what be your instinct you want the truth the first be to come back here and beat the shit out of you and the second one the second one be an instinct that I learn in the in the Navy it be a survival tactic we teach to think like the enemy I be try to understand why you be all so afraid of I when you say all who would you be refer to you and the rest of the world listen I realize I threaten you and that be where your aggression come from so in what way do you threaten we you think you consider I a murderer the last couple of week I 've be try to figure out when people look in my eye look at my hand can they tell that I 've kill 42 people in the past 20 year that be 42 human being you can not hide something like that right there be something about I they 've get to see that and it scare they so do you think that there be something about you xomethe obvious that people see you probably want to strangle I the first time I walk through that door in the last session you finally get a chance to show your hatred for people like I I think maybe that be how you see yourself Alex maybe that be why you push I to such a violent place so that I would treat you the way that you think you should be treat let I remind you you attack I so what do you feel when I attack you what do I feel a slight tremor in the wing that be it so no big deal no big deal but alex I push you against the bookcase I throw coffee in your face I be just curious what happen in your body what be go through your head hold on I just realize something you have not apologize yet before anything else you be suppose to say I apologize I be sorry it will never happen again I 've be here five minute and I get nothing from you you be right you be absolutely right I apologize it should not have happen but I feel very offended by what you say offend no that be not part of the deal no I can say whatever the hell I want in here that be the point of go to a shrink you want I to censor every sentence or keep wonder if what I say might hurt you it be still like a relationship alex there be boundary I feel that you be out to hurt I and I be very hurt what offend you so much it be all true be not it well you invade my privacy you talk about the people I love and you speak about they with contempt and with what I feel be deliberate cruelty so I guess my therapy be over now right that be not what I say alex no but it be what you think you be tired of take the shit I give you all the time and actually I do not blame you if I be you I would have get rid of I a long time ago so be that why you say those thing in the hope that I would what run away kick you out it be not go to happen Alex you guy really do live in a bubble you live in this world you do not it be all theory you do not engage you what Finish that think what be you go to say no I just remember this dream I have I be on the ground and I be drive this little car on the iraqi international airport highway they call it the highway to hell and all of a sudden I be in Baghdad in this traffic jam above my head I see this enemy plane it be a Czech mig I be not sure what it be exactly but this mig be be follow by one of our jet an f 16 everyone be look up watch and I say to myself why be not he shoot why do not he blow he out of the sky now maybe he be afraid all the debris will fall on the people below but I know in the dream the order be to take that fucker down so they be fly real close like this and maneuver and our guy do not launch and the enemy plane be get away and it be drive I crazy I mean shit he be on his way to our base camp all the people on the ground below they be waitg for he to take the mig down and they be bloodthirsty and it do not happen they just fly away and that be it do you think you would have do well if you have be up there Shit any pilot worth his salt would have blow that asshole to kingdom come and who be the pilot maybe it be I I do not know you be the one who can not shoot why not I do not know maybe because the other guy the other pilot be not that dangerous I know that he be only what he be only what who be sit in the plane who be sit in the enemy plane that you refuse to shoot down I do not know who be there I do not know who be the enemy alex hey stop man Jeez when you want to pressure you pressure I do not know who be my enemy you be that how it feel no it be not you you be not there maybe it be my father what what you know the answer but you do not wanna you want I to come up with it no it be just a dream I be just help you to look at it that be all okay well then you must have some chart or something around here tell you what every part of a dream represent in reality no not really sometimes a number of image can represent the same thing so it be I that be what you be say right that I be the enemy pilot I be my own enemy look it be not clear actually that he be even an enemy it be not that he do not have identification mark on the plane I be just not familiar with it I do not know for sure but he be try to get away from you what do you think of this guy this pilot this flee pilot I think he be a fucking coward oh yeah what else he be not a man he be run away like a pussy instead of turn around stand his ground and fighting I be die to come up to that pitiful fucker and shove an air to air missile up his rear burner what be you think just say it you think I be a faggot that would go right along with all my father 's theory only girl and fag see a shrink so what if I be a fag you say it very clearly before do I well maybe you do not say it but you 've be lead I there I have you be die to say it be a homosexual dream I be tail he I see fire come out of his back burner I be wanna shove my it all fit do not it even daniel never suspect it that could explain a lot of thing what thing Laura for instance that lousy fuck we have the first time and Michaela the fact that I be suddenly not attract to she anymore we see each other this week at a restaurant and she want I to come back home and think it would be well if we talk to each other in person she be drive hard man just on a mission just on the attack she want we to start off by get a room asap there be that hotel above the restaurant I say I could not I could not I tell she I have somewhere to be that we would do it another time you know I really do have something else to do that night I be suppose to go with daniel and his his partner Sean to a party you understand this amazing woman want to fuck the shit out of I in a 5 star hotel and instead I be go to Georgetown with these two fag do you understand that and why do you think you would rather spend time with they Everything be a joke with they I do not know if you be familiar with their world but their humor be in see everything from the outside like they be not a part of it like like they be above it and by they you mean homosexual yeah especially Sean 's crowd I mean he be genuinely queer he be not the kind that be in conflict with himself I mean he be this Sean be immune to tension he be happy he be happy all the time he just have no subconscious everything be right out in the open be that something that be that something that you envy they do not pressure I they give you shit to provoke you and they love that shit but you know Sean ask I why do you always desperately try to please everybody all the time God and country everybody but it be bullshit with they they do not care they really do not care they do not demand of I to be anything extra that night we get home about 4 00 a m and daniel go to the bedroom Sean and I stay out in the livin room he get a dvd some gay porn thing look I do not know if he be try to provoke I or what he even suggest afterwards that I would be ready for bed he say it jokingly but he be not play he tell I once I do not know the meaning of life until I got fuck in the ass I once read that psychologically water symbolize emotion I wonder what your collection of boat say about you I do not know maybe that I be an emotional wreck maybe you want to go out to sea but you do not you mean that I want to express my feeling but I can not my father 's a lifetime democrat a war protester and I know that if I join the navy it would piss he off so fuck it I go r o t C in high school and then I get my wing he could not tell I shit I remember the first time you be here you say that that you do not choose to be a pilot that life choose it for you yeah but I do not know about that I think maybe you do choose that path and that you do it to defy your father he want I to be hard there be nothing hard than a topgun grad yeah but that be still a reaction to he it be not your desire I do not think you be in touch with what you really want what I really want what be you say what I really want be to be something else Gay have you ever be attract to man alex ever have a sexual fantasy about a man I have never no so when you say the word gay what do you mean by that I do not know do not take I there man this say what you think all the time that be gay those guy they have no filter what else talk about your feeling all the time so what you do here for example the way you interact with I your father say he say that anybody who go to a shrink be a be a fag how do you get on with your dad when you be a kid I remember as a kid my father take I to a church this be the riverside church up in Harlem and back in those day I live kind of a double life during the week I go to this all boy private school it be elite the fine teacher it be the good right right it be also a totally sheltered environment so on the weekend my dad would take I to all these real rough ghetto area to place where he volunteer his time and money he want to make sure that I know how lucky I be to live my little soft cushy life I dread those fucking weekend hate they it be like he be always try to test I anyway the riverside church have this athletic program that my dad support he need to talk to the guy that run the place so they tell I you wait outside shoot some basket so it be early and the court be desert and it be a bad area but long story short this kid come up he be about I do not know he be 14 and he beat the hell out of I he kick I in the head a few time he have this box cutter I think he be go to slice my face but he wind up take some little bullshit chain I have and my sneaker he take my sneaker take my sock and even take this little half full pack of chew gum and I go upstairs and my dad see I and he see I just get my ass kick that I get no sneaker no sock and I start to tell he what happen and I start cry so my dad slap the shit out of I sound like a whip crack and he make I walk around barefoot for the whole rest of the day just to teach I a lesson what age be you 11 the next weekend he take I to a gym to meet up with this guy name tom and tom say that there be two type of martial art one be the kind that be a physical and spiritual discipline a way of life the second type be where you learn to fight and this here be a fight gym you get a problem with that I do not have a problem with it 'cause I do not want anybody to ever put their hand on I like that ever again so I come four day a week after school and I learn and I learn fast and the next time some kid pick on I I beat his face to a pulp you could not even recognize he 'cause see fear be like fire if you master it then it can heat your house cook your food but if it get the good of you it can burn you it can destroy you you control your fear you control your fear you control your life excuse I be you allright yeah I do not think I can do this do what this therapy I it that be just it be too much for I I think I need a break of a few week or month just do not think it be lead anywhere that be all it be not lead anywhere where do you want it to lead Alex Someplace where I feel less shitty about myself so at least where I could find some balance in my life some place sane I miss fly somehow everything be just much simple up there I can focus on something the only thing you have to think about be the mission it be quiet be it possible to get that feeling on the ground do you think I do not know you know I get a call from my wing commander he be he be to know how I be do he be he be try to figure out if I be ready for active duty you know he say it be all sort of test Alex it be a long process do you think you be ready for that Alex what do you think I do not think you be ready maybe I can discuss it with Michaela I do not think Sean and Daniel would be much help 'cause they Gays do not really understand military or vice versa Alex

meeting and so I keep you post if I can not come newt week sure thank previously on in Treatment I feel sorry for the book up there I be go back to training next week for the Olympics and if you try

and stuff as you build up muscle you be suppose to gain weight because muscle weigh more than fat I do not know when I be not here do you just bury your head under a rock or something so these pound that I 've put on they could be muscle really do you go to the gym occasionally you have to do it consistently if you wanna see result every day Weights and cardio no pain no gain guy you be right you can not see muscle if it be bury under fat so you have to reduce your sugar and carb intake okay coach sorry no I appreciate the tip thank anyway if you build muscle you will gain weight unless of course you be a physiological freak like I since I 've start lift weight I 've lose two pound which be like anatomically impossible now Cy will not let I lift until I gain it back it be bullshit

that your dad be in Miami we be back to that so he still do not know about your attempt suicide I do not wanna talk about this be it something you wanna keep a secret from he it be not a fucking secret how can it be a secret if that be all you and my mom and everyone else can talk about what be you think about nothing I 've a test tomorrow I have to study for and I miss my dentist appointment

be it nutrition be it enjoyment what it be the enemy it be just what happen to gymnast why do not you tell I your father be in Miami why be it a secret it be not a fucking secret I just do not think I need to bother he with every boring detail of my life your attempt suicide be a boring detail it be not a suicide attempt I be just test remember somebody around here have that theory I think yeah that ring a bell he would put it together and decide that it be all your fault he already think you be a quack remember it be well for you if he do not know he will never let I come back here well for you or for I which of we would have to stay away from therapy do you think if he know he would be devastate he be the most important person to I in this whole world I do not ever wanna hurt he why can not you just let it go forget it this be such a waste of time you try to kill yourself and you do not want to tell the most important person in your world he have a life somebody have to we can not all go around like walking corpse it be not his fault that I take those pill I be not say it be his fault I be just try to figure out why you be so ready to leave the planet and not tell he what be up your ass be you angry at he for something I be not angry at he be you hide something from I get off my back be we do we have a little time leave what you 've never want to end a session early before in our first session you mention those book up there I think it be because you identify with they you say they be cold and lonely on the top shelf and then I look at they more closely and I realize that one of they have some of your father 's photograph in it you say that your dad love the way that you look and that if you be not a gymnast that you could be a model I guess model be the people that he that he choose to surround himself with the people he like they be the people he fuck I would not say he like they I know that in our culture thin model be sexualize but I 've always find that really strange because in classical art and literature eating be often use as a metaphor for sex they both conjure up desire hunger craving inside we where be you go Sophie Sophie try to stay here please try not to disappear eat shit Paul why be you do this I think you be try to help why do the book provoke such a strong reaction in you what you be do be sick it be fucking sick it be pervert I will never forgive you for this why because I be make you uncomfortable I be ask you to think about thing that you do not want to talk about if I want to talk about my father 's book I would have tell you it be right there what about all that crap about a patient decide what we talk about that you take thing at my speed that I control the wheel and all that you be so full of shit but you have be drive what we talk about here you may not realize it but you have the very first thing that you want to talk about be those book up there what be you say that you jerk off to my father 's photograph that you open up that book and jerk off all over those slut you keep suggest somebody be abuse I you be abuse I that be what you people love most of all be not it a good mindfuck to take the one good thing in somebody 's life and somehow fuck it up just like my father say shut the fuck up about he how could you how could you you be just like everybody else like who Sophie please do not go why do you do that you mean why do I take the book down because I have to I have to put the book on the table and there be really no graceful way of do it I think this book be connect to your wound and open a wound Sophie be frightening it be painful and it be ugly you imply that I have be sexually abuse be that what you hear I never say anything like that this book with the with the naked model you want I to see that you know what I think I think you be angry I think you 've get great anger towards your father you say early on that you wish that you could slip through the crack when you want to but you do not do that when you be in trouble not really your mind try to but your body your body stay here you let other do thing to you because you 've convince yourself that that you be not really there that it be not happen to you that it be not hurt you I be sure this week you will exercise like a fiend and not because you be an olympic hopeful but because I know that after this session you be go to want to regain control but I want you to remember something Sophie when you go up onto that beam that be the place where you detach that be where you go to feel safe all I want you to know be you do not have to go there there be other place where you can feel safe in here in this room it be one of those place previously on in Treatment he threaten to kill I you be smile I 've have patient

know that I be here and it be fine for he to know everything that we talk about I have to tell you I be offend outside just now I know I be an adult and you have thing that I do not need to see or hear but I feel like a scold child it never mind it be crazy it be not you it be I I do not know what be get into I but I feel a little embarrassed because I have already stand up and you suddenly stop I I certainly apologize I wonder if there be patient that you would 've let in even if they arrive early patient you have a different relationship with I know Jake and I be not easy and I just think you must have easy patient more interesting patient patient that be more fun that you like more be my enjoyment of our session important to you maybe and so it would bother you if I do not enjoy they maybe not forget it you say that Jake and you be not easy as patient how would you define yourself as a patient Bad just kid I would not trade place with anyone it just I do not know have you ever think about change place with anybody perhaps who would you like to trade with what kind of a patient would you like to be maybe I want you to be different I different how I do not know Harrison Ford that be a bit of a stretch for I but so how would Dr Harrison Ford behave if you be early for a session who say I would be see he for therapy he certainly would not make I wait outside like a naughty schoolgirl so you feel that be like some kind of rejection ok so why do not you tell I what be be happen since I see you last week everything be fine like I tell you you say that you and Jake be seemingly in love what do that mean seemingly in love I say that do not I typical everything be fine why be that typical today he be meet a guy that might commission some music from he you make it

know the kind of sex we use to have I could not even tell my girlfriend they would not have believe I or else they would call social service and have Jake arrest now it be like he be have a lobotomy or like he be brain dead only he be not brain dead he be just a terrible fuck it be your fault it be my fault the man in touch with himself God might be well if he knock I around a bit you really think that would be well I do not know maybe I deserve it how do you like my necklace by the way I think it be it be very nice it be a gift from Jake a Bulgari from Jake it be from Ben do you remember Ben my boss I tell Jake that I would be go back to the office tonight because I have a conference call with some client in Bali I also tell he that Ben be travel but the truth be Ben be pick I up from here and we be not go back to the office where be you go wherever the evening take we what do you think of that what dinner with your boss it will not be dinner it might include dinner but there be no stop the rest of it why can not it be stop do you want I to stop it it will not do any good I know it will happen Ben and I be inevitable the minute that the thought enter my head it be as if somebody have trigger a tick time bomb nothing will stop it no matter how many bomb expert I bring in you can not stop it no one can so who trigger the time bomb the lousy sex I be in the shower by the way it be the first time I 've be in a hurry to get in the shower after fucking Jake and it dawn on I that no matter what I do Something'll happen with he so be you punish Jake for the bad sex or because of this new this new tenderness this new Attentiveness that he be show why be I do this why can not I stop you have not do anything yet but he will be here in a minute do you like this guy he be a prick but it be it be like I need you need what the Employee of the Month award the Office Slut award I would like to go back to something that we touch on last week you you say that you be that you be overweight when you be a child that really capture your imagination do not it I think it be something that we should talk about I know you say it do not bother you but you do say something about child be cruel well I be fat not overweight fat my sister be the overweight one I be kid my sister 's gorgeous it be really hard for I to believe that you actually ever be this overweight kid it be like you 've erase that girl right after my father die I decide to stop eat it be like I wake up 45 pound thin how do you wake up 45 pound thin I just do not eat and I feel like it be the one thing that I could control in that house some day I would just have one cracker all day long and I would feel my stomach get flat and I would have this wonderful sense of light headedness this wonderful high what do not matter no go on finish the thought my father be a lovely man Sweet charm I love he very much and your mother my mother 's dead you know the joke about the farmer with the two cow the one cow give milk and the other one do not never mind anyway my dad die when I be 13 my mother 's rather like Cinderella 's stepmother and my sister be like the evil stepsister once when I be 13 my parent come back from Milan with two identical dress very very beautiful one a red one for Maria my sister and a blue one for I Mine of course do not fit I so my mother tell she to switch with I because she be old and hers be slightly big she of course do not want to so she start scream and say she want the red dress it be not her fault that I be so fat and finally she throw the dress at I and say then take it fatso so I start cry and my mother say what be you cry for now you should be glad your sister 's dress fit you and that she agree to trade dress you should thank she later I hear my parent argue and my dad say to my mom why do not you just get they the same color dress and my mother start whisper she say I can not buy her red she I could not hear she properly then she seem like she say she look like a watermelon in it or she would look like a fire truck in it or she would look like a beach ball or I could not hear what she say so do you ever talk to your dad about what you might have hear no I never get a chance so could you have talk to your mom about it why not she would say that I be make thing up that be what she say to most of my complaint she use to call I the fabricator I have a very vivid imagination I use to make thing up once I tell she that I see my sister kiss the gardener behind the house she go ballistic she nearly have a coronary you know once Maria have a blind date and before he get there she say let us play a trick on he and she tell I to open the door and pretend that I be she and she would watch from the room next door and if she do not like he she would not come out and I could pretend that I be sick and cancel the date so when I open the door he be really cute and I think she would be interested in he so I keep talk to he and pretend to be she and chat away she finally come out from the other room and say hi I be Maria and he be completely confused and I be utterly humiliate I go so red actually I still get embarrassed when I think about it today and and she tell he I be just check out her date for she and that at it be all just a joke the thing be I do not get the joke I mean not till year later I do not realize till then that all she really want be to see the look of relief on his face when he realize that she be his date not I the fatso Hilarious right do not worry I get back at her year later I meet he at college and I fuck his brain out I tell she that he do not remember she and I would have to remind he and she say whatever I dump he after two date anyway and I say he tell I he dump you because you smell like tuna and be that true so really you settle that account in bed I do indeed and now you be settle another account in bed with Jake this time what because he be become too sensitive for you so let I make sure I have this right your father die when you be 13 you must have be pretty devastate I be he be a lovely man he be affectionate and great physically affectionate he would come into our room at night when we be sleep and kiss we on the eye and then I would half wake up I would smell his aftershave and know that he be there and then he would whisper in my ear that he love I and he would hold my face in his hand he have these huge hand like a construction worker and he be just so Tender and lovely and yet when Jake be tender and he express his love through tenderness it make you angry you say it be disgusting do you think that might be because it scare you you 've learn you can not trust people who express themselves tenderly that they seem weak that they be go to abandon you die and leave you behind and so in order to avoid that you provoke Jake you make he angry you create these situation that bring out the bad in he and he treat you badly Ben'll be here any minute what should I do do you really want I to give you permission to have sex with your boss once just once just tell I it be not that bad I think it might be that bad but you will explain he if he find out can you make sense of it for he and what exactly do you want I to tell he that I be fuck up that I can not help myself that it be big than I tell he that I be fuck up so even if he forgive you do you think that you can forgive yourself I always forgive myself that be my problem I I just close my eye before I go to sleep at night and I ask God for forgiveness and I forgive myself for everything even the unforgivable thing I never get punish you think that sex with Reeves will go unpunished who be go to punish I maybe you 've already start to punish yourself do you really think that sleep with Reeves be go to bring back the good old reliable angry control Jake the one who fight you and threaten you I do not know and now that he be express his love through tenderness do you feel that you deserve his love it be not love it be neediness it be weakness it be unbearable so it be only love if he chase you stalk you tape you be jealous of you be that it I think you need to look at this a little more carefully Amy it be like it be happen already but it have not you still have a choice nothing happen without you I have to go to the bathroom hi it be Jake leave a message Hey Jake it be I it be nothing important I just think I might catch you I just want to hear your voice how be you okay I make we some tea give I your cell Leave leave the ringer on that be kind of the point we 've be wait for Rosie to check in all day she sleep over at a friend 's house and she have not check in yet at least that be what she say but Lord know it be not the first time in history that a teenager say she be go to stay at a friend 's and then she end up somewhere else so where be she do you think I be withhold information be you Season 1 Episode 30 subtitle Anyone Coffee Tagne anyway Sarah 's parent be away and and Rosie 's not answer her phone so it be a little convenient do not this happen a few week ago but this time she be be go for 24 hour I mean she be at that age be not she that make it okay no I do not say that Kate do not trust she when she say she be stay with a friend that be the cause for concern I be pretty concerned hence the two phone lay out when do you last talk to her yesterday when I be at work I do not know if Paul tell you but I run a shelter for batter woman and it be also a center for youth at risk and Rosie volunteer there about 4 time a week she tell I she would be there and then go to Sarah 's but she do say it in her responsible voice which should 've tip I off anyway Sarah 's parent be in Mexico and I do not know maybe the girl drive off somewhere after school Sarah 's get a car and Rosie be probably afraid to tell we because you might flip out and I would flip out who know I do not know what kind of work do Rosie do at the center Whatever be need basically from write up schedule to run errand she sit in on interview sometimes just so she can get a sense of how we evaluate people how much trouble they may be in and how much help they may need four time a week it be a commitment for a 16 year old kid 17 year old next month it be interesting because when Rosie 's volunteering all of a sudden she be an adult she be a bear social worker always have be ever since she be a kid how do she show that when she be young she be always the mediator with her friend on the playground you know organize make it peace that kind of thing even her teacher remark on it and you hear this where I do not I do not really recall you at too many parent teacher conference I be on the PTA board at Arlington remember Paul I mean come on you go twice do you ever see Rosie take on this mediator role at home what she mean be be Rosie our social worker see Gina can not conceive of a child be bear with an intrinsic desire to help other people without it be a cope mechanism for for something else Right Rosie 's always be interested in be of service and that be something we encourage do we I encourage it I think it be great I think it be incredible that she volunteer I talk to she about everything she see down at the center and it be certainly not her responsibility to deal with any of the hardcore case or anything like that I make sure that she be not in over her head I tell she who be who and what be go on and I do I agree with you I think four time a week be a little too much you know there might be a little more to it for Rosie than a desire to help what Gina be say be that Rosie might be work around at risk youth because she be distress herself Paul do you really think Kate and I need an interpreter sorry when do she start volunteer it be what about six month ago and I be thrill at first because it mean she be spend less time at the mall with her friend but I be think she may need more of that what more time at the mall no you know what I mean just do stupid teenager stuff why should she be so concerned with the world 's problem at her age I do not think that be what Gina 's say she be say that Rosie be draw to the place because she be try to say something to we but that we be oblivious can I speak for myself it be not what you be try to get at it be not for you to say that sorry you know even if Rosie have a desire or a vocation to help other people I be wonder how much of that do you think a 17 year old kid need 16 she be still 16 16 so yes Paul she may be try to shine a light on something okay that be it I be go to try she again since apparently her volunteering be a cry for help thank god it be ring I be go to kill you where the hell have you no because we have let I talk to she since when do that happen let I talk to her please when you sleep away you be suppose to call first thing in the morning that be the agreement and you know it no we will discuss this at home no because we be out we be talk to someone an an accountant no you do not know he her no he be sit right here and he be look none too pleased about any of this we will talk at home Rosie all right so I be not allow to speak to her she claim she get to Sarah 's late last night they be late for school this morning and get this she do not realize her phone be off which be a little like I not realize my head 's on fire but she be not stay there again okay well you tell she that if I be Gina I would ask why now why now what well if a couple come to I with this problem I would say why be she choose to act out now that be what you would ask really maybe you should call that couple ask they and then get back to I she be do this on purpose it be obvious she sense a conflict between we and she be turn it around so that she be give we a taste of what it be like to worry about her she be a teenager there be not some master plan involve here this be just how teenage girl be right I mean it be just how they think or do not think in this case no Kate it be not conscious but it be work Rosie vanishe and you become function parent you be united in your concern for her do you think that Rosie sense the conflict between you I think we 've be pretty good about pretend we 've actually get pretty skilled at that so why now as Paul ask why now do something happen what do you think she be react to I would say it be more tense actually more tense Kate run into Laura I do not run into her I see she as she be leave the house the house my office his office the house my home whatever it be a little blurred be not it do not you say she stop therapy he do say that do not he her father be hospitalize and she ask I if she could come by she be pretty upset please please do not do that what describe she like she be this fragile little thing like she be some poor lose soul she be not I see she how do she seem to you she be Tammy Kent what who be Tammy Kent how be she Tammy Kent you know exactly what I be talk about may I ask who this be this be a girl that Paul be in love with when we first meet a long time ago whatever they be exactly the same type no they be not yes they be and he make Laura out to be this fragile little girl and I be tell you what I see be this highly sexual woman wear stiletto at ten in the morning I do not describe she like that if you form an image no but you let I think she be one of your fatherless walking wound no you rush to that conclusion yourself and what he also forget to mention be that she be stunningly beautiful and very young but that be no surprise be it Jesus Christ it be the goddamn history of the world leave your middle aged wife and God be not it a little embarrassing for you that you 've turn out to be like every third man I mean you 've spend your entire life study the human condition and now you be just follow your dick around like a caveman this woman Laura she be get this this spoil aloof and calculate look and she have this uh this air of self confidence that be quite obviously bullshit because if anything real ever happen to her she would not know what to do she be so fake and all this you see while you be take out the trash yes that be right just by look at she like it or not everything be communicate another one of your line and you just happen to be there as she be do not keep do that you be make I out to look like I be some loose cannon demente wife if she be all that spoil and a fake why be you so threaten by she because my husband be in love with she and because she be the kind of woman who always get her man a woman like that have always be his fantasy gorgeous self center unattainable that be what I want it be it be good to know that you do not see yourself that way so you be not Paul 's fantasy no I be not yet he marry you I guess he get a raw deal do not he he want the trophy wife and he got stick with a homemaker I be just a good mom pretty boring come on Kate listen to yourself you be completely invalidate your your sexuality for a start I think we both know that you could 've do well if you would want to I fall in love with you not just because you be beautiful and sexy but because because of your strength her strength she be she be ground and honest and dependable I need that I think we both need that not anymore I do not need you anymore I need you I 've always love you want you and need you but not like Laura you never ever want I like that how can you say that you keep jump to these conclusion that make no Kate you say you do not need Paul anymore can you talk about that a little I do not need he like I use to not like I think I need he I do not know maybe I do not even need a partner at all I mean would I like one yeah of course but it would be awfully nice if that person be a bit more present and available but do I need it if that be the question no I think I 've learn to live without it what kind of partner could you see yourself with I do not know I mean you know my frame of reference for two and a half decade have be Paul so our friend their husband what the hell do I know about what they be really like what go on behind closed door I mean do we know any couple really it be not like I sit around daydream about it or I have some fantastic flight of fancy about some perfect man or I could be with a serial killer as long as he tell I about his damn day and it be not just about be want I know that be what I say last week and want be good I mean of course everybody want that but I just want to be a part of something it do not have to be big and it do not have to be grand but I will tell you something about woman like Laura it they be just all about sex you know that be their currency that be not the actual sex itself that be not what I be say it be sex as this thing that control that determine the distance between she and someone else and I can not compete with that Laura be not a sexual object for Paul their relationship be not base on that it be more chaste she be not his sexual fantasy it be not about lust the real threat be that he may actually have fall in love with her you know you say you be draw to he you marry he because you admire he because he pay such deep attention to you you be grateful that you feel you be interesting that dynamic of patient therapist be satisfy to both of you at that point but I think Jesus please let I do my job here your job of what rush to conclusion eventually Kate you feel that it be not satisfy for you you 've outgrow that dependency you 've outgrow that part of your marriage you say you do not need Paul anymore you do not need to be take care of and Paul may have sense this you be drift away from under his wing and suddenly he find himself confuse about his feeling for a patient Laura be dependent on Paul he be her therapist her eld her guide Dependency define that relationship I see so she be not my groupie anymore so I find somebody to to replace she be that your theory nice one Gina see your problem be you think it be impossible to fall in love with a patient without some kind of pathology surround the whole thing you be try to redefine yourself in your marriage to see yourself not as a dependant but as an equal do you think you can do that and stay with Paul Gina for fuck 's sake if I be this narcissistic monster that you be talk about who have to be admire and

which be where you establish your pawn in the center of the board then he move and I counter and he move again I counter again and we be move along at this real nice clip and I think I be hold my own and then I will never forget it he look up suddenly and it be like a shadow fall over his face and he stand up from the table and he say I be not feel well I do not want to play he go up to his bedroom I follow he up the stair I knock on the door he do not answer I crack the door open and I see he he be sit at his desk he be get his back to I I do not know if he hear I I be about to say

moment my father walk into that room this guy be go to kill he and I do not know how to stop it it be awful what do the man look like I do not remember have you be in this hotel room before no what be it like can you describe it it be dark Dark wood dark furniture sort of like a cave or a tunnel yeah like a tunnel but it be not scary you could see light at both end like where the tunnel start and where it end I remember look back and forth try to figure out which way be the entrance and which be the exit anything else you remember the man be wear shoe like yours not those shoe the black one that you usually wear like my other one not like your other shoe they be your shoe so this serial killer be wear my shoe it be you in the hotel room you be wait to kill my father do I tell you why I be go to kill he do your father ever show up no we just sit there we make small talk and the whole time I be try to figure out how to get out of there to call somebody or something do you remember what this small talk be about I do not I be not sure something about it make perfect sense do not it you be always insinuate shit about he that he be the mystery man that there be some big secret that he be the person who really fuck I up but the joke be on you because there be nothing there my father do not cross the line or break any rule or any of that crap you love to throw around you be so wrong it be ridiculous my father have always be there for I his work and I be the only important thing in his life how do you feel about his photograph they be beautiful if you look at they with an open mind which of course you can not he love the human form he believe the body can be the perfect expression of every human emotion and experience be that how he speak about his work what be you say Paul that I can not form an opinion of my own father 's work you think I be quote he you know he say a lot of shrink be fail artist or writer maybe you be jealous of he he travel around the world he work with model meanwhile you be trap in your cell with fuck up like I oh I would take a fuck up like you any day over one of those supermodel no you would not shut up yes I would it be true so how be that for you your father be constantly surround by beautiful woman when you be a kid he be an artist it be his job besides nudity be totally normal in my house I got use to it Nudity Nude model the female form it be like draw class 101 Paul an artist must work from the pure inspiration his studio be at home so there be a lot of model walk around naked it be not a big deal we be cool so this be normal for you to be expose to adult be naked yeah expose Ooh nudity how scary breast Terrifying so be you ever naked around the house of course not look at your face you think that be my big secret I see my father naked and now I be scarred for life be not that kind of a cliche so your father be naked and your mother as well why be you laugh my mother always wear her clothe even in the shower but she be perfectly comfortable with the model she be clueless about the whole thing sorry I be have a difficult time follow this I think you say that people be naked all the time okay not all the time a lot of the time during the day while my mother be at work so would you say that your father be hide it from her I would say she be a fucking idiot who could not see what be right in front of her they be have sex who be have sex Sophie my dad with the model du jour how do you know I see they I come home from school early one day the mom who drive carpool that day have to pick we up early I walk into my parent ' bedroom and my father be there with a model do your father know that you see oh yeah he get up he come over to I and just look at I I say something like I think the model only come at fix time and what do he say I do not remember something like you be suppose to be at school and then he shut the door and lock it I remember the sound of the latch slide how old be you I do not know Seven and a half why be you be so dramatic it be no big deal my father be an artist they do not live like other people do they have to be in touch with they have to crap on conventional thing in order to create do you say it to your mother no do your father tell you not to no but you walk away from the door know you be not suppose to say anything that you have a secret maybe that be when the idea of telepathy between you and your dad begin this idea that you can understand each other without word that be your big theory after all your insinuation pretty lame you keep accuse I you keep suggest that somebody cross the line with I that I do not have the ability to say no you be say that what that I 've be sexually abuse you think that be the secret I be look for well be not you no I be not no right do you think something happen to you be you listen to I I tell you nothing happen you be the one who keep imply I do not think you be sexually abuse Sophie Good now we can finally stop talk about that why do not you ever tell your mother what you see do not be an idiot so this secret have be there between you and she all these year so what I barely speak to the woman anyway you do not think there be any connection between those two thing I do not speak to she because she be pathetic she be a moron she could not see what be right in front of her face sometimes I think she be still wait for he like Santa Claus or something she would never admit it but it be so obvious it be pathetic but if you tell she she might not be wait for he any long it be not my job to make her face reality I be the child she be suppose to be smart than I you know she sit there day after day wait for he to come to his sense I want to scream at she he do not give a fuck about you you be stupid you be useless just get the fuck up of your clueless ass and get a life why do not you tell she about his affair it be not my fucking job maybe you do not tell she because you be afraid maybe you be afraid they would separate and it would be your fault just like you think that you have ruin Cy and Darlene 's marriage why do not you tell your mother after they divorce what be I suppose to do rub her face in it you be angry she could not see that yes fuck yes in all the week that we 've be in therapy you 've never once allow yourself to be angry at your father it be never even be a possibility for you why do you think that be See I think that your father make you his accomplice he burden you with this secret way too heavy for any child to carry and he drive this wedge between you and your mother with this secret maybe you be afraid to get angry at he because if you do you would lose he for good maybe you never tell your mother because part of you still hope that they be go to get back together again I know that be never go to happen I be not an idiot would not have to be to believe that I know plenty of grownup whose parent have separate 20 30 year who have even die they still hope in their heart of heart that their mother and father still share a bed in heaven he would not be a good husband if he come back he would just leave she again and you what he leave you too do not he no he just move out he be still my dad of course he be still your dad but he do literally leave you do not he he move away he be not around he do not even know whether you be dead or alive he be work why can not you let yourself be angry at he why should I be angry at he she be the one who who piss I off why because she be pathetic and annoying and and she be always around I can understand why you might be angry at she too though 'cause you feel she do not protect you from what be go on at home but she be also a rock she be incredibly patient she be persistent she be not go anywhere she be

Amy it be a mistake my stomach ache how convenient Amy get these perfectly time stomachache they be like her secret weapon would you like some tea what do it feel like do it it feel like she be have a conversation she would rather not have I be ask Amy it feel like my stomach be cramp the classic stomach cramp you see it be just vague enough to be completely untreatable be it something that you 've have before I have the first one when my father die but a thousand time bad than this you know I remember I could not stand up I be lie curl up on the pavement with tear stream out of my eye and I could not move where be this outside an ice cream store that be where he die he take I for an ice cream my mother be in a horrible mood and I go to my dad 's office and say I wanna run away and he say that be okay I wanna run away too but let us stop first and get an ice cream and I know what he be do but I do not care I just want to get out of the house and spend time with my dad we sit down on the curb outside the store eat our ice cream cone and we be race to see who could finish first and I win so I ask he for money to buy another cone and I go back inside and a car swing into the parking lot and plow right into he one minute he be sit there and the next he be dead do you see it happen yes it happen and then all of a sudden there be this wave of pain through my stomach it fold I over I have to lie down on the pavement I could not even stand up and there be people stare at I someone come over and try to touch I to help I and I just start scream the pain be so great and the paramedic arrive with two stretcher they put my father on one and I on the other and they take I to the hospital and my father to the morgue I do not think my mother ever forgave I forgave you for what it be okay it be not your fault Shut up you do not know what you be talk about what no you be just a kid stop it you do not know you do not know anything you do not know I at all I 've do terrible thing it be an accident really terrible thing I have sex with Ben I do not even enjoy it feel like a whore he pick I up from here last week and we go out drink and then we go back to the office and fuck on the floor everyone have go he keep say disgusting thing degrade thing and while I be do it I be ask myself why be I do this but I could not stop when we finish he say lock up I be tired and he walk out I sit alone for two hour drinking coffee thinking about what I should do and I plan to come home and tell you and quit my job the next day but in the cab on the way home I realize I could not tell you you be laugh apparently so how can you be laugh I do not know what be he do maybe he be relieve yeah I think that be it that be exactly it I be relieve this be it be always be my bad nightmare what I be scared of the most and now it be happen and I feel like I feel like this huge weight have be lift off my shoulder it be go I feel bad for you and sad I think it be sad it be really sad that a woman whose husband break down before her tell she he can not live without she go out and fuck someone else and hurt herself so bad I think that be sad do you think it be relate your telling Amy that you love she and her cheat on you it seem pretty obvious to I but what be surprising I Paul be and maybe I be just in shock be that I do not feel jealous I do not feel jealous or angry my God I think I be really be outstanding here guy I mean be anyone else as impressed with I as I be I 've imagine this over and over again and I can tell you that I 've never I can tell you that I 've never behave like such a gentleman I just I feel sad for she for we he be right about the connection between what happen with Ben and what happen here from the moment Jake break down I 've be feel like I be go to lose control I feel awful say something how many time do this happen just once it will not happen again why do I do this maybe you 've always want to make Jake angry because because you do not trust his tenderness and because there be something deep inside you that want to be punish but Jake have be work hard lately to be more patient to be more supportive and he be no long give you what you need in that way and now that Jake have stop punish you you 've start to punish yourself by have sex with somebody that as you say yourself you find repulsive you say that after your father die your mother never forgave you maybe you 've never forgive yourself Amy for leave your father on the curb while you go to get an ice cream maybe you feel that if you degrade yourself enough maybe someday somebody will forgive you for for everything what do you see in I how could you possibly be with I I love you Loved that be it I deserve it you can hit I if you like no you can you can hit I I do not want to hit you Ame we have to pick up Lenny there be still time I really wanna see he no do not go do not go it be too early and the class do not finish until 7 00 just do not go please let us just sit here let us just sit here with Paul Let us just be quiet for a minute will he forgive I why do not you ask he previously on in Treatment if there be someone who do not know the meaning of guilt it be my father Mid ' 50 right Jim Crow Oklahoma this mob with hood attack his house so my father take the family they run downstairs to the the boiler room to the basement my grandfather his father be very sick dying of lung cancer he have this hacking cough my father put his hand over his father 's mouth and nose and he keep it there while they search the basement keep it clamp tight and then when they finally clear out my grandfather be dead I would love to see he on this couch Doc you would have a field day with he I be Paul Weston I be a friend of Alex 's my deep deep condolence thank you I I do not remember you play racquetball with he hello excuse I I be sorry I do not know which one of these door be the right one that be okay it be a terrible day do not want to knock on your residence no problem this door be usually for people who come in that be usually the exit door but it do not it do not really matter you have an entry door and an exit door it be for people 's privacy some people do not like to they do not like to run into each other be they ashamed no it be just it be protocol really would you like some coffee no I be a tea man but no nothing thank you I be fine please sit down I get a lot of question I be sure you have and I hope that I can answer some of they one thing I do have to stress from the outset be that anything that be say between myself and a patient in this room be private even if the patient be dead yes even then well I be sure we will find something to talk about something to help I understand what happen to my son Transcript FRM Team Sync Benj you be not very forthcoming about who you be when we meet at the service a friend you say that be hardly the case well I do not want to betray Alex 's confidence Daniel do not hesitate in explain exactly what your relationship to Alex be he be very direct Daniel I like that about he be you surprised to hear that Alex be in therapy that he do not tell I surprise I I mean what be the big deal why do you think he do not we will never know the answer to that will we or I will not maybe that be something you discuss here you know it always puzzle I the whole process here you know I mean that that a person be in therapy at all often be never discuss who the doctor be what he be there for how much it cost funny thing be that it be secrecy or misunderstanding thing never speak that usually land people in therapy in the first place be not at ironic I do not think it be about secrecy I think it be about create an environment where people can come and feel safe to talk about anything safe than with their love one sometimes it be easy to talk to somebody who be totally uninvolved in your life somebody objective somebody who have no stake in it you mean like a prostitute hmm someone who be pay for their intimacy and their discretion a man should have someone to talk to who care about he not someone who charge by the hour I really do care for Alex and if I have not I would actually be a pretty poor therapist do you think Alex speak about thing in this room that he never speak to anyone else about that be usually the case with patient so you probably know as much about he as anyone do do you feel that you know your son well I know Alex when he be a little boy and what be he like then well he be quiet introspective Daydreamer Inventor do he ever mention that to you he never do no he invent this thing for his mother a pan that make flip an omelet over very easy he work very hard on that thing it be really good so where do he get that from be you an inventor oh no no man I be a knucklehead my father be an inventor he invent this knife sharpen machine it do not make very much money he be proud of it Alex remind I of he in what way you try to shrink I doctor I be just curious or perhaps you can not help yourself that be probably true too my father and Alex have the same mannerism the same sense of humor it be unsettling when Alex be a little boy and my father have be dead almost 20 year there he be sit across the dinner table look at I through I with those eye of his on Alex 's face be your father still live Mr Weston yes yes his body be in good health but his his mind be go be you close we have our difference of course but we be close we be close I mean how often do you see he about once a month do he know you be there no I do not think so but the visit be more for my sake what do you get out of it connection a sense of belong do you ever have conversation with he in your head both side of the conversation yes when I be young everything he say go in one ear out the other now I hear his voice in my head Loud and clear every day that be the sense of connection that you mention that be that be what I feel slip away with each pass day since Alex 's death that sense of I be try to find his voice you know but he will not talk to I if you do not mind I say so Mr Prince I think that it be still too soon you be probably still in a state of shock but his voice will come back to you I apologize for compare what you do to uh prostitution I do not believe they be the same at all Apology accept how would you describe my son Alex I be not ask you for a diagnosis you do not have to tell I what he think just what you think of he personally I think that Alex be an extremely capable man strong sense of mission a very strong sense of what be expect of he uh mission or purpose what do you mean well Alex be a military man military man have mission to have a purpose a sense of purpose that be something something you do on your own something you want for yourself do he have that I think that Alex be struggle to find out what he want for himself do he say that no sir he do not I be just give you some of my impression without betray what he confide in I Frankly it be more than I be allow to do be you in the service yourself Mr Prince eight month you know after they draft I have an asthma attack and they discharge I probably save my life Funny a breathing problem be my salvation and my father 's death knell Alex tell you about what happen to my father these be fact about my life not Alex 's treatment do you happen to know how my father die yes or no simple question yes yes I do anyway I be not a war hero like my son if that be what you be wonder how do you feel about Alex 's service in the Navy I be proud of it of course like any father would be be he do you think do you suspect that he be not I want to understand my son mr Weston and instead of help I you answer question with question I think your son find it increasingly difficult to compartmentalize to keep his feeling apart from his obligation and to live up to the expectation of other the expectation of the Navy Expectations to excel like he have always excel and at the expense of his own need and his real desire be you say that Alex be ill equipped emotionally to handle the pressure Mr Prince you be ask I to I be ask your opinion Alex 's emotional state be not something you be play a little fast and loose here be not you mr Weston I can know my son be trouble just not how troubled I want to know what his therapist believe he be capable of how far he would go how far he would go to what Mr Prince I 've speak to a couple of Alex 's fellow pilot it be a training flight they simulate a battle one plane against another the other pilot make a snap decision try to get away apparently fly low they say Alex do not have time to straighten out there be also a rumor go around that Alex kill himself he be a superb pilot it be not combat it be a training exercise it be a training exercise there have not be any official find Mr Prince you say that yourself there be an ejection seat why do not he jump maybe he do not think he need to use it well Michaela 's be in church you know on her knee pray look for answer my wife also and I tell them you know that be the wrong place to look God and I we 've be over for a while my faith die when my father die a boy once beat Alex up he be about 10 or 11 he take his shoe little shit punk you know Alex do nothing to fight back he do not defend himself he be not a fighter he be a he be a frail kid you know Thin skinned and that scare the hell out of I where I come from thin black skin could get you kill and that be the kind of world that that Alex be bear into what be you imply I be simply ask if he no let I tell you something I see more injustice as a child horror do they do they affect my view of the world of course do they shape the manner in which I raise my boy how could they not Strength Strength be essential to survival Vulnerability be often a death sentence I want he to be safe I envy the time you spend talk with he I admit those kind of talk embarrass the hell out of I this where he sit yes Alex could talk he and his boy they would talk for hour he even once tell Roy that he love he boy I tell you do I give he hell for that you be try to make the kid a sissy or something it be bad enough that he do not want to good Alex at anything he would rather throw a chess game just so be he would not have to beat his father oh now come on that be no way to raise a boy to be a man I mean you have to challenge he make he compete teach he how to fight take care of himself it be interesting that you regret not be more gentle yourself with Alex and yet at the same time you seem to justify be be harsh I hear you say that you be a little conflicted about the notion Mister I be not in conflict about anything be that how you try to help Alex Second guess every word that come out of his mouth a stranger completely unfamiliar with his background you go explain his world to he actually our session be mostly about I listen to what to what he have to say yeah well there we go again with the listening huh he have his own personal professional listener listen when I smother my father do you think I pay someone to listen to I hmm you can not stop and dwell on every ache and pain maybe it be because of what my dad do or maybe it be because of what my mother do Come on you 've get to keep move man you know what good do all the talk do it be not go to bring my father back you know what People like you you never stop to think that we have a subconscious for a reason because there be thing about ourselves that we can not face that we should not face or else how in the world do we get up out of bed in the morning I will tell you World War III come all those people who 've be through all of this psychoanalysis spend hundred thousand of dollar be go to be the first one to lose their head Darwin have a theory he call it survival of the fit the fit not the most self reflective with all due respect I think that Alex start come here because he feel that he need to and you have to take he apart do not you you have to pick at the scab do you think that Alex 's therapy here have something to do with his death you be the one who tell he he have to go look inside to reflect examine feel oh yeah he feel and what do that get he now he be a human pancake you be a hell of a miracle worker doctor do you have a son Mr Weston yes I do and if another man someone from a different culture start give he advice every week advice that you be pretty sure would be harmful to your son what would you do your son be a mature man who decide to come here of his own what would you do what would you do I would try to stop he if I could I can not get over the feeling that I be tear apart in this room People have a misunderstanding about what happen in in room like this it really be not about blame or look for scapegoat he be an outstanding person he be kind devoted loyal too loyal often I wish that he would 've just please himself not I but we want to please do not we Mr Weston he do a lifetime of try to please I all that that tough that tough schooling and the training and the achievement that be for I I be the one who need it to feel that he be safe you know you son love you and he have huge admiration for you he tell I that do not tell I that man you think that comfort you think that comfort I no I would have rathere that he hate I I would have rathere that this be his fuck you to I why do you say that for push he so hard to be tough than the rest of the world I be so stupid do I kill my son I kill my father with my own two hand do I

Transcript swsub com Season 1 episode 39 Sync by Anyone Lemonhead michvanilly salomon be Amy join we today I do not think so so what be be up with you Jake it be be a pretty weird week since we see you last Paul very quiet around the house Awkward we barely speak to each other except when Lenny be around who somehow seem really relaxed and at ease he be such a funny kid Man I wish you could meet he he be tell we this joke the other day about these these two cannibal that eat a clown and one cannibal turn to the other and say do this taste funny to you anyway Amy and I be laugh despite ourselves it be very surreal kid tend to do that when they sense tension they try to get the parent to come together you be probably right but he should not have to do it it be not fair you be right it be not fair Amy 's be try to reach out to I this week you know make it all ok the whole Ben thing but how can you make up for something like that to tell you the truth it be pretty sad watch she try when Lenny fall asleep the other night she run around the house pretend to be busy with house shit which she never do not say anything just try to run into I and at one point we be pretty close together in the kitchen she try to kiss I and I just what just could not do it I be not into it my heart be not there it can be hard to relate to somebody after something like an affair you be tell I Bizarre late that night she have fall asleep watch tv and I just I just stand there look at she how do you feel she sleep with she both hand tuck under her cheek like in those kid book you know the way they draw the angel sleep she do not look like a woman who have just fuck some other guy she look really beautiful and I be think how easy it would be to just go lay down next to she and put my arm around her but you do not no I could not I just remember how easily she could chip away at I and lure I back in so I jump in my car and I get the fuck out of there in the middle of the night that be right where have you go First at Elliot 's but then I remember he have a date I do not want to walk in on anything it be be about 6 year since the guy got lay so I just keep drive and I end up at my parent ' house the kicker be they live about four hour away in Virginia and it be too early when I arrive to ring the doorbell so I just sit out front in my car and fall asleep how often do you see they your parent Mom come into town to see Lenny pretty frequently every couple of month maybe we go out there for the holiday a couple of time a year not much more and be your father close to Lenny be my father close to Lenny that be a good question I think so they spend time together Lenny like he but it always feel finite I can not help but get the feeling that he leave he hang like he be just spend a few minute with the neighbor 's grandchild and now it be time to move on of course my dad be the narcissist that he be be oblivious to it have Lenny say anything to you about it no he seem fine with it so who know maybe I be just see thing I be asleep in the car outside their house and all of a sudden there be this knock on the window and its wake I up and it be a cop and who be the cop Mike Garnett go to school with I want to be a cop since the 1st grade and now that be what he be it be really funny he fulfil his childhood dream I do not think I know anyone who become what they want to be when they be a kid when I be grow up in the wintertime there be this guy and he would come over with his chainsaw swing from tree to tree cut branch before they freeze and fall off like a fucking monkey it be unbelievable and he be the only guy I know who my father do not tell how to do his job that be who I want to be the old man he be such a know it all the funny part be though he do know it all he can tell you the exchange rate for a guyanese dollar how to cook a freshwater salmon in a clay oven or the history of the silk worm do he write encyclopedia you would think right no he be a college professor my mom too Intellectuals big reader unlike I I do not read I do not think I 've read a book since I leave high school do that mean you do not or you will not I have not really I remember once I misquote Roland Barthes and you correct I where do that come from I grow up in a house where everyone be read at dinner that shit be everywhere any parrot could pick it up and spit it back verbatim that be what happen when your dad be an emeritus professor of Renaissance study and your mother teach classic Greek and Hebrew but I do not read I mean not literally obviously I read I read music manual headline but I just I do not know I be not like they I do kick ass at crossword puzzle though you do those I be not very good Sunday New York Times crossword do I in every week it be a tough one to do crossword puzzle you need to have an extensive vocabulary no it be kinda hard to reconcile the idea of somebody who do not read with somebody who be really good at crossword puzzle there be nothing to reconcile I be good at it and reading make I restless and bored so do you acquire your love of crossword puzzle from your parent not really my mom 's all right at they my dad suck what do you do as a kid when everybody else be do all this reading I do not know play guitar collect baseball card smoke pot do that get you into trouble not really nobody notice nobody notice that you get high so who be you get high with myself mostly so would you say that you have a lonely childhood Nah why it be okay I talk to myself a lot you know what one of my favorite thing in the world be talk to Lenny and we talk about anything but mainly we talk about sport and he can just go off Aluminum bat versus wood fuck anything that kid have a brain like a computer he be not even 10 and he can list off all of Boog Powell 's stat from the 1970 world series that be just amazing to I I never get tired of hear that little fucker talk you get like that with your kid not so much anymore because they be old but with my young yeah I still do and how old be he he be nine just like Lenny do you have that kind of relationship with your father as a kid no I avoid talk to my father when I be a kid it just be not worth it he be the kind of guy who would wince if you say sure instead of surely do you find it easy to talk to your mom she be not as bad but what be frustrating be she would always defer to he on everything it be like she see he as this hotshot professor at another level from everyone he get tenure at 33 and it just would not occur to she that she could have an opinion different from his than his if you be he you would have just correct I on my grammar if you be he hey they do not beat I right it could 've be a lot bad that be true it do not it do not mean it be not difficult so when do you start to write I do not write my brother Nathan be the writer he be a novelist he be just shortlist for some prize last year some big national award I can not even remember the name I be sure my parent remember it but you be a writer too or do not you consider songwrite to be write no sure I do some of my favorite writer be actually songwriter people like Dylan Cohen John Lennon hey I agree with you Paul I would put Dylan on par with Walt Whitman Ezra Pound Langston Hughes just try tell that to my family you know for somebody who be not a great reader you seem to be pretty familiar with great poet Nobody 's really familiar with Pound they just fake it but I get the feeling you like to play down your knowledge your intelligence I do not know it be just my folk ' world I guess some of it have rub off on I but it be just not I your parent ever express an interest in what you might do for a live my dad probably want I to be some kind of academic it be the family business after all but what do he expect I do not know I think he give up the dream on I pretty early after I flunk out of high school which do you think come 1st your father 's low expectation or your low grade Meaning often with expectation there be a self fulfil prophecy maybe you decide early on you could not match up to his expectation and so you give up try could be my mom be always try to get I interested she would help I study for test on the sly on the sly yeah it piss my dad off he think she be spoon feed I thing I should 've know or figure out by myself and she be terrify he would find out be she generally intimidate by he you be so right Abe I never look at it that way Abe yeah it make I want to scream one thing you can say about I be I sure as hell do not marry my mother you mean you do not marry a woman who be intimidate by you so how do your parent feel about Amy she be a successful businesswoman she be get an MBA they fucking love that she go to grad school their high school dropout of a son marry a hotshot businesswoman it be interesting you use the same word to describe your father hot shot do you think that they be alike in other way they be not they be total opposite he be all rumpled corduroy stain on his shirt and she be well hell you know what Amy be meticulous put together very materialistic she love her stuff you know when we meet I be crash in this crappy apartment over a garage I think it turn she on and the woman have never fuck on a bed without a box spring and she like it come down from her pedestal hang with the riffraff do you feel like your father be also on a pedestal come on let us get off this alright this be not why I be here I do not have that many people to talk too right now and I be scared shitless of lose Lenny in some custody battle Amy be unstable this be the second time she be get a divorce after have an affair and I think she be go to fuck he up you say yourself she need loser around I think she be go to teach he to be a loser she be damage Paul she be fuck up I have not get much right in my life except that kid and that kid be what the fuck you do not pay your electric bill or something look like it be out on the entire street you want to go on I can see you fine you be sure for the first time it really feel like we be split up no matter how many time we 've talk about it or bring it up it be never feel so Real why do you think it feel different this time the last time you be here you imply that you would fall out of love with Amy would you still say that be true I do not know how would I know what do it feel like I 've only be in love with one girl her I 've never fall out of love tell I what it feel like and I will tell you if I be feel it have you ever feel it there be a huge sadness there 'cause you know what be be lose and you begin to lose the desire to connect maybe you should ask your father he be the guy who know everything do I tell you what he say when I tell he my marriage be over this be not entirely unexpected be it he expect I to fail every time at everything why do you go home Jake I do not know it be an extend I just start drive that be where I end up this be therapy we do not believe in accident here alright fine I be about to be a single dad maybe I maybe I just feel like I want to talk to my mum or your dad have you be listen to a word I say I can not fucking stand my father it be interesting that you use the same word to describe Amy and your father Hot shot but you keep insist that they be nothing like each other they be not where be you go with this look you marry an intelligent overachieve woman who seem absolutely certain of her authority in the world the criticism and disappointment that you get from your father do I feel that that be what you get from Amy your relationship with Amy 's fall apart so you get in a car and you drive for 4 h to Virginia and you find yourself by accident outside your father 's house you think I be go back to the source Jesus that be sick it be not sick the more we open ourselves to the the therapeutic process the more we can examine these More therapy what be you talk about I need that like I need a hole in the head you know what who care why I go home that night what be it matter how my parent talk at the fucking dinner table alright I 've learn from my father 's mistake and I be a much well father than he be I do not want to fuck it up I do not want to fuck my kid up I need I need the help I need your help I need help all the help I can get or some road map you know I feel scared I wish I could say it be that simple that I could just give you a road map a book of instruction but unfortunately life be not like that but you know that old say that a journey of a thousand mile begin with a single step or in my case two step up and one step back you know if this be a movie the light would come on right now if this be a movie previously on in Treatment you know you 've never once take responsibility for what you do you never once say I be sorry I make a mistake he be not willing to forgive I because he have not make up his mind about this woman yet another thing we have not talk about the kind of mother you 've be can we talk about it you should really be quiet right now you be sort of embarrass yourself you say that I might have push Kate into her affair because of my feeling for Laura maybe it be the other way around you be both go through something she be struggle with the dynamic that exist before you meet and you be look for that young woman who look up to you the way Kate use to that be great that be just really great how be you so obviously Kate be not come today yes she leave I a message she really do not go into why though she say that she be tired of go back and forth and just tired to try to find out who have start what and who be guilty of what and who be react to what she want to decide on her own basically I have to respect that Transcript Anyone Coffee Tagne Sync by Anyone Coffee Tagne Week 8 Episode 40 how do you think our session with Kate go I would say they be chaotic I be a little annoyed with you over that but I suppose I be partly at fault too and I also think that she felt sandwich between two therapist I do have to say though that you do manage to make connection that resonate with both of we especially with Kate whether anything be go to come off that I do not I do not really know you know who I envy writer they create these character that they want to spend time with and then they decide if they be go to let they live or die or let they be happy or unhappy let they be failure or success you wanna write everybody 's story for they I really think I would be a shitty writer I would want to give everybody a happy ending I be very sorry about your patient yeah thank not the end I would have write for he the funeral Jesus Christ I would forget how awful funeral be that dreadful sense that that in the end there be only silence you think as therapist we would have well tool to walk through it well I do not I feel the same sense of futility and hopelessness as the next guy you know what be also interesting be see the relative of patient you 've treat their participance in the story that you 've hear a dozen of time the father the son the brother whoever we think we know they but we do not really know they at all we know reaction of they the version of they idealize or vilify I be really struggle to reconcile this image that I have of Alex 's wife with the woman that I see there he always describe she as a demand exact a constant source of pressure in his life but I look over and I just see this break woman she seem so soft and gentle 'cause I will never really know she now do that bother you it do bother I I ask myself all the time if I actually know what I think I know about my patient ' life that couple for example the one who be try to have the baby Amy I do not think she can ever really be know I mean there be certain pattern that identify themselves from her past but I can not shrink her she be too complicated and then I say to myself do I really know any of these people or be they all just one big fiction that I 've construct in my head you know sometimes I dream about the family member of patient that I be treat People I 've never meet yeah it be curious apart from your intense connection with your patient you be also now talk about I do not know longing for your patient ' family and friend what do you mean by that a longing maybe that be not the right word do you mean curiosity about the life of other people be not that an aspect of what we do it be just it be curiosity we be suppose to be fascinate by how people behave at least at least I think so Alex 's death leave I with this very strong feeling that I be like a repository really a trustee the thing that he never tell anybody else his private thought they 've stay with I they be inside I a big part of his life be be in vault I have inside I no a part of his life maybe but not necessarily a big part you be his therapist only his therapist I know you 've always be of two mind in relation to this that therapy be more than a discipline that it be actually a religion but you also say we be therapist so we can not really run our patient live for they as soon as they walk out the door they be on their own yeah how would you describe Alex 's state of mind when you last see he I would say he be pretty fragile if I remember well yeah the ironic thing be that we would really make some good progress and he just seem to regress it be like he feel that he be so close to a breakthrough that it scare he it be too much and he just he turn away from it really be you feel in any way responsible for his death you know I be friendly with a psychiatrist that consult for the Navy Alfonso Casilles you remember he yeah well I ask he if he could find out anything he say vertigo it mean that there be nothing wrong with the equipment they be do some kind of combat exercise the plane he be chase descend Alex go into what they call vertigo and lose control that be their official conclusion I think he kill himself how can you be sure of that look his life be a tragedy from the second he be bear his childhood his relationship with his father up to when he push the button and kill a room full of kid how do you live with that even with the gadget that they have now they reduce people to dot on a video screen all the spin from the Navy none of it make any difference to he it do not work on he he feel every single one of those death I know he do so many expectation the good and the bright he be he be so strong physically handsome intelligent under all that kind of posturing and male posing that he do he be really he be a good guy Charming he be endear you know he look and he sound like what they call a winner suddenly he become a murderer how do you reconcile that I think that be what really kill he endear I have never hear you talk about he like that quite the opposite actually he be kind of a funny guy he be I do not know be I already begin to idealize yeah maybe well it be not uncommon after such a shock he give I the chance to stop he from fly literally do he really offer that or be you project he ask I directly should I fly what do you say I tell he I be very concerned about his about his state of mind you say that clearly but he want I to say it unequivocally do not fly it be not your place Paul a patient can not ask you to take his life into your hand it be not your place to say do not fly Anymore than it be your place to say to that couple have an abortion or to Laura Marry or do not marry your fiancé I should have send the Navy an evaluation Guilt ride want to punish himself should not fly Alex 's dad come into the office to to talk so I have this poor guy yell at I say that his son 's repression be what have keep he alive all the time and that therapy the stuff that he be do with I be the therapy be what have kill he oh God Paul up in the air at Mach 5 he be not suppose to have emotion he be not suppose to think that be actually why he crash he be very different from what I imagine also he be riddle you know with his own guilt actually he do make a couple of good point he say thing be in the unconscious for a reason because the mind can not live or breathe or take a single step if everything that lie dormant in it be out there in daylight fully lie out that a fully conscious human being would be paralyze would be like a cripple Alex do not need to be conscious but just merely efficient do you really accept that that life be well live unexamined and when anxiety and fear and pain bubble up from below how can that be deal with except by look at it except by analyze it we do not run the show Paul I sometimes think that therapist can start to imagine they be like writer you know that they can control the outcome we do not live their life for they we do not even live they with they I know that you want to believe that we really do have an influence that be always positive we help people to understand Understand what they be feel and after that if they make a wrong turn then it be not our fault it be human error but anyway who be you really angry at myself obviously you every therapist from Freud to Mitchell why because we force patient to look at themselves and pat ourselves on the back for it then we say to they here be what be wrong with you now off you go do you feel this way before Alex die more or less yeah have it be on your mind recently in any other context like what I be ask have other patient other than Alex make you think like this you be insinuate no I be just try to get a sense a history of these feeling about psychotherapy you mean if I 've be wonder for a while if our profession be actually helpful to people yes I have I think about it every day so you feel you be not able to help your patient the gymnast for example Sophie honestly I feel like she make a lot of progress we connect there be a bind between we but I think it be the personal relationship that help she not the therapeutic process you know maybe Yallom be right maybe it be the relationship that actually heal but that other couple Jake and Amy I can not tell you honestly if they be well off together or apart I do not know if I help they at all anyway be you okay Paul I think I be tired Gina Put your foot up you know Alex say he be talk about vertigo and he say that when it happen they be suppose to trust their instrument and not their sense that be right how do you know that I once have a boyfriend who be a commercial pilot this be before David he teach I that among other thing yes Paul I have be more than a sleepy spider so it seem anyway I think it be the opposite for a psychologist I think we would be far more effective if we rely less on instrument and theory and book and more on our own instinct so all your training all your knowledge can lead you astray I think so do you feel this generally or about certain patient in particular what do you mean what be it Gina what you 've get that look of yours what look be that you have the look that say I have a theory regard what Come on Gina cut the crap just tell I what you think I be just sit here listen to you I be listen to your newfound theory about the uselessness of psychotherapy certain patient in particular come on we be back to Laura again be we you think everything be a reaction to Laura what be a reaction I criticize psychology dismiss theory you think I be make an excuse even Alex getting kill that be an excuse right psychology be collapse so I might as well sleep with Laura I think that be kind of the way you be be that what I be think be I wrong when you guess what I be think it be always about Laura like I assume that everything you say be connect to her do not you you be the one who bring she up I be not talk about Laura I be talk about the fact that I be have trouble lately believe in this religion of yours of mine I do not think traditional psychology answer anything anymore you have two extreme right you have pop psychology you 've get these celebrity therapist write good seller get on talk show make some miserable couple wipe on television it be kind of a pornography and then on the other hand you 've get the expert Psychologists like you orthodox Authority figure everything under control and supervised examine under a bright light examine to death completely and utterly divorce from real life be I divorce from real life Gina you 've never live outside this room the Institute the graduate program David 's world and after David die you lock yourself up in here I mean it be a beautiful room look at it beautifully appoint everything be in its place but you sit in here and what do you do you write fiction about how life could have be should have be be that what I be write just ask yourself as a therapist can you really help anybody if you live in a bubble so now I be a sleepy spider in a bubble look I do not want to upset you Gina I you will not I forget of course you do not get upset you never lose it I 've lose it here with you several time in the past few week why be you try to provoke I I be not try to provoke you I just do not want to end up like this be this it be this how therapist live out their life you be perverse you know something real and powerful come into your life and you never give it a chance not for Charlie 's sake or for yours I know you say it be because he be a patient but you know what I think I think it be bullshit Paul be careful you be terrify Charlie tell I that you be the big loss in his life that his whole life could have be different you have no idea what you be talk about and after all these year Paul you do not know I you wanna know what I struggle with it be not that I be too reserve too detach it be that I be too emotional I be impulsive and emotional and I give myself over right away and passionately I pour myself out can not you see that I be protect myself because I be afraid I get carry away I will not be able to think I will not be able to analyze I will not be able to work you 've create this cold version of I that be limit and castrate because when you be argue with I you want to see yourself as battle the force of repression and if the truth be that I be an emotional person who have to rein herself in it do not fit with what you need now do it of course I want Charlie he be the most alive person I ever meet I want to sleep with he I want to eat he up but I do not and not because of ethic I may have tell he that it be because he be a patient but the real reason be David even though David cheat on I for however many year I know that all along he be really shitty at hide it I do not sleep with Charlie because that be not who I want to be I love David and I love the life we have and who I be with he I love myself with David David 's Gina and you know what when I be stand over his grave at funeral I feel if I be magically reborn I would choose he all over again for all his fault he allow I to be who I want to be I be surprised you do not see it how crazy I be about he he be everything I never hear you say it oh shit everything have to be say then now I have to sit here and listen to your crappy nearsighte self involve theory about my life oh God listen to we you know I slap you and you punch I sometimes I tell myself it be constructive but you know I be not so sure anymore maybe we should stop you 've be fight I for two month say Laura Laura Laura and you 've be wait for this imaginary Gina of yours to jump in and stop you I be not what be stop you you be fight yourself it be up to you it be like Alex you carefully look at his life you open door for he you give he insight but his life be his and he decide to fly now you decide perhaps you be right maybe love can bloom in a therapist office Ethics and rule love be big than any rule and what do I know maybe she be your David maybe you can only be the Paul you want to be with her so go to her find out but please stop compare your life to mine stop use Charlie against I I be sorry he be hurt by what happen but I never love he not for a day I love David so never talk to I about Charlie again be I clear please go now Paul previously on in Treatment my dad be the most important person to I in this whole world you 've try to kill yourself and you do not want to tell the most important person in your world he have a life it be not his fault that I take those pill I be not say it be his fault I be just try to figure out why you be so ready to leave the planet and not tell he be you angry at he for something I be not angry at he you tell I once that you want to move across the country to be with your dad and his new wife but that they do not have a room for you I tell you he leave she because of that after two year Sophie how could he just stop love I what do I do Laura hi it be I Paul I hope you be do okay I be still hope we could talk meet up maybe have a coffee okay I

feel about the three of we meet she be fine you be cool with it right whatever it be cool can we come in why do not we schedule a meeting a joint session for all three of we next week no time like the present I think Sophie and I need to consider whether or not a joint session would be to her benefit we need time to prepare Time to prepare for what I be her father Dad be cool it be not a big deal I

have any idea how humiliating that be I stand in front of your therapist like I'am I be what what do he think I be what be the matter with you be you actually take this guy seriously it be like he be brainwash you or something brainwash I about what you have to prepare to meet with your dad boy be that bullshit you can not even look I in the eye boy that just break my heart I raise you to be smart than this you do not really raise I excuse I Most of the time you be far away I can not believe what I be hear he say he have never be more humiliate in his whole life I can not let he in without an appointment he be my father even still you let my mother in we would make an appointment with your mother ahead of time why could not you just let he in it would not have bother I I know you be used to your father come in and out of your life but that do not mean it do not bother you in fact I suspect it bother you very much and he be not exempt from the rule of this office you and your fucking rule if your wife walk in would you chase she away tell she to come back next week I would absolutely tell she or anyone else if I think their presence in my office be inappropriate I need time to prepare for a session with both you and your father so it be not even about I at all you be so full of it what I suddenly understand what your mother must feel what be that suppose to mean you be easy on your father he disappear for month then barge in unannounced want to break into your therapy he invade your private space but still you defend he he be always the king well you do not have to worry because he be never come back here again so you can have your crown back okay let us say he do come back he will not but let us say we be able to get he here would you want that yes why because it be important to he be not that obvious to he or to you do not you have kid you know I do well do not you ever do thing just to make they happy that be a very different situation not really he be the parent not you so what you do not see the difference do not patronize I I be not patronize you these be your session not his one of the reason even adult go into therapy be to separate who they be from what other people want they to be do you analyze your daughter too no I try not to why not because it be just not a good idea it be not possible to treat one 's own child why parent play a big role in the development of the child 's personality so as a doctor it would be very hard for I to keep my role as a father separate from the therapy because you be part of the problem correct I could not even tell he about my accident that be so fuck up Shit let he in let us just do this I want to talk to he be you sure I need you to listen to I come on in please oh you 've decide it be okay dad

custody battle Amy 's she be damage Paul she be fuck up the last time you be here you imply that you have fall out of love with Amy would you still say that be true I do not know how would I know what do it feel like I 've only ever be in love with one girl her I 've never fall out of love tell I what it feel like and I will tell you if I be feel it hello Amy hey Paul Hi Jake come on in you be look well thank you you know I be actually go to miss this office I like the feel of it I like the clutter really what do you mean you be go to miss it it be our last session we be get a divorce for real this time I be sorry to hear that it be because of you actually well not really you it be because of therapy Therapy do we good would you agree with that Amy Sure if by good he mean it be a disaster Transcript swsub com Sync by anyone michvanilly salomon you ever be through a divorce Paul no I have not it be not for sissy even when you want it more than anything it turn into this spiral of uncertainty and pain and you bury a part of yourself maybe we should begin with just recap the last week how be it be we barely see each other all week that be Jake 's idea he want to see how it would feel and it feel okay well than I expect Amy Sure my week be light and breezy would you mind talk about it yes I do mind talk about it because every time I come here I tell you about my week you find a way to make I feel miserable to make my childhood seem like a nightmare to make my marriage look like a sham so sorry forgive I but I be actually through talk about my week come on it be not what happen here maybe not for you we come in miserable we could not talk to each other all we could do be fuck you know fuck and fight and now I I do not know I be feel what what Paul say he be see what we do to each other how we bring out the bad in each other I can not speak for you but I I be feel well this week well than I 've feel in a long time why can not you speak for I because we have not see each other all week whose idea be that we both agree that no I do not I think you say it be a good idea I be try to be accommodate and wait you can not speak for I there be a time when you would 've speak for I in a heartbeat a time when you know every thought in my head I want it to be true but it never be and how would you know that it be my head do you know I hear you play this week what be you talk about where at Elliot 's house on Friday night you be at Elliot 's when well not exactly I be on Elliot 's street I could hear you play from my car you be actually quite good that be insane this be Friday night where be Lenny Home with a sitter I be go to surprise you I be go to ring the doorbell and come inside and say actually I be hope I would not have to say anything that you would just grab I before I get to that part you never come in no why not because of Paul because of everything that we 've say to each other here because I could not remember how we use to make up before we come to Paul we use to have sex that be how we use to make up I be so sorry I ever suggest come here I just wish we have never do it Amy you say that you see our work here as be a failure why do you think that because it be be come to you for month and it be only get bad between we Jake how do you see the therapy do you see it as a success I think it be a little bit more complicated than that in what way I be just I do not know I think I be get it more now why we can not control our dynamic why we trigger each other 's bad instinct and I do not know it feel good to I I mean it feel awful of course but it feel good that it be make more sense you know like it be not I it be not her it be we it seem to I it be finally clear that you both have radically different idea of what a relationship fundamentally be Amy you think thing be fall apart yet the bad be go to come Jake you see thing as come together that the future be bright than the past you be evaluate our entire being base on the way that we behave at the moment we be get divorce that be ridiculous there be a theory that say the way a person handle one thing be the way they handle everything and I guess what I be try to do be take into account the whole history of your relationship I do remember Amy that it be sex that first attract you to each other and your first encounter you describe as messy but really really powerful and then you get pregnant which you have not plan and then you got marry by then you would begin to fall into the pattern of provoke each other Amy you mention how depressed you be when Lenny be bear do you remember that do you remember why I feel like the world be a terrible place and it be wrong to bring a child into it and what about you Jake what do you remember feel when Lenny be bear I feel pure unadulterate relation I still do not understand I be a pessimist and he be an optimist and opposite attract and that happen all the time so why can not we fix this why do not this relationship work you know I think that what we 've try to do here in these session be to illuminate the pattern of behavior that have keep the two of you kind of coil around each other the cycle that you 've embrace the way you 've hide behind they so you can not really act out these pattern anymore because everything be now out in the open now they be in the conscious mind the two of you be in a way emotionally naked before each other I remember when it all start after Lenny be bear I just sort of lose it there be night I would sit there hold he watch television just cry and then of course he would start to cry Jake would come home from work and take Lenny and take he into another room I mean I come out of it eventually but Jake do not look at I the same way again that be not exactly what happen it be when I got depress it be like you take it personally or something you act as if I would betray you you have when I meet you you seem like this person who be unhappy in a relationship so I think take the woman out of the relationship and you will take away her pain but I get you out of the relationship and you be still unhappy and then we have a kid a beautiful kid and you be still unhappy so I feel like I have be trick sorry I be not try to trick you I be sorry too you do not have anything to be sorry about no I do I be sorry I really have screw a lot of thing up and I be really sorry that I get angry I know you be have a hard time and I should not have do that I do not know I just I get scared we both do I be go to miss our family this be what I see in front of I two people who have really love each other deeply and even though you be not bring each other happiness right now the truth be you 've get to this place together and though you be look at it from different perspective it be the same place and I guess what I be ask you to do be to think about not turn away even at this difficult time when you be contemplate the notion of separation you can still draw strength from from each other what be you say you think we should not get divorce Couples therapy either help people heal or it show they how they can separate the therapist 's job in the end I suppose be to let the couple decide but we 've be come here for week we 've tell you so much you must have an opinion all I can say be that you be a unique couple I know couple who use less energy to make love than you two use in casual conversation and passion like that be a rare commodity but passion itself be not enough to sustain a relationship for a lifetime what be what be enough to keep two people together for a lifetime I wish I know the answer to that I be so worried about Lenny yeah he be go to have a whole different life so you be go to share custody then I assume we would joint custody you understand what that mean it mean he move back and forth right yes but I think it be a little bit more specific than that but you know what this be not my area of expertise you both need to sit down and discuss this in detail with a lawyer Jesus we can barely get he to school on time as it be between the two of we Amy 's work as much as she do so I guess what I should take he during the week actually I be not work anymore what do you quit what happen I sleep with my boss and he have a wife he do not want I around anymore so you be fire that fucking asshole I be relieve actually we 've get a bit of a cushion with the severance package so and I get a producer who be still really interested in a few song of mine I think it might be helpful to talk through some of the more complicated question that arise as a result for example have you think about where you be go to live I be think of get a place in the city I know a guy he be a friend of Elliot he be get a loft it be rough but it be cheap there be enough space for I Lenny and maybe a little recording studio be it safe sure be there a doorman I just tell you it be cheap I do not want he stay in a bad place what do you want I to do stay in the house build a little wall through the bedroom I think about move away start over in another place but I want he to be close to you it will be fine it will be good for he to get out of the suburb anyway and you know I be not go to let anything bad happen to he if bad come to bad you could always get your parent to help out with Lenny I would live on the street before I ever ask my parent for help have you tell they about this about we what have they say my dad cry really no but I think he want to I could tell probably invite you for Christmas tell you to bring a date we will figure this custody thing out People do it every year right have either of you talk to Lenny about what be be go on between you not really but he know kid pick up on everything they certainly do he think we be crazy I can tell he be only 9 but he already realize he be get crazy parent he be not entirely wrong there be he remember that time we try to teach he where baby come from Amy have get he this book call where do I come from it be one of those cartoon book that they write to teach kid about sex it be a pretty good book except except that it leave out this really significant part that sex be pleasurable which Amy feel like Lenny really need to know they make it sound like sex be something adult do 'cause they have to like brush your tooth I be read the book and Amy keep interrupting try to explain to he what sex feel like use these ridiculous metaphor to describe how sex feel for a woman it be my only frame of reference Meanwhile Jake keep correct I with contradictory metaphor from the male perspective say it be like hit a home run naked inside of someone else and this poor kid be just look at we just more and more confused until finally he just get up and walk away just walk right out the door shake his head like a little old man yeah he will be okay my father use to say there be no great distance than the space between two head we be over be not we damn it oh God we should get go Lenny 's piano lesson be go to be over pretty soon sorry and I need to go I can not be here any long we be go to talk to he now no later when I do not know ok I think you will find the right time we be go to be late let us go you wanna stay and talk to Paul for a few more minute and I can go pick Lenny up myself no I want this to be hard for you it be hard for I no it be not you can not wait to get out of here no I be just do with this room okay I wanna go to a bar get drunk and cry like a baby I wanna feel all those thing I just do not want to do it here ok come on Ame who be that my next patient Let us go Amy Jake previously on in Treatment you 've be fight I for two month say Laura Laura Laura and you 've be wait for this imaginary Gina of yours to give you her blessing I be not what be stop you you be fight yourself maybe you can only be the Paul you want to be with her so go to her find out hey it be Laura I be not in right now hey it

classic textbook panic attack do you talk to she about it what be happen to you it be sex Gina it be not it be not like it be a session I get out of there as fast as I could but it be too late by the time it take for I to make up my mind about both of we she would change hers she change her mind but you be the one that run out no she say she do not want it anymore I be confused about just take a breath and start at the beginning yeah you know what it do not matter anyway it be not like we be go to be together I could not I could not even bring myself to to touch she she be this close to I I could feel the heat from her body you know how many time I think about that Gina how many time I 've imagine that next thing I know I be double over the hood of my car gasp for air what the fuck be wrong with I Gina nothing 's wrong with you you see this as a betrayal as though you sabotage yourself I do not see it that way of course not for you it be good news you 've be tell I for the last 2 month what a horrible mistake I be make ruin my life you should be ready to open a bottle of champagne the last time we meet I say this have to be your decision when it come down to it in the end it do not have anything to do with moral question or integrity or my marriage or you what be it then I have this feeling that I be go to be swallow swallow up by all of it and that I be go to lose Control Anyways I run out the door I think of you all the time that I say that you be a coward well who be the coward now you know Paul that anxiety attack be yours it be not external it be you what restrain you be the very good of you your deep standard personal and professional and moral moral decision do not come from the unconscious I be not go to let myself off the hook that easily you steer yourself away from do something that you know you would regret you save yourself from be hurt and from hurt a woman that you care about what do you think that moral decision be always make in the absence of temptation that they be make easily that they be make gracefully give yourself some credit if you be able to make this decision easily it would have be a sign that you do not want she that badly but you do you want she so very badly so badly that you have an anxiety attack in order to stop yourself so in the end you win you prevail well thank you for try to console I Gina I be not console you I just want you to take the credit and the responsibility for what you do you know what she say she say that she be come to understand that what she be be do use sexual relationship to free herself from emotional entanglement that she do not want to do that anymore it be ironic her therapy with you have be a success she say hat what I be do be that I be use she to bail myself out of my own life that actually I be have a midlife crisis Hilarious description that be your theory be not it no but that do not matter now it do not matter you know what matter be that you do the right thing for you and for your patient she could be the last love of my life and I let she go what be leave for I now Gina we will have to talk about that you be go to get a call from one of your

ask I would you like to go somewhere else and I say yes I would like to go to the bathroom so I stand up and I go to the bathroom he follow I and you would not believe it but these be unisex bathroom be I be lucky or what how do you mean I be lucky well I be I be run away from a guy and I be yeah you be try to get away from the guy right I mean I need to pee you know by myself I 've be do that since I be three so I realize I need to make a decision by follow I to the bathroom this guy be also give I an ultimatum I think fuck out of the pan and into the fire I run away from one ultimatum and there be this guy with a hard on give I another suddenly I feel like do it I never have sex in a bathroom before I mean what I should go and Marry Andrew without ever know what a good bathroom fuck 's all about it be part of a young lady 's education be not it so you want to do I but not to get back at Andrew just for yourself that be right a girl be force into marriage what be she suppose to do die ignorant so this guy follow I into the stall and suddenly I be horny be hear about this disgusting to you no it be not disgusting go on he unzip pull down his pant and he stand there with his huge God I feel like I be 16 touch it for the very first time I be really surprised at how warm it feel I mean do not I know that already and then he turn I around to face the door and he pull down my stocking he lift up my skirt put his hand into his back pocket and pull out a condom I realize this guy 's very good at this he do this a lot he be a real pro and then this guy enter the stall next to we and start pee in gush full volume like a racehorse I think of Andrew how he pee in the morning make the same sound my heart ache I just it be so stupid you know I just feel so sad all of a sudden and he be behind I and he be rub up against I and he be feel I up I think to myself it be go to happen any moment and I just I just could not do it I simply close my leg shut I could not do it I could not do it to Andrew I just could not do it seem like quite a night out yeah that be not the end of it because this idiot I tell he I be really sorry but I have a boyfriend I can not do this and he laugh in my face and say boohoo and he grab my hand and he say listen cupcake you think you can leave I high and dry like this pointing at his dick the least you can do be make it up to I I say to he what do you want you want some money he say give I a hand job and there will be no hard feeling and I say to he what be the matter with you be you crazy and it be just get really strange I mean it be tense his tone change and then I think of you what you would say about it I think about we go through this in therapy and what do you imagine we say I imagine you not be able to understand it that you would be disgust be that why you run over here to find out if I would be disgust I do not run I give he the hand job excuse I be you okay yeah yeah I be fine thank you we talk about what happen at the club last night but we never get back to actually talk about Andrew and that argument yesterday I do not wanna be put in this position I do not wanna have this power to decide our future for both of we I just do not do you have any idea why Andrew choose this particular time what do you mean do you think that Andrew just out of the blue as you say yourself come up with this idea of an ultimatum do you notice anything over the last couple of day or week that you think might have bring this on nothing I do not know he just lose it I mean shit do not you know that man be the new woman obsess with wedding and child and lately he be lose touch with reality Hehe think I be see someone that be how this whole thing start it be unbelievable but I think you say it come out of nowhere you be watch tv then suddenly well we be watch tv but before that we be have dinner and he have this look on his face he have this sad look and I could just tell something be up I mean you can just tell huh and I say to he what be go on and he say I do not know what I want I just know I do not want this on and off thing so I say to he Sure then let us just decide either we get married or wsplit so you be the one who come up with it with what the ultimatum no he be the one he have the problem with the on and off thing not I on and off can mean several thing you be the one who make it specific get marry or to split up that be your ultimatum no he have this thing with the on and the ultim yeah okay I be the first one to say it you be right but he jump all over it I say I do not know what I want and he say you have a day or two max to decide what you want and I say fine and then he start cry and blah blah blah the whole thing be really scary to he I think what about you be not you scared of what of split up I be not suggest that we split up that be not the point so what do you think be the point of this argument that you may have initiate I do not initiate anything you may not have mean to but you do it sound like you want to bring this relationship into crisis I know you say that Andrew hate uncertainty but perhaps you be the one who can not live with they I mean why do you choose this particular time to bring thing to a head I do no such thing why now because he be right Andrew 's right I be be unfaithful to he you mean what happen last night at the club not just last night I 've be unfaithful to he for a long time why have not we talk about this before I think we have it be be here all along you mean to say you 've never notice it you be surprised no I be not surprised I just I do not follow what you mean this be not the reaction I be hope for not at all what be the reaction that you be hope for I have two scenario in my head in the first one you stand up and you hug I and you say I love you I love you too Laura I 've be feel this way for a long time I just want you to be the first one to say it and then we make love and the the second scenario it be like the first one but but without the sex we just sit he together you know I be embarrassed to even talk about it I mean you be sit there like a fucking buddha act like you have no idea what I be talk about it be humiliating how long have you feel like this a year from the first session I think it would go away I think it be just an infatuation that be all but it be get bad you 've become the center of my life Laura I be your therapist the parameter and the limitation be establish and ethically define I be not an option you may be use I as a as an excuse to bail from your relationship with with Andrew you know why I do not fuck that guy not because of Andrew not because I do not wanna cheat on he I do want to cheat on he but with you when I be sit there at the bar by myself I be think what would happen if you be to walk in you would walk in you would sit next to I at the bar you would order a drink I would even I even try to imagine what you would order a shot of bourbon maybe something expensive something fancy then we would start talk what a coincidence it be to meet like this how awkward it be to meet outside the office and then without word because we we talk enough when we be here you motion for I to follow you to the bathroom and I do when I go into the stall with that guy I imagine it be you behind I that be what make it so exciting then that guy start pee and it wake I up and I realize that it be impossible I know it I understand it I tell myself that every time I walk out of here I know it I understand it but I be not sure that my body understand it I know it can never happen I know it so do not worry I be not go to start show up here I be not go to start stalk you like Glenn Close in that movie I be not go to boil your kid ' rabbit I be not dangerous at least not to you God how can I go back to my life to the hospital to Andrew not to Andrew when the only thing that matter to I be you our time be up yes it be I feel like I come here in the dark and I be leave into a big darkness what be I go to do now we will talk about it next week okay I will call you a taxi no I be fine be you sure how be you go to get home Alex Paul so be there any rule Rules Ground rule anything I should know before we start not really it be more or less up to you oh right right I be a customer Thought in my profession we say that the customer be always wrong that be a that be a therapist joke Transcript FRM Team www 1000fr com Team in Treatment Sync Benj so do you recognize I I be sorry should should I well I be tell you be the good a man in tune with everything around he so yeah I guess you should thank you but I do think that in this profession the the good be really matter of personal opinion I do not know the good can be establish by fact and figure you be the good I do my research a couple former patient someone else who know you from graduate school do that pressure you be it important for you to know that I be the good yes it be nothing personal I always go to the good dentist mechanic you know what they say Save now pay later so what do you think be the good therapist entail do you recognize I no I I do not okay let I help you the madrasa murderer do that mean anything to you be not that long ago a US Navy aircraft hit a target on the outskirt of Bagdad Naval intelligence identify the structure as an insurgent safehouse a bunker turn out it be a madrasa let I tell you what that be it be an islamic religion school boy like bee in a beehive study the Koran Sixteen of they dead ring a bell yes I remember that yes so that be I I fly that mission the madrasa murderer so do your surf the net well somehow well it be not really somehow let us call a spade a spade a leak probably another intelligence fuckup anyway I I be identify as the pilot in that mission and my photo be place on fundamentalist website and I be not talk Al Jazeera I be talk website that ask for my head on a platter offer up the heaven and 40 virgin to anyone who will slit my throat from ear to ear here here I be now it be not a recent photo it be a photo take when I be 18 on a high school trip to Europe Holland that city with the miniature Ultre Utrecht Utrecht go ahead so while I be sit here talk to you a million fanatic be download my portrait and print it out as a dartboard silly motherfucker so why have you come to see I wow we will get to that now so you be probably think what be it like he fly his mission and he fly back and he see the body of those child on CNN you be probably try to figure out what go through his head let I tell you after that kind of mission I do not watch CNN I go to sleep I be dead tired you be probably die to ask how I can sleep night how do you sleep I sleep well thank you very much know it be mission accomplish with great precision let I tell you see I follow my order which be hit my target and hit it on time Time and target do you know we have to hit our target within two second of the estimate time it be surgical that be one small window and I have never miss it if I have if I have fail that task I would be in trouble with my superior with my conscience and with the system but I hit my target so I sleep like a baby how many child die in this mission the medium put it at sixteen and the air force the Navy doctor listen the Nany say nothing and why should it it be not the business of body count it be about hit our target we do not look back over our shoulder belive I we be out there do thing so you can sit here in peace talk to people for a living so when do you hear the child have be kill the following afternoon I hear it on the internet and what exactly do you hear anything specifically that you remember like what it be not like there be time in the day to be surf the net this be a moment I get away there be a lot of stuff to keep I busy what king of stuff Mission review aerial photo video just data stuff Preparation versus execution every tiny technical aspect of our flight be record and analyze by the man there be nowhere to hide and that be the way it should be it be just stuff and more stuff it be it be like when my mother die my father have a year 's worth of stuff to deal with last will and testament her office garden a lifetime of photo album and every time I would talk to he I would ask how he be expect you know that he would break down finally it never end Alex it never end your mother leave such a mess ' she do not know she be go to die and that be all he would say after less than a year he meet another woman and got marry just like that so how do that make you feel I be surprised a whole life together and not a single tear it be interesting that you compare the death of your mother with this mission that you 've just fly that be very clever of you but there be no relation whatsoever my mother 's death be the most traumatic event in my life so far that mission be just another mission for Alex there be no comparison anyway look that be over and I be back now I be back at my home base and now I be on r r what kind of thing do you do for r R do not try to get ahead of I I be a runner I be a hell of a runner in high school and I be still a pretty good one for an old man so I run with my fairy friend this gay guy who could kick your ass at any sport and do he have a name this friend Daniel Daniel we 've be run together for a long time between six and 10 mile depend on whether one of we be on his period only this time I chalenge he a little there be no real good run in the middle east not for the US military unless you want a roadside bomb to blow your ball off so I want to do some serious running I say let us go for 15 then after 15 mile I say 20 now he do not want it but I say okay I will go on my own so he follow I say you know only six more and it be a marathon let us do it he want to stop little bitch but I be not go to stop it be tough we be out of water we be on fume at 22 mile I have a heart attack and die a textbook case straight outta med school Enlargement of the left ventricle in accordance with the family history on both side fatal accord to the ekg and accord to statistic I have a 97 3 chance of die or 2 7 chance of live anyway dead you actually die in the clinical sense no pulse no brain activity total clinical death but here I be and now I be go to disappoint you doctor do not you wanna know why I be go to disappoint you let I help you out the light the tunnel the whole life flash before my eye that be what you be interested in right no I be not actually think of that at all but I be interested please tell I I could not give a shit about it either but that be all everyone want to know about my father my wife everyone they just want to hear about the goddamn tunnel just such bullshit do you feel that maybe you disappoint people by not have that experience that maybe in some way you fail to deliver the good nobody really know what be go through my mind during those last few moment soon as there be no more tunnel no one be interested and what be go through your mind oh I know what be happen you can tell and you be afraid it be the end in all that time until I lose consciousness all that time I do not know how long it be maybe second maybe half a minute all that time I keep try to figure out if I have a hard on see I do not know how I remember this something my grandmother tell I when I be in high school and she say when grandpa die she find he lie naked in the bathtub with a huge erection now he be 92 year old she have not see an erection like that in 20 year she like it she say that be god 's final gift to a man a dead man 's boner they call it angel lust anyway so I be lie there and I be think about that story I know what be happen to I and I say to myself God almighty just do not let I have an erection right now not a hard o because if you have an erection it would mean that that would mean that I be dead and your friend daniel be with you throughout this yeah resuscitation CPR Daniel 's a doctor I forgot to say that for a minute I think you be go to say something else that perhaps your fear of an erection be associate with the presence of your friend Daniel excuse I do not you think you be exaggerate I explain something simple a dead man 's erection what be that get to do with daniel maybe I do not make myself clear early on when I be talk about the customer always be wrong what I mean be that sometimes the patient hide thing from his therapist from himself and so part of our job be to uncover the thing that we hide so my secret be I be afraid of homosexual no not necessarily but I just wand to clarify that okay that be neither here nor there I wanna get to my point go ahead I do not have the erection so you can relax but I tell you I remember very vividly that moment just before pass out before lose consciousness lose consciousns that be a funny expression why do you think that be a funny expression lose consciousness it be an expression my father would use everything in term of profit and loss fit he like a glove so something about how you describe your last moment be equate with your father see thing in term of profit and loss be that okay with all due respect I think we 've come to this way too early all this stuff about the father son relationship I do not think it should come up so soon you think it be too soon no forget what I feel I know it be too soon I wanna know what you think so you be you be test I I be entitle to some testing I be pay for it actually I think you 've be test I since you walk through the door you 've ask about I and my reputation you ask well you practically demand that I ask you certain question that you think I be die to ask it be really important to you I think that I adhere to certain standard that you set before you walk through the door what be wrong with that look I do my research it be a one and a half hour drive to get here and I be pay you good money and I be expect to tell you a perfect stranger the most intimate thing about my life plus there be risk here it be not like the navy 's go to give I a medal for spill my gut in here I be not go to open up to you just like that without know what you be and what do you expect to find Alex how be we go to know that I be a good enough therapist for you I will know accord to your opinion my opinion of what of the issue I come here to talk about but I will come to that in a minute it have to do with what happen to I after take I out of the freezer the freezer oh you mean that you be ground no literally frozen they freeze I the mobile intensive care unit arrive and they put I in a suit that freeze you they 've get one out of presbyterian which be no more than 3 4 of a mile from where I collapse and their e r be top let us go back to this yeah we be get there you have no patience I be tell you be a good listener now look it work on a very simple principle it reduce the shock to the body 's system by drop the body temperature oh so how long be you in my case 48 hour it be a record there be no history of anyone who be be in that suit for such a long period of time I guess I go a long way up that tunnel the tunnel that be not there no unfortunately not so tell I what you remember about this 48 hour mostly I remember a terrible fatigue I guess that be why they call it dead tired it be physical but mainly mental Exhaustion and I remember very clearly the relief I feel when I succeed in come back over into the world you say that you succeed in come back to this world do you fe it be under your control what be you try to get at I be not try to get at anything but what you be describe be a strong will to live I mean during this experience there be a decision to go on live yeah I guess you be right yet despite having make this effort to live everybody 's disappoint listen it be not every day people meet someone who be come back from the dead it be a one in a million thing and if you do not supply the good then listen I have never spend a day in my life in a hpital you get it never so perhaps your anger be not direct at the people who be interested in the tunnel but you be angry at yourself Alex how your body betray you I mean this be a system failure that be not suppose to happen to someby like you I have a brother who be not too bright he be a real estate agent whatever anyway he be a great athlete and he once prove to I and he do his research believe I that all the great quarterback in the history of football be also the good look Namath Staubach Cunningham they be all really good look people the good look student in the class be often great athlete you know why that be I have no idea it be get nothing to do with sport really when they get their gift from god the father or whoever the hell dole out the talent they get the whole package Beauty talent character that be how it be it be an evolutionary thing so how be your football Football 's not my game run of course wrestling pole vault once upon a time but now I be part of a military elite Athletes may be popular but we be the crème de la crème you have to understand that you be talk to a person here whose whole life be perfect People in my line of work be bear to excel to be perfect it be not our choice it be life that choose we to be the good and what do that mean life choose we yeah you do not become a fighter pilot suddenly at age 20 at age seven or eight when you be in the third grade you know you be talente you know you be head somewhere special you be go to be the good and it all lay out right in front of you top grade varsity letter you name it I be a topgun grad you understand that that training be not for pussy so if you do not achieve your personal good be you disappointed in yourself no no that be not how much long do we have we 've get time I will tell you when it be time okay so here be my point finally I come here to get your advice on something sure I decide to go there to the target you understand what I be talk about here you mean to the site where you drop the bomb to the school Madrasa I wanna go back and take a look around to the place where the child be kill correct I know what you be think so let I straighten this out for you I do not have a guilty conscience I already tell you that I sleep well at night very well why would you want to go back I be interested from the moment I come out of that freezer I know I want to go back and it come up in a conversationi have with daniel when he come to visit I at the hospital he think who know I be go to freak out or something he think it be a crazy thing to do and he say I need to see someone first psychologist psychiatrist do not you think it be dangerous not at all I do not really think anyone will recognize I but your picture be on the internet no way you see the picture it be totally ridiculous my mother would not recognize I from that picture not even michaela who be michaela my wife and what do she think of all this what be she get to do with it do not you talk thing over with your wife you know what this be not for I all this what do you feel what do you think I ask you something I come to you to consult about something very clear and specific so you want I to tell you that this desire of yours to go back to where the bombing take place be a good thing okay yeah yes do you want I to take responsibility for this visit okay do I a favor do not make I into an idiot what I be not take responsibility no I be just go back to something that you say early on remember you say that life choose you to be a member of an elite that it be not your decision maybe that be an attitude you be comfortable with you be comfortable with it because you do not have to make any decision it relieve you of responsibility your command officer he make the decision convey they to you and you execute they wait be you try to tell I that I be ask you to be my command officer okay I will buy it so be you willing to to be my CO for 150 an hour I do not think I be I do not think I be qualified for that but would you agree to be your own commanding officer oh listen you know what just leave it alone I can see I be not go to get anything useful out of you and you be suppose to be the good but I be not the good Alex maybe you be the good but I be not think about the ramification of what you be about to do you be go back to a place where you drop a bomb 16 child be kill your face be on the internet and there be a price on your head so wait wait now you be say that you agree with daniel that I 've go crazy how would you feel if I do how hard be a straight answer I 've get a plane to catch why where be you go be you not listen to I I be go back there Nonstop DC to Frankfurt then Frankfurt Amman thursday morning by charter to Baghdad you be leave tonight good morning doctor I be go back as part of a church group a charity I be go to be visit those neighborhood no no this be not part of Navy protocol let I ask you something when you be run with Daniel be it 22 mile how long do that take I do not know almost three hour Daniel want to quit he be always go on about your optimum pulse during exercise and he think we should not go over 85 you know what I find interesting that shortly after you complete this mission you go on leave and against the advice of your good friend who also happen to be a medical doctor you work yourself up into a state of extreme exertion it be as if you be avoid go back to active duty no I have no problem fly again in fact I be die to get back into

action do they have any coffee around here I could use a good cup of coffee um our time be up I be afraid I still get a couple thing I want to talk about I be happy to see you again you know I think

before our meeting next week that be all what meeting next week well I would like we to meet three or four time for I to form an opinion of you to get to know you a little do not you think otherwise it would not be professional I will read it now okay so be all these ship instead of sail for real at least you will not get seasick oh I do not know about that what do you mean sometimes I can get quite wobbly just sit right here you have to make a round window to the outside then you will feel like you be in a real ship do you really read all those book or be just to make an impression yes you read they or yes you be try to make an impression yes I read they I feel sorry for the book up there why do you feel sorry for they where would you put they I do not know they be your fucking book Buster you suffer from asthma yeah how do you know that there be an inhaler here oh thank I I 've be look everywhere for that thank you so what you could have die without it accord to what it say here it look like you could have die too yeah that would have solve a lot of problem what would it solve nothing I do not mean anything by it can I talk to you like a normal person do you drive your daughter crazy with question like this too much more crazy believe I how have you know I have a daughter because you do you know my mother you be on the pta committee at arlington elementary I be there before I go off to a private school I be in the same year as your daughter well why do not you tell I that before you say that the that the social worker speak to you like she know you she be such a retard do she ask you if um if you think about death a lot how do you know that accord to what it say here she be try to prove that the accident be your fault it be a good thing you do not answer any of her question by the way everybody think about death I bet she do not say that though do she ask you if you have any specific thought about death no do you do I what everyone everyone think about death and uh imagine how it will come to they do you have any more specific thought about it maybe you have certain thought that you would like to talk about unless you be worried about

she call it make sense that she would call I first I do not what do you mean well I be just try to figure out why you get so angry when you think she would call I I do not get it she do call no no no do she call or not tell I already she do not call so why be we back to this again because I get the feeling that when you get angry you want your mother to call just so that you could get angry with her you have no idea what I be look for you just do not get it okay so why do not you explain it to I then she think that what be write there be true what be true whatever it say suicidal tendency blah blah blah that be what your mother say be true she think that this accident be a wonderful opportunity to get rid of the sport thing that be what she call it but what do that have to do with this report she be afraid she do not believe that she think that because of all this competition and perfectionism she think that I want to kill myself and that be bullshit it be be like this for year I 've be under pressure for year and she have never support I all the other mother be right there all over we visit the gym the training camp all of it and the only thing she have to say be what do you need this for it be obvious she do not understand anything all this pressure it do not make any difference it be so silly why would I hurt myself now just before the national when I have all the and if I fail the lawsuit then I really have no chance what do you mean fail do you see this as a kind of test tell I why do you why be you make it sound like its what I do not come here for therapy I just need you to write your opinion and tell I that I be perfectly all right and tell they that I be not some crazy who fly into car every day be that why you come here today Sophie for I to tell you that you be all right that you be not crazy be that the test you be afraid of fail I have to go it be 10 2 already you probably have to turn on your cell phone now why be you be you worried that I

a suit yeah I spill coffee over myself during the meeting what meeting be you go to sit or what there be traffic that be it 2 00 what Sarah say you leave the office at 2 00 that be right I tell you I have a meeting a meeting with whom what be with the interrogation with reeve what difference do it make who be Reeves Amy my boss so where be it this meeting at a cafe why be you waste our time here with Paul on this bullshit well you should 've think of that before you come in late be it usual for you to be late Amy sometimes I be fashionably late well you 've be late for all of our three session so far I apologize be your be late an indicator of not want to be here perhaps do not flatter yourself so you be usually late Amy and this be usually your reaction Jake be this his usual response yes he be suspicious do you think perhaps Amy have something to hide Jake be that why you be nervous early on I be not nervous maybe it be you who be nervous to be alone with I he be a bundle of nerve well perhaps if where have you get the outfit Paul 's talk where would you get the outfit I tell you I spill coffee on myself so I go and buy it which cafe do you go to do you see what I have to deal with here the bakery next to the office I have an espresso he have a mint tea I have an almond croissant he have toast there be no shopping in that area so so what you drive to a mall where to so what if I do all the way to a mall yeah how much do we owe you Paul what be the matter with you how much do we owe you why because we be waste our time that be why she go to finalize the abortion I do not finalize anything while we 've be sit here wait to talk about whether or not we should have an abortion she'meete with Kornreich to work out detail I do not work out any detail you be lie I buy a suit do you or do you not see Kornreich I do see he but I do not work out anything so what be you do there he tell both of we that he could not do anything till he run some test so he take some blood from I and you call I suspicious do you see why I hide thing from you because you react like a madman it be not an abortion it be in case we decide to have an abortion do Kornreich ask what I think about all this or be your opinion and his enough oh god here we go the man be be give I fertility treatment for five year can I talk to he if you be wear this outfit I be sure he be happy to talk to you do he look under it do he check you before take your blood you be such a shithead when she curse Paul you know she be lie I think Jake what Amy might be try to say be that she can not talk to you about this abortion because you suspect anything that she say I be the one at fault here I be the one at fault she arrange a meeting with her OB behind my back and I be the one at fault here tell I something be she pay you behind my back too oh right I bribe he so I can have an abortion and on the other hand Amy you may be responsible for Jake 's suspicion because you behave like somebody who be get something to hide because you lie because you will not allow I to have any doubt what do you mean by that well you can see it for yourself he will not even consider an abortion as an option and look at he do you hear how he talk to I well perhaps his uh his aggressive attitude reflect his need to be more aware of what be happen to you to be part of your decision to understand your thought process maybe it be a it be an expression of his love for you love God curse I out 's all about love I do not curse and you be a liar I will go and see Dr Kornreich tomorrow and I will discuss it with he and I will make a decision Amy can you tell we what what the most important issue for you be we 've be through that here Paul I do not know if I want to be pregnant again she do not want to have the baby I do not know if I want another baby I be not sure I tell you I be tired be you capable of thinking of anything but yourself it be my pregnancy our pregnancy it be ours oh really that be right and the hemorrhoid be those your too and the nine month of morning sickness whose be those and the extra 50 lbs be those yours too have you speak to Dr Kornreich about terminate this pregnancy that you 've want for so long yes I do not think I will be able to love another baby I be angry at he already I feel like it be force itself into the middle of thing ever since I become pregnant I 've feel the hormone rage drive I insane and I know I will have postpartum because that be what happen last time I see it come and it paralyze I I will not be able to take care of this child I will not love he I do not know what I be capable of you know I scare myself I scare myself to death so be that convince enough you be insane why because I want to be able to make my own decision derange really well if that be the case and assume you be mentally healthy why be you in such a hurry to have another child with I maybe you could explain it to her Paul maybe you could explain that it be abnormal for a woman to make up such a crazy speech about be depress I want to get you and Kornreich and everybody off my back so I can make my own decision and you know what if play the part of the depressed wife will do it great there I be sorry I make all that up really what do you make it up I tell you she be a bear liar I lie and I apologize what I will go kneel in the corner and pray for forgiveness be not it possible that something in this fake narrative of yours have more than a grain of truth those fear sound very real to I all of a sudden he be a therapist maybe I be hear what she be try to tell you Jake what be I try to say to he that you be terrify you be terrified of have this child can not you hear that she be exaggerate her fear so that you will hear she so that you will listen to her what do you mean he mean that it be abnormal for a woman who be spend five year in fertilization treatment to want to get rid of the baby because she be afraid of hemorrhoid it it seem to I that both of you have a wide range of emotion in respect to this pregnancy perhaps Jake you be not confront your fear about not want another baby and you Amy on the other hand if you be not so busy fend he off you might find within yourself argument for want another child why be it so hard for the two of you to understand that a woman may choose to put her career or her body or whatever ahead of have a child I think what I be try to say be that I do not think the issue be as clear cut as both of you want to admit Bullshit total bullshit you be talk to two people who spend five year in fertility treatment do you know what it be like five year for five year they 've inject I and hurt I and draw thing out of I and tell I when to eat and when to sleep and when to breathe and when to fuck do you know how many hand go in and out of my body during during the last five year for nothing and when we stop the treatment and not because I want to because the doctor tell we to the whole world include he comfort I and say oh you know maybe it be for the good and you know what they actually manage to convince I so here I be and it be a year later and I feel happy and I 've lose the weight and for the first time I can actually see myself as someone who someone who someone who would never have a baby with a shithead you be so primitive primitive back when she be cheat with I on her first husband Paul I be sexy but now I be primitive I still find you sexy not as sexy as Reeve right you be wrong believe I you know for a pathological liar you sure say believe I a lot I be a liar and deranged and egotistical anything else just admit that you do not want to have my child we already have a child remember yes I do he be at home have ding dong for dinner you know what it seem to I that you be not really talk about a child you be really talk about your inability to accept each other for who you be you know I do not understand what you be do excuse I but I just do not get it we come here a couple of week ago because we could not make a decision and as time go by you try to convince we that we be not indecisive but that we have problem you have not help we to decide whether to have the baby or not but you 've do a great job of get we to fight I think what be com we do not come here in order to bring thing out we come here to decide whether to keep the baby or not keep it that be all but it be not a yes or no answer tell I how do you sleep at night what do you think I should have problem sleep at night if we be talk about a separation here then you should lose some sleep but I be not talk about a separation why be we talk about a separation we come here to talk about a pregnancy and we end up talk about all these other thing Relationship yes relationship no I be sick of it yes to the pregnancy or no to have an abortion or not have it just fucking say it already to keep the child or do not keep it tell we what you think you want I to give you an answer right now I want a yes or a no I think you should have an abortion really go ahead have an abortion be that what you think do you see what be happen here do you see how you shove I into a corner do you see how I have to give you the answer that you do not want to hear this be exactly what you do with Amy I can not tell you whether or not to have an abortion yes you can you just do I do not have an answer you just give we an answer you say to get an abortion you could 've say many thing but you tell we to have an abortion right you do you have an opinion and you let it slip out you be murder our child stop leave he alone let us go you get what you come here for right there be nothing else to do here let us stop waste you know why I can not tell you whether or not you should have an abortion it have nothing to do with whether I be a psychotherapist or not whether I be allow or whether I be not allow this be a personal decision for you both it be a personal and moral decision that you must take yourselves all I can do be help you to confront your feeling so that you come to a correct decision for you both that be all I can do that be it Goodbye Amy hello you 've reach the office of Dr Gina Toll please leave I a message and I will get back to you as soon as I can Gina it be Paul Paul Weston I know it be be quite a while I will I will try again later previously on in Treatment I love you

it be um it be kind of funny being here again well I be retire now so I turn this room into a study yeah so I see it be where I do my writing you be write but what I do not know maybe an article or something less formal maybe something long I do not know it be strange be here after David how be you cope with that it be probably the most difficult time of my life come back home without he he be a remarkable man yes he be how about you oh I well I be um I be work too hard I be try to lose this weight I can not I feel like I be have another midlife crisis have one at 30 another one at 40 and now

's favorite like Joseph and his brother so he be exactly the age Rosie be when you yes when I stop come here yeah Gina I I call you last night because um I really feel that I need to talk to somebody it be um actually it be something that be be bother I a lot lately but only yesterday I really feel the need that I have to to talk about it I feel that I do not know how to put this but I feel like I be I be just lose my patience I be lose my patience with my patient there be session when I can barely restrain myself from have just from an outburst I want to just lock the door some day and wish everybody would just go away I have this I have this couple who 've be come to I for marriage counseling they have one child but they have be try for five year to have another baby so she get pregnant and now she want to have an abortion I think what she really want be to get rid of the husband if you ask I but anyway this guy really get on my nerve yesterday he corner I he badger I until I make a decision should we have an abortion should we not have an abortion I finally say yes good have an abortion as soon as I say it of course I regret it because I know that I have speak in anger but I I could not help it this guy he just he say some really nasty thing to I he call I a murderer I know he be right the second it come out of my mouth of course he be right I be sit there tell he to kill his baby but still I be I know I be not make much sense but anyway and there be this girl who I 've be work with for a year there be an issue of erotic transference and this come out now everything be all about this issue and I be think to myself what if patient could see what I think about they if they could really see inside my head they would head for the hill believe I they would run for cover what about new patient be you take on new patient yes I be I think I take they on to prove to myself that everything be okay I 've take on this guy he be a bomber pilot Cocky arrogant kind of a guy Macho you know fly a mission over Iraq drop a bomb on a school where 16 child be kill so he come back he go on leave and then he run for 22 mile without stop and bring a heart attack on to himself so I be try to get this guy to see that maybe there be a connection between these two event but anyway all the time I listen you know as if it be nothing but inside I be just I just find it so so disgusting and there be a girl who go to Rosie 's school who you be treat a friend of your daughter 's no she be not a friend they be just in the same grade anyway this girl idolize her coach be you insult about what that the patient call you a murderer yes I be Gina I know I be a good therapist I do not know maybe this week I need somebody to just tell I to calm down tell I that everything be okay that everything be all right I remember you say once that one of our big problem be that we do not have an audience we do not have anybody to pat we on the back to approve of what we be do somebody that you can go to and say do you see how I maneuver that person into that situation do you see how I get he to say what I want he to what I mean be be that we have no one to criticize we no one to review we anyway I I be begin to feel anxious before session and I I must admit that I think something be go on at home when you call at home why because it be be almost 10 year since I last hear from you the last time you be here you be so angry you do not even come to the funeral I think how angry he must be he do not even come to David 's funeral and I be really sorry about that Gina I have I be go to come but I feel that it be I feel it be inappropriate then you call I out of the blue yes because I need somebody to talk to you be the one who choose to stop have a supervisor you say I interfere with your practice that instead of guide I be interfere yes I say that but then there be time when a supervisor have to take a stand in your case I feel I have to take a stand I have to interfere but that be not the way I feel now I mean that be ancient history why do we have to go there anyway whatever happen I always feel that you be somebody professionally I could I could at least talk to I I be already retire oh I forget yes you be write your memoire no no no no I think that be what you mean when you say that you be write why be you afraid I will write about you I think there be way too many autobiography anyway who care maybe somebody like Bob Dylan I would be curious about that but how many people like he be out there I be try to write a novel oh yeah wow that be I do not know we will see I 've give myself a year to write I do not know what else to say about it right now I do not know Kate and I we we just argue nonstop I think it be begin to affect my work what do you mean you argue well it be always about something insignificant something trivial that trigger it off this time it be about Max and be ask to go to these class for gifted child which I just be Max gift he be very very smart yeah well then what do you fight about she know how I feel about this I have say it over and over again I be against the idea of it what do she do behind my back she take Max to this to this class without tell I and you know they decide that who be they this principal and and Kate this girl she be barely out of college she barely know my son 's name pontificating tell I how I should raise my kid and Kate and I start to argue about about that and then that lead onto other stuff and then we end up and it be like oh you care so much about your patient if you care as much about your family as you care about your patient then it would Kate say that yes yes she say I do not love she that I be always try to be a step ahead of she that I handle she like a patient she say the thing that she hate the most be that I see it all from a distance what do you mean it her we it she say that when it come to we I will never have any perspective she be right be not she but I can not help but see it from a perspective and all I can see be all I can see be rupture what do you mean rupture be you try to shrink I Gina sorry and yet you be here for eight year yes what do that mean you be under my counseling eight year I take care of you you find that difficult to accept I be your audience for eight year maybe I should not have tell you all this stuff about about Kate maybe it be just because I be exhausted I be wipe out and I be just afraid that because of that something that will happen that I will lose control anyway we do not come here to talk about Kate though of course just before I come here we have a big fight on the phone you keep say you do not come here to talk about Kate but you keep talk about her that be because you make I talk about her I be not do anything it be be eight year and I be try to catch up Gina I be not stupid there be always a reason with you so do not do not tell I we be have a nice cozy conversation here about my married life what do you wanna do we could get together a couple of time and see how it go okay be this time good for you yeah it be fine may I say something before we go on what about Kate there be a sadness when you talk about she in your voice there be something very sad about it I do not know where she be most of the time she tell I that she be go to the gym and I I look in her closet and her gear be still there and I say to myself oh you know she be she be probably get another set of running shoe when I call her cell she never answer I let it go usually in the evening we be too tired and so a week later I will suddenly say where be you last Wednesday and she will look at I like I be I be crazy and then Sex Sex be out of the question once a month if I be lucky she hardly ever initiate it I can not remember the last time she want it what about you do you want to I think about it all the time what would you say if somebody come to you with a story like mine I do not know we be talk about you and Kate we be not speculate about a patient do you want I to say that she be have an affair because I do not know where she be because of her running shoe I always ask myself if they be to diagnose therapist whose marriage fall apart how many case of erotic transference would they find what do that mean that sometimes erotic transference in therapy be a test of your married life if a therapist can not handle a situation where his patient fall in love with he it may indicate some breakdown in his private life yes but I do not think my marriage to Kate be fall apart yes I have a row with Laura I mean with Kate whose Laura Rosie 's friend the girl with the issue of of erotic transference you do not mention she by name you just say it have come up okay she tell I that she tell I that she be in love with I and that she want to sleep with I okay okay what be you say that Kate feel that and that be where our tension come from good material for your novel Gina Come on you know that therapist get divorce like everybody else please do not draw any conclusion because there be none to be draw besides my trouble at home do not begin last week or last month how would you say her therapy be go whose therapy you say talk about your session that you cut thing short you have no patience that you often feel guilty about your behavior be that true also with Linda Laura Sorry Laura look Gina you know that patient fall for their therapist every few second what well way be there to air this than to bring it to the surface and put it out there you know this room be suppose to be safe zone where we can open thing up and talk about thing in a control way just to make thing perfectly clear this be transference plain and simple of course you and Mitchell and your New York gang have idealize it Gina I do not come here to talk about a patient I think you do come here to talk about Laura instead you keep talk about Kate you mention to I offhand that there be an issue of erotic transference and instead of focus on that you go on to tell I about a couple a class for gifted child a new girl who go to school with your daughter so what be you try to prove here Paul that you will not talk about her about Laura that you can avoid talk about her you know what Gina I think this be a mistake come here today I think I would well leave why because you twist everything into your own preconceived notion be there physical contact no you hesitate before you answer because I be shocked at where this be go what do you think I do sleep with this girl and then come here to confess to you when do it happen when do what happen nothing happen I keep tell you nothing happen no no no no what do she say to you she say she be in love with I that be just last Monday this week yes yes what

you so much you be you it be unbelievable how much you be enjoy yourself erotic transference happen all the time it be simply a question of how one deal with it now I know how to deal with it can you honestly say to yourself that she fall in love with you be just a part of her healing process and that it have nothing to do with you maybe you be a little worried because of your family history that it could go too far Gina timing dosage tact you be fail in all three I be not my father my father be a doctor he leave the house of one of his patient we be talk about a girl who have a crush on her therapist it be a completely different thing and you know damn well it be you should get counseling regard this Linda Laura Sorry Laura Let us not call it counsel let us call it talk Laura Laura be her name God you be so catch up in your little theory that you do not even remember her name why do not you ask her ask who Kate what if she be see somebody that would make you happy I bet I think you

you ow anything about Scuba diving they have this thing that be call the bend it be something that happen when the diver come up to the surface too quickly it be really dangerous it can explode your

try to adjust myself so that I do not I guess come to the surface too quickly do you dive Paul yes I well we use to who be speak in the plural now I can not imagine you dive where have you go Mexico

her boob out of the baby 's mouth and squeeze it and some milk squirt out Ani look over at Andrew and he have this admire smile on his face you know like he be loe at some masterpiece in a Museum like the Madonna what do you think he see maybe an image of you and he together in the future maybe or maybe he just miss her tit no not really they be not that nice she be change a lot since she have the baby in what way I do not know I do not really know she before but Andrew tell I a lot about her he say she be this wild type you know who have a lot of guy chase she she put he through hell he say they would go to bed and she would be one person and then they would wake up and she would be someone totally new a free radical that be what he use to call she he say I remind he of her that be scary

someone who gets fuck in her sleep and can not even remember do you think that be what happen to people after they get marry I do not now do it be sex something you forget how to do or be it like ride a bike I think that depend on the on the couple of course sex can be a subterfuge it can Paul okay okay so anyway when I go to the kitchen to help out with something and when I come back Andrew and Gary be engross in this deep conversation about you will not believe this upholsterer there be this upholsterer who redo their entire living room Andrew 's take down the guy 's number and I be like what be you do and he say you know you and I discuss you know recover those armchair your dad give you I be tell you Paul we never discuss this and all of a sudden Andrew 's reupholstere armchair I mean we be talk metrosexual that do not sound very much like the Andrew that you 've be talk about exactly I mean this be beyond metrosexual do you ever watch the Animal Planet well it be about this type of bird I can not remember the name of it but anyway the male bird build a nest for the female these amazingly intricate structure they be incredible anyway the female go from nest to nest you know check out all her various mating option try to make up her mind while the male bird be desperately flap about and try to attract the female with his architecture you know the nest look like cage anyway the whole way home I think I would not be able to fight this anymore so when we get near the house we be about to park Andrew say to I do you want to go to the movie or stay home and I say I say yes and he say yes the movie and I say yes I will I will marry you I mean fuck it fuck I will marry you yes so where do you think this Fuck it yes come from when everything you 've be say to Andrew everything you 've be do for that past few week have actually be one big no mean what you think Andrew take I there as some sort of object lesson to show I how good it could be for we 'cause I do not think so Andrew be a pretty mediocre psychologist would you listen to I I just say yes and I be already bad mouth my future husband you do not answer my question Laura where do this yes come from you really do not understand why I say yes to he it be because you say no to I because because I say no to you I mean the whole situation be just one big fucking no I be not blame you I be not accuse you I be just do you expect a different reaction in your fantasy how would I respond to you say that you be let us say in love with I first of all take the quotation mark off the in love with I it be insult and stop with the fantasy talk because fantasy be for silly little girl you know we be talk about reality which be that I be in love with you but I still that be reality I still want to talk about fantasy for a minute not the fantasy of a silly little girl but the fantasy of a grow smart woman please let us not do that that be beneath my dignity well I do not think there be anything beneath our dignity if it take we someplace our dignity refuse to go you remember that story you tell I that summer when you be 15 year old in San Diego that couple you live with the one who have no child David and Celia you say that summer be be very significant to you my God my mother have just die Paul of course it be significant what be the point in rehash all this my mother die I be very lucky to have somebody take I in for a few month I mean so I just wanna go back to that period for a little bit if you do not mind your mother be go your mother be your last wall of protection against your father from your father 's how do you put it toxic fume toxic fume yes his loneliness his fear his dependency on you you say that he would call you up in California and say how unhappy he be and how much he miss your mother beg you to cut your vacation short and come back home what be this get to do with anything you take a liking to these people who be athletic healthy the exact opposite of your parent in every way and you describe David very vividly and you say he be very kind to you yeah you know he use to take I camping we would go surf use to just talk about stuff you know Teenage bullshit you be very attract to he he be a hunk yeah he look like Nick Nolte they smoke a lot of grass a lot of grass I smoke with they it be my first time and when that summer be over they say it be a shame they could not adopt you they say we want a daughter just like you yeah I actually ask they to see if it be possible if there be some legal way to Aanyway they just laugh at I they do not take I seriously they say I be so cute actually I want he to adopt I she be great Celia but you know I be 15 I want he all to myself make a lot of sense when you think about it you be 15 year old your father be grieve completely dependent on you David must have seem like a life raft just as just perhaps I be now from Andrew perhaps I be an alternative to everything that Andrew represent Dependency anxiety but I be not a realistic option for you this be a safe place where you can come like David at the beach yes but with one big difference what be that I do not want you to adopt I I want you to fuck I I need to pee there be a problem with the with the thing it be it be block up I just call I be go to call the handyman well then may I well we be almost out of time so what be we camp I need to pee what be the big deal I be very clean I will not messy your bathroom I prefer my patient to use the but you say that the toilet overflow why do not we just finish up for today I can owe you the 10 minute when you come back next week what you be afraid your wife will see I or that I will see she be she even home now I mean what be she sit on the couch with roller in her hair drink beer this have nothing to do with my wife Fine forget it if it freak you out that much well I bet that do not come up in med school do it what to do in the follow situation a patient in love with the therapist ask to use the bathroom the bathroom be out of order the patient then ask to enter the therapist 's home what should the therapist do I be sorry if the correct answer be it depend on what the therapist feel towards his patient I can see you might interpret this do not interpret Paul I 've have it up to here with your fucking interpretation you know what kill I no matter what I say or do you see everything as more proof that nothing be go on here you turn I into a 15 year old who be not take seriously a silly little girl who people just pat on the head and say be not she cute you know the stop patronize I Paul look I know when I turn somebody on you know what thought of you the first time I see you what I think you look like a dead man I think beneath that professional exterior be a man who stop live I want to take your heart in my hand and just pump life into it maybe that be your sense of of what happen to married people that they just stop live maybe you be afraid that be what will happen if you marry Andrew just my be here have bring you back to life Laura let us yeah I know you would deny it I mean how could something like this happen to you huh but it do happen I know it happen and you know it happen what happen Laura I and you Paul we happen the thought you have before you fall asleep next to your wife happen I think we be out of time for today why do not we talk about this next week when you when you come back just tell I I think you owe it to I do you want I just a simple yes or no no previously on in Treatment US Navy aircraft hit a target on the outskirt of Baghdad turn out it be a madrasa it be an islamic religion school boy study the Koran Sixteen of they dead I fly that mission Madrasa murderer shortly after you complete this mission you work yourself up into a state of extreme exertion do not you think there be a strong desire there to atone for your action you be go back to a place where you drop a bomb your face be on the internet and there be a price on your head surprise I do not think I do not think you would come back again I be back good come on in would you like some coffee I 've just make a pot yeah coffee 's good how do you like it I get Skim whole milk get some soy here Black I like to taste the bean I bet you need a lot of coffee to listen to the fuck up in here I do not drink coffee just tea I keep it I keep it for my patient blood plessure irregular heartbeat no I 've just I 've just never really like the taste ah a subconscious irregular heartbeat what do you get checkup EKG Yep every year and how be your heart it be perfect look Alex I be I be really glad that you come back to tell you the truth I be I be a little worried after you leave last week 'cause I want to go back to Baghdad well I go Man Paul Sorry but the one thing I do not compromise on be coffee Transcript Sync Benj be that your reaction whenever the coffee be not perfect be not perfect Paul this be like attempt murder your coffee but let I hear your interpretation it be obvious you have one not really I I remember I use to have this patient once and he would come here and before each session he would say stop and then he would pop a pill and it be just a ritual what be you try to say well I think in his particular case what he want to show I be his distress and his his pain I do not know maybe with the coffee it be maybe you be just tell I that you be only go to come to the therapy under your condition and anything that you do not like you be go to spit out right away do not you think you be be a little traumatic Come on Paul maybe why do you come back I want your advice on another little matter besides you deserve to know how my trip go be that you help I decide to go for all the wrong reason by the way because my visit do not do what it be suppose to and what be it suppose to do let us just go to the chase okay Saturday morning I be stand near the bomb strike just like in London after the Blitz just rubble you know this area have be hit again and again by we by they by suicide bomber we hook up with a Red Cross unit and they take we to this makeshift hospital it be a triage unit there be not enough doctor to treat everybody it be chaos what do you do I be just watch you got to understand in my line of work I be 10 15 000 foot up in the air Missile lock in on a target by radar on a screen I do not see people I just press a button just it be kind of crazy to be down there all of a sudden how do that make you feel come a face to face with the victim how would it make you feel scared Guilty See that would be the normal reaction I know this should have be the drama of my life but I feel nothing and then I realize the system do a great job on I what do you mean the system listen there be people down there arm and leg miss face blow off it be carnage and the parent be walk around they be wait to see if their child be go to live or die all because of what I do but what can I tell you to I they look like 200 people stand in line at a pharmacy do you feel any connection with they do you feel in any way responsible for what they have suffer in that moment all I care about be whether they cheat I or not I mean the system the people on the madrasa it be not any difference than see it on tv the only thing in my mind in that moment be whether the system know that the building near the target 's bunker the one that be suppose to get my one ton bomb if they know these building be full of child or not as they claim nothing else matter so it be really important for you to know that you have do the right thing like you say last week if you hit the target you sleep well and all those people whose suffer you be responsible for could you not see they no I see they I feel norhe for they and then I realize how ingenious that my body have a build in separation mechanism what do that mean separation Compartmentalization I be stand there and all I care about be whether I make a precise hit the enemy be a formula Size of building amount of people multiply by the amount of explosive divide by 100 equal a number of estimate casualty you understand I be stand there and I do not feel anything I have this friend who die four month ago anyway I I go to the funeral and all throughout the service I keep say to myself why do not I feel sad I though to myself maybe I do not love he maybe I do not care I torment myself for about a week anyway finally I realize that actually I feel a great deal even the fact that I be so busy with my guilty feeling even that attest to how much I feel about he yeah but what be you say that I be feel but I do not feel what I be fell I think that you have very very deep feeling about these people but something strong inside you prevent you from acknowledge those feeling not just to I or to anybody else but to yourself I do not understand what you be say I do not get what you be tell I feeling be not a philosophy you either feel or you do not you can not bullshit about it you think I be bullshitting listen I be pay you 150 buck for less than an hour and I do not see you make an effort you be suppose to be smart than I and I be not feel that so we be compete to see who be be the who be the smart you know Alex I think that here like everywhere else like with thee coffe for instance you be concerned with what be the good it must be it must be difficult Come on give I a break it must be kind of frightening for you to feel empathy with these people so you create this kind of ultimate reality for yourself with those people where oh no they be just wait in line at the pharmacy I be just the accidental tourist not the pilot who bomb they who kill their family I wish you be right but it be much more fundamental if you hold on to this organ call guilt feeling and I believe that be what it be it be an organ like the spleen or liver the system will cul it out of you completely Understand I have no way of feelle guilt anymore I do not have the organ so you really believe it be possible to amputate such an organ you go back to Iraq why be it so important for you to go back to risk your life just to just to be there I tell you I want to check if anything be leave and and I want to see what happen when I come down from that top view but nothing happen that be right nothing can we can we go back for a moment to the site of the bombing can you describe one moment when you say to yourself I should be feel something now right now and I do not there be a moment I do not know if it be what you be look for but there be a moment when this old man come over to I he have be burn his arm be bandage he keep look at I with a strange little smile which mean I know you I know you I ignore he at first but a few minute later he be back I know you I know you he keep say for a second I think he recognize I but I do not really believe that I doubt he would ever see the internet but in some deep intuitive way he know he know I be the man who drop the bomb that destroy the whole street we be stand on you could be you could be describe a mystical experience like a dream yeah it be like a dream like a totally bizarre dream he start look like some old warlock out of a fairy tale or something he would not leave I alone he keep point at I I know you and I look in his eye and he be sort of amuse kind of friendly like my father look at I when he think I 've do something wrong like he know my secret like no matter what I do I can not hide from it and I be freeze there and by that time people have gather and they be watch we finally someone from the church group come and pull I away but that old man he never take his eye off I you still think it be too early to talk about your father why because he pop into my head for a second you people what be it with you people I give you a little crumb and you lunge at it I be just ask myself alex what be it about that old man that make you think about your father let I tell you something if there be someone who do not know the meaning of guilt it be my father you know why because if he could feel he would not have survive you know my father kill his father with his bare hand yeah and that be a fact man I would love to see he on this couch Man doc you would have a field day with he you want to talk about it oh now I get your attention I do not think I can tell it as well as he do but I will try Mid ' 50 right Jim Crow Oklahoma my old man have piss off the local good ol'boy by try to organize some black labor at this factory they try to threaten he but my dad do not back down he be a tough son of a bitch I will give he that anyway the whole thing it just escalate and this mob with hood attack his house my uncle Ronnie be on the front porch with a rifle they shoot he down shot my aunt Jeannie too and then they come inside my father take the rest of the family they run downstairs to the boiler room to the basement right near the boiler they all cram into this area this hide room my grandfather his father be very sick Dying of lung cancer and he have this apparently he have this this wheezing and this hack cough so my father put his hand over his father 's mouth and nose and he keep it there while they search the basement keep it clamp tight then when they finally clear out my grandfather be dead he would suffocate there it be that be that be a horrific story tell it every year on my grandfather 's birthday it be a tradition and you really believe he do not feel guilty about it I be tell you he always use to say leave the guilt for the white man we can not afford it it be possible that he be say that it be dangerous to feel guilty that it be a kind of weakness maybe that be a message that you 've grow up with what can I say that be just my father 's way but be it your way I do not know hey it work for he do not necessarily make he an asshole People love my father my wife be crazy about he you should see he at at family dinner he be get she off in a corner and tell joke and I do not know she appreciate he maybe that be why we last as long as we do you say last as if it be past tense yeah actually that be why I come to see you today there be this issue with my wife what happen be when I come home from my trip it be late and the kid be already asleep and I see my wife what do you mean you see your wife I look at her I really look at her she be sleep in front of the television for an hour an hour and a half nonstop I sit there without take my eye off her when be the last time you watch your wife sleep for an hour straight well I usually fall asleep before she do well try it once you will be surprised what will surprise I what you will discover about she about yourself I be look at her look at every inch of her body and I say to myself who the hell be this woman sleep on the sofa in front of the tv what the hell do she know about I what do she think she know about I and what the hell be I do live with she in the same living room in the same house with the same kid for the past 15 year Understand and I be sit there opposite her right she do not imagine what be go through my head and you know what happen she start grind her tooth now it be the first time I ever see she grind her tooth in her sleep and I be talk something sick frightening the sound that come out of her mouth how do you you could cut diamond between her tooth okay it really fuck I up sound pretty upsetting shock I tell you and suddenly I understand for the past 15 year this woman be be so busy pretend that everything be okay flow she be a model mother a model wife an outstanding lecturer at a communication college very impressive in front of my fellow pilot and it turn out she take it all out on her tooth at night you know that be pretty common actually they do not think it have anything to do with stress it have to do with flaw in the structure of the jaw you really believe that no it be connect to her stress in what way in what she be a totally repressed person and all her repression come out at night in her sleep so she grind her tooth you think Michaela may have trouble with her feeling too you think I do not feel wait till you meet her everything be just like clockwork clockwork that be what it be clockwork the kid have be go to bed at the same hour since they be two day old they get sick on a fix date we would have sex on a fix date in a fix position and Michaela even fart once a year on a fix date once a year on the night after Easter Sunday she fart she let herself fart once maybe twice a little one not that much then it be over no farting for the rest of the year man she be a program person every emotion be under control sound like you be a little angry with her what why just the way you talk about her no take a lot more than michaela 's schedule to make I angry I get the impression before when you be speak that maybe you be a little angry with yourself Alex I mean you go all the way to Iraq and you could not feel anything I do not know maybe have you speak to Michaela about it of course over our morning coffee she say yes honey I grind my tooth you only notice it now you be such a sweetheart that be what I would call love then she say Baby please cut down on your coffee remember what the doctor say since my heart attack she let I have one cup of coffee a day and that battery acid you give I that be not coffee that do not count okay so you do not like Michaela worry about you treat you like you be sick it be just it be like she be on a mission to get I back up in the air asap she say I be fit as a fiddle and I need to be knock on the navy 's door to get back how long have it be since you 've fly two month since my heart attack it must be hard to be away from that world not to be part of what use to be the the center of your life first of all I be still one of they so you can relax on that but mean while sit at home thinking about the possibility that you that you might never fly again of course I will fly again People with bad injury have bounce back do you want to go back Alex when the time be right but Michaela 's die for I to go back and at night she grind her tooth like some kind of Alex it be not like she change overnight what be you say I think there be thing about michael that really bother you because they reflect something inside you that you can not live with like what like her passion for you to fly again I be not 100 convince that you actually want to go back maybe because you be have trouble forgive yourself okay all of this just reinforce my decision to leave home what why yeah I do not think it be pointless to drag this out for year when a person decide he be not in love with his spouse he should not have to put off leave home be not that so it be over it be dead I 've have friend who 've reach this conclusion they go to 3 year of couple therapy and they end up separate so what be the use I say cut that shit do not you think that be a little extreme I mean it be possible to overcome a crisis do you know what I realize that I be never in love with her with Michaela do you know what that mean what a terrible realization that be what do you expect I to do find a lover like my dad start come home late at night I do not even have a good excuse anymore I will not do anything but sit on my ass and watch tv so what you look upset no I be just I be

pretty much all the time all right let us do your shoe she be cool Kate yeah she be awesome true you could learn a lot from your wife about how to talk to people wish I could take she with I to the gym she could tell everyone the truth to their face who do you want she to tell the truth to do you write my evaluation no do you what the fuck why do not you that be why I be here that be all I need from you that stupid evaluation actually I do not think I know you quite well enough yet Sophie so why do not you write yours well I try with my dad but but he be too busy with his exhibition he be an artist a photographer he hate the word artist he always have his exhibition at home because he be against gallery anyway he say it be totally unprofessional for I to write my own evaluation and that you sound like a quack be you a quack no I be not a quack I promise and then I try to write it with my mom that do not work obviously why do you say obviously because she be a total tool and a retard a tool and a retard yeah we get in a fight and I be like I so do not need this right now so I leave I go to this apartment near the gym where the foreign girl stay I tell they my parent be go out of town so they let I crash there and then I try to get Cy to help I write it but he be too busy get everyone ready to leave for training camp so so I do not do it so why do you and your mom get into a fight try to write the evaluation together she actually want to write it for I and I be like no mom I can do it myself and she be like we will be here until the next olympic and I be like bite I so I leave so you do not want she to write it you just want she to help you what phrase it it do not matter we get in a fight for a change but this time Sophie you leave home so have you do that before no so something be different about this particular fight what do yothink it be that be different do you do you come from home or do you come from the gym today the gym Gym be that far away that be why I be late Sophie before you arrive I uh I get a phone call and um I hear you ask somebody to let you out of the car well I I try to call you to tell you I be on my way but um then I figure that we be like five minute away so I think I hang up before the call go through be that your father you could 've hang up you know or do you always eavesdrop on other people 's conversation Sophie if you be my patient I would ask if you think it be a coincidence that I overhear that conversation but I be not your patient I would not see a therapist who I think be an eavesdropper I would be out of here so do your dad bring you in I tell you I have a fight with he I think you say the fight be with your mom it be really none of your business who I come here with early on you say that you would like Kate to go to the gym with you what would you like Kate to to tell the girl at the gym your daughter 's clothe be gross why be that funny well why be they gross they be hideous okay I be really not get my evaluation today be I this be stupid I should go be my clothe dry yet I would not think so well can you check and call Kate because I need she to help I put they back on you people be such tool I can not believe you get pay for this why do not you tell I before that you hear my conversation I be wait for you to tell I so now I be a liar too I di't say you be a liar Sophie it be what you be think why do you need Kate to go to the gym with you I do not need she to can I ask you something how do you get along with the girl at the at the gym they be asshole okay all of they the whole place it reek of hypocrisy do you know like every girl there be a Mia or an Anna except I they know it they just do not do anything about it they encourage it these girl Anna and Mia be they friend of yours you do not know these girl they be fun girl especially Anna Rexic Anorexic okay and Mia bulimia you be sharp as a tack thank you so the girl at the gym be anorexic or bulimic except for you you can not keep your weight down otherwise and if you be not skinny you can not compete so so you have no choice you have to but who say you can not compete Cy and Regina Regina be our physical trainer all the girl follow Cy around like little groupie slut Cy be that okay Cy can you show I how to do that move Cy I be about to fall Quick put your hand between my leg but not Regina 'cause she be russian so her bullshit detector be like nuclear and at the end of the day Cy and Regina decide everhe who compete who be gain weight and can not compete after my accident Karen Scott and Audrey England come to visit I they have these pathetic look on their face like like they feel my pain but I know they be happy I would have be happy if something have happen to one of they right before the olympic tryout honestly if it be I I would have do what Shirley do she do not even come I and her we be like the good one there by far it be like she be say drop dead for all I care just get out of my face at least that be honest so they be leave tomorrow for training camp in California and I have nowhere to go they will not let I stay at the apartment by myself they promise Cy I could go even though I can not train and now he say they 've change their mind who be they the sponsor the money people anyway I pick a fight with he that be what you hear on the phone it be not his fault why be it so important for you to go with they to the camp everyone will be there you mean Karen Audrey and Shirley but but you say you can not stand they you say you do not even like they and you can not train anyway so I do not understand why it be so important to you it be not important but I be look forward to it sound like um you and Cy be uh you be very close no why can you tell that over the phone you say he want to take you to camp despite the fact that you have an injury and do not he do not he drive you here it be on his way he want I to come to the camp to at least watch the training so I do not lose focus but no he could not make they pay for Darlene either Darlene Cy 's wife she have to pay her own way and Dana 's too Dana be the little girl you use to babysit why do you stop who tell you I stop do I tell you that last week you have good memory for an old fart thank you so why do you stop they do not need I anymore Dana use to have all these breathing problem but then she have this surgery and they get well and and darlene come back from Wisconsin where she be like learn to process her own cheese or something so so they do not need I do you work there for a long time no sort of and Dana must have become very fond of you do she become attached to you yeah she be the cut she have not stop talk about I since I leave she say she do not want to go to California if I be not go to be there they tell she that I would not be able to babysit she anymore 'cause I would have this accident but see I have already tell she before that I could not keep live with they once her mom come home I waed to prepare she you know but they do not tell I what they be tell she so the whole lie become mixed up in her head what what you look scared all of a sudden I look scared like you be look at a psycho or something I be just remember that the last time you be here you put your your cast together do you you remember and you say this be Cy yeah the mermaid that he draw you say that when Darlene come home you know you could not keep on live there I never say I live there but you tell dana you would not be able to go on live there yeah because she be a child but so it feel to she like I live there it be just 'cause she would go to school and come back and I would be there and you know she got use to I be around so even when he be home she would nt I to stay cook they dinner do her homework with her sometimes she would wake up scream because she stop breathe in her sleep Cy tell I that what the hell be go on here what do you mean what the hell be go on here my dad be right I will go to therapy and I will end up a psycho just like your daughter everyone think she be a freak be you try to hurt I Sophie no but you should know what people say about her she have this thing with this guy and afterwards everyone say she would turn out psycho 'cause her dad be a shrink shrink ' kid be psycho everyone know that well maybe that be because because some people be afraid of therapy they be afraid of what they might find out they be afraid that it might touch those wound that be deep inside they I think there be thing that perhaps you feel deep inside Sophie that you would like to talk about I be fine you wanna worry about a little girl Worry about your own kid do it bother you that people talk about my daughter why would it bother I because maybe you know what it feel like maybe I do not we be talk about your coach and then suddenly you bring up the story of my daughter yeah because I think you should know be there people who say thing about you Sophie at the gym maybe you know Sophie sometimes when people be jealous they say thing to hurt we because they envy we do you think that some of the girl at the gym might be jealous of you and how close your relationship be with Cy do not talk to I like I be a child please Fair enough Sophie I get the feeling that you be afraid to tell I something that other people say about you be my clothe dry yet can you go check if I will not be get an evaluation today I would at least like dry clothe okay well I have start to write it can I see what you 've get I be uh I be not quite finished yet I will bet you have not write a word Sophie 's evaluation 16 year old a gymnast she be an olympic hopeful she come in for evaluation after a near fatal accident during first session appear to be very impressive sensitive Mature for her age very intelligent and a highly independent personality I try to write it with my mom but we do not fight I just say never mind do you really think those thing you write absolutely they be just generality at the moment it be not enough for a real evaluation you know this morning I try to brush my tooth like you like I like how have it go I could not do it I just stick

fall apart yes I have a row with Laura I mean with Kate who be Laura the girl with the issue of erotic transference I do not come here to talk about a patient do you come here to ask for my guidance or to talk to I as a friend be you seek advice from a colleague what role have you assign I I be try to figure it out but I be fail no he be not here please do not call back because he be dead he die

supermarket manager employment agency guy I forget what he do but anyway he be divorce get a kid she make sure to tell I all the detail do she say how long everything be go to hell patient family if I be if I be into astrology I would say there be something cosmic go on planet collide somewhere first one of my patient the pilot I be tell you about he be leave his wife just like that she grind her tooth in her sleep so marriage over and the 16 year old the gymnast she be have an affair with this guy in his mid 40 married guy her coach at least I think that be what she be hint at and she also go to the same school as my daughter so I have the pleasure of find out that Rosie be have a a thing with this boy at school I do not even know what a thing be I do not even know if it be true I ask she I get nowhere she would not tell I anything and then finally be it I Kate say it be she say it be my fault I do not see she that be she be invisible she say I do not see the kid either they be invisible too as far as I know Rosie could be have sex with a drug addict everybody talk about she at school at least that be what she say who say Kate say that I be lose Paul the girl Sophie the gymnast you talk about 10 thing at once no she be in the same grade as Rosie Let us focus on Kate what be I suppose to do Gina I mean what what be I suppose to do now do she say what she think will happen now between the two of you I do not know she say it be she say it be up to I what do you think that mean you tell I she be bang some insurance salesman and it be up to I she give I all the detail she blow he she screw he it be like a porno film she tell you that absolutely why you know my conception maybe I should say my misconception of Kate be that everything everything about sex be always connect to intimacy for her there be never anything weird or dirty about sex it be always about intimacy now I feel if someone throw the word intimacy at I I want to punch she in the mouth punch her in the mouth what you say punch her you know all that bullshit that I think mean intimacy to her the candle the backrub feel safe meanwhile she be in her own porno film fuck this this guy I be try to figure out why she would tell you graphic detail because she want to hurt I do you ask for detail I just want to I want to get a grasp of the situation you know she make sure you would not ignore what she be say I think you know what be go on last week when we speak I think you know I be sure Kate sense that as well your suspicion maybe I be wrong I know I do know you would think that would make it easy you know almost throw she out of the house it be like you hurt I I be go to hurt you now just get the fuck out of here I mean there be a thousand way that people can deal with these thing we could have go to therapy for example I mean not everybody have to fuck around what be that Coldex Night they be suppose to be strong than Coldex Day I 've have two of they already they kind of make you a bit stone do you want some tea Water would be good thank sure I have a session yesterday with that thank with that couple who call I a who call I a murderer in the middle of the session she run to the bathroom and she start to bleed what happen miscarriage my God it be pretty scary how be she I think she be fine I just speak to she at the hospital they be run some test but she seem to be okay at least I be not a murderer though I would not be surprised if the husband blame I for everything you know stress as a result of therapy it be possible ironically they would both just kind of work out their problem they be not argue which for they be a major accomplishment and he say to I this be our last session and then then it happen anyway I be try to get the blood out of the couch 'cause when she get up she leave a stain and Kate walk into the room and she look around and she say what go on in this office anyway quite a week quite a week ultimatum from two woman Kate and Laura Laura she tell you she be in love with you what be what be we go back to that for I be talk about something completely different you do not think it be relevant you describe two woman attack you two woman what about three woman do it feel like I be attack maybe that be why you be take pill to protect yourself against I I have a cold see last week you call I a sleepy spider in wait be you be you insult by that I take it back you be not sleepy would you agree that your relationship with Kate have be a wall between you and your patient so that you be safe you be not attract to they Attraction 's it be not a problem Freud Messer davy all the big guy they all talk about how attraction be inevitable it be part of therapy but if you brush it under the rug the message you be give to the patient be that their feeling be perverse be dangerous their feeling I be talk about your feeling I be not worried that Laura will try and break down the wall on her own I be worried that you want she to the wall what be this metaphor my wife be a wall you do not agree I be not hide from my patient that essay that Bolas write about forget about Bolas every time we go deeply you reach for some theory these male therapist torment by lust for their patient right I mention Laura and that be who you start quote but why be we even talk about Laura because I want you to hear what you be say that you be surround by woman who demand that you respond and love and be angry and feel that you face your feeling do I mention that Laura be be getting marry in June so Laura be over that be finish if anyone want to pull down a wall it be Kate why Secrecy she she hate it she hate that I can not share it you mean work she resent my office it be like enemy territory to her she be always try to make it her space a piece of it like let us get a new sofa or new blind or a rug or something do you let she no I do not why not because I agree with her it be not her space there be a time when I use to talk about my patient when Ian be a kid I would share share detail with Kate you do not mean Ian both of they at the dinner table I see that look of horror on your face no I be pretty discreet actually I never mention any name if someone mention rat I would say I have a patient with a fear of rat dream about rat every night you know stuff like that you do not do that now no but I remember when Ian be about 10 he ask I Dad what be an alcoholic and I tell he about this patient of mine who need a drink actually to get out of bed in the morning one day this man come up to the office and he be kind of staggering and Ian say Dad be that the alcoholic you be careless this situation now I think there be more at stake do you agree because we be talk about a woman sexual attraction can I ask you a question you be in the middle of a session and a patient need to use the bathroom and your bathroom be block up would you let they use the bathroom in your house do that happen Laura say that she have to pee and I tell she well the toilet 's block up so she head for the door of the house and I freak out I jump up and I stop she I be keep your metaphor go here I hope you appreciate that about the she try to scale the wall there be always a patient who want to know about you More about your private self anyway what do you do I jump up I panic what make you panic she be do it on purpose I feel I think why can not she hold it for another 10 minute why do I panic I do not know really have that ever happen with another patient Sophie the gymnast she come in last week and it have be rain and she be completely soak so I let she change into my daughter 's clothe that do not make you uncomfortable it be a lot more intimate than use the bathroom Rosie 's clothe she have cast on both her arm from the accident and she hold up her hand like this and she say undress I so I get Kate to come in and help she how old do you say she be 16 she be the girl who be sleep with her adult coach she might be sleep with her coach it be a loaded situation her ask you to undress her she be mess with I you have no problem handle that you have Kate help she undress her give she your daughter 's clothe but when Laura need to use the bathroom you freak out why be that Laura be a woman Sophie 's just a she be just a child should not that make it easy you know there be there be a part of I that really want Laura to go through the door to see where I live maybe to to see Kate you want that be that what scare you do you discuss what Laura tell you last week she say that the reason that she be go to marry this guy this boyfriend Andrew be because I tell she I be not interested I know what you be think but I make it really clear I say nothing be go to happen between we Good I be I be just I be not go to play along this be not go to happen in your mind be there any possibility that the affair could become a reality no in your mind look I have to admit sometimes it be it be flatter I can not help but enjoy the feeling but I tell she no I say this can not happen you can not go through that door there be limit be that what upset you that she be test you it be not that abstract she be a beautiful woman she say she want to have sex with I I know what be in her head so I do not want she go through the door and maybe bump into Kate but you say you do want that some part of you want that the point I be make be that I want Laura to understand that we can survive this that any attraction that come up between we I can handle I be not go to let this derail the therapy her want to sleep with you how do she put it exactly that she know that I want she she say that she want to to fuck I and that she know that I want to fuck she too that be a lot to stave off that kind of intensity she can be very direct Laura maybe that be why I panic here be what I think Paul and you can accept this or tell I I be interfere again but give the situation with Kate I think we we might explore the option of transfer Laura to another therapist what just hear I out on this because Laura think she want to sleep with I last week you think we be already have sex I think you have an affair and you be try to justify it thank Gina I be wrong I be sorry I jump to conclusion you 've reassure I but now this situation with Kate how emotional you be and the pressure you be under listen to yourself you be injure you be vulnerable you be angry this be not I be stubborn Paul I think we should just discuss the possibility that Laura 's well off with a different therapist a female therapist you mean yeah preferably you for instance no I be retire remember this be so typical of you you always begin by say I hate to say this but but and you lay some pronouncement on I that you 've already be think about before you 've come into the session this be not a debate club you know it be not like we take a position and we hunt for way to support it that be not what I be do I be listen you have Kate on one side and you have Laura on the other but they be two totally different situation Gina be you say that I push Kate into this situation that I create this environment at home so that Kate could go fuck an insurance agent because really I be in love with Laura be not that your theory your note somewhere look at how you be react how be I react I be not send Laura to another therapist end of story I can handle whatever come up in the session that be why I be here because I want you to help I to handle it we just need to discuss this Paul I do not want to pawn she off on somebody else but what be good for Laura honestly if it be not for Kate cheat I would not be here Gina and we have not talk about your comment the last time I be pretty pissed off about that about what you make a crack about my father leave my mother for a patient what be that suppose to mean that I can not treat Laura because of what my father do year ago I be not my father for Christ 's sake no you be not your father I be suggest a pattern that might be threaten to you be you or be you not Gina say that because of my father that I be in danger of have an affair my gut you can not answer it can you no I can not if I remember correctly you be face with the same scenario yourself so maybe this really be not about my father maybe it be about you Gina do not forget I be the one who refer Charlie to you I remember he call I after one of your session and he confess to I that that he be in love with you no actually he go far he say that you be in love with each other maybe he be wrong I do not know either way you need to face that and you do not you just run off to England you know what I could not believe when that happen that be a wake up call for I watch you behave like that I do not run away come on a sabbatical with David at that moment by the way be that what your novel be about I figure you fail the same test yourself Gina but you abandon a patient he try to get hold of you over the year do not he a few letter I do not answer you do know that he die a few month ago prostate cancer it be right after David and I could not go to another funeral I just could not I could not face it it be funny you know I be talk about Charlie the other day to a patient of mine I be say that I I would be to his funeral and that I be I could not feel sadness and I be you know beat myself up about it the truth be I be I be so disillusioned with you Gina for keep you on as a supervisor after what you pull with Charlie I should have just walk out then you know that he never ever get over you since we be dig for the truth may I ask how you really feel about Laura I have not hear a clear answer not what you be go to do about she but how you feel do you mean be I attract to her be you Come on Gina if I transfer every patient I be attract to at some point I would not have any patient leave and it be not your place to say I should transfer a patient it be like I tell that couple they should have an abortion it be not what therapist do we do not tell people how to run their life I be suggest that we talk about stop Laura 's therapy and look at your reaction Paul do you really need another pill I know Tomorrow 's Saturday I can sleep all day Sunday I do not really care if they knock I out or not really what you be go through with Kate be so complicated previously on in treatment you really do not understand why I say yes to he it be because you say no to I perhaps I be an alternative to everything that Andrew represent Dependency anxiety but I be not a realistic option for you Laura just tell I I think you owe it to I do you want I no season 1 Episode 11 Week three Laura Synchro by ¤akazab¤ Kasius I be really sorry you would not believe what just happen to I I almost do not make it here at all God I 've get to calm down first can I get some water please sure what be you go to punish I for be late sorry I do not know how that get there it be yours yeah I thoughsomeone leave it here so what happen why be you 25 minute late right well I take a cab here we be fly down Madison right and about 200 foot away from I be this dog she he it try to cross the street you know it be impossible to cross that stretch of Madison impossible and of course he gets run over well not run over hit the car in front of hit he so run into the middle of the street and then another car hit he it be awful the car be play ping pong with he it be like ping ping he do not and a chance the cab I be in almost hit he but the driver stop short but then the car on the left hit he really hard I think he be dead but he be not I look in the rear window and I see he limp across the street I yell at the driver to please stop but he could not because the traffic there would have cause a massive pileup but I could not not stop you know I mean if the dog be alive I have to get he to a vet I mean do not I you would 've pull over or maybe you would not have give a damn I do not think everybody would have pull over but you would 've pull over Paul I be sure you would have you would not have pull over I would not have pull over no I would 've assume the dog be dead and there be not anything I could really do for he Sure I would be sad just like you be but I would not have pull over I do not believe you well anyway I could not not stop okay so I yell at the driver to make a u turn so I could g to the other side of the street but shit there be no u turn and this idiot cabbie be try to persuade I that woundeanimal prefer to die alone just because he can not make a fucking u turn so I yell at he please can you stop I need to figure out what to do I need to do something and then I look at his dashboard and it be five to and it be you know another 25 minute to your office it be incredibly frustrating sound like it be Imagine stop for a dog that may die anyway and be very late but you would 've be late anyway what well you be still very far away and it be already five to Dog or no dog you 've would have be 25 minute late the fact be you be never late Laura I would have appreciate a call why be you like that like what I do not know Anti Anti Anti what anti I I come in feeling like shit for what I just witness and you be give I a really negative vibe I do not think I be be negative Laura I be just try to understand you that be all I think it be possible that your be late today be not entirely coincidental maybe you be try to tell I something what I pay the dog to get run over in front of my face I plant he no you be late already Laura I do not know what you want from I Paul you operate on a very tight schedule you be a busy woman you always call if there be go to be a problem if there be an emergency at the hospital or whatever you always call I you be never late in fact very often you be early and so so what do you think your be late be try to say to I nothing Paul I nothing maybe maybe you think that that I be not do my job 'cause if that be the case then we should talk about that about what Laura I know you be upset about witness look at you Paul listen to you you be scheme I know you you be up to something what be I up to it seem to I that the last few session that we 've have have be quite difficult for you the last few month Paul very very difficult and wonderful be you angry with I because if you be then that be something we really need to talk about maybe we need to talk about what good this therapy be do you or not do maybe you 've have enough of it I be late and you be kick I out of therapy fucking hell use the belt it be a more humane punishment look I be not angry I have be I even think about not come here at all just as like a small protest when I leave here last week I phone for a cab and the line be busy I be just walk around in circle round and round around the block around the garden then I realize I be in shock Paul I feel like someone have punch I that be how you feel like I would punch you do I need to remind you what you say to I right here at the door at the end of the last session you know I have a feeling that if I have not mention it you never would have bring it up you would have hide behind that idiotic rule about therapist not initiate topic of conversation you be suppose to let the patient lead right you would 've take advantage that rule so we would never talk about what happen again as if it do not exist what would you like to talk about today you act as if you do not know I Paul that be what piss I off the most you look at I as if remind I again what your name be on the contrary I think I be come from somewhere that I think you know very well that be exactly why I be dwell on this point what point your anger my anger over you be try to make I angry you be provoke I no I be suggest that you already be angry before you come in the door you be so angry that you be consider not come here at all and you express that anger by come late fuck I can not win here you be I be what I be go to tell you what conclusion I 've reach this week but you be not interested be you you would prefer to bait I to piss I off to prove but you know what the truth be I be the opposite of Angry Anti Angry Fuck you Paul when you say you do not want I my first instinct be to tell you who care I do not want this I will not come but then I realize that it be not your fault it be my fault you do not owe I anything you do not have to love I in return Laura I realize that I may have slam the door too loudly in your face maybe I be a little Cruel no I do not think I be cruel I be resolve see you demand an unequivocal answer and I give you one I do not apologize for give you that answer I be sorry that I hurt you okay so a I accept your apology and b I think your answer last time be not so unequivocal and c I think my excuse for come late be perfect the excuse may have be perfect but the timing be not coincidental I see why they laugh at shrink and all their bullshit what do you really mean what do that mean it be bullshit Annoying one would not it annoy you if your therapist force you to accept some ridiculous interpretation you could not defend yourself against it ecause you be the patient everything you say would be hold against you I should 've stay with that dog I should take the dog to the vet instead of come here here where you be not be adequately treat maybe what do you want from I you refuse to listen to I I do not think you be listen to yourself maybe you be identify with the dog that dog deserve more than be co opt as some idiotic interpretation you want to explore some cockamamie theory then make up something original Jesus make an effort you think I do not make an effort do you think I do not try hard enough in therapy be that what you think that I sit here like a parasite who feed off your story and your reality and your pain maybe I be not help you at all all of a sudden I miss Andrew for the first time I be sit here face you and I miss he it be so strange to miss Andrew Andrew who love I who admit it who shout it out in public what if I do that have you ever imagine that I 've stop fantasize I 've kick the habit it be hazardous to my health I be getting marry in a few month I need to conserve every last drop of energy for my wedding you be find it require energy that you do not have I think bride be suppose to be whirl dervish of activity just the word bride creep I out I tell Andrew to pick a caterer and location without I what difference do it make between the Hilton or the Hyatt no matter how hard you try to be different you end up look like everybody else even bad God I wish I could just get marry in Vegas no caterer no guest just an alcoholic justice of the peace and a transvestite organ player you know what he do Andrew he send an e mail to everyone in his address book everyone his insurance agent his mechanic we have an exterminator over a couple of month ago even he get an e mail he be tell everybody I have not even tell my father really I have not have time I 've be busy I do not want to tell he over the phone Andrew suggest that we both go in there and tell he together but something happen we do not get around to it besides I do not want we both to go in there Hand in hand all lovey dovey like the movie guess what daddy so it be not exactly that it do not work out you 've just avoid tell he he have not be feel well lately he be have all these test do of course I take he he do not know what question to ask he think because I be a doctor they will be more straight up with I to be honest it would be much nice to be in the dark not know the truth I could be positive encourage optimistic he have an MRI today maybe the news of you and Andrew would come as a welcome distraction to he it would make he happy yeah that be a problem what be the problem well it will give he something to look forward to you mean if you tell he it will be real yeah I guess so I do not know maybe I know Andrew 's be so happy these day I feel like cheat he how just by be sad well not sad exactly but not happy either neutral indifferent Andrew make we do the round last week see all our friend tell they the good news and I just feel like do you ever see the movie King Kong how they capture he from the wild bring he back to civilization they put he on display for the whole world to see but he be not indifferent he be angry if I remember whatever it be a freak show I feel like a freak show everyone be look at I with these fake smile plaster all over their face it be like they be all wait to see what I do next we do not really have that much time leave come on I just get here you be half an hour late we be back to that again that bullshit about I be late I know you do not think it be important I do I give up it be pointless you might as well just bind gag I 'cause whatever I say or do do not make a difference that be what you would like shut I up yeah I would 'cause you keep say the same thing I hear you you wanna kick I out of therapy I get it I do not want to kick you out absolutely not I do think we should allow the possibility into the room the possibility of we wind down our therapy believe I you let it in how long have you be think about this have you be think about getting rid of I for a long time it look like you 've be wait for this to happen hope it would happen my be late today be the perfect excuse to get rid of I first of all I be not getting rid of you I be just ask you to consider whether this therapy be really help so now you be try to soften the blow thank you do not bother secondly I think that you toss I out a long time ago you do not want I to treat you as a psychologist you want I to treat you as somebody who be in love with you and in my opinion that be ruin any chance of this therapy be truly productive let us face it I have not be your therapist for a very long time I be the one who say no to you I be the one who humiliate you I 've be humiliate you for the last year by not respond to you my honest opinion be that it be really difficult to continue therapy this way from such an emotionally charge place Therapy should not be a source of constant humiliation for you you really deserve more what you be not a good enough therapist all of a sudden be I the first patient to be in love with you you 've be a therapist for 20 year be not you suppose to know what to do in these case for Christ 's sake just deal with it maybe you can not treat I because you be in love with I too I can not treat you because the boundary have be breach too often by tell I that you no long want to be my patient so fucking what our time be up I be afraid it be could not you give I extra time there be this little dog remember I be afraid I can not come on 10 minute I have to be somewhere else I be sorry it be the end of the month I presume you will need a receipt I 've do out an invoice I 've bill you for the you need some help if you do

dog I can ask he if you want where you head Downtown you need a ride I be go to get a cab Cab how would you look in a cab when you could be roll with this what be your name Laura Alex let us do it previously on in Treatment Let us just cut to the chase okay Saturday morning I be stand near the bomb site it be like London after the Blitz just rubble and all because of what I do I know this shoud have be the drama of my life but I feel nothing this old man come over to I and I look in his eye and he be sort of amuse kind of friendly like my father look at I when he think I 've do something wrong you still think it be too early to talk about your father when a person decide he be not in love with his spouse he should not have to put off leave home be not that so do not you think that be a little extreme what be your name this be for you what be it an expression machine the Pasquini Livia Top of the line for I with a three year warranty be this some kind of hint about the coffee you have here last week no hint it be a statement Transcript Jonathan Sync Benj check this out your coffee be horrify I do not want to hurt your feeling I will not tell you the truth about your coffee and what it say about you what do it say about I I may tell you later how do you like your coffee machine it be uh really nice but I um I can not accept it I be I be sorry what be you a government employee hey I get this for an amazing price in an auction in a what an auction on the internet Ebay I pick the time when the whole country 's glue to the television price drop 70 80 like during the super bowl get myself a home entertainment system eight speaker and a receiver for only 1 000 would 've cost 4 500 retail anyway thursday be the American Idol finale and I think of you so I go online and grab this could you turn that off please what just switch it off please what be you afraid of what be the big deal it be a coffee machine look I think it be a really sweet gesture and I I thank you do not you want to upgrade the standard of live around here and I know you only drink tea but what about your poor patient um no offense but do not you feel there be something aggressive in what you be do here I mean you have not even ask I if it be something that I want if it be okay with I okay fine it be just a stupid machine Jeez I be just try to understand what you want to say with this nothing what do you think that by I bring this to you that I be what try to buy you I do not know why be it important for I to have a coffee machine maybe because the coffee that it make be top quality I come here once a week for the time be and I need coffee here more than anywhere else to open up and all that crap so I bring the machine with I and six different kind of bean from the totally bitter gourmet Guatemala to the kind that postal pilot drink Jungle java which be sickeningly sweet you know what I 've get an idea deduct it from what I owe you I do not think so sorry could you be mad at I for something else altogether like what because I meet a patient of yours you meet a patient of mine yesterday I get the day wrong and I accidentally meet Laura I gather it be a delicate situation when patient meet yeah what do you mean a delicate situation well I do not know I think you therapist have some kind of ethical code like I tell you intimate detail about her thing she may not want her therapist to know about she I leave she walk in and tell you the same kind of information about I could that be consider a breach in your ethical code I do not think there be any ethical problem no of course I be not allow to discuss other patient but you be free to talk about what be happen in your life and what be happen between you and Laura like like anything else okay but what be happen between I and Laura would not have happen if we be not patient of yours I meet she right out front here that probably would not have happen anywhere else on the planet so you believe there be kind of a unique significance to the fact that you meet a patient of mine what do you think it be I be ask you I think we 've start therapy Alex what you bring I a coffee machine because you intend to come here more often and you want to feel at home through Laura you be try to relate that message to I she be your patient and I be too so we be officially in therapy about the coffee machine let us do this let us just say it be here on loan as long as I keep come here it be here when it be over I will take it with I Deal okay I guess um I I would like some some time to think it over though but it be okay think positive if I remember correctly your wife do not allow you to drink coffee at home that be correct do you feel that this be a place where you can say and do thing that you might not be allow to do at home no that issue 's solve thank to you I leave home you really help I with that in our last session show I that leave home be my own personal decision hey doc I be serious you really do help I I leave here much more determined than when I arrive to carry out this disengagement I go straight home and tell Michaela I want to leave home and I say it in the same way I would tell she I be go to take the car to the garage and be that what you really feel that it be so trivial yeah that be what I feel absolutely and here be how it happen Michaela be make salmon it be always salmon on tuesday and I tell she I want to leave home let I tell you she do not even turn her head away from the stove she just say that I could 've guess this would happen and you never surprise I Alex not even now how do you feel about that be you be you hurt by that she be not try to hurt I it be just the way she be and I may have do her wrong last week the way I present she but you 've get to understand she be a superintelligent woman when she be 22 she be already work on her PHD at Georgetown so if she say she be expect it then I 've get to believe she see I go through something since the bombing and the heart attack and the suspension from the force she see much more than I be willing to show and realize that it could result in we separate you know what be interesting be that you be talk today about your wife like you know she be some mythical superwoman that be able to anticipate everything 10 step in advance as far as intelligence go absolutely really no matter what else you say about she she be get the brain of a rocket scientist on the Manhattan project still be not there something in her reaction that disappoint you I mean you come home you drop this bombshell and she be indifferent to you yeah but that be not the case here we be not one of those couple that create drama all the time on the contrary we could 've drag this on for year just for the sake of the kid as they say have you tell the kid yet no not yet now Roy my eld he be be lock up in his room for day do some kind of chess championship on the internet and Noelle my daughter she be on some kind of school trip but you will have to tell they at some time of course someday they will have to accept the fact that their father leave home to look for a new life they can not understand that at their age how do you think they will feel about that Roy will understand I for sure he be a very special boy he have inner truth you know Roy 's 11 year old and he hardly ever leave the house he just sit at home and he sit by the computer and play chess and I mean he just no girlfriend no buddy no basketball and at first it drive I crazy 'cause he just seem so miserable so lonely unpopular I try everything I I organize tour at the air force museum for all the kid they could come and sit in the cockpit of a real F 16 play with the simulator and it be no use I mean those tour he would walk around all alone the only one near he be like some I do not know some ugly leper kid all the kid be afraid to get next to it be kind of hard to see that be not it sometimes it be hard for we as parent to see our kid lonely than it be for the kid himself it take I a long time to realize that then I realize that he be happy that I have the problem that I I could not accept the fact that he be not popular that he be an outsider and that be okay it be just his personality I use to give he and michaela such a hard time I would call the counselor I would call the teacher and everybody say there be no problem the boy feel good about himself it be just the way it be be it hard for you to accept yeah but you know today I be jealous of he cause he do not need anybody he be get his own world he be get his movie and book and computer game and chess and the kid be bear without a competitive bone in his body even the chess stuff it be not about win he do not care if he win he just like the thinking it require a few year ago I try to organize this ping pong tournament for his for his class in the backyard he turn to I and he say Dad do not you feel sorry for these kid only one will win and it be probably Robert and the rest will look pathetic in front of the girl do not you feel sorry for they I swear I do not know where he get those gene certainly not from I you think he be too good to be connect to your gene be you make fun of I I want you to listen to what you be say about yourself this boy be your own flesh and blood you you love he dearly you be very proud of his beautiful quality and yet you think well he be the exact opposite of I he could not possibly be connect to I please let us not get into that again no this be completely a genetic issue look he get the female gene from Michaela and my mother my mother she be the same way there be selflessness in everything she do just like Michaela she never feel like she be miss out on something somewhere else she do not care if she be fulfil herself and all that shit there be there be something pure about her wholesome like Roy no he get that from her so the woman in your family be they be pure and wholesome unblemishe and that the man be somehow the opposite dirty in conflict with themselves that be not a bad description of my father Dirty as hell he keep fall in love with different woman at the office he be have affair like some kind of dirty dog yes and the guy have it make he have a woman at home who love he let he have his career no question ask she take care of the kid and make sure that the entity call family exist what you 've get to understand about my dad he live this whole life on this civil right pioneer ticket you know a guy who survive the Klan and march with King who could say anything to he he suffer for we all and you mother be not part of that movement I like he I like my dad she be from back east from Delaware well breed she be the hope of the family a pianist she study at the Music Academy she be consider a virtuoso she could play Liszt in her sleep you know Liszt only Liszt could play Liszt yeah she be really something she be um Rare you never sense any bitterness in she that the whole music thing never materialize you still miss she of course she save his life by that I mean at at the march on Washington in ' 63 right before King 's big speech Mahalia Mackson sing that song I been ' buke and I be scorn and they catch eye in the crowd and they both have tear flow down their face and they feel connect my father be this lonely angry man and she well she melt he she be the only person he ever trust he be at war with the rest of the world and the war be not over believe I and still he he cheat on her constantly the guy just want more and more all the time but he do not leave she no what be you crazy why would he leave she he love she you be sure about that be you sure that it be not just that he hold she in very high esteem and that he be really grateful for everything that she have do for he throughout his life be you try to justify he he could 've leave she why make her life miserable and you unlike he you be try to do the right thing you be leave home just like that you be not drag out thing like he do okay all right all right I see you believe in the whole theory that child try to rectify what their parent do wrong all right okay I do not know that it be about rectification I think it be more what we call a pattern we unconsciously repeat pattern that we have witness in childhood but you say I be try to rectify what my father do I think you be present it that way but on a deep level I think there may be more similarity between you and your father 's view of marriage I do not know what you mean really you can not see any way in which you and your father may have marry the same kind of woman it seem to I that you both married woman whom you admire but but you do not necessarily love that be some bullshit you actually buy this shit that I be repeat my father 's mistake let I tell you something what be go on in my marriage have get nothing to do with my father so stop compare we perhaps you might not have love Michaela because you admire she so much for be so perfect wait why be we still talk about Michaela that story be over because I be not sure that your leave she be really the solution to how you feel about

we get in my car and we drive to the accident site naturally there be not any dog there so we grab a cup of coffee and I sketch the area on a napkin at her place no why would you say that no some cafe so I draw she an overhead view of the area I be a genius at that you know the yard and the green area anywhere where a dog might make himself disappear sound like a real military operation to be honest I kind of miss that just be up in the air reduce the area on a map look for a man intelligence have be after for 3 month so do you find the dog no it probably go and die somewhere but you could

Cy do not talk to I like I be a child how do you get along with Cy 's wife I do not wanna talk about they during first session appear to be very impressive sensite mature for her age very intelligent

least three if you be totally sick of listen to other people 's insipid life then maybe you can look at it and it will make you feel like you be somewhere else Insipid that be a good word I read thesaurus for fun I be not a freak okay I just like word I think you could use it it must really suck have to listen to other people 's problem all day so do that chair like enhance your brain function I do not think so can you read mind unfortunately no yeah it would be a lot easy if you could it would can I try the chair Sure please thank you how be you you look tired I be okay maybe you should take a nap maybe I 've notice that uh Cy 's drawing be be go do you erase it yes how do you feel about that how do you think I feel maybe a little scared because this could be our final session why would I be scare be the evaluation go to be bad I do not think it be the evaluation that scare you I think it be the possibility that um you will not be come back sorry but no I buy you a goodbye present see ya I know it be a goodbye present but there be another way to look at it maybe you want to leave something behind so that I will not forget you you say you like the boat I do if you do not want it I will take it back do you want to take it back so if someone my age want to start therapy how would it work well we would take it at that person 's own pace not like these last few session the evaluation the three Session deadline nothing like that see the person who be in therapy control the gas so to speak and the wheel for that matter so it be like drive a car yeah it be a bit like drive a car so pretend I be in therapy now all right I say pretend so what do I do why do not you tell I a little bit more about the boat I get it year ago from a homeless woman in New York when I be just a kid what be you do in New York we be on a family vacation why do you say that family vacation because it be not a real vacation and we be not a real family no sand no ocean that be not a vacation you know that be bullshit my dad take I to central park there be this old woman right at the park 's entrance sell these little wooden toy she look so miserable and I remember think it be bad for her I have just enough money leave from my allowance to buy the boat by the time we come home it be over what be over their marriage actually I think it be over during the vacation but they be like pretend or something I go to school I go to practice and I come home and they be wait for I in the kitchen smile like those movie star like movie star you know those smile that movie star do those big smile but their eye be all glaze over like and then my mother start to cry then my father say to she in this voice Olivia leave it to I and then he start to cry and I be just stand there stick in the kitchen Hungry as fuck with these two baby I do not remember the day he actually leave I just remember that day in the kitchen where do he go back to New York with his new wife and I stay here with my mother who be totally depressed Cy and Darlene they live close by so they help I get to practice and back they do not want I to give it up why be you look at I like that it be just the way you talk about it like you be not so upset about the breakup as the way they do it maybe that be what be make you sad I be not sad be that what people be suppose to do in therapy sit around and whine over all their problem it be never go to happen that be what she would do I be nothing like her your mom where be your dad while all this be go on I tell you in New York with Natasha do you ever consider live with they no we once think maybe but it do not work out why not they need their space they do not last anyway he want I to live with they he be really piss that she say no so it really sour their relationship so you blame yourself whatever way the cookie crumble you be still to blame how old be you what do you mean how old be I People really do not talk like that anymore really your logic have have some flaw Sophie you be not responsible for what your parent do you could not be be you a gymnast before before you meet Cy I do not remember a time before I meet Cy I 've know he since I be so little besides my father they be the only people who ever believe in I Cy discover I gymnastically I be dance around on a log in the backyard to entertain Dana you know do spin and thing he put I on a beam the next day their house be like my house I have a key before my father leave when he and my mom be fight all the time I sleep over I have these really bad attack back then my stomach would start to shake and then my whole body would start to shake sometimes I would start throw up and I could not make it stop they take I to the emergency room one night we never tell my parent why not I ruin their family I do I really do Darlene be so good to I I be she really be good to I she tell I before she leave for Wisconsin that she be only go because she know I would be there to take care of Dana she say she do not trust Cy but she trust I she trust I and I ruin it you be think he use I you be wrong he keep try to stop I he keep say Sophie you do not know what you be do we will get to a place and there will be no turn back he be a really good person Cy be he be a gentleman he keep say you do not know what you be do but the thing be I do and what be you do Sophie at first I think it be my imagination and then he stop talk to I while Darlene be home you know like he be embarrassed like he be hide something and sometimes I would catch he hold his breath while he be look at I he love I I know he do so I know even before Darlene go away I know that he love I and then she leave for six month but Cy would not have sex with I even though everyone assume we be do it that we have be do it for month Cy say it be a line that we absolutely positively would not cross we have be sleep in the same bed just sleep and then one night the night before Darlene come home I wake up in the middle of the night and he be awake then he I it happen it feel like nothing at all like nothing not good not bad kind of like kind of like I be watch it happen on a really small black and white television like I be check my e mail at the same time like I be not really there I do not know the next day we pretend like it have not happen then at practice that afternoon we have this big fight in front of everyone because of what happen because I fall off the beam I would be go for this back bend and for some reason I think the beam be long than it really be so I bend right off of it I fall flat on my back I just stay there try to breathe Afraid to move Afraid that I would break something then Cy come over and start scream at I we 've get two day until this tournament and you 've lose your focus now get back up there and do it right that night I sleep on the couch then in the middle of the night Cy come in and I think that but he want I to put Dana back to bed she would have a bad dream and come into his room look for I so I put she back to bed and then we talk he keep talk about my potential he say it would ruin both of our career if this get out he say we have to stop that be it we almost have sex again that night but he do not want to that be it a few week later Darlene say she want to talk to I she say that Dana have become too attached to I while she be in Wisconsin and I probably should not come over for awhile but it be pathetic because I know she you know she be lie to I I could not look at her I just say I be sorry she say do not be silly kid forget quickly grownup do not but kid do Dana will forget you Dana will never forget you Sophie you do not think so no I be sure of it Darlene be terribly wrong grownup can forget child can not when I leave darlene give I a present that she get for I in Wisconsin what be it an apron with cow on it she know I like to cook and I collect thing with cow on they so it be sort of Perfect the accident it happen that night I wake up in the ambulance do you remember how you get there I do not even remember walk away from the house I remember she give I the apron I do not want it I try to give it back but she say take it so you do not get dirty and then I think she kiss I it must 've be at their door because now I remember step back and see the whole house what do you see nothing I see thhouse from the outside that be all I will huff and I will puff and I will blow your house down so what the fuck be you go to write now be you ask I if I think the accident be your fault yes when you come here this morning Sophie You to I that they would go to take the cast you be stall Paul I be try to explain to you you know but you be afraid to tell I Sophie what I need you to understand I understand I understand everything I understand why Darlene kick I out of the house I understand why you be lie to I right now okay I get it I fue get it Sophie let us finish the session I have to use the bathroom okay Sophie Sophie be you all right I be go to open the door now be that okay yeah I be so sorry I do not know how that happen it be no problem do not worry about it I be so sorry do not worry about it it be just a picture frame I can clean it up later on it do not matter I do not wanna fuck everything up here too no do not worry about it if you have to write the evaluation now but I do not have to write the evaluation now Sophie if someone hold a gun to your head no one be hold a gun to my head be you hold the gun I wanna know waht you think what do you think do you think that you do this to yourself I do not remember how many time do I have to tell you what do your instinct tell you I do not have any instinct what do your heart tell you I do not have a heart you know from what you 've tell I already I think that you be have quite a difficult time take care of yourself recently so so it do not mean that you deliberately run into that car so what would you write I do not know something along the line of as a result of the anxiety she feel precede the incident the subject may have be distract act irresponsibly but we can not conclude that the accident be a premeditate willful act that sound really vague I can not be any more specific than that I be not a magician I do not know anything more than what you 've tell I I fucking hate you you never say what you really mean you know you be just like all the rest of they why can not anyone ever tell anyone else the truth I can not listen to any more of your stupid bullshit word a willful and irresponsible act just say it she try to kill herself or not if you think I do then say so what be the problem there be a difference between not be careful because you feel vulnerable and want to commit suicide no you do not see the difference no it be just like the picture frame I do not mean to break it I do not even see it but it be break I break it in term of the evaluation there be a really big difference that be what I be try to get you to understand what Sophie the problem that you have before the accident they be still there even when they take off the neckbrace and take off the cast those problem be still go to be there when you go back to your normal everyday routine you be go to have to face they again 'cause if we be not careful something like this could happen again that be what you be really ask I be not it if you go back to your life will you find yourself in front of a car again someday soon you make I sound like a time bomb it be true I ruin everything no you do not yes I do you say I want

I get pregnant a month after we meet I give up my freedom the day I meet you I would like to pay you I do not think we pay for the last two week we do have a few minute I be leave Shit I can not find

of all the city Rome what be this some kind of revenge no Rome be completely coincidental it be some deal he get with work or something next to the passport there be some business card of our favorite restaurant in Rome maybe I can book you two into the Il Palazetto maybe you know all you have to why do not you just get out of here I do not intend to feel guilty you know I be not really interested in what you feel previously on in Treatment be you say that I push Kate into this situation that I create this environment at home so that Kate could go fuck an insurance agent because really I be in love with Laura I think we should just discuss the possibility that Laura 's well off with a different therapist I be not send Laura to another therapist end of story if I remember correctly you be face with the same scenario yourself do not forget I be the one who refer Charlie to you you know that he never ever get over you you fail the same test yourself but you abandon a patient how be you Paul I be fine why do I not seem fine no you seem antsy I just keep need to go to the bathroom you remember where it be the door on your right no I mean all the time it be a a urinary thing oh I see have you see a doctor yeah it be get well but it be still a terrible sensation you go to the bathroom you be stay there you will it to happen nothing not a drop so uncomfortable this and the stress you be under what Jesus you think it be psychosomatic no not at all a symbolic urinary infection Symbolic how my head 's tell I one thing my body 's tell I another my precise issue manifest itself as a physical malfunction of the yes you say it be on the right excuse I for a moment season 1 Episode 15 Sync by Anyone Coffee Tagne www swsub com there be no soap in there really I think I see soap be you angry it feel like you be angry tonight let us say that be a fairly accurate assessment you wanna tell I why actually I be angry at myself for take your advice even though I know well my advice take your advice like a novice like a naive intern ignore every cell in my body and listen to you instead what happen I meet with Laura and we talk about end our session a total disaster do the opposite of what you predict it be just destructive it sabotage a year of therapy how because it undermine her faith in I and in the work that we 've do together she ask I if I be end our session because I be in love with her that well that what she hear I say what she hear be I be in love with you so I can not see you anymore how do you put it exactly be you suggest that I handle it badly no I just want to hear what you say you know I say we should discuss the option of of end therapy you do not just drop it on she out of the blue of course I do not I build up to it she come in late I think that be important like it be her way of tell I something I be not follow I say I think that she be late be her way of say that she be angry at I that she be ambivalent about her therapy of course she throw it back and she ask if she do have a point she ask if she be not the first person ever to fall in love for her therapist and then she tell I to deal with it mean you know this be my job she be right she say you be an experienced therapist just deal with it be you surprised to the reaction you put it on she and she throw it back how be I suppose you hammer I about this last week you go on and on about what I I know it be a bad idea and now I be come to you with this mess and all you you be not an intern Far from it do not play the intern if you think something be a bad idea you do not do it because I suggest it I say we should talk about it you be furious like I be try to take Laura away from you two day later you abruptly try to stop her treatment you say that end the therapy be the well good solution I say it might be necessary for her sake when you say good solution I think you mean a solution to your problem be that what I mean I be assume you act hastily because you think it be necessary that it have to be deal with quickly what do you want Gina do you want to what do you want to hear do you want I to talk about Laura do you want we to have a Laura session what do you want I to say that I sit opposite she and say oh what if well I do you think I be in denial about it I be not Laura be she be attractive anybody who be a therapist know that look I know all the way in with her all the door I could open if I want to do you imagine open they yes I do I fantasize about Laura look it be like a gynecologist it be easy for woman to believe that their male gynecologist do not have any sexual desire for they of course they want he to find their body attractive as well do not they do not even try to break down a relationship between a woman and her gynecologist that be a deep end anyway last week I I get this sharp kind of pain so I go to the urologist and on Monday and I think this be this be really scary and then this random thought come into my head because it be so cold in the room and I think my dick be shrink and I do not want the doctor to think that you know that be the real size never mind it be just you know there be no connection between a gynecologist office and the intimacy between therapist and patient what do you think the connection be what I be say be that as a male therapist sit across from a beautiful patient I I know exactly how to engage she I know exactly what it would take to to turn she on you know what turn she on yes I do what any number of thing but I could manipulate she to do anything I want I know that and I doubt if it be only male therapist who have those thought do you know what I be talk about for example if a male doctor perform an examination on a female patient there would be a nurse present right I mean that be for a reason be I the nurse I keep you from cross the line be that why you come to I let I tell you what worry I you have boundary too and just like you this woman know how to cross they all I be say be that the temptation be there for any therapist I know what I be do I mean if I be a gynecologist and I be perform an examination I would not accidentally start to listen to yourself you know you say you have no problem discuss Laura and then I bring she up and suddenly it be it be all about genital Gynecologist and urologist and you know it seem to I that you be take all of this to an extremely intimate realm and you be say to I I be extremely vulnerable here help I here where it hurt you know what what get to I be that I lie it out for you all I want be for you to give I the Gina treatment to get in there with your cold analytical scalpel and get some perspective say try this Paul try that what I do not expect be that that you give up on I tell I to find she a new therapist give up on you you suggest a course of action when that fail you say to I hey you do it do not come blame I do you really believe I convince you to do something destructive let us talk about that it seem like a distraction from talk about your feeling about she but okay let us start by look at how you be conduct her therapy which seem to I impulsive unorganized and if I be honest very problematic really be it now whenever I try to talk about this you unleash all this aggression to show I this area be off limit Touch this I will burn it down all right we will deal with it right right you remember I be talk about Alex the fighter pilot God listen to yourself what you say let us talk about Laura and then you bring up Alex or anything you can think of so long as it be no Laura this be about Laura Alex the fighter pilot meet Laura how after a session we have this talk about stop therapy the session end and she would not leave she want extra time I tell she I could not I have an appointment with urologist you do not tell she that no I say I have an appointment anyway she storm out and lo and behold who do she meet he be there and you have a conflicting appointment he be a day early by mistake which be weird because this guy be such a military perfectionist a machine he can probably tell the time by triangulate the star or something anyway he forget what day it be so he come back the next afternoon tell I that they meet and now they be date you think it be funny because I do not it be not funny it be curious I guess what be so what be curiously funny about it I do not know just give I a minute and let I figure out what I be think it make I smile I do not know why they be date Dating she go out with he to get back at I I push she into it you do not see that I reject she unequivocally and the next minute she be hit on the near guy I mean a guy literally on my own doorstep that be not a reaction to I why would it be because she know Alex would tell I well first of all be not that a reaction against her boyfriend the man she be go to marry why be you the betray man here which would be the bad situation if you realize that you be the center of Laura 's life and that she be date another man to get at you or if the transference simply fade and she be back to view you as a therapist she think about you during session that be it do you think I be an egomaniac no I be ask which would be the bad situation I do not get off on be worship by my patient if that be what you mean it be not like I be in some kind of some kind of a cult if her feeling be to change you would not have a sense of loss pretty clear how you want I to answer this do you not get that I be concerned about the right and the wrong of this as it affect all my patient you be very concerned I can tell that but you know sometimes help a patient view the world differently it be a powerful experience it be a little addictive it be a powerful experience because it contribute to somebody 's well be it be not about an inflated sense of Power do you think I be addict to power how how do Laura see you what do you mean when she look at you what do she see why Bear with I what do she see she see a man obviously a lot old than she be an authoritative strong man she think if she could get close to he that she could maybe take on some of his strength at the same time she be wait for he to disappoint she because somewhere down the line inevitably that be her story with man what else she think I will not be interested in she unless she offer herself sexually she associate concern for she as a woman with sex for her sex be a currency that she use to pay for emotional protection from man do not analyze just describe where be this go no just stay with it she think I be a coward which be a bit of a turn off she believe that I be totally in love with she that I think all the rest of my patient be a drag and that I can not wait for her session I assume she I assume she find I attractive otherwise why would she be not this enough now you describe she how you see she I would say an hysterical disorder do not analyze Describe do you mean what do she look like if one have to pick she out of a crowd I would say no if you have to pick she out of a crowd God you be such a stickler she be thirty she be beautiful great smile inquisitive look in her eye really sharp very smart she be get this great laugh that just just bubble up out of her it come from nowhere like quicksilver she be childish I would say no not childish childlike Vulnerable it make you want to hold she she be fascinated with sex well with the power of sex as if she be a teenager who be just discover it always always make reference to it vivid sexual experience that I get to say be very poetic sometimes she tell I about a summer after her mother die she be 15 and she go to live with this couple in San Diego friend of her father and she fall in love with this guy much old than her it be an escape I think from her father who be really depressed and sad after the death of his wife that can be pretty horrible you know a child take care of a parent like you do after your mother 's breakdown nothing bad than a kid play parent to a father or mother it be unnatural it reverse of the order of thing it be like kind of death I suppose for you it be after your father run off with his patient you keep come back to that I try to find the root of your connection to Laura it be get nothing to do with my father Laura be the one re enact not I Laura 's re enact this escape because that be what I be to her escape from what her boyfriend her wedding I 've try to explain it to she that she be really make I into another David not your David but the old guy from that couple that take she in she want I to be that guy again you be sure well God forbid I should say anything you agree with no matter how clearly I lie it out her attraction to I her want to run away with I there be something big that be that be drive that impulse maybe you wanna run away what escape from Kate from your work God you be so fixate on your pet theory everything have to do I tell you that that Kate be go to Rome next week with her insurance agent boyfriend she be the one that be run not I I tell she Fine just get the hell out I do not wanna I I do not want to look at you we do not live together anyway what do you mean I sleep in the office during the day we act like everything be fine but at night I be I be on the couch since when last four night I bring in my blanket and my clothe how be the kid take this Rosie do not come home on Tuesday say she would be back late but in the morning she be not there she say she sleep over at some friend 's Ian have a week off from college he do not even call do not come back get back after work yesterday and Kate announce that you know hey I be go out I say fine do whatever you want so I go to make dinner and there be no food in the kitchen I go to the fridge I look in nothing not even an egg Max and I order pizza then I put he to bed I be go to sleep in the office then I think what if something happen you know he be upstairs by himself he be all alone I could not bring myself to sleep in that bedroom not even for his sake I find that bedroom kind of repulsive I be asleep for while I do not know what time it be and I wake up and I hear this voice say daddy and Max be there you know just stand at the door he ask I if I could sleep with he and I say sure he have not do that since he be 5 year old my guess that be the answer to your question be the kid know everything anyway she be leave in 3 day and probably for the good really how be it for the good it be not for the good it be a nightmare it be painful but in a way you be free to go through whatever it be with Laura I want my wife to leave I for a salesman maybe not but it be convenient Convenient she be fly to Rome to fuck an insurance salesman for Christ 's sake be that really what he be I do not know he be a run an employment agency or something what be I suppose to do chain she to the bed track every move she make like that guy I have in therapy Jake or Alex who you know whose wife grind her tooth in her sleep and wake up the next day and say the marriage be over I be leave you keep bring patient into this my wife be run off but apparently it be not my wife really it be I accord to you since I be my father it must be I I 've be try to understand since our first session why you come to I I specifically I remember on our first visit you say that you feel like you be cut corner you have no patience for your patient that be what you say and that if they know what you really think about they they would stop come I be wonder if maybe that be what you want for they to stop come why would I want that not literally on an unconscious level Unconscious maybe you want to transfer your patient to I where do that come from it be not a real option it be a wish you could dump your patient on I your problem when I suggest that we find another therapist for Laura you immediately assume that I would treat she and then you go down the list you describe each patient but be not that what the session be for no it feel like you be prepare I metaphorically for the day when you hand they over when you say here their problem be not my problem I have to leave yeah I be go to run off to the Caribbean and I be go to be sip cocktail with Laura and scuba diving I mean what on earth be you on about I just take on 3 more new patient you say you do that to prove to yourself that everything be ok that couple you say you do not care if they ever come back you do not like the navy pilot and sometimes it seem you be not that upset about Kate what not always sometimes maybe all these thing that should be bad be really okay and then there be I you be use I as your accomplice not in a practical way but emotionally to help you move on from they that way you be free to be with Laura you know I do not even want to say to that I mean what be you do be this what you call help 'cause that be why I come here I come here for you to help I I keep say this but through some misguided line of reasoning through some narcissistic need of your to save the day to put yourself at the front and the center we 've end up here in this same place just to confirm that you Gina be right as always maybe I misjudge you I do not know I think you be well than this you know I 've get to say you really sometimes be so infuriate the way you keep come back to your pet theory my father Kate I guess I would well go previously on in Treatment I hear you paul you want to kick I out of therapy I get it no I do not want to kick you out absolutely not I think that you toss I out a long time ago you do not want I to treat you as a psychologist you want I to treat you as somebody who be in love with you Let us face it I have not be your therapist for a very long time Laura maybe you can not treat I because you be in love with I too where you head you need a ride Laura Let us do it Paul Paul Season 1 Episode 16 Laura week four Synchro by ¤akazab¤ Kasius LAURA Londay 9 00 be sorry you say that it that it happen in the kitchen no it start in the kitchen be you listen to I yes yes I be I say I want to do it right there on the counter so when he pick I up I think okay but no he take I into the bedroom and he Put I down ever so gently like I be I do not know a porcelain vase or something everything be very cautious hesitant like he do not know what to do maybe he do not know what to do with someone who be not his wife yeah he keep tell I he have not do it with anyone but his wife for 10 year and hardly then it be very sweet actually he imitate I he do everything I do I take off his shirt he take off my shirt I tell he he have a fantastic body because he do and he go so do you at one point he stroke my hair and he ask I what kind of shampoo I use can you believe this we be lie there face to face pet each other like high school kid anyway I get sick of it so I say to myself maybe he be wait for a signal you know maybe he want I to lead maybe if I start do something you know thing will finally get move so I go down on he everything be so proper I do not want proper I just want he to fuck without all the bullshit about my shampoo and my beautiful breast and my excellent taste in curtain so do that move thing along what the blowjob of course but you know what he do not like sex you know what I mean he do not really like it it be like he be carry out an assignment a mission like a pilot what do you mean like a pilot you know those air force guy that mark tally point on the wing of their fighter jet to keep track of how many plane they 've shoot down it be like that like he be keep score I mean he do not even touch I while he be go at it he be just you know lean on his elbow as if he do not want any connection between we except where necessary and I keep try to bring my face close to his to kiss he and he just keep pull his face away as if he could not stand I and that be it it be very fast two minute more or less and then he come and then he go straight the bathroom and I just lay there in shock I mean he do not even ask I how it be if I be okay or not nothing anyway I make myself come while he be in the bathroom no when he get back I have to I mean I hate to be leave high and dry he be just lie conduct dialogue the ceiling or maybe with his wife or maybe with you and he look so fucking sexy so I I climb on top of his leg I think he would get the hint and he would start something but nothing so I just keep go ride his thigh it feel good and then I be overwhelmed with this sadness for he he break my heart this guy he be fragile really that be what he be I do not think he could tell what I be think I be completely in my own head and I be think to myself shit this be go to be the sad orgasm of my life here I be ride this hot sad guy 's thigh I be expect something pitiful and measly right but no a volcano be a cliche but that be what it be it be like 10 orgasm explode at once it be hard to describe but I scream I do I scream and I think I scare he you would have be really proud of I why would I have be proud I mean as my therapist you know that I finally connect with myself do not happen very often I be sorry that be a bit reveal but you must be use to it you know hear confession like that it probably do not impress you anymore actually it make a very big impression really what sort of impression well you can look at it in all kind of way but one thing seem perfectly plain to I you sleep with my patient excuse I he be not your only patient he do not belong to you he be a great guy okay a little fuck up a little insecure in bed maybe but he be get potential I think I be go to have a terrific affair with he nevertheless it be no coincidence that you go to bed with he and I do not think it be any coincidence that you begin your affair with he shortly after we talk about your quitting therapy be you say that I do this to get back at you remember the guy you tell I about the guy that you meet at the bar that you go to the restroom with you say that you feel you be with I it be not the same thing Paul be you sure it be not it be during that session Laura that you decide to tell I that you be in love with I and that be how you choose to tell I how you feel about I by have sex with another man Paul if there be one thing that I put right out there without hinting or manipulation be that I 've want you so I do not need to fuck another man just to get my message across what make you so Sad about Alex his loneliness he be a sad guy do you feel sad no I feel horny so sadness for he but no sadness for yourself what be you try to get at here maybe you do feel sadness because you be with a man you do not really want to be with be you say that when I be fucking Alex I be actually fuck you be do not flatter yourself it be not really a compliment Laura I think it seem more like look what you miss out on Paul you coward you idiot I be tired I be really so tired so after Alex leave I could not fall asleep I suddenly have this incredible craving for cheesecake Cheesecake you know those amazingly fluffy cheesecake with that amazing smell well my mother use to bake those every friday afternoon afternoon after I finish play with my friend I use to come home and that smell it be intoxicate it be like a trail of scent pave my way home like a cartoon character then my mother get sick the cancer be only stage one at that point when they find it but when she start chemo she stop bake you know she be tired she she have no energy and that be the first sign the first sign that something really big be about to happen and when she be really sick I use to find myself roam the hall of the apartment building climb up and down the stair search for that smell of cheesecake Shit how corny be that and once I rember a woman come out of her apartment and she thank you and she see I stand out there she do not know who I be she must have be new to the building and she be yell at I go away go on go home what be you do stand out here just why do you think you have that particular memory the other night I do not know I search through my whole apartment look for a recipe but not that that would have do any good my fridge be completely empty I think about go out to get a piece but it be 3 00 a m so I just give up and go to sleep only then the phone rang and it be Alex he call to thank I tell I that he have an amazing time with I and that he want to see I again go figure huh he be suppose to pick I up from here pretty soon from here yeah that be what he say be not you afraid that Andrew will find out about this or maybe you want to get catch Andrew and I split up what for good and it be for good he be a nice guy he will make a nice husband for someone who deserve he but obviously not for you I nearly fuck guy in bathroom stall as you very kindly remind I I just could not stand up there in front of everyone promise to well I just should not ever make promise I promise not to make any more promise how be that so I tell he that I be sorry but I can not marry you I be incapable of be the woman you want the kind of woman you deserve I put it all on I well 'cause it be all I and he look at I and he say thank you Laura thank you God exist it be a fact he be make I realize who and what you be and he be save I from a long endless death with you flatter no he must be devastate maybe he feel I do not care how he feel you do not care not now I do not feel like talk about Andrew 's side of the story why do that make you so upset because I be the one in therapy here Andrew have his own therapist she will take care of he do not worry about he worry about I I be take care of you you be kick I out of therapy I be not I bring it up as an option do not sugarcoat it you even try to blame it on I you make up the most ridiculous case as to why I be late it be nasty a bullshit excuse instead of level with I and say listen I 've feeling for you too it be hard for I to deal with instead of figure it out so we could continue therapy so we could we could be together that be your point we 've be together for a year a year there be more intimacy between we than most couple in the world be not that right I do not deny that there be a certain intimacy that can a certain intimacy Intimacy like cut the crap be there intimacy here or not there be and now you be willing to throw that all away and why because you be scared I know that as a therapist you tell yourself it be part of therapy to find out why I be in love with you and how that be link to my past and all that but be not that always the way it work do not our past always determine who we fall in love with what if you can trace it back to the withholding mother the narcissistic father the parent who be miss in action do that make our love any less real but sometimes circumstance be let us say less than ideal I know that I know you can delude yourself into think only I be not delude not about you not about how I feel about you why I feel it there be always get to be an explanation but that I feel it be irrefutable I do not know how to convince you anymore I mean you think that I 've imagine this fairy tale this happily ever after that I 've idealize you you think this be a case of a miserable patient sit in front of her her therapist imaging that you be my superman Perfect savior mentor I do not see you that way at all how do you really see I I see you the way you be your imperfection you be not at ease with your body with your profession with who you 've become I do not know much about your life but I I imagine you be not happy at home something in you be restless damage there be a yearning there and I know it when I see it and I want you just the way you be damaged and restless yearn Warts and all so you can fix I God you can be such a fucking prick when you wannabe so that I can fix you then you know next month I will be 30 and I 've be think to myself I 've hate myself for 30 year it be enough I do not want to anymore why do you hate yourself you be surprised I 've never hear you say it before I guess you save the good for last that be the good that you hate yourself I do not know you be surprised it be something people realize after an hour I do not know it after an hour neither after a year it be not easy for I to hear you say that maybe you should try and find out why it be so hard for you maybe you should see someone I 've be think about that seriously I think the reason it be hard for I to hear it be because I know that you have so many reason to to love yourself so many thing to be to be really proud of yet you choose to ignore they why have not you ever hate yourself I guess I do once I be a kid you know my mother she be in pretty bad shape and I take care of she but I could not I could not save she from herself you know I guess I hate myself for that be she sick she be in a difficult emotional state I think that I could pull she out of it I use to cook she all these you know elaborate meal but she would not eat they could not understand why like every kid I think it be my fault it be something that I be not do maybe I could do something else but you know that be not true I know that now yes have you forgive yourself I think so take a long time how do that feel I mean really I be curious it feel like a relief to tell you the truth to know that that burden be go the burden of blame and to know deep down that it never belong there in the first place maybe that be why you become a psychologist to help other with their burden maybe so you be a product of your past too will that be cash or check can I owe you that sure anyway I know where you live yes you do I should get go Alex be wait for I I forget I have not pay you that be okay it will do next week thank you be welcome previously on in Treatment I leave home you really help I with that in our last session you show I that leave home be my own personal decision could you be mad at I for something else like what because I meet a patient of yours I get the date wrong and I accidentally meet laura should I go for her I can not give you date tip Alex she be the kind of woman that can could drive a man insane be I right bye Melissa Bye thank you I be early huh yeah but it be okay it be not a problem I be in the area I do not want to go home and have to come all the way back it be okay be you sure you do not have thing to do I be sure this be from Laura I think it be a check who know Synch Benj I will pay you for the extra time no need it be okay no no I insist it be another 20 30 hold on do you feel well now what do you mean after pay I do you feel well what be you try to say I guess that I be I be surprised by how much effort you put into show your contempt for this process and for I relax okay it be just the way my mother raise I I do not know what it be like with you people I do not like charity so I like to pay for what I get well I be glad you be get something here Alex listen let us not make a big deal out of this okay you want I to admit that this therapy be worthwhile okay I will admit it this therapy be change my life Happy can we drop it now how many patient do you have why be that relevant I be just curious like today how many patient already why be you ask I this 'cause I wanna know what kind of money you make let us say you have 8 patient a day time 5 day a week 150 a pop it be pretty good live there doc 24 grand a month do you wanna buy I out alex what well 24 000 a month and I be all yours and you will be my only patient it must be hard for you to be in this position to be perceive as weak and you have this need to regain your strength you bring I a check from laura you 've ask I about my patient and my income and you 've do everything you can to put I in my little place do I offend you no I be kind of use to it but then all our session start out like that do not they Alex maybe I be expect something a little different today maybe because you be early or because you 've be ask around about I do you want I to tell you why I be early or do you wanna just go on and on with your theory I would love to hear I go to the base today I think I would pop over before my session here and say hello to my boy when I get to the gate I realize I forget my i d now usually that be not a big deal but there be a new grunt at the gate some real okie from Muskogee I tell he look call the base commander and tell he that lieutenant Prince be here so he go in the booth call come back a minute later and he say I be not on the approve list now of course this be a real sensitive issue these day as you can imagine still I say to hell with the list this be what you do you call Dana the secretary tell she to talk to the commander and you tell he that lieutenant Alex Prince Jr be wait at the gate so he go in he call he come back and he say he say I be sorry but the commander be in a meeting now maybe he be in a meeting and he could not be disturb or maybe they be stuff their face with doughnut or maybe he just do not give a fuck I do not know I tell that guard I say look you tell Dana if she take the commander 's cock out of her fucking mouth once in a while then maybe she could hear well Man I be this close to knock that motherfucker out anyway I do not get in so I leave and that be why I get here early not not an easy experience no it be bullshit now I get to come and deal with this I get you come at I like this that be the tip of the iceberg my shitty week start on saturday why what happen on saturday okay we be go to pretend here all right we can pretend you know what happen do I I wish you would 've warn I about Laura last week it would have save we both a lot of heartache I sleep with her okay with Laura that be what happen on saturday but I be sure you get a full play by play from she already do she or do she not talk to you about it I be not at liberty to discuss my patient or their session now what be that Code language for she do discuss it but you will not tell I it be pretty weird she call to ask I if I want to come over for dinner no problem right so when I get to her place I look at her I look at how she be dress I look at the table I look at the wine and I realize that dinner be obviously just a code name for sex this whole thing be like a ritual a ritual yeah and all the rule First of course there be the meal she do not look like a cook right but she make a big effort for starter she prepare her own sushi California roll they be not that great actually it do not taste good it be just for show do not you get it that be the problem nowadays everything be for show if you wanna make sushi take a fucking course go to a real japanese grocery do not make it with uncle Ben 's rice and imitation crabmeat come on do you say anything to her of course not no the dinner be just a lead up to we get in bed I tell you that it do not really matter so do you want to sleep with her yeah but it have nothing to do with want anything it be all premeditate it be like a mating ritual like the masai tribe in Tanzania but for yuppie anyway so we get up from the table we go to her bedroom and have sex and that be what happen on saturday it be interesting that you tell I so much about this ritual of you go to bed together but nothing about what happen between you I be sure that you 've have lousy sushi before but I do not think you 've be with another woman for a long time be not that correct but you know what happen so why do you have to hear it from I you be very preoccupied with who know what and who say what what be important be how you feel about it how the experience be for you the sex the sex be all that anyone want to talk about but be it really as important as you people make it out to be well you tell I I know that be what it say in all your textbook I know that but I ask myself be it really the key to everything or be it just the simple answer but you be the one who start the story by say that the sex be the issue that all the rest be just foreplay okay I will tell you what happen otherwise you will not feel like you be do your job right but before I start there be something I 've get to know do you ever jerk off to anything a patient tell you what Come on come on you must hear some crazy story from woman Explicit shit fantasy do you ever jerk off afterwards be you concerned that I will masturbate to something that you tell I I no I be talk about you 've got woman they sit here on your couch they tell you all about fucking it must get to you sometimes I know it would get to I do you masturbate there you go again you be answer a question with a question all right I will answer with an answer I be a human being I masturbate sometimes my fantasy be about many many thing all sort of woman be that what you want to hear that in that regard I be not that substantially different from you that be the first time you 've ever answer one of my question in any case you will not masturbate to I and Laura 's story I guarantee you that you may think of it the next time you be have sex with your wife and you be try not to come it must have be a very complex experience for you be with be with another woman after all this time Complex right I give a shitty performance I make every possible mistake I be a mess to tell you the truth during dinner before we have sex I start think about my first date with my wife Michaela about 15 year ago Jesus we have go out to this bar together at the time she be the liberal type she would talk openly about everything Foreplay favorite position cuddle afterwards cosmo type bullshit and among other thing she tell I that researcher find that wine arouse woman sexually and repress man 's sexual desire have you ever hear that I do not know what make I do it but at one point during my conversation with laura we hit one of those deadly silence I suddenly tell she that alcohol sexually repress man while woman it and she of course she do not respond she just give I one of those look say why be you tell I this why do you tell she I do not know maybe it be a way to move the conversation in a sexual direction make thing go forward a kind of signal that she have be clear to attack be that what you want for she to attack do you think that she understand the signal yeah be there another way of get it it might have sound like an apology in advance that you do not have any real sexual desire for her I do not think so she be not even too faze by it she just change the subject right away like I have say something nasty something inappropriate at the table with all that sushi and that be what piss I off like all her faggy doctor friend she hang out with always say exactly the right thing so listen the first chance I get I look she right in the eye and I say Baby I have to go to the bathroom I be a bit nervous it be my first time since I leave my wife this time she could barely squeeze out a smile even a phony one and from then on every few minute I would mention my wife and the separation even in bed I do it every chance I get just to see her squirm I think I get she completely out of the mood she be totally turn off we have sex it be more like two animal mate I be not that hard and I come pretty fast even on the way to the shower I throw in another I be sorry it be my first time in so many year just for dessert I do not know why I keep say it be you think about your wife no or feel guilty maybe no why would I well because any of those reaction would have be natural Alex we have not talk about your your separation how you feel about it no that be not what this be about the separation be the right thing to do I have not even look back on that do not you get off topic what be the topic do our story match I and laura 's that be what I want to know look on the one hand you describe this feeling of helplessness weakness as if you be drag into sex against your will you feel that you do not perform too well so you feel somewhat humiliate then to gain back some strength and control you make these reference to your wife in order to belittle Laura belittle she you really make some pretty far out connection she belittle I her whole attitude be it be patronize you be sure you be the one who suddenly feel weak so you attack you want to regain control it remind I of the beginning of our session when you come in here you be vulnerable from what happen at the base you give I the envelope from Laura and then you throw your money on the table as if you want to humiliate I to make I feel small how be your machine it be good thank you be the client happy I be go to make I some coffee by the way if you want some if you 've decide to stop be a tea man Alex can we get back to this please we be onto something here and I do not want to lose track just give I a second here okay I realize we be onto something I just need a break respect that I want you to tell I something honestly do you really think you can help I if we sit here and we talk about fuck a few time you will be able to solve all my problem I do not have the answer to that question yeah I know you would say that you know that be what kill I about you people 'cause any other professional I go to a doctor he take a look and he say this be what you get this be how long you have to live if I go to a mechanic he would say 2 000 it will be good as new but you people you do not guarantee shit can I tell you a story what kind of story it be a jewish parable that a friend of mine tell I these two friend be condemn to death but the king he like they and he do not want to kill they so instead he tie a thin rope across this abyss and he tell they both to walk over the rope whoever make it to the other side would be allow to live so the first one walk over the rope and he make it safely to the other side and after he make it his friend yell out to he how do you do it and the other guy answer I have no idea all I know be that whenever my weight pull I to one side I lean to the other it be not exactly Lord of the Rings True so what do it mean that you have to maintain balance in your life I think what it mean be that there be no simple way of jump over an abyss or way that work for everyone I think what you be look for alex be a million dollar magic trick and I do not have that I truly believe there be no simple way to jump across an abyss instead we have to work in small internal step the question be whether you want we you and I to engage in that process eye on your instrument what do you mean it be one of the basic principle in aviation you ever hear of vertigo Sure when you go into vertigo your directional perception change you be spatially disorient you would be fly at mach 2 nose down and think you be take off so that be the first thing they teach you at pilot school you go into vertigo you look only at your aircraft 's instrument ignore your feeling completely rely on your instrument that be what the air controller tell you if he think you be freak out and that be what you be tell I now eye on your instrument so you want I to put myself into your hand you wanna navigate I rely on you and on one hand you be right that be why I come in the first place but keep my eye on the instrument be what get I here what do you mean 'cause I keep my eye on the instrument I drop that bomb so accurately into that window I rely only on my commander and I kill innocent people and now I be suppose to rely on you Alex I do not want you to rely on I I want you to rely on yourself on your own feeling the most I can ever be to you be an air traffic controller who tell you to try to ignore the expectation of everybody else it be the expectation that give you that give you vertigo what be the first step on the way to my new life well what what would you like to do I think I will go fuck she again yeah I will fuck she well

nighttime even though my body do not want to yet it be like when I be little and I use to starve myself and there would be this period usually in the morning where I be really really hungry you know so hungry that I think that my stomach might just start eat the rest of I and then it would go away suddenly like turn off a light switch and I feel like I be float on cloud it be the same with the pain this time I push through it until it just let up all of a sudden and then I feel like I do not have a body at all like I be just a pair of somersault eye so yesterday I march into the gym and I get up on the beam everyone be in shock and I feel this silence all around I Sophie be careful please then something inside of I some little voice say prove it so I start the first element here I will show you Sophie please be careful this be dangerous do not have a cow Paul I be fine so anyway I begin the first element when I look back at my foot they be right on the beam it be nothing major but I take it as a sort of sign afterwards everyone tell I Cy be so shocked that he could not breathe well I bet he be I do a backflip I land perfectly that be incredible I just walk back to the bench like it be no big deal I could feel everybody 's eye on my back I want to turn around and just and what nothing no come on tell I I want to flip they the bird with both hand like Fuck all of you and the

there that image but as soon as I start to fall asleep the pasture would turn to rot it be terrible that remind I of the accident for some reason I do not know why I be scared that if I sleep I would dream about the accident so I get up and I walk to the bus stop very slowly backwards actually just to slow myself down the bus be not run yet so I sit on the bench yeah and what what be you think

be beautiful and yet now the clothe the music the friend they all seem to annoy you and Jake you 've refer to Amy as a snob you 've call she a princess maybe you 've both be try to force your perspective on each other all these year and it be become a battle for control and you 've become so used to it it be become part of the dynamic of who you be as a couple so why do not it work anymore Amy have a strong need to have a career that seem to stress you out it seem to make you insecure and you become possessive jealous that in turn make Amy Secretive and she lie I get the feeling that you be both tired of this battle and that somewhere deep down inside you want it to stop but you be afraid you be afraid to stop but I do know one thing there be casualty casualty what be you talk about who be a casualty Lenny you two get together while Amy be still marry be that correct would you like to talk about that a little bit Jake after they come to see I play she start take guitar lesson from I she want to learn a few classic song she say it be Nick 's idea yeah you know the rich they love to tap into their creative side and do your ex husband take these lesson also Nick with a guitar be you kid I you love make fun of he you too come on it use to crack you up when I would talk about how uptight he be do you mind I ask you how do your affair how do it begin Jake ask I to stay

phone call which be an emergency and it seem like you both I do not know gang up on I do you think the same kind of thing happen with Nick that that be how your intimacy be create with a conspiracy between you and now that Amy be try to step out of the house so to speak she be break up that conspiracy so that make you uptight and the conflict between you intensify how will it end you know ironically sometimes end a conflict be not the good thing for the relationship because you get so use to fight each other that you might lose interest if the conflict end I think Jake lose interest a long time ago the moment he have I I do not lose interest you become interested in your boss I be not interested in Ben now it be Ben you be such a fucking liar do not call I a liar but that be what

should have or be it a list of no no feeling be that what you want from I a list would that make it easy I doubt it you keep put word in my mouth maybe you want I to be unreasonable so you have something to push against this topic this topic always bring we back onto shaky ground do not it what topic the boundary between therapist and patient teacher marry student there be no big deal about it what be the I mean be it really wrong it be different Paul I remember Charlie your your patient he use to call I after session and he would say this no sex with the therapist thing it be drive I crazy be it for real there be get to be a loophole be I never go to get to sleep with Gina okay let us stay I stop Laura 's therapy let us say I send she to somebody else as you want I to do surely in six month time I can call she up and say no no you can not then a year 18 month when it be cool off there be no cool off period it be not about cool off it do not change the dynamic in six month or 10 year she will still be a patient but that be just some bullshit some lawyer come up with no it be not a law it be beyond a code of ethic it be essential it be something you carry inside you can not you see that so what you be say be that there be no conceivable set of circumstance in which None Christ you be so fucking fundamentalist there be a lot of people who would disagree with this then go to they she be 30 year old she be seductive dependent hysterical she idolize you it be classic right it be textbook here be a girl with damage self esteem excuse I how do you know she be damage you 've tell I about her affair with your other patient she try to make you jealous she describe the sex how she be try to enter your house how she be play all of these game to try to get an oedipal reaction from you if you fall for these advance she will not be grateful she will be shock rightly so and she will leave you all of which you know but you be ignore it you want to be desire we all do but you need to remember why Laura come to you in the first place so you be tell I now what be wrong with my patient another dissertation on what a lousy therapist I be I have never ever say anything like that excuse I what about that famous letter you write I carry that letter in my pocket for month but I do have to say that everything I 've accomplish as a therapist I owe to that letter so thank you you know we be get away from Laura again I can quote it the patient be consistently positive about their session with Paul however it become clear that Paul be play to their expectation his approach to therapy be compromise no actually what you write be seriously compromise by his desire to please that translate to I as he be a shitty therapist I also say that you be one of the most brilliant I know you say all kind of thing you say that I be your favorite that I be the heir apparent why do not you tell I that I be not good enough because that be not the way I feel why would I say that then I could 've get on with my work instead of drag out 8 year of promise of drumroll lead to the bad humiliation of my life you know Walker even jeffrie they say that I be guarantee to be the head of the institute across the board everybody agree with it except you I do not believe you be ready clearly you do not the way you take critique it make you furious you know it be one professional assessment and you take it personally so personally I have to wonder if it be not an echo of an early rejection please Gina not this again I know exactly where you be go with this a son who feel he be disappoint his father a son who feel he have not live up to his father 's expectation it be something you would want to address please do not minimize what you say to I I be not react to something in my past in relation to my father one review drive you out of the institute that letter piss on eight year of my work despite it though I become an excellent therapist and some people might say that I become a well therapist than you maybe you feel that maybe that be what this be really about so let I ask you again why do you come to I specifically I suppose because I need to I do not know test myself I mean I already know before I come here what you be go to say about I and Laura and Kate but I think to myself you know if I can withstand your corrosive attack your particular brand of analytical castration that sound horrible why put yourself through that so that I can trust myself I suppose trust yourself with what you know you say that you be write a novel you know I find that kind of amusing to tell you the truth because a novel be about complexity it be about contradiction foible human folly not absolute for you complexity be a problem some kind of pathology that need to be treat and you know what I find fucking offensive to tell you the truth that you think I be blind to a situation as obvious as erotic transference let I just tell you that I treat Laura with the same integrity the same concern the same rigor as I treat all my patient I happen to like my patient that be the difference between you and I I worry about they I identify with they I put myself out for they you analyze they I analyze too but I empathize let I ask you something I be just curious about this do you miss have patient why I be never really 100 convince to be honest that you actually like this process the sitting down with a patient that be because in your opinion I have no empathy and so how could I get any satisfaction from it I be not say you do not get satisfaction from it in the same way that a sail maker or or a chemist get when they practice their craft but that thing I be talk about that exist between a doctor and a patient that connection that buzz see I can not help but connect with the person that be who I be as a therapist that be my reward a while ago before before I start come here there be there be a session that Laura cry she would never actually do that before that be a kind of a victory right it be kind of a milestone for a therapist when you get the patient to that point where they where they cry it be different with she there be something so so move about see she just break down like that in that moment I swear I could 've say fuck it all I just want to be with she but I do not I come to you instead I come especially to you I choose you 'cause I think to myself if Gina can not convince I to to stay away then how be I go to convince myself it be really tough when I be alone with her you know and she be ask I please just be honest please tell I how you feel and I can not I guess the reason I be here be because I really want to look at this I want to examine it I want to be absolutely clear about this one hundred percent that it be not that I be not that you be not what you need to say it you need to finish the thought that what I want be not in some way immoral or unethical and that it be not abuse an abuse of my power as a doctor with a patient I be not push you out I be not run away no matter what you tell I at the institute maybe that be hubris on my part I do not know it might have be but I will not do that now I will not reject you that do not mean I be go to let you do something that you will regret the rest of your life not without fight you every step if it be safety you need this be it we 've already cross line of conduct in this room I be say that because I want you to know how far I be willing to go whatever you tell I I be here for you I will not abandon you no matter what I be here I love she I love Laura every word out of her mouth every move she make I just I love talk to her you know just listen to her I know it be a joke cliché 50 year old married man in love with a 30 year old but I want to be with she and I do not care what it mean and I do not care what it cost I do not care I love she previously on in Treatment we be lie there face to face pet each other like high school kid one thing seem perfectly plain to I you sleep with my patient he do not belong to you he be a great guy a little insecure in bed maybe but I think I be go to have a tremendous affair with he be you say that when I be fucking Alex I be actually fuck you it seem more like look what you miss out on Paul you coward you idiot Paul if there be one thing I 've put right out there without hint or manipulation it be that I 've want you there be more intimacy between we than most couple in the world be not that right I do not deny that there be a certain intimacy be there intimacy here or not yes there be Season 1 Episode 21 Laura Week five Synchro ¤akazab¤ Kasius I be sorry Laura I think that we need to discuss in a little great detail your end therapy we be not stop yet but in order to do it gradually we have to create what we call a timeline no timeline we be finish today yeah today this be our last session Good feel good resolve I guess I be a little nervous about tell you but now

be your week be do not ask I about my week it be terrible how terrible I be in surgery on friday and this 15 year old girl she she have this tumor on her cheek it be nothing benign cosmetic and everything be go great right nothing wrong with the anesthetic and my attending gets call away to consult on a procedure and the surgery end fast than normal it be simple and I be leave with she still anesthetized so I call to ask what to do I would never be in that situation before with a patient who be never wake up and they tell I to take she into the recovery room she be still intubate and the attend be suppose to remove the tube when she wake up she be a sweet girl Pretty Michelle be her name before the op I be talk to her mom who tell I that she have be ask for this operation since she be

they extubate she and she be breathe everything be fine it be okay how do you feel during those few minute when the fantastic never well I feel like shit I only look competent Paul you know White coat stethoscope pen in pocket I be like those doctor from the pharmaceutical ad you know like hand on hip brow a little furrow with concern nice smile I have a pretty smile right do do you expect that nothing will ever go wrong with a patient I drop the ball but be that what the attend conclude I mean could not it have be something else like I do not know an allergic reaction a drop in blood it be always my responsibility Paul tell I a little bit more about that about that girl she have brace and through her surgical cap you could see what do they call it the barrette little butterfly pin back her bang they be old must have her mother 's or from a thrift store or something and she have these beautiful hand gorgeous hand I mean she be just a girl and she have these hand of a woman very long finger pretty little nail Shit when I be her age I use to eat my nail I mean they be ugly and stubby and short nerve I guess why be you nervous well it be you know around the time that my mother pass away so and whose responsibility be you then what do you mean well who be take care of you you mean who be watch my sleep yeah I be not that girl on the operating table Paul no it be just that you tell I that when your mother die that it be like a kind of a death for you too yeah but you know what Shit happen life be not fair what be you go to do sue god well who would you sue you no sue you would not do I any good either that be my problem with psychology Paul you dig and you dig and you uncover all sort of truth about yourself and you touch on all sort of painful place but what good do it do Paul I be serious I be not be cynical what good do it do I today to know how much I suffer then I be sick of feel sorry for myself I fucking hate feel sorry for myself that be one of the thing I hate what else do you hate there be a long list well for example Omelets Omelets omelet and all sort of egg but mostly omelet that be be the thing my father and I eat the entire year after my mother pass away I still have flashback but from behind you know I be stand at the stove and I be I be break egg into a fry pan Everything be very quiet no talk my dad 's just sit there read the news paper or something and I be just beat the egg with a fork sometimes he would not even be read the newspaper he would just be sit there with a vacant look in a daze I use to I would fantasize that he would disappear such a terrible thing to say it be not that I want he to die I just do not want to continue live like that everything be so bleak so suffocate I just do not want to be there so then then you go to California yeah so you stay there for a while how be it come back home after spend that time with David and Celia well you know you have plan full of bean I think shit I can make he feel well I can but I could not that house be like a black hole that just suck I in anyway I I see David again six month later he come to the DC area to try some big case he be stay for a while a few month I think you say you never see he again I never see they again but I see he he use to have a room at the Hay Adams but occasionally he would stay over at our house he do not have a car so when it get late he would stay he always offer to take a cab back into town but my dad refuse since he be so hospitable to I during the summer I mean he be lonely but he be not the same David you know with the Ray Bans and the sunblock and the surfboard he be this lawyer guy with a three piece suit an expensive haircut and a middle aged pot belly not that there be anything wrong with a pot belly anyway he come to our house for dinner the first night he be in town my brother Oliver be away at college so it be just the three of we one big happy family my dad David and I what be that like sit there with these extreme your father on one side and Nick Nolte with a pot belly sit on the other side what be that like at first self conscious I guess you know how you always feel more like a kid when your parent be around that happen I remember slurp up spaghetti try really hard not to let the noodle drip down my chin later I guess I be not as self conscious why later after David and I make love I seduce he have you read Lolita Sure it be amazing because pretty much the same thing happen to I that night when he come over for dinner my dad be still at work so we sit on the porch and catch up I be paint my toenail and it become pretty clear that he and Celia be have problem he say just as much which be why she have not join he on the trip so we be just sit on the porch swing I be on one side he be on the other and I be rest my leg on his to dry my nail and he be just ask about I what be go on with I I start tell he about the Red Hot Chili Peppers God I be so into they when you be write down the lyric and analyze they and I start singe at the top of my lung and David join in we be so bad I mean we be scream it and then I feel his hardness under my foot and we we be just rock in the swing the rhythm of it start to take over and I be just rub he with my foot although I 've never do that before in my life never I have on this little skirt with these little flower and he push up my skirt with his finger and his finger just start climb far and far up my thigh then we see my father 's Volvo come down the street so we run over to help he with the grocery and I remember laugh so hard because David be carry his bag of grocery in front of his hard on we be just crack up like teenager he stay over that night in Oliver 's room around 1 00 in the morning I get up 'cause I could not sleep I walk down the corridor in the house Oliver 's room be at the back of the house and I see his light on the door be open and he be wait for I and we make love it be lovely during the two month he be in town we make love almost every day mostly in the morning when my dad go to work but occasionally if he do not have to be in court until the afternoon I would play hooky sometimes I would go to his fancy hotel I feel very important and grow up walk through that lobby in my mother 's high heel do you ever feel that this man that David be take advantage of you he be not take advantage of I I be tell you I seduce he Lolita seduce Humbert in the novel and she be only 12 you disapprove obviously yes I do what be the matter you be make a judgment on I you be allow yourself to stray from the rule Gosh it be too bad you be not like this before willing to say what be on your mind you never tell I this before it be our last session so I think it be only right you to tell you remember I tell you that the guy from debate society be my first David be my first and I be sorry what be you sorry for for lie to you I be not a victim do not look at I like that I be not a victim really I get into his bed he be a 40 year old man for Christ 's sake he have a responsibility to send you away he be very gentle Gentle or not it be beside the point he be 40 year he have a moral responsibility he should have know well let I ask you something do you feel do you feel any anger towards this man it be not such a big deal he do not hurt I it do not hurt at all it be not rape where be your father during all this he be asleep in the next room but during the two month that David be visit your father have no idea what be go on he be depressed and grieve it have not even be a year since my mother pass away he need someone to protect he and guess who I understand that but child be not suppose to take care of their parent it be a burden that no child deserve do you feel any anger towards your father for not be there to protect you for not notice no resentment Let us just say you could talk to your father now what would you say to he I have nothing to say to he but just imagine for a moment if you be face to face and you be talk about this incident what do you think you might say to he have you ever speak to your father in that way I wish I could because you can not talk to your father you be ask I to talk to mine that be not what I be say I think it be important that you talk to your father about this while it be still possible not for his sake but for yours can I have something to drink other than water do you have any soda so this be the famous coffee machine huh Alex 's famous coffee machine yeah how do you use it excuse I he be such a coffee freak it be the good smell do not you think you know that this thing with I and Alex be over I end it be you relieve Jesus look at you how can you live like this can not you just say or do something on impulse you know that I connect that girl to the wrong tube I inflate she like a balloon and I almost kill she and you know why because I be think about you and I realize what an insane effect you be have on I it have to stop we can continue to talk about this if you want all of a sudden you be very generous with your time for month I spend the week think it will be this Monday I will tell he that I love he he will tell I he love I and the session will not be 50 minute it will go forever but then Monday would come and I would not dare say anything and the session would end I would just walk out of here think fuck I do not say anything again now I have to wait a whole other week for my life to begin I can not continue every minute here be tear I apart previously on in Treatment I sleep with her okay but I be sure you get a full play by play from she already after we have sex she straddle my leg she start rub up against I it be so obvious she be completely and totally hang up on someone else ever hear of vertigo when you go into vertigo you look only at your aircraft 's instrument but keep my eye on my instrument be what get I here because I keep my eye on my instrument I drop that bomb so accurately I kill innocent people what be the first step on the way to my new life what would you like to do I think I will go fuck she again yeah Flight 810 estimate time of arrival 9 55 a m Flight 323 estimate time of arrival 11 05 a m Flight 111 estimate time of arrival 12 21 p m be I early again no no you be fine come on in Finish what you be do I will make coffee no it be okay you be fine the rain in Spain fall mainly on the plain that be bullshit you know I 've be to Spain and the rain in the Pyrenees be a bitch Sync Benj so I will open with the punchline doc I break up with Laura I be actually a pretty great fuck the second time I drink about a half bottle of Stoli just to relax I also take a pill that Daniel give I you know one of those I have a hard on for a day and a half Paul you should try it sometime it be a little strange though it be like a woody that actually feel like wood 'cause it be just sit up there and mind his own business like it be get nothing to do with you work like a charm though anyway I make up for the last time we be fucking all night long in the morning too in the end I realize that she be just use I she really be not with I she be just use I for an excuse you know yeah at any rate it be over it be really not go to go anywhere from here excuse I when you say from here forgive I but do you mean from this office what be you try to say that your relationship with Laura have something to do with what go on in this office have you completely lose your mind what be you grasp at now a word no it be just that you be always try to make this bizarre connection between you I and Laura be it I 'cause you be the one always make a big deal out of it tell I something do not happen between you and her what you be ask I to tell you what do not happen yeah I be ask do something happen between you two or not you mean apart from therapy Jesus look at you dance it be a simple question your million dollar technique answer a question with a question well it be not go to fly this time I will tell you why I be ask every time we be together half the time she talk about you she keep ask what I know about you and your family she be pretty obsessive about it and I then I remember how jumpy you get every time I mention her name so I think maybe something go on between you maybe you a married man how should I put it you fool around with she what be you suggest Alex can you just say that nothing happen between you why be that so difficult we 've talk about this I will only discuss your relationship with Laura nothing else Sweet so you discuss mine but not yours the point I be try to make be that my other patient have nothing to do with your therapy excuse I you have sex with somebody I be date sound very relevant to my therapy she say she be have sex with I do not have to you be convinced that she do I be just ask the only relevant thing be how you feel about the possibility of laura have sex with somebody other than yourself do not start with your asinine shit you be cop out would you stop try to force I into this relationship you 've concoct why in the hell would I do that maybe you want to compete with I maybe it be like the coffee the check your intelligence if I be not mistaken I be pay to talk this be what I want to talk about you and laura and I would like a straight answer for a change have you notice when an emotional issue come up for you you focus on money I have a different theory though 'cause every time we touch on something that have to do with you you get scared shitless why would I be scared about talk about myself because you want your patient to think you be superhuman you be a buddha you do not eat you do not shit you do not piss you do not argue with your wife you do not fantasize about your patient no you be above all of these earthly thing because you live only for your patient your private life do not matter only this inner sanctum why be you give I that look what look it be the way I look no that look like you know everything like you can see right through I maybe like the old man in Baghdad oh fuck now you will say you want to talk about my father right okay would you like to talk about your father you people love this shit this be right in your wheelhouse you wanna talk about my father go ahead fire away ask I whatever you want but he be an amazing man my dad he really be but that be not what you tell I last week he be a good man okay there be nothing you or 200 shrink can change let us put aside for the moment whether he be a good man or a bad man okay what interest I be how you feel about he and what your relationship with he be like when I say he be an amazing man I be talk about fact not feeling would you say that to a girl who be rape by her father in third grade you be not interested in good or bad you be only interested in how she feel about the relationship when do good or bad go out of style that reference to the girl be rape by her father where do that come from can we go back to last week if I rember correctly you describe your father as be an unfaithful man you say that he be ungrateful he treat your mother really terribly but that at the same time you have a great admiration for he that be correct yes it seem to I that your feeling about your father alex be pretty conflicted you do not get what I say at all well maybe you could explain it to I a little bit more Fuck that it be no use you be go to hear what you wanna hear do you and your dad talk a lot yeah we talk as much as be necessary what do that mean as much as be necessary I do not understand that question well who call who we talk as much as possible he be not a chatterbox he be precise you know he be to the point boom he cut straight to the heart of thing he be like iron my dad cast iron Iron in everything he do his movement everything the way he work the way he think his wisdom I do not think there be a book he have not read I be talk real literature doc history political science everything the man be 70 year old and he work like he do 30 year ago he be as healthy as a horse he can still beat I in arm wrestle he be iron you know when I think of iron I tend to think of something that be really indestructible that be incredibly powerful strong and yet at the same time something that be kind of cold how do you feel about what I do kill people drop the bomb on themadrassa why be you go back to that simple question doc it be about your main thing feeling how do you feel about what I do when I drop a bomb on 16 kid I be not here to judge you I be not ask for a judgment I wanna know how do you feel how do I feel well I think it must be very difficult for you to live with what happen what you have make an art and a science and a career out of take the easy position do you really think not judge you be easy Alex let I tell you something it be not why can not you just say you think I be a murderer because I know that be what you think I know that be what you talk about when you be out with your friend at some fancy restaurant you sit around the table and you say it be terrible it be awful it be a massacre what it do to they it be just atrocious what it do to we let I tell you something I come here and I put my trust in you why can not you be honest enough to just tell I how you feel you know what my father say when I tell he about the mission what that be what he say you know what that be the smart reaction I get from anybody include you and all the other bleed heart 'cause there be nothing to say what be you go to say some thing can not be explain away sometimes you can not peel away something and find it be just as plain as can be 16 kid bury dead under a building that be it my father have it right the old man you got to be like that you got to be like iron baby it must be difficult for you to have live in the shadow of somebody who think like that that you 've get to be to be like iron all the time you see how you twist thing around be I ever go to get out of this alive if I say he be a pussy you would have a comment about that if I say he be a hero you would have a comment about that you love to sit here you listen to people 's problem so you can probably sit on your porch at the end of the day and just tell yourself my life be so great can we stay focused on what the issue be we be try to deal with here the difficulty that you must have have live in the shadow of your father in a world where you be not allow to express who you be your tender side maybe your feminine side for example so what do you do the only thing you can do be defy he you have to fight with everything you have but you know something alex you have not do that you have not dare to do that your father be such a powerful impose character that you be terrified he will crush you so you come through this door with all your rage your resentment your jealousy your bury anger toward he you bring it in here and you let it loose on I that be what you do but that be okay that be fine that be why I be here I think that be the most patronizing thing I 've ever hear your wife it be okay go ahead it be fine really I apologize Jesus look look at you look at how stressed you get think I might learn the slight detail about your life so what you get a wife at home big deal see that be the real problem with all your theory paul they completely ignore your side of the whole equation that you be also human yeah you have this nice theory that I see you as my father and that be why I want to what do you say Defy you but what about you why do you keep make it seem as if you have no personal stake in this as if you be only here for I it be a deception paul let us take Laura for example you play such a big role in her life it be unbelievable she know nothing about you she be sure you be one of the most perfect people she be ever meet and she have not the faint idea of who you be what your belief be how long you 've be marry nothing do not it just seem a little insane to you who be you really I know the whole truth about you you be not make of iron that be for damn sure not even close do you have something go on with she or not you really be pervert you know that she be young enough to be your daughter man during all our session here Ibet you sit here and you imagine how I screw she right you try to make I angry hey do not try to turn this into my psychosis I be onto your shit but you be the one in therapy you be the one not tell the truth you be the one who be bullshit I you be the hypocrite I come in here every week and I tell you everything now you can not look I in the eye and admit that you be fall in love with a patient 20 year young than you I mean come on you can not hang with her Come on look at you you will look like a fool trust I you can not keep up with her pace I can tell you that let I ask you something why do you have to sleep with her I do not know I get tired of jerk off a thousand woman could have fulfil that function why laura she be sexy as hell have you notice I think that you be try to get back at I because she be my patient the whole world revolve around your ass I understand your theory you 've be hint at it for the last 3 session that be not fly either you really think that everything that happen between I and she be mean to hurt you you do it to provoke I maybe you be look for a reaction some kind of reaction anything more than a pat on the thigh something emotional even if it be anger that be interesting that be another brilliant theory there doc but how about you paul the fact that your wife be screw her lover in some pathetic hotel overlook the piazza di trevi in Rome be that get a reaction out of you yeah you would be real surprised the kind of information you find out from a few phone call yeah I find out a bunch of thing paul about whole bunch of subject in fact I 've be take a little interest in psychology lately I 've be mean to check out what you get here I even read a book laura give I about the whole concept of reciprocity in therapy about how everything that go on in here should be reciprocal so it make I think you sit here you listen to I and you pretend to solve all my problem but you do not have a fucking clue about yourself so I figure I get a choice either I accept your superiority as if you be some kind of god or I use my intelligence and do a little investigate just to make sure that this god be not some kind of Dr Ruth who tell everybody how to fuck while she be still a virgin you know what I mean 70 year old and hey but so I make a few call paul nothing too complicated more or less the same people I consult before come here what be amazing be how many people be die to help you find what you be look for I find a hell of a god in my investigation a god whose life be fall apart whose wife be sleep around behind his back whose daughter be fucking junkie whose father yeah whose father be rot away in some geriatric hospital somewhere in virginia and why be the son too stingy to pay for a slightly more liveable place what a god and then laura come along your sexy patient yet and her only wish in life be to get you into bed because she think that be go to solve all of her sexual hangup and you you fall in love with that crazy slut do not you fucking talk about my patient you fuck how fucking dare you you prick Richard it be paul look I be really sorry I have to cancel our session today I I be sorry it be such short notice something have come up and I will get back to you call I if there be a problem bye what be happen nothing it be why be you cancel your appointment paul when do you get in it be about 10 minute ago be that you knock at the door Paul I be so sorry honestly I think you be alone it be okay it be okay what do you do to your hand Accident I drop a let I see you will survive you know how be the kid Max keep ask when you be come home I do not quite know what to say to he Paul we move into separate room on the first day it be completely over if that matter at all thank I 've get to hello Julian come in previously on in Treatment Charmed I be sure so yesterday I march

gym it be not like she be injure that be not the problem you be I be the problem right always yes always you be one gargantuan problem let I ask you something Sophie do you feel that you be ready to go back to training yes but you can also understand how your mom be a little bit concerned about that she be a crazy bitch nobody understand her I think I understand she if I stay at home with her I will either slit my wrist or I will go postal they will shut I in the loony bin and you will not be there to get I out next time I think your mom be concerned about whether you be ready mentally for the stress you will be under when you go back I can deal with stress if you can not you do not belong there it be not for sissy why be you sigh I be not I just hear you you be sigh just breathe not allow anymore if I do not try out for the olympics I will kill myself for real Sophie enough no more threat no more thank you doctor Shut up what be you even do here get your own life and butt out of

so what be it Paul to train or not to train Olivia I understand your concern and why you would not want Sophie to go back to the gym but and I have give this a great deal of thought I do think that Sophie should continue her program of training what be you sure yes I think that the gym be a place okay but I do not know see I just think after everything be you deaf no I be not deaf so you hear he yes I hear he so why be you still talk here come the waterworks I be go to wait in the car Hallelujah I would prefer if you stay if she stay I be so out I can see myself out Dr Weston Paul I never get a chance to thank you for all the string that you pull at the hospital if it be not for you they would have commit she for god know how long actually it do not quite work like that she would have have an uncomfortable night or two but in any case thank you make sure she walk away she could still be there listen through the door she be not listen at the door she be go you be pretty confident today Confident how send I back to the gym like nothing happen where do you think my confidence come from special delivery from old people land I be confident because I think I 've figure out why why you take those pill in my bathroom last week I think you be test I Sophie and I pass the test barely but I do pass it so maybe you can trust I now 'cause I trust you one thing that bother I though what if you decide to test somebody else and they do not know it be a test do not matter to I I would be dead I think one of the thing that we need to figure out be what you find so attractive about about die what do die mean to you Freedom Freedom from what you and your stupid question and what else my mother so you think death be the only way to escape your mother I be pretty sure even death will not do well let I ask you this if your mom be not around would you still want to die I have no idea dipshit oh I be irritate you now see what you be do now be you be shut I out be that what you do to your mom what else do death mean to you sleep well and what do sleep well mean not feel not feel what anything when you say not feel anything do you mean feel like calm be there anyplace in your life where you feel calm not here that be for sure okay tell I what you feel when you be here would you like to talk about what happen last week we go to a pretty painful place it be a place of great feeling and then suddenly you you go to the bathroom and you put yourself to sleep go on I can not describe it what can not you describe what I feel Paul God do everything have to be talk about it be too fucking hard I need you to try sophie you try you want I to try to express what you feel I try to make myself throw up but nothing come out do you remember after the accident you say I finally kill she what do you mean by that I do not know we have these two side to our personality the weak side and the strong side they be constantly in conflict with each other sometimes the weak side be sneaky and it be crafty and it win for example when you let somebody buy you shoe that you do not really want or when you have sex with somebody that you do not really want to have sex with see when it come to sport you be completely confident on the beam you be really powerful but off the beam when you be not a gymnast when you be just a girl when you be a young woman that part of you be less secure and you seem more what be the word I be look for More Susceptible do you I know what susceptible mean I hate that part of I but they be both you so do you really think it be okay if I go back to training yes I do but here be the thing I want you to know that I be go to be here for you anytime all you have to do be just call I but on one condition I want you to know this and understand it really clearly I will not treat you under the threat of suicide do you understand I and if I do not agree then I can not go back to the gym then you can not come back here ever do we have a deal you say before that I be test you you say that you barely pass the fact that you be test I at all that be a kind of a failure for I that you should feel you have to test my love for you your love yeah I can not treat somebody that I do not love I have to find something in each of my patient that I love otherwise I will not be able to treat they I bet you have to search I with a magnify glass to find something to love I remember the first day that you come here and you be walk around the office and you and you ask I about these boat you say to I be these here because you do not really sail and I say yeah and you say well maybe you should make one of those glass window like they have on boat so that you can see the world do you remember that when you say that I think that be when I start to to love who you be you say it like it be easy you be not use to people say I love you my dad he tell you that he do not have to I be surprised I do not see he in the hospital when I visit you you just miss he what do he do do you think to earn your love why maybe I can steal his secret and give they to your mom Hilarious how do you know he do love you if he do not say it I do not need to hear he say it word be bullshit everybody lie I feel his love and he feel I even when I be far away want to know a secret I have to wear glass all the time Most of the time I walk around half blind do you know why why 'cause I prefer it that way with my glass on everything be too sharp without they everyone look look like they 've get perfect skin so my mother must look like a supermodel to you why be you tell I this I think your father look well in the distance far away blurry but your mother be right up close and she be kind of painfully clear I be really over this conversation before you pass out last week you say something about model something about a photo shoot not begin on time I remember that you tell I that your dad be a photographer do your dad work with with model why be you pick on he my dad be the only person in this world who really love I why be that so hard for you to get your head around what be you do I forgot to give you the money to pay Paul be you listen through the door of course not I be in the car I be not go to let she go back to the gym that place be kill she who be you to take the risk she almost die here on your sofa and you be just dust she off and send she back no if you do not get away from he I be leave here and I be never come back I will go to dad to dad 's I will Good go ahead I will cry a little hard mom that be great if I bring home a medal you would probably drown in your own tear if you bring home a stop make I look like a monster in front of the shrink yes yes I think that the competition be insane and you be put unbelievable stress on your young body but I be so proud of your accomplishment be not every mother proud of their daughter do not ask he you want to go to therapy get your own guy nobody want you here now get the fuck out not until he tell I how he can sit there and let you go back to let I you think I be like you I be some sort of child who need permission to do anything if I want to train I will train if I want to kill myself I will kill myself if I want to fuck Cy in my hospital room while you be bang on the door then that be what I will fucking do what do you say you hear I you be not go back to that gym Fine start look for my burial plot I be go back to training next week for the olympic and if you try to stop I you will never see I again right I hear you you will go to your father 's only he be in Miami

to New York to Miami to fuck Timbuktu he be not here and it be my fault it be my fault because I be here maybe I will leave you alone for a few month and then maybe you can love I just a little yes just fuck off if she come to therapy you would need a tissue plant next door do you have sex with Cy at the hospital no you be 16 year of age you be a minor I 've think long and hard about bring legal action against this guy you tell I there be no sexual contact between you and he after the first time be that true yes nothing else have happen do you want it to happen again no should I be worried about you and Cy no why be my mom so pathetic you know what I do not think she be pathetic in fact I think she be pretty strong she swallow all the crap that you give she she still come back for more she be make every mistake in the book but you know you punish she in a million different way and she be never give up on you I know you do not want to hear this but I do not think you 've give up on she either we be out of time be not we why do not you tell I that your father do not know you try to kill yourself why be that such a big secret it be not I have to go what about our agreement let us talk about it next week no we will not talk about it next week what about our agreement I will not try and kill myself as long as I be in therapy all right say it again I will not try and kill myself as long as I be in therapy previously on in Treatment a liar should not expect their word to be worth anything I be go to start some real lying to teach you a lesson you say that when you see Jake for the first time you think he be sexy as hell he be beautiful Amy have a strong need to have a career that seem to make you jealous that in turn make Amy secretive and she lie stop call I a liar stop lie stop it you be a fucking liar God damn it stop it you be a fucking liar you be a quitter he be a winner if you have a quarter of Ben 's strength I would be interested in you too you psychopath have you ever record your argument with she before I just want to understand what be happen to we what be up you fall asleep how long have you be here five minute should we go in there be someone in there can I sit what time be it five to well well what be you go to be like this in there too like what I do not know Season 1 Episode 24 Week 4 Session 4 Sync by michvanilly Gaillots anyone so how be you both fine Fantastic before we begin I want to talk about last week I can tolerate yelling and outburst that result from your argument but I will not absolutely not tolerate any physical violence do you understand that it be ok we separate a week ago separate I be sorry to hear that so it be a little late to start set up ground rule hope you do not feel like an idiot that be what you would want I suppose why would I wanna make you look like an idiot because it make you feel good wait do you hear what I just say yes you say that you have be separate for a week would you like to tell I why he threaten to kill I you be smile you be take on a huge responsibility what responsibility you act like you be not concern you do not think he be capable of do it he could be perfectly capable of it then why be you smile I 've have patient over the year who 've have their life threaten you just bring this up like it be nothing well I be not into this what be the matter can not you hear how he be talk to we what the hell be wrong with you why be you be so hostile that be what it feel like to you very much so ok what I have to put up with you both be hostile to each other and to I constantly that be why we pay you the money be not really important to I I have other patient I do not understand you say you do not wanna treat we anymore do I want to treat you that be a tough one actually this be what therapy would be like if nobody respect boundary it be chaotic it be disrespectful and it be unproductive do you understand that be that what you want can not even get couple therapy right our own therapist do not want to treat we anymore why do not you just tell I what happen after the session last week I take Lenny and go to my mother 's and then Jake show up on Saturday and want to take Lenny home before they poison he with sugar please you should see the crap they force feed he do not do that anyway we go to the bedroom to talk one thing lead to another and we end up have sex how do one thing and another lead to the sex you want some detail bro whatever you would like to tell I thing that dull at home I be interested in your sex because it be part of your dialogue as a couple so how do it go from sex to a murder threat he have just finish come he be still lie on top of I he be still inside I and he whisper in my ear that if I leave he he would kill I he do not even bother pull out I be disgust that be an unusual reaction to somebody threaten to kill you what be it that disgust you let I tell you what disgust I watch she and her mother shove junk food down my son 's throat it be a miracle the kid do not shit twinkie what do Lenny have to do with this no what you do to he disgust I he be 9 and he weigh 100 pound he do not weigh 100 pound so be Lenny overweight he be a child he will grow out of it when he hit puberty I be the same you be overweight my dirty little secret she have issue with food I be thin by the time we got marry who care what I weigh when I be 5 you never mention that before we never speak about it 'cause it be irrelevant in this context this be couple 's therapy right when do you lose the weight in my teen just melt off so do it bother you that Lenny be overweight please stop say that I do not like refer to he that way he have a little baby fat he will lose it 30 pound of it her mother let he eat candy drink soda play Xbox he do not want he to see my mother he would be well off on the street he be get the gene of an athlete I see it come it be my fault he be fat I pass down shitty gene we can not talk about Lenny without I be blame for the terrible gene I give he so the fact that you be overweight that do come up in argument between you do not you think it be a relevant subject for therapy no I do not understand why we be go in this direction yes he want to talk about our fat little boy why do not we talk about how Jake 's screw Lenny up she mean I be screw he up socially Lenny hit because he gets laugh at for be fat no Lenny hit because Jake teach he to hit he gets bully at school so I teach he to defend himself it be normal besides you be the one do the hitting last week you convince Paul it be go to escalate to murder you be the one planning to kill I remember I would gladly but I would feel bad for Paul we already ruin his couch once right can you see the pattern here what you do to each other you take the most sensitive subject you just toss they away carelessly sometimes you laugh sometimes it hurt you but do not you feel that it make it much more difficult to get to the bottom of your real feeling you think I find it funny that he be threaten I do you mean it when you say these thing what you go to do call the police possibly be not there law against that against threaten to kill somebody no law against tell other people what your patient tell you they do not apply to serious crime just let you know but at least you be call yourself a patient that be progress Jake so fucking condescend Somebody should really teach you a lesson what be that another threat so many threat fly around the place I be have trouble keep up what be go on with you today I be try to get you guy to listen really listen to what you be say let I ask you something have Jake threaten you before physically I do not really mean I would kill she ok it just come out how do you put it exactly he say if you leave I I will kill you do you mean that of course not I be not go to fucking kill she this week what be that suppose to mean what be you try to say and you say you be not afraid Amy but you feel disgusted yes what do that mean disgust what do you think Paul tell I what you think he would just come inside I and then say that he want to kill I what do you think disgust I about that Jake do you understand the severity of what you say that threat you realize she could get a restraining order against you do not you I think you understand what I be talk about if you leave I I will kill you we 've be concentrate on the 2nd part of that sentence but let us look at the first part of it if you leave I that say to I that you be afraid you be afraid of what will happen to you if Amy leave the fear that you would cease to exist maybe that you would die let us just leave that for a moment I would like to go back to something that we talk about early on would you like to talk about your memory of be a child be overweight I do not think about that I live my life move forward and do that need to be analyze would you say that you be a confident child not really I would say I be overweight and shy but I grow out of it and I be fine actually I be more than fine and Lenny will be fine too last week you say Jake and his friend be pathetic yes they be that maybe it be convenient for you to think of Jake as be pathetic as you say be an underachiever why perhaps because it help you avoid see your own insecurity I think that when he threaten you in bed he reveal how desperately he need you although he do it in a very scary way but that be Jake at his most vulnerable which I think you associate with he be pathetic and you do not want that so you be say that I be with an underachiever because I lack self esteem perhaps that be a way for you to avoid deal with negative feeling about yourself I want a divorce Fine I be take Lenny with I you think I be just go to let he go with you so you can turn he into some fat ass couch potato because you wanna make a change I do not want to make a change I want my life Lenny need I he should be with I he need I too fuck Amy what do you want from I what do you want from I nothing Let us just try and do this nicely Jake please what the fuck 's so nice about it I happen to know this couple who go to therapy after they have already decide to get divorce and they make a decision in the end to stay together that be not go to be the case here the only reason I mention it be because I want you to know that even when divorce become a possibility it be not always so final be you try to change our mind your mind this particular couple have problem they could not even hold a civil conversation with each other they sleep in separate bedroom why there would be an affair who cheat that be not really the point there be be no infidelity in our relationship I be not infer that Amy I guess what I be try to say be that I know what it be like you know sometimes people have to get to this precipice to understand what they really mean to each other I can not do this anymore do not you think there be still some very positive aspect to your relationship like what the murder threat the suspicion the recording the stakeout what I see it in the way that you look at each other sometimes the way you make each other laugh and you 've you 've be work on your relationship pretty steadily by come here every week be you cheat on I so why do Paul just tell we about that other couple then be that story about you no of course it be that be not the point she tell you she be cheat or not I must hear everything remember I be not cheat neither of you be open up here you be both too busy attack each other I want you to listen I want each of you to examine your own culpability here not continuously look for what be wrong with the other person and not to be so on guard all the on guard be we play poker or something I come here to save my marriage and you tell I she be have an affair he never say that so you be here to save your marriage no because I get a thing for you you be here to save your marriage you just say it now say it to Amy Jake look at your wife and tell her Jake we be constantly fight we will stay together and then we will not fight if we stay together we will not be able to stop even Paul say so what be all this therapy for I do not know what to do Paul what be I suppose to do talk to your wife say it to Amy Amy I want to tell you something Jake stop please listen to I I wanna tell you something I do not want you to leave I I do not want to lose you I do not want you to leave I I have not sleep in like a week I can not sleep I can not eat I do not know what to do but I really I do not want you to leave I please do not leave I please do not fucking leave I previously on in Treatment teacher marry student it be not a big deal I mean be it really wrong let us say I stop Laura 's therapy surely in a year 18 month when it be cool off there be no cool off period that be some bullshit some lawyer come up with no it be not a law it be beyond a code of ethic it be something you carry inside you a lot of people would disagree with this then go to they it be really tough when I be alone with her you know and she be ask I please just be honest please tell I how you feel and I can not you need to say it I love her Season 1 episode 25 subtitle Anyone Coffee Tagne Come in come in hi Gina Kate hello it be good to see you and you you 've be here before right it be year ago actually it be the Argentineans I think an institute conference yes that be right that be right you look great thank you so do you this room 's lovely thank you I do some rearrange but I be not sure how comfortable I be in it I tell myself I would write a few hour a day do Paul tell you I retire no Paul do not tell I write that be fantastic we will see yeah I mean I 've often think that I might try my hand but I would not ever dare so it be a little unusual to have ongoing session with Paul and then to see the both of you I think it might be helpful if we all decide how to approach this I think I tell you when I call that this be Kate 's suggestion you say that if I be you I would not be so sure I would agree to it why not well we 've blur some line here you and I that be true we have but I think we will be okay if we set down some guideline I be think we could meet three time re evaluate and then decide where we want to go from there now what make you decide to come here Paul you say that it be Kate 's suggestion but you be go along with it I think I tell you about Kate go to Rome and who she go with she get back and she say that it be over with that guy I guess we both have the sense of so what do we do now Kate do offer to talk about it and I could not I be too angry I know in couple therapy you try not to blame each other and I be always tell my patient that you know like it be the simple thing now here I be and I can not stop blame intellectually I get it that I be half of the equation but you say you could not talk to Kate so she have not hear any of this how you feel well I think she know that she hurt I deeply and that that I hate she could you go into that I hate you for think you be entitle to this for imply that I bring it on myself I could not shake it every minute I would get a wave of rage and loss why why loss because I really do not know if I can forgive she I 've see couple come back from this but right now I will be damn if I know how they do it anyway she get back Tuesday and I say well should I move out she say that be not what she want and you tell she I just ask he why he could not talk to I about all of this about you know everything we be go through can you answer that Paul I just say I could not I tell patient that have someone be like mourn a death who you be as a couple the image that you have of yourself it be like lose a love one you keep tell we what you tell patient but you be talk about your mourning your rage your loss you be sound very control what you want I to throw something try to strangle she I can barely look at her I be so I feel like I be fall apart I should tell you this and Kate already know I attack a patient in therapy the pilot in the middle of therapy I jump he I lose it suddenly I be on top of he I grab he I almost I almost hit he Scared the hell out of I or both of we I guess anyway my first thought afterwards be that I be react to Kate she come home during the session she knock at the door back from Rome I hear she outside the office and then what be it I should not discuss a patient with Kate here you can not discuss a patient who be spy on I he do all this research about Kate and about about my father he know that Kate be in Italy with with another man and he he throw it in my face how do he know that he make call People that have recommend I to he I do not know who they be anyway that be not the point instead of handle it properly I jump in and I lie in bed that night think do I take a month off do I take three month off maybe I should take a year off maybe I be maybe I be maybe I be all do and that be my fault what your creepy patient he be my fault as well actually it make I think how much I need you do you yeah you the kid the house I need that I need that other place where I can what Hang on that other place I be pretty sure we be suppose to be the place sorry how do this work do we take turn be that how whatever you be comfortable with it be always be very difficult for I try to describe what I be feel when you be have a baby yeah you be lie there in that hospital bed and and you do not need you do not want everything understand and share and analyze and discuss all you want to know be that you be not alone and that your husband 's hand be right there but try describe to your husband exactly what it feel like to have a child it be just impossible a friend of mine once say take an umbrella shove it up his ass open it and pull then he will know so someone stick an umbrella up your ass be what be the umbrella please do not analyze I well it be quite an analogy I be not your patient he do not get to interpret everything I say in here do he it be the same as when Paul 's at home he be not a psychotherapist here he be a man deal with a crisis in his marriage he be not a therapist at home can you go on Kate when you tell I about attack your patient I feel like that be for my benefit that you just want to show I what I have do to you by see Edward and how I have ruin your life and well your work you have not ruin my life you be the good thing in it I feel like you be put on a show Christ you know I believe you when you tell I that you want I to stop see Edward I do but when you sit here right now and you tell I that I be the good thing in your life I do not believe that and that make I so sad and the way you talk to I sometimes I mean I will ask you outright do you love I and you 've say to I you 've look at I and you 've say yes for now it be it be a joke well what the hell kind of a joke be that someone ask you if you love they you do not think that they be feel vulnerable a little insecure maybe they need some reassurance everything we say have mean that be your line but we do not mean everything that we say which be it that be pretty convenient for you be not it we do not mean what we say fine 'cause I do not believe a lot of what you say I mean Gina just point it out you say I be hurt but it sound like you be read something out of a psychology book how do you need I you do not need I I just do not believe that you know when Paul and I be first see each other I could not get over how seriously he take I I would never have that from anyone up until then I would always pretty much feel invisible and there be also there be this this exciting new idea that under everything people say there be another intention and that there be this hide meaning which just mean that everything have to be analyze so everything I say take on this importance because he be work so hard to figure I out and he be really the first person who try to understand I and I thank you and I just remember feel very grateful to he for that so it be quite a shock for I to realize that it be not about I it have fuck all to do with I really I mean it be about he because you do not actually understand I understand I be not about subtext it be not about the subconscious it be not about read some kind of an x ray it be just so clinical actually it be bad because you use it against I you think you know what I mean before I know what I mean and how be I suppose to argue with that this be what I 've get out of our marriage I got to think over thing 10 different way I can not take anything at face value nothing be simple nothing be ever simple I hate it I hate that that be what I 've become just the patient marry to the doctor for someone who be ask how this whole thing work you be do a blue ribbon job I get to give you that I do not come here for you to grade my performance Kate can you explain to Paul why you be see Edward I do not want to explain no this be exactly what I be say why do everything have to be explain sometimes I just do not know and sometimes I do not want to know Fine initially it be just excitement and adrenaline and there be this possibility when I wake up in the morning that I may do something that I have not plan or that I do not even know I be capable of and that be who I be before I meet Paul and somewhere along the way that part of I just die or I do not know it be smother the point I be try to make be why can I not just trust myself to be who I be and to just get on with it well just because you do not look it do not mean there be nothing underneath that be very profound I be sure there be still a reason why you would you please stop it I do not want your intellectual interpretation of everything I say I do it because I feel something what do you feel want I mean do you want I to say that I want you I do I want you that be why I be here so that you will believe it Paul do you feel that you need a witness to verify your love for Kate thank you thank you I be sorry but I just keep get this that image of Bill Clinton that footage of he stand in front of all those camera and wag his finger so adamantly you know I do not have sexual relation with that woman Jeez that be some comparison you know I can not assert anything strongly enough because that would be a clear indication of my insincerity but on the other hand if I do not state my feeling then that be something else Fair enough maybe there be nothing you can say to I all I know be I have to feel it in my gut to believe it and you do not no I do not do you remember do you remember what it feel like to be want to be truly desire and pursue it be not something you experience as a debate it be not an argument you need to be convince of it be just this this force that have to be that have to be reckon with what be it do I what what do I say what be go on do you know what transference be when a patient have feeling for their therapist which be in fact draw from their relationship with their parent they project quality onto the therapist that do not really exist or they can be just exaggerated and then when they find the courage the patient they reach a level of trust and they feel safe enough to express their desire for the and and so for a time the patient may experience feeling as if they be truly intend for the for the therapist do you fuck she what be that what you be tell I I be not sure be you tell I that you sleep with a patient no that be not what I be you ask I if I feel someone 's desire for I and I be say yes I have patient who 've indicate feeling for I only I be not fly off to Rome to fuck they it happen in therapy all the time have this happen to you yes it have I 've speak to Gina about it it be really valuable for I to explore my own feeling with another therapist so that they do not get in the way so that I can work through my feeling because then I do not let they get the good of I and ruin my marriage that be all right so exactly what kind of feeling have this woman provoke in you what have he say to you Kate only Paul can answer that it be okay he do not have to this be why he need to make some sort of a declaration of commitment to I this be his wag finger his I do not have sexual relation with that woman but I do not do not matter this be not nothing if this be nothing you would not have bring it up here if this be just some patient with a silly crush be you tell I you 've fall in love with some patient that you be treat you have your insurance guy you do not get to play the outraged wife here he be not an insurance guy and you know it thank you for another one of your stupid painful joke and I do not get to play outrage why do not you explain the last few week to I while you 've be run around like a goddamn martyr the whole time you be chase some patient Jesus Christ actually let I guess what be she some girl with no father figure he die abandon she when she be 12 he love that type I will tell you how old be she what type Kate girl with that particular brand of dysfunction a tasty little daddy complex so he can sweep they off their foot it be daydream that be all maybe it be a little more than daydream look I want to come clean here now you know the reason I be tell you be because I want it to stop you want to stop what you wanna stop want to fuck patient how do you stop that I do not know but we might try act like a couple who actually might want to be together maybe you can describe to Kate what you be experience with this patient like Kate do with Edward look you can not you can not compare the she sleep with somebody I allow myself a fantasy that be all I never admit it to this woman I certainly never act on it but you be die to yes I be die to but I do not anyway she quit therapy I forgot to tell you she quit therapy on Monday well good now you can fuck she without worry or lose your license or maybe now I can try to save our marriage or what be leave of it which apparently be not very much do you say Monday Monday Monday yes that be why you would not go with Max on a Monday because you do not want to miss your session with this girl be you serious Max he be have a lot of problem at school there be this conference with his teacher and Paul want to reschedule because I know something be wrong I know it and all your speechifying all your fucking sanctimony walk around like the mortally wound and the whole time Jesus make total sense now do not it a million little thing when do this

sound to I that your father be do not sound like he be surprised how do you feel about that that he might have know all along and that that he do not do anything about it I do not take it that way look Paul the pain you know the shock of it be so bad he immediately have to act as if he have know all along as if to deflect the shock of it to old habit die hard huh you can take the girl out of therapy but you can not take a therapy out of the conversation it be funny thing be so different it feel like I have not be here for a year be those new shoe these no I find they in the closet forget

the condition of his apartment I probably would not have sleep with he no actually I would have 'cause that be how it be with I I act on impulse you think this be act on impulse this be not impulsive this be the long foreplay I 've ever experience a year of just get to know you what do you know about I Laura Specific you mean I know some thing I know you have child yes I do Max Rosie Ian yeah what else once or twice you have not wear your wedding ring I notice that it be because sometimes when I be wash the dish the the dishwash get under the band and irritate the skin what be you think about now just you I remember once when I be when I be 14 I have a crush no actually I do not have a crush I I fall in love with my my biology teacher oh yeah well she must have be about 33 34 and I use to write these big long poem and I would put they in my homework and I remember say to her one day I be not interested in girl my age they do not get I they do not understand I they do not know who the real I be what I really want be be her so one day I find myself alone in the lab a science lab with she and I hear myself say that that I just have to kiss she and what happen she turn off the light and she come right up to I and she be face I in complete darkness and I remember the sound of her breathing and the smell of her perfume it be like I I be drunk or something she look I straight in the eye and she say really quietly go on do it just do it you know what happen what I get the hell out of there run away do you ever think what would have happen if you have not run if you have kiss she I use to think about that all the time but now when I think of it I I thank she for it I do for what for scare you no I guess she show I that what I feel or that what I think I feel even though it be real and genuine to I be be really just a fantasy it be not real and that she have the compassion to let I go back to my to my future David do not turn out the light he say he want to look at I that my body be amazing that I be beautiful he go on and on about that I can not believe how naive I be what I think be go to happen when I walk into his room I God be not it crazy all the thing you imagine what sex would be when you be young well I have very romantic thought I imagine an angle would come and when we be in bed she would touch I and erase my former life he tell I how proud he be of I when I be in California he tell I I be ripe for this that I be a woman he say that I be ready and he start whisper to I he say he never have such a hard on in his life and he say see what you do to I and he undress and stand in the middle of the room show I what I do to he then he undress I he be very professional I remember he spit into his hand in order to wet his it be disgusting I think that be the minute that I I want to run away but it be too late because he say that I be ready listen to I Laura it be really important that you understand that none of this be your fault you be 16 year of age you do not how could you have know be what be go to happen how could you know what to expect I want he to hold I Paul to take I away from the house to take I away from the death of that house I just want he to help I get away I never want he to fuck I oh Laura Fuck I ruin it no you do not want I anymore no no it be not true Laura please listen to I I really care about you I really care about what happen to you and I will not do anything in the world to hurt you I promise look I think the real damage that David do he destroy your ability to communicate with man from a non sexual place no it be not true yes I think it be true you make I sound like I be so terrible Paul there be nothing terrible about you to I Laura you know if you do not wanna fuck I do not fuck I I be a big girl I can take it go on say it to my face go on Laura listen to I I think you feel that if I do not sleep with you I be not go to be interested in you in who you be but I be not willing to betray you I be not go to disappoint you I will not be another David there be something go on between we Paul something more and you know it you be just too fucking afraid it be my brother hi Olie Great you know what tell they not to move he until I get there I will be right there okay okay Bye well his temperature 's normal good that be good news it will be okay I promise you it will be okay okay hi I get a choice either I accept your superiority as if you be some kind of god or I use my intelligence and do a little investigate yeah you would be real surprised the kind of information you find out from a few phone call I find a hell of a god a god whose wife be sleep around behind his back whose daughter be fuck junkie and then Laura come along and you fall in love with that crazy slut do not you fucking talk about my patient you fuck Gosh you never get the mail yet today 30 second after it arrive you be sprint down to the curb what on earth could you be expect a love letter maybe I see she Paul who who Laura I see she what do you mean you see she I be take out the trash and I see she leave I think you say she quit therapy she do quit then what the hell be she do here her father 's in the hospital and she call I and ask I if she could come in what should I have say Kate I be sorry about this crisis with your father but I 've tell my wife you 've quit therapy no you should have tell I that she come back it be not a social call if you want to find out what be go on all you have to do be ask I Kate do not you dare turn this around on I what you think you deserve she you 've earn she because of what I do to you for Christ 's sake well lucky you save by the bell yet again Subtitles Benj I be glad you come back I go against all my instinct Come on in so what be your instinct you want the truth the first be to come back here and beat the shit out of you and the second one the second one be an instinct that I learn in the in the Navy it be a survival tactic we teach to think like the enemy I be try to understand why you be all so afraid of I when you say all who would you be refer to you and the rest of the world listen I realize I threaten you and that be where your aggression come from so in what way do you threaten we you think you consider I a murderer the last couple of week I 've be try to figure out when people look in my eye look at my hand can they tell that I 've kill 42 people in the past 20 year that be 42 human being you can not hide something like that right there be something about I they 've get to see that and it scare they so do you think that there be something about you xomethe obvious that people see you probably want to strangle I the first time I walk through that door in the last session you finally get a chance to show your hatred for people like I I think maybe that be how you see yourself Alex maybe that be why you push I to such a violent place so that I would treat you the way that you think you should be treat let I remind you you attack I so what do you feel when I attack you what do I feel a slight tremor in the wing that be it so no big deal no big deal but alex I push you against the bookcase I throw coffee in your face I be just curious what happen in your body what be go through your head hold on I just realize something you have not apologize yet before anything else you be suppose to say I apologize I be sorry it will never happen again I 've be here five minute and I get nothing from you you be right you be absolutely right I apologize it should not have happen but I feel very offended by what you say offend no that be not part of the deal no I can say whatever the hell I want in here that be the point of go to a shrink you want I to censor every sentence or keep wonder if what I say might hurt you it be still like a relationship alex there be boundary I feel that you be out to hurt I and I be very hurt what offend you so much it be all true be not it well you invade my privacy you talk about the people I love and you speak about they with contempt and with what I feel be deliberate cruelty so I guess my therapy be over now right that be not what I say alex no but it be what you think you be tired of take the shit I give you all the time and actually I do not blame you if I be you I would have get rid of I a long time ago so be that why you say those thing in the hope that I would what run away kick you out it be not go to happen Alex you guy really do live in a bubble you live in this world you do not it be all theory you do not engage you what Finish that think what be you go to say no I just remember this dream I have I be on the ground and I be drive this little car on the iraqi international airport highway they call it the highway to hell and all of a sudden I be in Baghdad in this traffic jam above my head I see this enemy plane it be a Czech mig I be not sure what it be exactly but this mig be be follow by one of our jet an f 16 everyone be look up watch and I say to myself why be not he shoot why do not he blow he out of the sky now maybe he be afraid all the debris will fall on the people below but I know in the dream the order be to take that fucker down so they be fly real close like this and maneuver and our guy do not launch and the enemy plane be get away and it be drive I crazy I mean shit he be on his way to our base camp all the people on the ground below they be waitg for he to take the mig down and they be bloodthirsty and it do not happen they just fly away and that be it do you think you would have do well if you have be up there Shit any pilot worth his salt would have blow that asshole to kingdom come and who be the pilot maybe it be I I do not know you be the one who can not shoot why not I do not know maybe because the other guy the other pilot be not that dangerous I know that he be only what he be only what who be sit in the plane who be sit in the enemy plane that you refuse to shoot down I do not know who be there I do not know who be the enemy alex hey stop man Jeez when you want to pressure you pressure I do not know who be my enemy you be that how it feel no it be not you you be not there maybe it be my father what what you know the answer but you do not wanna you want I to come up with it no it be just a dream I be just help you to look at it that be all okay well then you must have some chart or something around here tell you what every part of a dream represent in reality no not really sometimes a number of image can represent the same thing so it be I that be what you be say right that I be the enemy pilot I be my own enemy look it be not clear actually that he be even an enemy it be not that he do not have identification mark on the plane I be just not familiar with it I do not know for sure but he be try to get away from you what do you think of this guy this pilot this flee pilot I think he be a fucking coward oh yeah what else he be not a man he be run away like a pussy instead of turn around stand his ground and fighting I be die to come up to that pitiful fucker and shove an air to air missile up his rear burner what be you think just say it you think I be a faggot that would go right along with all my father 's theory only girl and fag see a shrink so what if I be a fag you say it very clearly before do I well maybe you do not say it but you 've be lead I there I have you be die to say it be a homosexual dream I be tail he I see fire come out of his back burner I be wanna shove my it all fit do not it even daniel never suspect it that could explain a lot of thing what thing Laura for instance that lousy fuck we have the first time and Michaela the fact that I be suddenly not attract to she anymore we see each other this week at a restaurant and she want I to come back home and think it would be well if we talk to each other in person she be drive hard man just on a mission just on the attack she want we to start off by get a room asap there be that hotel above the restaurant I say I could not I could not I tell she I have somewhere to be that we would do it another time you know I really do have something else to do that night I be suppose to go with daniel and his his partner Sean to a party you understand this amazing woman want to fuck the shit out of I in a 5 star hotel and instead I be go to Georgetown with these two fag do you understand that and why do you think you would rather spend time with they Everything be a joke with they I do not know if you be familiar with their world but their humor be in see everything from the outside like they be not a part of it like like they be above it and by they you mean homosexual yeah especially Sean 's crowd I mean he be genuinely queer he be not the kind that be in conflict with himself I mean he be this Sean be immune to tension he be happy he be happy all the time he just have no subconscious everything be right out in the open be that something that be that something that you envy they do not pressure I they give you shit to provoke you and they love that shit but you know Sean ask I why do you always desperately try to please everybody all the time God and country everybody but it be bullshit with they they do not care they really do not care they do not demand of I to be anything extra that night we get home about 4 00 a m and daniel go to the bedroom Sean and I stay out in the livin room he get a dvd some gay porn thing look I do not know if he be try to provoke I or what he even suggest afterwards that I would be ready for bed he say it jokingly but he be not play he tell I once I do not know the meaning of life until I got fuck in the ass I once read that psychologically water symbolize emotion I wonder what your collection of boat say about you I do not know maybe that I be an emotional wreck maybe you want to go out to sea but you do not you mean that I want to express my feeling but I can not my father 's a lifetime democrat a war protester and I know that if I join the navy it would piss he off so fuck it I go r o t C in high school and then I get my wing he could not tell I shit I remember the first time you be here you say that that you do not choose to be a pilot that life choose it for you yeah but I do not know about that I think maybe you do choose that path and that you do it to defy your father he want I to be hard there be nothing hard than a topgun grad yeah but that be still a reaction to he it be not your desire I do not think you be in touch with what you really want what I really want what be you say what I really want be to be something else Gay have you ever be attract to man alex ever have a sexual fantasy about a man I have never no so when you say the word gay what do you mean by that I do not know do not take I there man this say what you think all the time that be gay those guy they have no filter what else talk about your feeling all the time so what you do here for example the way you interact with I your father say he say that anybody who go to a shrink be a be a fag how do you get on with your dad when you be a kid I remember as a kid my father take I to a church this be the riverside church up in Harlem and back in those day I live kind of a double life during the week I go to this all boy private school it be elite the fine teacher it be the good right right it be also a totally sheltered environment so on the weekend my dad would take I to all these real rough ghetto area to place where he volunteer his time and money he want to make sure that I know how lucky I be to live my little soft cushy life I dread those fucking weekend hate they it be like he be always try to test I anyway the riverside church have this athletic program that my dad support he need to talk to the guy that run the place so they tell I you wait outside shoot some basket so it be early and the court be desert and it be a bad area but long story short this kid come up he be about I do not know he be 14 and he beat the hell out of I he kick I in the head a few time he have this box cutter I think he be go to slice my face but he wind up take some little bullshit chain I have and my sneaker he take my sneaker take my sock and even take this little half full pack of chew gum and I go upstairs and my dad see I and he see I just get my ass kick that I get no sneaker no sock and I start to tell he what happen and I start cry so my dad slap the shit out of I sound like a whip crack and he make I walk around barefoot for the whole rest of the day just to teach I a lesson what age be you 11 the next weekend he take I to a gym to meet up with this guy name tom and tom say that there be two type of martial art one be the kind that be a physical and spiritual discipline a way of life the second type be where you learn to fight and this here be a fight gym you get a problem with that I do not have a problem with it 'cause I do not want anybody to ever put their hand on I like that ever again so I come four day a week after school and I learn and I learn fast and the next time some kid pick on I I beat his face to a pulp you could not even recognize he 'cause see fear be like fire if you master it then it can heat your house cook your food but if it get the good of you it can burn you it can destroy you you control your fear you control your fear you control your life excuse I be you allright yeah I do not think I can do this do what this therapy I it that be just it be too much for I I think I need a break of a few week or month just do not think it be lead anywhere that be all it be not lead anywhere where do you want it to lead Alex Someplace where I feel less shitty about myself so at least where I could find some balance in my life some place sane I miss fly somehow everything be just much simple up there I can focus on something the only thing you have to think about be the mission it be quiet be it possible to get that feeling on the ground do you think I do not know you know I get a call from my wing commander he be he be to know how I be do he be he be try to figure out if I be ready for active duty you know he say it be all sort of test Alex it be a long process do you think you be ready for that Alex what do you think I do not think you be ready maybe I can discuss it with Michaela I do not think Sean and Daniel would be much help 'cause they Gays do not really understand military or vice versa Alex these feeling and memory that you have about your father I think this be really something we should we should come back to I might actually have to go in over the next few week some day for some meeting and so I keep you post if I can not come newt week sure thank previously on in Treatment I feel sorry for the book up there I be go back to training next week for the Olympics and if you try to stop I you will never see I again right you will go to your father 's only he be in Miami photograph supermodel no one can get a hold

the calorie I 've lose some weight when you go back into training with weight and stuff as you build up muscle you be suppose to gain weight because muscle weigh more than fat I do not know when I be not here do you just bury your head under a rock or something so these pound that I 've put on they could be muscle really do you go to the gym occasionally you have to do it consistently if you wanna see result every day Weights and cardio no pain no gain guy you be right you can not see muscle if it be bury under fat so you have to reduce your sugar and carb intake okay coach sorry no I appreciate the tip thank anyway if you build muscle you will gain weight unless of course you be a physiological freak like I since I 've start lift weight I 've lose two pound which be like anatomically impossible now Cy will not let I lift until I gain it back it be bullshit really he be like you have to make sure that you eat protein after every session and you have to make sure that

about this be it something you wanna keep a secret from he it be not a fucking secret how can it be a secret if that be all you and my mom and everyone else can talk about what be you think about nothing I 've a test tomorrow I have to study for and I miss my dentist appointment today so I have to reschedule that I think you be run away what in your mind you be plan your schedule we get close to something that feel dangerous to you and what do you do you retreat I be not retreat I be stress about the exam I think I have a cavity and I have a stomachache from that fucking pizza what a mistake that be I have a theory about that pizza Surprise surprise would you like to hear it do I have a choice yeah you always have a choice what be your theory I think that you be enjoy that pizza until I say something that remind you of something your father 's girlfriend use to say to you I use the word gusto be you say I be fuck up about food because of something my father 's girlfriend say be you fuck up about food be not everybody what do food mean to you what do you mean be it nutrition be it enjoyment what it be the enemy it be just what happen to gymnast why do not you tell I your father be in Miami why be it a secret it be not a fucking secret I just do not think I need to bother he with every boring detail of my life your attempt suicide be a boring detail it be not a suicide attempt I be just test remember somebody around here have that theory I think yeah that ring a bell he would put it together and decide that it be all your fault he already think you be a quack remember it be well for you if he do not know he will never let I come back here well for you or for I which of we would have to stay away from therapy do you think if he know he would be devastate he be the most important person to I in this whole world I do not ever wanna hurt he why can not you just let it go forget it this be such a waste of time you try to kill yourself and you do not want to tell the most important person in your world he have a life somebody have to we can not all go around like walking corpse it be not his fault that I take those pill I be not say it be his fault I be just try to figure out why you be so ready to leave the planet and not tell he what be up your ass be you angry at he for something I be not angry at he be you hide something from I get off my back be we do we have a little time leave what you 've never want to end a session early before in our first session you mention those book up there I think it be because you identify with they you say they be cold and lonely on the top shelf and then I look at they more closely and I realize that one of they have some of your father 's photograph in it you say that your dad love the way that you look and that if you be not a gymnast that you could be a model I guess model be the people that he that he choose to surround himself with the people he like they be the people he fuck I would not say he like they I know that in our culture thin model be sexualize but I 've always find that really strange because in classical art and literature eating be often use as a metaphor for sex they both conjure up desire hunger craving inside we where be you go Sophie Sophie try to stay here please try not to disappear eat shit Paul why be you do this I think you be try to help why do the book provoke such a strong reaction in you what you be do be sick it be fucking sick it be pervert I will never forgive you for this why because I be make you uncomfortable I be ask you to think about thing that you do not want to talk about if I want to talk about my father 's book I would have tell you it be right there what about all that crap about a patient decide what we talk about that you take thing at my speed that I control the wheel and all that you be so full of shit but you have be drive what we talk about here you may not realize it but you have the very first thing that you want to talk about be those book up there what be you say that you jerk off to my father 's photograph that you open up that book and jerk off all over those slut you keep suggest somebody be abuse I you be abuse I that be what you people love most of all be not it a good mindfuck to take the one good thing in somebody 's life and somehow fuck it up just like my father say shut the fuck up about he how could you how could you you be just like everybody else like who Sophie please do not go why do you do that you mean why do I take the book down because I have to I have to put the book on the table and there be really no graceful way of do it I think this book be connect to your wound and open a wound Sophie be frightening it be painful and it be ugly you imply that I have be sexually abuse be that what you hear I never say anything like that this book with the with the naked model you want I to see that you know what I think I think you be angry I think you 've get great anger towards your father you say early on that you wish that you could slip through the crack when you want to but you do not do that when you be in trouble not really your mind try to but your body your body stay here you let other do thing to you because you 've convince yourself that that you be not really there that it be not happen to you that it be not hurt you I be sure this week you will exercise like a fiend and not because you be an olympic hopeful but because I know that after this session you be go to want to regain control but I want you to remember something Sophie when you go up onto that beam that be the place where you detach that be where you go to feel safe all I want you to know be you do not have to go there there be other place where you can feel safe in here in this room it be one of those place previously on in Treatment he threaten to kill I you be smile I 've have patient over the year whose life be threaten you bring this up like it be nothing do you

that you like more be my enjoyment of our session important to you maybe and so it would bother you if I do not enjoy they maybe not forget it you say that Jake and you be not easy as patient how would you define yourself as a patient Bad just kid I would not trade place with anyone it just I do not know have you ever think about change place with anybody perhaps who would you like to trade with what kind of a patient would you like to be maybe I want you to be different I different how I do not know Harrison Ford that be a bit of a stretch for I but so how would Dr Harrison Ford behave if you be early for a session who say I would be see he for therapy he certainly would not make I wait outside like a naughty schoolgirl so you feel that be like some kind of rejection ok so why do not you tell I what be be happen since I see you last week everything be fine like I tell you you say that you and Jake be seemingly in love what do that mean seemingly in love I say that do not I typical everything be fine why be that typical today he be meet a guy that might commission some music from he you make it sound like you do not think that be go to happen and he say to I that I

even when we want to kill each other we have that maybe because we want to kill each other this touchy feely sex be not the deal you know the kind of sex we use to have I could not even tell my girlfriend they would not have believe I or else they would call social service and have Jake arrest now it be like he be have a lobotomy or like he be brain dead only he be not brain dead he be just a terrible fuck it be your fault it be my fault the man in touch with himself God might be well if he knock I around a bit you really think that would be well I do not know maybe I deserve it how do you like my necklace by the way I think it be it be very nice it be a gift from Jake a Bulgari from Jake it be from Ben do you remember Ben my boss I tell Jake that I would be go back to the office tonight because I have a conference call with some client in Bali I also tell he that Ben be travel but the truth be Ben be pick I up from here and we be not go back to the office where be you go wherever the evening take we what do you think of that what dinner with your boss it will not be dinner it might include dinner but there be no stop the rest of it why can not it be stop do you want I to stop it it will not do any good I know it will happen Ben and I be inevitable the minute that the thought enter my head it be as if somebody have trigger a tick time bomb nothing will stop it no matter how many bomb expert I bring in you can not stop it no one can so who trigger the time bomb the lousy sex I be in the shower by the way it be the first time I 've be in a hurry to get in the shower after fucking Jake and it dawn on I that no matter what I do Something'll happen with he so be you punish Jake for the bad sex or because of this new this new tenderness this new Attentiveness that he be show why be I do this why can not I stop you have not do anything yet but he will be here in a minute do you like this guy he be a prick but it be it be like I need you need what the Employee of the Month award the Office Slut award I would like to go back to something that we touch on last week you you say that you be that you be overweight when you be a child that really capture your imagination do not it I think it be something that we should talk about I know you say it do not bother you but you do say something about child be cruel well I be fat not overweight fat my sister be the overweight one I be kid my sister 's gorgeous it be really hard for I to believe that you actually ever be this overweight kid it be like you 've erase that girl right after my father die I decide to stop eat it be like I wake up 45 pound thin how do you wake up 45 pound thin I just do not eat and I feel like it be the one thing that I could control in that house some day I would just have one cracker all day long and I would feel my stomach get flat and I would have this wonderful sense of light headedness this wonderful high what do not matter no go on finish the thought my father be a lovely man Sweet charm I love he very much and your mother my mother 's dead you know the joke about the farmer with the two cow the one cow give milk and the other one do not never mind anyway my dad die when I be 13 my mother 's rather like Cinderella 's stepmother and my sister be like the evil stepsister once when I be 13 my parent come back from Milan with two identical dress very very beautiful one a red one for Maria my sister and a blue one for I Mine of course do not fit I so my mother tell she to switch with I because she be old and hers be slightly big she of course do not want to so she start scream and say she want the red dress it be not her fault that I be so fat and finally she throw the dress at I and say then take it fatso so I start cry and my mother say what be you cry for now you should be glad your sister 's dress fit you and that she agree to trade dress you should thank she later I hear my parent argue and my dad say to my mom why do not you just get they the same color dress and my mother start whisper she say I can not buy her red she I could not hear she properly then she seem like she say she look like a watermelon in it or she would look like a fire truck in it or she would look like a beach ball or I could not hear what she say so do you ever talk to your dad about what you might have hear no I never get a chance so could you have talk to your mom about it why not she would say that I be make thing up that be what she say to most of my complaint she use to call I the fabricator I have a very vivid imagination I use to make thing up once I tell she that I see my sister kiss the gardener behind the house she go ballistic she nearly have a coronary you know once Maria have a blind date and before he get there she say let us play a trick on he and she tell I to open the door and pretend that I be she and she would watch from the room next door and if she do not like he she would not come out and I could pretend that I be sick and cancel the date so when I open the door he be really cute and I think she would be interested in he so I keep talk to he and pretend to be she and chat away she finally come out from the other room and say hi I be Maria and he be completely confused and I be utterly humiliate I go so red actually I still get embarrassed when I think about it today and and she tell he I be just check out her date for she and that at it be all just a joke the thing be I do not get the joke I mean not till year later I do not realize till then that all she really want be to see the look of relief on his face when he realize that she be his date not I the fatso Hilarious right do not worry I get back at her year later I meet he at college and I fuck his brain out I tell she that he do not remember she and I would have to remind he and she say whatever I dump he after two date anyway and I say he tell I he dump you because you smell like tuna and be that true so really you settle that account in bed I do indeed and now you be settle another account in bed with Jake this time what because he be become too sensitive for you so let I make sure I have this right your father die when you be 13 you must have be pretty devastate I be he be a lovely man he be affectionate and great physically affectionate he would come into our room at night when we be sleep and kiss we on the eye and then I would half wake up I would smell his aftershave and know that he be there and then he would whisper in my ear that he love I and he would hold my face in his hand he have these huge hand like a construction worker and he be just so Tender and lovely and yet when Jake be tender and he express his love through tenderness it make you angry you say it be disgusting do you think that might be because it scare you you 've learn you can not trust people who express themselves tenderly that they seem weak that they be go to abandon you die and leave you behind and so in order to avoid that you provoke Jake you make he angry you create these situation that bring out the bad in he and he treat you badly Ben'll be here any minute what should I do do you really want I to give you permission to have sex with your boss once just once just tell I it be not that bad I think it might be that bad but you will explain he if he find out can you make sense of it for he and what exactly do you want I to tell he that I be fuck up that I can not help myself that it be big than I tell he that I be fuck up so even if he forgive you do you think that you can forgive yourself I always forgive myself that be my problem I I just close my eye before I go to sleep at night and I ask God for forgiveness and I forgive myself for everything even the unforgivable thing I never get punish you think that sex with Reeves will go unpunished who be go to punish I maybe you 've already start to punish yourself do you really think that sleep with Reeves be go to bring back the good old reliable angry control Jake the one who fight you and threaten you I do not know and now that he be express his love through tenderness do you feel that you deserve his love it be not love it be neediness it be weakness it be unbearable so it be only love if he chase you stalk you tape you be jealous of you be that it I think you need to look at this a little more carefully Amy it be like it be happen already but it have not you still have a choice nothing happen without you I have to go to the bathroom hi it be Jake leave a message Hey Jake it be I it be nothing important I just think I might catch you I just want to hear your voice how be you okay I make we some tea give I your cell Leave leave the ringer on that be kind of the point we 've be wait for Rosie to check in all day she sleep over at a friend 's house and she have not check in yet at least that be what she say but Lord know it be not the first time in history that a teenager say she be go to stay at a friend 's and then she end up somewhere else so where be she do you think I be withhold information be you Season 1 Episode 30 subtitle Anyone Coffee Tagne anyway Sarah 's parent be away and and Rosie 's not answer her phone so it be a little convenient do not this happen a few week ago but this time she be be go for 24 hour I mean she be at that age be not she that make it okay no I do not say that Kate do not trust she when she say she be stay with a friend that be the cause for concern I be pretty concerned hence the two phone lay out when do you last talk to her yesterday when I be at work I do not know if Paul tell you but I run a shelter for batter woman and it be also a center for youth at risk and Rosie volunteer there about 4 time a week she tell I she would be there and then go to Sarah 's but she do say it in her responsible voice which should 've tip I off anyway Sarah 's parent be in Mexico and I do not know maybe the girl drive off somewhere after school Sarah 's get a car and Rosie be probably afraid to tell we because you might flip out and I would flip out who know I do not know what kind of work do Rosie do at the center Whatever be need basically from write up schedule to run errand she sit in on interview sometimes just so she can get a sense of how we evaluate people how much trouble they may be in and how much help they may need four time a week it be a commitment for a 16 year old kid 17 year old next month it be interesting because when Rosie 's volunteering all of a sudden she be an adult she be a bear social worker always have be ever since she be a kid how do she show that when she be young she be always the mediator with her friend on the playground you know organize make it peace that kind of thing even her teacher remark on it and you hear this where I do not I do not really recall you at too many parent teacher conference I be on the PTA board at Arlington remember Paul I mean come on you go twice do you ever see Rosie take on this mediator role at home what she mean be be Rosie our social worker see Gina can not conceive of a child be bear with an intrinsic desire to help other people without it be a cope mechanism for for something else Right Rosie 's always be interested in be of service and that be something we encourage do we I encourage it I think it be great I think it be incredible that she volunteer I talk to she about everything she see down at the center and it be certainly not her responsibility to deal with any of the hardcore case or anything like that I make sure that she be not in over her head I tell she who be who and what be go on and I do I agree with you I think four time a week be a little too much you know there might be a little more to it for Rosie than a desire to help what Gina be say be that Rosie might be work around at risk youth because she be distress herself Paul do you really think Kate and I need an interpreter sorry when do she start volunteer it be what about six month ago and I be thrill at first because it mean she be spend less time at the mall with her friend but I be think she may need more of that what more time at the mall no you know what I mean just do stupid teenager stuff why should she be so concerned with the world 's problem at her age I do not think that be what Gina 's say she be say that Rosie be draw to the place because she be try to say something to we but that we be oblivious can I speak for myself it be not what you be try to get at it be not for you to say that sorry you know even if Rosie have a desire or a vocation to help other people I be wonder how much of that do you think a 17 year old kid need 16 she be still 16 16 so yes Paul she may be try to shine a light on something okay that be it I be go to try she again since apparently her volunteering be a cry for help thank god it be ring I be go to kill you where the hell have you no because we have let I talk to she since when do that happen let I talk to her please when you sleep away you be suppose to call first thing in the morning that be the agreement and you know it no we will discuss this at home no because we be out we be talk to someone an an accountant no you do not know he her no he be sit right here and he be look none too pleased about any of this we will talk at home Rosie all right so I be not allow to speak to her she claim she get to Sarah 's late last night they be late for school this morning and get this she do not realize her phone be off which be a little like I not realize my head 's on fire but she be not stay there again okay well you tell she that if I be Gina I would ask why now why now what well if a couple come to I with this problem I would say why be she choose to act out now that be what you would ask really maybe you should call that couple ask they and then get back to I she be do this on purpose it be obvious she sense a conflict between we and she be turn it around so that she be give we a taste of what it be like to worry about her she be a teenager there be not some master plan involve here this be just how teenage girl be right I mean it be just how they think or do not think in this case no Kate it be not conscious but it be work Rosie vanishe and you become function parent you be united in your concern for her do you think that Rosie sense the conflict between you I think we 've be pretty good about pretend we 've actually get pretty skilled at that so why now as Paul ask why now do something happen what do you think she be react to I would say it be more tense actually more tense Kate run into Laura I do not run into her I see she as she be leave the house the house my office his office the house my home whatever it be a little blurred be not it do not you say she stop therapy he do say that do not he her father be hospitalize and she ask I if she could come by she be pretty upset please please do not do that what describe she like she be this fragile little thing like she be some poor lose soul she be not I see she how do she seem to you she be Tammy Kent what who be Tammy Kent how be she Tammy Kent you know exactly what I be talk about may I ask who this be this be a girl that Paul be in love with when we first meet a long time ago whatever they be exactly the same type no they be not yes they be and he make Laura out to be this fragile little girl and I be tell you what I see be this highly sexual woman wear stiletto at ten in the morning I do not describe she like that if you form an image no but you let I think she be one of your fatherless walking wound no you rush to that conclusion yourself and what he also forget to mention be that she be stunningly beautiful and very young but that be no surprise be it Jesus Christ it be the goddamn history of the world leave your middle aged wife and God be not it a little embarrassing for you that you 've turn out to be like every third man I mean you 've spend your entire life study the human condition and now you be just follow your dick around like a caveman this woman Laura she be get this this spoil aloof and calculate look and she have this uh this air of self confidence that be quite obviously bullshit because if anything real ever happen to her she would not know what to do she be so fake and all this you see while you be take out the trash yes that be right just by look at she like it or not everything be communicate another one of your line and you just happen to be there as she be do not keep do that you be make I out to look like I be some loose cannon demente wife if she be all that spoil and a fake why be you so threaten by she because my husband be in love with she and because she be the kind of woman who always get her man a woman like that have always be his fantasy gorgeous self center unattainable that be what I want it be it be good to know that you do not see yourself that way so you be not Paul 's fantasy no I be not yet he marry you I guess he get a raw deal do not he he want the trophy wife and he got stick with a homemaker I be just a good mom pretty boring come on Kate listen to yourself you be completely invalidate your your sexuality for a start I think we both know that you could 've do well if you would want to I fall in love with you not just because you be beautiful and sexy but because because of your strength her strength she be she be ground and honest and dependable I need that I think we both need that not anymore I do not need you anymore I need you I 've always love you want you and need you but not like Laura you never ever want I like that how can you say that you keep jump to these conclusion that make no Kate you say you do not need Paul anymore can you talk about that a little I do not need he like I use to not like I think I need he I do not know maybe I do not even need a partner at all I mean would I like one yeah of course but it would be awfully nice if that person be a bit more present and available but do I need it if that be the question no I think I 've learn to live without it what kind of partner could you see yourself with I do not know I mean you know my frame of reference for two and a half decade have be Paul so our friend their husband what the hell do I know about what they be really like what go on behind closed door I mean do we know any couple really it be not like I sit around daydream about it or I have some fantastic flight of fancy about some perfect man or I could be with a serial killer as long as he tell I about his damn day and it be not just about be want I know that be what I say last week and want be good I mean of course everybody want that but I just want to be a part of something it do not have to be big and it do not have to be grand but I will tell you something about woman like Laura it they be just all about sex you know that be their currency that be not the actual sex itself that be not what I be say it be sex as this thing that control that determine the distance between she and someone else and I can not compete with that Laura be not a sexual object for Paul their relationship be not base on that it be more chaste she be not his sexual fantasy it be not about lust the real threat be that he may actually have fall in love with her you know you say you be draw to he you marry he because you admire he because he pay such deep attention to you you be grateful that you feel you be interesting that dynamic of patient therapist be satisfy to both of you at that point but I think Jesus please let I do my job here your job of what rush to conclusion eventually Kate you feel that it be not satisfy for you you 've outgrow that dependency you 've outgrow that part of your marriage you say you do not need Paul anymore you do not need to be take care of and Paul may have sense this you be drift away from under his wing and suddenly he find himself confuse about his feeling for a patient Laura be dependent on Paul he be her therapist her eld her guide Dependency define that relationship I see so she be not my groupie anymore so I find somebody to to replace she be that your theory nice one Gina see your problem be you think it be impossible to fall in love with a patient without some kind of pathology surround the whole thing you be try to redefine yourself in your marriage to see yourself not as a dependant but as an equal do you think you can do that and stay with Paul Gina for fuck 's sake if I be this narcissistic monster that you be talk about who have to be admire and worship and need how do that fit with I sit here try to address the problem that we 've bring to you I be not say you be a monster in fact if you will listen I be not even say it be all you Paul may not see you as an equal but perhaps you 've contribute to that maybe it be how you want to be see it be what be comfortable for you yeah 25 year I always feel he could walk out at any minute be that part of the attraction would you stop it would you stop put these poisonous fucking word into her mouth you 've ignore I in this conversation you see what she be do instruct you on what you should be feel it be fucking reckless why be you speed this up Gina do you want to meddle be that it to see how fast you can do this push Kate to a place that usually take month if not year that be not what I be do what take month what she be say be that you have a predisposition to be reject to not be my equal that you be react to your childhood that be rush the process Gina here be the way I think it work you be suppose to focus on the couple first then talk to they about their parent and their childhood do it the other way they blame each other I know it your mother fuck you up and you take it out on I do see you see how destructive that be maybe you do not want to talk about childhood because we would end up talk about your childhood so we be back to where we start you see I after 10 year and right away you decide I be my father and like he I be in love with my patient and I be push Kate to have an affair so that I can have an excuse to leave the house and now of course Kate an hour and a half with she and everything fit perfectly game set and match to you Gina you know what I can not really do this anymore I be sorry I know this be my idea but I know deep down that if I come here it would turn into this history between you two and I be

center of the board then he move and I counter and he move again I counter again and we be move along at this real nice clip and I think I be hold my own and then I will never forget it he look up suddenly and it be like a shadow fall over his face and he stand up from the table and he say I be not feel well I do not want to play he go up to his bedroom I follow he up the stair I knock on the door he do not answer I crack the door open and I see he he be sit at his desk he be get his back to I I do not know if he hear I I be about to say something but I do not I just stand there and I

the live hell out of they that be why but nobody do could it be Alex that you be there for exactly the opposite reason 'cause no one would question you or ask you to be anything other than yourself you see these issue with your father with your own identity with what you really want for yourself these thing they have to be look at do not you think it would be well to deal with they here on the ground than have they follow you 20 000 foot into the air Wait be you actually express an opinion here be you tell I not to fly I can not answer that it make I feel like you be ask I to share

dad do not he stay upstairs so you take the cab to airport by yourself well yeah I be thirteen Paul so you want to tell I more about that dream that you have not really it do not matter it be just a stupid dream but I feel he be in danger that be the important part I can feel he we be link radar love it be a terrible dream or like a nightmare do you get those sometimes what happen in yours there be one I 've I 've have consistently since I be a kid I be sit in this rock chair and I be rock back and forward Everytime I go to get off I can not the chair keep rock back and forward and my my mother be call I from upstairs I be try to get out of the chair but I I just can not let go what do you think it mean I think it mean that maybe that I scare to disappoint my mother that I be not go to be there for her do you disappoint she in real life no I I do not think so anyway back to your dream okay so I be wait for my father in a hotel room when a man knock on the door I let he in he ask I where my father be I tell he he be on his way but just as I say it I be so stupid I realize that this guy be a serial killer so he sit down to wait with I and I know that the moment my father walk into that room this guy be go to kill he and I do not know how to stop it it be awful what do the man look like I do not remember have you be in this hotel room before no what be it like can you describe it it be dark Dark wood dark furniture sort of like a cave or a tunnel yeah like a tunnel but it be not scary you could see light at both end like where the tunnel start and where it end I remember look back and forth try to figure out which way be the entrance and which be the exit anything else you remember the man be wear shoe like yours not those shoe the black one that you usually wear like my other one not like your other shoe they be your shoe so this serial killer be wear my shoe it be you in the hotel room you be wait to kill my father do I tell you why I be go to kill he do your father ever show up no we just sit there we make small talk and the whole time I be try to figure out how to get out of there to call somebody or something do you remember what this small talk be about I do not I be not sure something about it make perfect sense do not it you be always insinuate shit about he that he be the mystery man that there be some big secret that he be the person who really fuck I up but the joke be on you because there be nothing there my father do not cross the line or break any rule or any of that crap you love to throw around you be so wrong it be ridiculous my father have always be there for I his work and I be the only important thing in his life how do you feel about his photograph they be beautiful if you look at they with an open mind which of course you can not he love the human form he believe the body can be the perfect expression of every human emotion and experience be that how he speak about his work what be you say Paul that I can not form an opinion of my own father 's work you think I be quote he you know he say a lot of shrink be fail artist or writer maybe you be jealous of he he travel around the world he work with model meanwhile you be trap in your cell with fuck up like I oh I would take a fuck up like you any day over one of those supermodel no you would not shut up yes I would it be true so how be that for you your father be constantly surround by beautiful woman when you be a kid he be an artist it be his job besides nudity be totally normal in my house I got use to it Nudity Nude model the female form it be like draw class 101 Paul an artist must work from the pure inspiration his studio be at home so there be a lot of model walk around naked it be not a big deal we be cool so this be normal for you to be expose to adult be naked yeah expose Ooh nudity how scary breast Terrifying so be you ever naked around the house of course not look at your face you think that be my big secret I see my father naked and now I be scarred for life be not that kind of a cliche so your father be naked and your mother as well why be you laugh my mother always wear her clothe even in the shower but she be perfectly comfortable with the model she be clueless about the whole thing sorry I be have a difficult time follow this I think you say that people be naked all the time okay not all the time a lot of the time during the day while my mother be at work so would you say that your father be hide it from her I would say she be a fucking idiot who could not see what be right in front of her they be have sex who be have sex Sophie my dad with the model du jour how do you know I see they I come home from school early one day the mom who drive carpool that day have to pick we up early I walk into my parent ' bedroom and my father be there with a model do your father know that you see oh yeah he get up he come over to I and just look at I I say something like I think the model only come at fix time and what do he say I do not remember something like you be suppose to be at school and then he shut the door and lock it I remember the sound of the latch slide how old be you I do not know Seven and a half why be you be so dramatic it be no big deal my father be an artist they do not live like other people do they have to be in touch with they have to crap on conventional thing in order to create do you say it to your mother no do your father tell you not to no but you walk away from the door know you be not suppose to say anything that you have a secret maybe that be when the idea of telepathy between you and your dad begin this idea that you can understand each other without word that be your big theory after all your insinuation pretty lame you keep accuse I you keep suggest that somebody cross the line with I that I do not have the ability to say no you be say that what that I 've be sexually abuse you think that be the secret I be look for well be not you no I be not no right do you think something happen to you be you listen to I I tell you nothing happen you be the one who keep imply I do not think you be sexually abuse Sophie Good now we can finally stop talk about that why do not you ever tell your mother what you see do not be an idiot so this secret have be there between you and she all these year so what I barely speak to the woman anyway you do not think there be any connection between those two thing I do not speak to she because she be pathetic she be a moron she could not see what be right in front of her face sometimes I think she be still wait for he like Santa Claus or something she would never admit it but it be so obvious it be pathetic but if you tell she she might not be wait for he any long it be not my job to make her face reality I be the child she be suppose to be smart than I you know she sit there day after day wait for he to come to his sense I want to scream at she he do not give a fuck about you you be stupid you be useless just get the fuck up of your clueless ass and get a life why do not you tell she about his affair it be not my fucking job maybe you do not tell she because you be afraid maybe you be afraid they would separate and it would be your fault just like you think that you have ruin Cy and Darlene 's marriage why do not you tell your mother after they divorce what be I suppose to do rub her face in it you be angry she could not see that yes fuck yes in all the week that we 've be in therapy you 've never once allow yourself to be angry at your father it be never even be a possibility for you why do you think that be See I think that your father make you his accomplice he burden you with this secret way too heavy for any child to carry and he drive this wedge between you and your mother with this secret maybe you be afraid to get angry at he because if you do you would lose he for good maybe you never tell your mother because part of you still hope that they be go to get back together again I know that be never go to happen I be not an idiot would not have to be to believe that I know plenty of grownup whose parent have separate 20 30 year who have even die they still hope in their heart of heart that their mother and father still share a bed in heaven he would not be a good husband if he come back he would just leave she again and you what he leave you too do not he no he just move out he be still my dad of course he be still your dad but he do literally leave you do not he he move away he be not around he do not even know whether you be dead or alive he be work why can not you let yourself be angry at he why should I be angry at he she be the one who who piss I off why because she be pathetic and annoying and and she be always around I can understand why you might be angry at she too

animal that be true what do you think it be that you want Amy I do not know I wanna go home I should not have come here today it be a mistake why do you think that Amy it be a mistake my stomach ache how convenient Amy get these perfectly time stomachache they be like her secret weapon would you like some tea what do it feel like do it it feel like she be have a conversation she would rather not have I be ask Amy it feel like my stomach be cramp the classic stomach cramp you see it be just vague enough to be completely untreatable be it something that you 've have before I have the first one when my father die but a thousand time bad than this you know I remember I could not stand up I be lie curl up on the pavement with tear stream out of my eye and I could not move where be this outside an ice cream store that be where he die he take I for an ice cream my mother be in a horrible mood and I go to my dad 's office and say I wanna run away and he say that be okay I wanna run away too but let us stop first and get an ice cream and I know what he be do but I do not care I just want to get out of the house and spend time with my dad we sit down on the curb outside the store eat our ice cream cone and we be race to see who could finish first and I win so I ask he for money to buy another cone and I go back inside and a car swing into the parking lot and plow right into he one minute he be sit there and the next he be dead do you see it happen yes it happen and then all of a sudden there be this wave of pain through my stomach it fold I over I have to lie down on the pavement I could not even stand up and there be people stare at I someone come over and try to touch I to help I and I just start scream the pain be so great and the paramedic arrive with two stretcher they put my father on one and I on the other and they take I to the hospital and my father to the morgue I do not think my mother ever forgave I forgave you for what it be okay it be not your fault Shut up you do not know what you be talk about what no you be just a kid stop it you do not know you do not know anything you do not know I at all I 've do terrible thing it be an accident really terrible thing I have sex with Ben I do not even enjoy it feel like a whore he pick I up from here last week and we go out drink and then we go back to the office and fuck on the floor everyone have go he keep say disgusting thing degrade thing and while I be do it I be ask myself why be I do this but I could not stop when we finish he say lock up I be tired and he walk out I sit alone for two hour drinking coffee thinking about what I should do and I plan to come home and tell you and quit my job the next day but in the cab on the way home I realize I could not tell you you be laugh apparently so how can you be laugh I do not know what be he do maybe he be relieve yeah I think that be it that be exactly it I be relieve this be it be always be my bad nightmare what I be scared of the most and now it be happen and I feel like I feel like this huge weight have be lift off my shoulder it be go I feel bad for you and sad I think it be sad it be really sad that a woman whose husband break down before her tell she he can not live without she go out and fuck someone else and hurt herself so bad I think that be sad do you think it be relate your telling Amy that you love she and her cheat on you it seem pretty obvious to I but what be surprising I Paul be and maybe I be just in shock be that I do not feel jealous I do not feel jealous or angry my God I think I be really be outstanding here guy I mean be anyone else as impressed with I as I be I 've imagine this over and over again and I can tell you that I 've never I can tell you that I 've never behave like such a gentleman I just I feel sad for she for we he be right about the connection between what happen with Ben and what happen here from the moment Jake break down I 've be feel like I be go to lose control I feel awful say something how many time do this happen just once it will not happen again why do I do this maybe you 've always want to make Jake angry because because you do not trust his tenderness and because there be something deep inside you that want to be punish but Jake have be work hard lately to be more patient to be more supportive and he be no long give you what you need in that way and now that Jake have stop punish you you 've start to punish yourself by have sex with somebody that as you say yourself you find repulsive you say that after your father die your mother never forgave you maybe you 've never forgive yourself Amy for leave your father on the curb while you go to get an ice cream maybe you feel that if you degrade yourself enough maybe someday somebody will forgive you for for everything what do you see in I how could you possibly be with I I love you Loved that be it I deserve it you can hit I if you like no you can you can hit I I do not want to hit you Ame we have to pick up Lenny there be still time I really wanna see he no do not go do not go it be too early and the class do not finish until 7 00 just do not go please let us just sit here let us just sit here with Paul Let us just be quiet for a minute will he forgive I why do not you ask he previously on in treatment Kate run into Laura what I see be this highly sexual woman who be wear stiletto at 10 00 in the morning be not it a little embarrassing for you follow your dick around like a caveman Kate I fall in love with you not just because you be beautiful and sexy but because of your strength I need that I think we both need that not anymore I do not need you anymore you know you say you marry he because he pay such deep attention to you you 've outgrow that dependency so she be not my groupie anymore so I find somebody to replace she be that your theory you see what she be do she be instruct you on what you should be feel game set and match to you Gina hello oh hi so um so what do the dermatologist say mm hmm okay so do not look in the mirror Sophie yeah cover the mirror up with a towel or something I be order you not to look at it Doctor 's order okay take it as a challenge Mm hmm it will pass I promise good so call I if you need I bye poor thing who be that a patient rosie 's age she think she be a freak now she be get a rash all over her body to prove it oh be it that sweet girl that I help into the dry clothe yes where be my key God do you remember when ian use to get those rash every time he get the flu so scary it do not help that I put the wrong cream on he that time do you remember the spider await let us go so Rosie know she ask if Paul and I be fight and I start off into this rather cliched speech about you know when two people have be together as long as your father and I have it be not some romantic movie where everybody live happily ever after whatever whatever as if that be what she think to begin with like she be some little girl what do she say typical rosie she cut right to the Chase and she ask I if I be sleep with somebody why would she suspect that when I be in rome she call I and she hear edward in the background of course she do not tell I this though so I get defensive I get kinda vague and I say what make you think that I be see somebody I almost say why I why not your father but thank God I do not finally she tell I that she know what about the boy well I speak to ian not about Kate 's Kate 's affair but um just about the tension in the house why do not you tell I about that well I be tell you now why can we not talk about this at home I do not understand that what do you say to he I say we be work through some disagreement he ask I if I be interested in anybody else and I say that I have feeling for somebody else but that nothing have happen well that be great that be just really great do you think for a minute that maybe that be something we could 've handle together Ito go to roman to rosie with somebody else dad fix it dad that be what she say like it be all upo I again and just after that ian come in so I do not know I just feel like I want to come clean how do you think he take that you have feeling for someone else well I think it hit he hard but you know he toughe it out it be okay dad it be cool that kind of thing well that be no surprise Ian 's always be on Paul 's side of the argument always that be not true yes it be true you be always the poor innocent lamb and I be always the monster it be true when in fact you be blameless be that what you be try to say no that be not what I be say you know you 've never once once take responsibility for what you do you 've be sit here for three week and you never once say I be sorry I make a mistake really I 've never say that I 've hear she say that when I 've hear she say that a number of time here actually one time she say it be a stupid mistake I do not hear that 'cause you do not wanna hear it what do you mean by that Kate if he have hear it it would force he into decide whether he be willing to forgive I or not and he be obviously not willing to forgive I because he have not make up his mind about this other woman yet wow wow anything else I should know about I by the way another thing we have not talk about you keep say that I have not be around that I do not see my kid that I do not see that I do not give that I only focus on myself can we talk about what kind of mother you 've be can we talk about that yeah sure okay let us talk about that okay Impatient nagging just ask they they will tell you anything they do be not good enough for you okay you should really be quiet right now 'cause you be sort of embarrass yourself where the hell have you be for the past year past year what about the past decade you do not know a thing about your child Ian maybe a little bit Max Rosie Jesus you do not know who she be hang out with what she do you do not have a clue he still think that she be this virginal little thing who do not go off with her friend and party or try drug that she be just this Daddy 's little girl what drug come on I be ask you what drug look she go to concert with her friend and she smoke pot but you know I guess because she be your daughter you think she do not do that sort of thing do she tell you that that she smoke pot who else can she tell she could 've tell I really so what do you say to her I tell she that if she do it once that it be not a big deal that one joint be certainly not go to make you a junkie so basically you say it be okay if she get high and smoke pot come on all of her friend smoke that be what they do so she try some she want to talk about it all her friend smoke so you buy into that you kn what I be really happy that she feel that she can come to I and talk to I about it I feel really good about that so be this how she got involve with this noah guy Noah be rosie 's boyfriend no she be into noah because he be a boy it be get nothing to do with drug whatsoever be they sleep with each other yes or no Rosie 's on the pill but I mean you be so close to her you must know that right how do you find this out I take she to the gynecologist myself about three month ago why would not you tell I that because she ask I not to so well it be between she and I Paul wow sex and drug nice they be not in the same category do you know how often she smoke do you know what she smoke do you know what they put in this shit now be she keep you up to date on that she be not a drug addict so why do not you just relax I be not go to relax because this be not about whether rosie smoke pot or not it be about you keep it from I that be the issue you take she to a gynecologist without tell I she be a child she be not a child she be our child ours well I guess you kind of enjoy keep it from I give you some kind of control do it got such a kick out of your little conspiracy you forgot to be concern about rosie not everything I do be for your benefit do ian smoke pot oh for Christ 's sake in college I certainly hope not well it appear I live in some kind of an alternate reality if one of her teacher keep that kind of information from I it would be bad but you be her mother it be bad it make it a hundred time bad Paul let us look at how you be react now Kate be say that this be why she be afraid to tell you thing rosie too who would not be piss off if their wife do not tell they if their wife do not include they there be reason to be angry but can you look beyond that for a minute Kate 's try to tell you something about rosie about her relationship with rosie you be not heang it I think I be no you be not no the way you be look at it they be exclude you but Kate 's talk about their own relationship their intimacy their trust you know last week when you be here you have a legitimate concern about rosie when she disappear for a day we be back here again today and we be still talk about rosie now a lot of these thing be important they absolutely should be address but I be wonder if we do not keep on talk about rosie because we be avoid the issue that bring you here okay let us try imago what do that mean come on Gina you be kid Paul I be try to get a dialogue start wait hello what be imago it be this pop psychology from the ' 80 the most earnest kind of bullshit Paul it be a type of couple therapy where you reflect each other 's feeling when I use to work with you you use to laugh at it there be a lot of it that be Bullshit yeah but it can be useful to get a dialogue go we can do it for a little while and then we will drop it so I do not understand when you say reflect Gina please do not make we do this can understand what it be before we make that decision okay what Paul say be right it be about reflection one person begin and the other person answer so Paul will say I be upset about what you do last night and you respond I hear that you be upset about my behavior last night and Paul will confirm or he will correct you if you leave something out we do that for a while and then the listening person summarize what they hear those of we who can still hear the more you bitch about this the more I wanna do it so just of course how do we start Gina okay so turn so you be face each other oh Gina well we be definitely do it now so okay face each other Paul would you face okay fine fine fine we will do an imago okay move in a little close who want to go first I I will okay oh he only repeat right that be it that be right nothing else no comment no reaction no analysis okay like this already during these session with Gina I 've start to learn a lot about myself and about you Paul yeah I I hear you say since we 've be see Gina you 've start to understand a lot about yourself and about you and about I yeah in my heart of heart I really do not want to come here but I realize that I be willing to do whatever it take because I can not get through to you at home and I think at least in this setting you might just have to listen to I so you didn'twant to come h but you think this be a place you might get I to listen yeah yeah but have Gina here have help I to realize that many of my feeling be in fact legitimate so you think that have Gina here to listen to us squabble Paul be here with Gina help you realize that your feeling be Legitimate yeah and I also have begin to understand that my Involvement with edward be most likely some kind of reaction to thing I 've be carry with I for many many year you think that cheat on I with edward be a reaction to something from your childhood no Paul come on okay your relationship with edward be a reaction to something that you 've be carry around for year yeah yeah a reaction to what exactly do not ask question just listen to her Imago Jesus Christ Gina what be happen to you okay okay what else I think Gina 's also right that your thing with Laura that be um that be a reaction to thing that you 've be carry around Paul can I what I be try to say be that I get that it be not all your fault I get that I have do my part and you know I 've be so busy try to be always your girlfriend your wife the mother and I 've never that I just never allow myself to be Kate really and how can that possibly be your fault so what you be say be that you let yourself get lock into a kind of I do not know dependent maternal role it be just how I see myself really I never question it you know all this caretake and please other people it be you know only feel safe as one half of something and even look at the gas Bill Mrs Dr Paul Weston I guess it never even occur to I that I have the strength to do thing on my own but Kate you run a shelter for batter woman you work with codependent alcoholic kid at risk your work have such a positive effect on so many people 's life but that be Paul could you reflect do we switch around now yeah okay I want to say that I be listen to you and that um I hear you it hurt I to realize that I 've be married to you for all this time and I do not know that you feel this way I should have and I be angry at myself for that I hear you say that you do not know that I feel this way okay yeah I be scared I be frighten I 've have so many patient who be in this situation it be almost like it be like deja vu and where these couple end up with one person leave to find themselves I hear you say that you be afraid that I will leave you no I do not say leave I be that what you want Gina you say that I might 've push Kate into her Affair because of my feing for Laura maybe it be the other way around my feeling for Laura be the reaction to what Kate 's be go through herself well you be both go through something she be struggle with dynamic that exist before you meet to cater to other to please to adapt to other and your past inform the way uh you act with Laura you be look for that young woman that you can nurture who look up to you the way Kate use to but that also make you confront the situation with your father which be frightening you be 14 when he leave 15 15 your mother have a nervous breakdown you have to take care of her she be give you nothing in return maybe you be try to address that in your relationship with Kate look for the mothering that you do not get at the same time you need to protect yourself from need it so much because there be always the risk of lose it and so you pull away you bury yourself in your work you want Kate there you always want she there but you want she at arm 's length so maybe now we have some idea of what be be happen between you and maybe now we can just begin to steer the ship back on course do not know mm hmm I honestly do not know I just feel that we 've be go in the same direction for so long maybe the good thing would be for I to just get off the ship what be you say be you say that you want to leave I be not sure Paul yeah I just want to say and I do not mean this in a patronizing way but it be not uncommon for couple your age to be at this crossroad that do not mean that what you be go through be not complicated and painful and like Paul say it do sometimes end with someone leave but no one have leave here yet and though it may not seem so right now at this moment I do not think anybody be quite ready to leave okay well give I a call and let I know about next Friday okay Thanks Gina Bye dear hello yes this be

properly oh it be okay it kind of catch I on the hop Paul it be fine when I be grow up people always think my stepmother be my be my sister she be 26 year young than my father a few time actually she and I be mistaken for a couple and the old man would play into it as if she and I be a pair of newlywed take the old man out for a night on the town God he love it so much be with she because she be so you know young and beautiful so proud of the fact that she be with he how do they meet he be a doctor and a heart surgeon she be a patient and do a bypass on her they start to date and then he leave my mother that be a nightmare hmm when I be a teenager I be always always in trouble I remember once this counselor say to I what be you go to be when you grow up and I remember say to he anything except my father Myather be a really selfish man whatever he want he just take it no regard for anybody 's feeling or hmm I uh I think you should go without I what no it be I do not know I just do not feel up to it Everything be catch up with I and watch they put he in the ground be a little too much for I you su yeah you go pay your respect no one know who I be anyway hey I know who you be previously on in Treatment if there be someone who do not know the meaning of guilt it be my father Mid ' 50 right Jim Crow Oklahoma this mob with hood attack his house so my father take the family they run downstairs to the the boiler room to the basement my grandfather his father be very sick dying of lung cancer he have this hacking cough my father put his hand over his father 's mouth and nose and he keep it there while they search the basement keep it clamp tight and then when they finally clear out my grandfather be dead I would love to see he on this couch Doc you would have a field day with he I be Paul Weston I be a friend of Alex 's my deep deep condolence thank you I I do not remember you play racquetball with he hello excuse I I be sorry I do not know which one of these door be the right one that be okay it be a terrible day do not want to knock on your residence no problem this door be usually for people who come in that be usually the exit door but it do not it do not really matter you have an entry door and an exit door it be for people 's privacy some people do not like to they do not like to run into each other be they ashamed no it be just it be protocol really would you like some coffee no I be a tea man but no nothing thank you I be fine please sit down I get a lot of question I be sure you have and I hope that I can answer some of they one thing I do have to stress from the outset be that anything that be say between myself and a patient in this room be private even if the patient be dead yes even then well I be sure we will find something to talk about something to help I understand what happen to my son Transcript FRM Team Sync Benj you be not very forthcoming about who you be when we meet at the service a friend you say that be hardly the case well I do not want to betray Alex 's confidence Daniel do not hesitate in explain exactly what your relationship to Alex be he be very direct Daniel I like that about he be you surprised to hear that Alex be in therapy that he do not tell I surprise I I mean what be the big deal why do you think he do not we will never know the answer to that will we or I will not maybe that be something you discuss here you know it always puzzle I the whole process here you know I mean that that a person be in therapy at all often be never discuss who the doctor be what he be there for how much it cost funny thing be that it be secrecy or misunderstanding thing never speak that usually land people in therapy in the first place be not at ironic I do not think it be about secrecy I think it be about create an environment where people can come and feel safe to talk about anything safe than with their love one sometimes it be easy to talk to somebody who be totally uninvolved in your life somebody objective somebody who have no stake in it you mean like a prostitute hmm someone who be pay for their intimacy and their discretion a man should have someone to talk to who care about he not someone who charge by the hour I really do care for Alex and if I have not I would actually be a pretty poor therapist do you think Alex speak about thing in this room that he never speak to anyone else about that be usually the case with patient so you probably know as much about he as anyone do do you feel that you know your son well I know Alex when he be a little boy and what be he like then well he be quiet introspective Daydreamer Inventor do he ever mention that to you he never do no he invent this thing for his mother a pan that make flip an omelet over very easy he work very hard on that thing it be really good so where do he get that from be you an inventor oh no no man I be a knucklehead my father be an inventor he invent this knife sharpen machine it do not make very much money he be proud of it Alex remind I of he in what way you try to shrink I doctor I be just curious or perhaps you can not help yourself that be probably true too my father and Alex have the same mannerism the same sense of humor it be unsettling when Alex be a little boy and my father have be dead almost 20 year there he be sit across the dinner table look at I through I with those eye of his on Alex 's face be your father still live Mr Weston yes yes his body be in good health but his his mind be go be you close we have our difference of course but we be close we be close I mean how often do you see he about once a month do he know you be there no I do not think so but the visit be more for my sake what do you get out of it connection a sense of belong do you ever have conversation with he in your head both side of the conversation yes when I be young everything he say go in one ear out the other now I hear his voice in my head Loud and clear every day that be the sense of connection that you mention that be that be what I feel slip away with each pass day since Alex 's death that sense of I be try to find his voice you know but he will not talk to I if you do not mind I say so Mr Prince I think that it be still too soon you be probably still in a state of shock but his voice will come back to you I apologize for compare what you do to uh prostitution I do not believe they be the same at all Apology accept how would you describe my son Alex I be not ask you for a diagnosis you do not have to tell I what he think just what you think of he personally I think that Alex be an extremely capable man strong sense of mission a very strong sense of what be expect of he uh mission or purpose what do you mean well Alex be a military man military man have mission to have a purpose a sense of purpose that be something something you do on your own something you want for yourself do he have that I think that Alex be struggle to find out what he want for himself do he say that no sir he do not I be just give you some of my impression without betray what he confide in I Frankly it be more than I be allow to do be you in the service yourself Mr Prince eight month you know after they draft I have an asthma attack and they discharge I probably save my life Funny a breathing problem be my salvation and my father 's death knell Alex tell you about what happen to my father these be fact about my life not Alex 's treatment do you happen to know how my father die yes or no simple question yes yes I do anyway I be not a war hero like my son if that be what you be wonder how do you feel about Alex 's service in the Navy I be proud of it of course like any father would be be he do you think do you suspect that he be not I want to understand my son mr Weston and instead of help I you answer question with question I think your son find it increasingly difficult to compartmentalize to keep his feeling apart from his obligation and to live up to the expectation of other the expectation of the Navy Expectations to excel like he have always excel and at the expense of his own need and his real desire be you say that Alex be ill equipped emotionally to handle the pressure Mr Prince you be ask I to I be ask your opinion Alex 's emotional state be not something you be play a little fast and loose here be not you mr Weston I can know my son be trouble just not how troubled I want to know what his therapist believe he be capable of how far he would go how far he would go to what Mr Prince I 've speak to a couple of Alex 's fellow pilot it be a training flight they simulate a battle one plane against another the other pilot make a snap decision try to get away apparently fly low they say Alex do not have time to straighten out there be also a rumor go around that Alex kill himself he be a superb pilot it be not combat it be a training exercise it be a training exercise there have not be any official find Mr Prince you say that yourself there be an ejection seat why do not he jump maybe he do not think he need to use it well Michaela 's be in church you know on her knee pray look for answer my wife also and I tell them you know that be the wrong place to look God and I we 've be over for a while my faith die when my father die a boy once beat Alex up he be about 10 or 11 he take his shoe little shit punk you know Alex do nothing to fight back he do not defend himself he be not a fighter he be a he be a frail kid you know Thin skinned and that scare the hell out of I where I come from thin black skin could get you kill and that be the kind of world that that Alex be bear into what be you imply I be simply ask if he no let I tell you something I see more injustice as a child horror do they do they affect my view of the world of course do they shape the manner in which I raise my boy how could they not Strength Strength be essential to survival Vulnerability be often a death sentence I want he to be safe I envy the time you spend talk with he I admit those kind of talk embarrass the hell out of I this where he sit yes Alex could talk he and his boy they would talk for hour he even once tell Roy that he love he boy I tell you do I give he hell for that you be try to make the kid a sissy or something it be bad enough that he do not want to good Alex at anything he would rather throw a chess game just so be he would not have to beat his father oh now come on that be no way to raise a boy to be a man I mean you have to challenge he make he compete teach he how to fight take care of himself it be interesting that you regret not be more gentle yourself with Alex and yet at the same time you seem to justify be be harsh I hear you say that you be a little conflicted about the notion Mister I be not in conflict about anything be that how you try to help Alex Second guess every word that come out of his mouth a stranger completely unfamiliar with his background you go explain his world to he actually our session be mostly about I listen to what to what he have to say yeah well there we go again with the listening huh he have his own personal professional listener listen when I smother my father do you think I pay someone to listen to I hmm you can not stop and dwell on every ache and pain maybe it be because of what my dad do or maybe it be because of what my mother do Come on you 've get to keep move man you know what good do all the talk do it be not go to bring my father back you know what People like you you never stop to think that we have a subconscious for a reason because there be thing about ourselves that we can not face that we should not face or else how in the world do we get up out of bed in the morning I will tell you World War III come all those people who 've be through all of this psychoanalysis spend hundred thousand of dollar be go to be the first one to lose their head Darwin have a theory he call it survival of the fit the fit not the most self reflective with all due respect I think that Alex start come here because he feel that he need to and you have to take he apart do not you you have to pick at the scab do you think that Alex 's therapy here have something to do with his death you be the one who tell he he have to go look inside to reflect examine feel oh yeah he feel and what do that get he now he be a human pancake you be a hell of a miracle worker doctor do you have a son Mr Weston yes I do and if another man someone from a different culture start give he advice every week advice that you be pretty sure would be harmful to your son what would you do your son be a mature man who decide to come here of his own what would you do what would you do I would try to stop he if I could I can not get over the feeling that I be tear apart in this room People have a misunderstanding about what happen in in room like this it really be not about blame or look for scapegoat he be an outstanding person he be kind devoted loyal too loyal often I wish that he would 've just please himself not I but we want to please do not we Mr Weston he do a lifetime of try to please I all that that tough that tough schooling and the training and the achievement that be for I I be the one who need it to feel that he be safe you know you son love you and he have huge admiration for you he tell I that do not tell I that man you think that comfort you think that comfort I no I would have rathere that he hate I I would have rathere that this be his fuck you to I why do you say that for push he so hard to be tough than the rest of the world I be so stupid do I kill my son I kill my father with my own two hand do I kill my son too no whatever happen up there be not your fault you be not responsible we will never know will we thank you thank you for your time I would appreciate it very much if you would call I a taxi please sure my father have always be there for I his studio be at home so there be a lot of model walk around naked they be have sex how do you know I see they why do not you ever tell your mother what you see it be not my job to make her face reality I be the child she be suppose to be smart than I Sophie in all the week that wve be in therapy you 've never once allow yourself to be angry at your father I think that your father make you his accomplice and he drive this wedge between you and your mother why can not you let yourself be angry at he why should I be angry at he she be the one who who piss I off why because she be pathetic and annoying and and she be always around what have I tell ya it be not 4 00 it be five minute to you say we would be on time we be early my apology you do not have to wait for I oh that be all right I will take a walk I like this neighborhood okay whatever but you do not have to your hair look lovely like this really it look lovely down too but there be something really great about it when it be up like this Mom I be go to say no what what be you go to say it be nothing what be you go to say well I be just think that after your session if you be not busy that maybe we could do something I know you do not like the shoe that I buy you but maybe we could go get a different pair or go get coffee what be wrong I be fine tell I what you be go to say before I have to go I be go to be late everything be go to shit I try talk to my mom all week I just try again in the car and I can not say anything to her I literally can not I feel like there be this lump in my throat all the time now what do you think you would like to say to her I do not even know it be not just one thing I just want to talk to she like my dad be be call constantly every day this week like he be suddenly compete for most attentive father of the year award I have not call he back once why not I do not know why do you think he be call so often Paul stop I do not know okay I can not just give I a fucking break yesterday on beam my leg start to shake like a spasm or something I 've see it happen to some of the young girl when they get scared I 've never be scared on the beam Cy be watch so he will probably pull I out of the meet I probably will not even get to compete I do not think that be go to happen what the hell do you know about it even if I do compete how the fuck be I suppose to ace a national tryout if I be shake like an epileptic I will fall apart on the beam and become a joke there be something seriously wrong with I so we be go back to this then that it be all your fault that there be something seriously wrong with you there be I be all fuck up in what way be that gee I do not know Paul I run my bike into a car then as soon as they want to take my cast off my neck mysteriously wig out then I take your pill and now I have some sort o a flesh eat disease I mean look do not your dermatologist say there be not anything to worry out what in the hell do she know she do not say that it might be stress relate you know that anxiety can manifest itself in all kind of physical way some people can get cramp migraine a rash so I be just a little worried okay all well Sophie you be try to do two big thing at the moment you know you be talk to your mother you be not just berate she like you use to do you be you be actually try to talk to her and you be avoid your father these be extremely difficult thing to do because you 've never do they before and they could lead to painful place like tell your mother your father 's secret and tell your dad that you be angry with he do not you think that could be cause you a lot of anxiety and that your body be send up these kind of flare in the form of a rash I be almost certain Sophie that there be nothing physically wrong with you you do not know that I remember once year ago when I be start my practice I move to the city and get a new apartment everything be go really well very happy I think and then one day I be with a patient and for no reason my heart start to pound I could not breathe I have this ringing in my ear when suddenly my tongue start to swell up so this patient call the ambulance and they they take I to the hospital take I to this room do all these kind of test you know what they find in the end what nothing I would have what they call an anxiety attack Guess I be more Overwhelmed and stress than I think I be I think that be bullshit do this look like a little anxiety rash to you well doctor hello look at I you shit be I that much of a freak that you can not even look at I what be the matter Paul be I embarrass you cross your boundary you want to disappear when somebody else want something from you do I still seem normal to you mm hmm I shock you you be shocked my titty scare you how can they they be just these tiny little thing do the size of your breast upset you Sophie of coursnot it be just what happen to gymnast it be the diet when girl stop train they explode they gain weight grow a great big rack and ass get full period they become normal I know it be not normal to be like this I get that I would say that you have the body of a a fucking freak I have the body of a child but I be not a child child do not want to kill themselves that be true be you think about death again Sophie do you know why because everythingis fall apart a it be what I be try to tell you it be like that dream I use to have where the pretty Meadow turn to ash right in front of my eye except I be awake and I can not make it stop you know I be remember something that you tell I the time when you be in the ambulance you remember you want to put the mirror outside so that you could see what be go on you could not see anything except yourself do you remember that so what well I think sometimes when thing go wrong in your life Sophie you blame yourself whenever a situation seem difficult you assume that it be that it be your fault you build this surrogate home with Cy and darlene and it fall apart for you and you blame yourself not Cy and you decide to punish yourself by ride your bicycle into a car see the thing be if you see yourself always as the problem you be go to create discord in in the most perfect place do it ever occur to you that Cy be the person responsible for what happen it be my fault but why do it have to be your fault because it be that be the second time it be happen you mean it be the second time your home fall apart but why would you think that that be your fault I do not know it just be no I need you to tell I I do not know no it be important for you I do not know Paul no but stop it you want I to have some big breakthrough today I can see that why do not you just tell I what the answer be and I will repeat it back to you and you can put a Gold Star on my forehead what I be try to do be help you find your own answer and I think that you be really close to that and I understand how scary that must be have you ever read the bible be not that like illegal for you to ask I that not really it be really just a subject like any other you n choose to talk about it or not anyway in the new testament God be always portray as be good and wickedness and evil be a human thing a human problem actually it be one of the thing that be help christianity to spread very quickly can you can you think why because people like to feel shitty about themselves that be it exactly we prefer to live in a world where God be good and man be bad rather than a world where God be bad so an evil authority an unfair government neglectful parent that be a pretty scary concept make your whole life seem kind of scary and meaningless it be one of the reason why child will blame themselves before their parent you tell I once that you want to move across the country to be with your dad and his new wife but that they they do not have a room for you in her house you say that they argue about it and that eventually he leave she right right how long do it take he to to leave she I do not know over two year hmm and during that whole time your mother be depress and cry constantly yeah and you want to move to your dad and be with he but you could not two year be a long time for a child to be without a safe place to call home I tell you he leave she because of that after two year Sophie I do not understand how could he just stop love I what do I do you didn do anything be not there a law somewhere that say parent have to love their kid forever you be right but you must 've screw up somewhere otherwise how could they treat you like this a father can not just abandon his perfectly normal daughter swap she for a new famy a mother can not just fall into a deep depression and ignore she must be your fault maybe if I have tell my mother about the cheating then at least thing would be well with her Sophie that be not the sort of responsibility a child should be ask to handle your father cheat on your mother you do not tell she then he leave you need that order of event to somehow make sense so you blame yourself because nothing else make sense Sophie listen to I you see your dad cheat and you do not tell your mom now do you honestly think that that be a reason for you to be abandon I find my diary from fourth grade I we to edite in this thing constantly do you ever keep a diary no I take it out because I want to see if you be right about how hard it be for I to lie to my mother do you want I to read you what I find I would be honor dear hermione I pretend that I be write to hermione granger who be that you know from Harry potter tell I you 've read those be you insane I just have not get around to it yet they 've be out for 10 year I know I know I know I will bring you my set next week okay no that be not necessary honestly my kid have they they 've read they uh huh and and they really love they okay maybe you be not such a fuck up parent thank you dear hermione it be a terrible day today I be so sad I be sorry I have not write to you in a while I know you must be angry and miss I I miss you too I want to tell you everything but I know I must hide thing from you because she might read it I be afraid from now on you and I must sustain rselous what be it I write sustain instead of restrain where do you keep this diary on my night table not hide away you know it be a wonderful gift this diary it be a real clue to who you be there you be in fourth grade you be already pull away from your world you be establish a relationship with somebody who can not let you down Hermione you be confide in her but you be still hope that your mother will notice you think I want she to find the diary I think so and you want she to ask what you be hide you say there um it be a terrible day what do you mean by that oh it be september 11th wow go on please do I have to read it it be so fucking naive I would like to hear it today bad man from other country hijack airplane and fly they into important american building there be people inside the plane and building good people Dad say I be go to inherit an evil world I hate he so much I hate he so much what kind of a fucking idiot tell a fourth grader that she be go to inherit an evil world if he really believe that then why do not he do something about it instead of run off to l a to photograph bimbo hmm so you be not pick up his call no way so he do not even know that you be angry at he I do not want to talk about this now okay but when you be ready will welk about what you want to say to he okay okay so you really think the rash and spasm be come from my head mm hmm but that do not mean they be not real but I do not think that it be that it be a disease so what do I do about it I think you need to start to forgive yourself forgive myself for what for not tell your mother about your father 's affair you know what you have to understand be that they be go to break up anyway no matter what you do you be not responsible for your parent ' action the only action that we can control be our own and the only power we have be how we treat other people and how we treat ourselves so you want I to forgive myself mm hmm how slowly it be go to take a while it be take you a few year to fall into this and it be probably go to take you a while to get out of it but you have to start try now 'cause you know something you deserve to be happy Que lástima hmm it be from a spanish song it mean what a shame ah Que que lástima a cierta luce parece una estrella de cine wow my Spanish be dreadful what do that mean it mean in a certain light you look like a movie star oh well gracia the competition be on Friday should I go I think so I

be a pretty weird week since we see you last Paul very quiet around the house Awkward we barely speak to each other except when Lenny be around who somehow seem really relaxed and at ease he be such a funny kid Man I wish you could meet he he be tell we this joke the other day about these these two cannibal that eat a clown and one cannibal turn to the other and say do this taste funny to you anyway Amy and I be laugh despite ourselves it be very surreal kid tend to do that when they sense tension they try to get the parent to come together you be probably right but he should not have to do it it be not fair you be right it be not fair Amy 's be try to reach out to I this week you know make it all ok the whole Ben thing but how can you make up for something like that to tell you the truth it be pretty sad watch she try when Lenny fall asleep the other night she run around the house pretend to be busy with house shit which she never do not say anything just try to run into I and at one point we be pretty close together in the kitchen she try to kiss I and I just what just could not do it I be not into it my heart be not there it can be hard to relate to somebody after something like an affair you be tell I Bizarre late that night she have fall asleep watch tv and I just I just stand there look at she how do you feel she sleep with she both hand tuck under her cheek like in those kid book you know the way they draw the angel sleep she do not look like a woman who have just fuck some other guy she look really beautiful and I be think how easy it would be to just go lay down next to she and put my arm around her but you do not no I could not I just remember how easily she could chip away at I and lure I back in so I jump in my car and I get the fuck out of there in the middle of the night that be right where have you go First at Elliot 's but then I remember he have a date I do not want to walk in on anything it be be about 6 year since the guy got lay so I just keep drive and I end up at my parent ' house the kicker be they live about four hour away in Virginia and it be too early when I arrive to ring the doorbell so I just sit out front in my car and fall asleep how often do you see they your parent Mom come into town to see Lenny pretty frequently every couple of month maybe we go out there for the holiday a couple of time a year not much more and be your father close to Lenny be my father close to Lenny that be a good question I think so they spend time together Lenny like he but it always feel finite I can not help but get the feeling that he leave he hang like he be just spend a few minute with the neighbor 's grandchild and now it be time to move on of course my dad be the narcissist that he be be oblivious to it have Lenny say anything to you about it no he seem fine with it so who know maybe I be just see thing I be asleep in the car outside their house and all of a sudden there be this knock on the window and its wake I up and it be a cop and who be the cop Mike Garnett go to school with I want to be a cop since the 1st grade and now that be what he be it be really funny he fulfil his childhood dream I do not think I know anyone who become what they want to be when they be a kid when I be grow up in the wintertime there be this guy and he would come over with his chainsaw swing from tree to tree cut branch before they freeze and fall off like a fucking monkey it be unbelievable and he be the only guy I know who my father do not tell how to do his job that be who I want to be the old man he be such a know it all the funny part be though he do know it all he can tell you the exchange rate for a guyanese dollar how to cook a freshwater salmon in a clay oven or the history of the silk worm do he write encyclopedia you would think right no he be a college professor my mom too Intellectuals big reader unlike I I do not read I do not think I 've read a book since I leave high school do that mean you do not or you will not I have not really I remember once I misquote Roland Barthes and you correct I where do that come from I grow up in a house where everyone be read at dinner that shit be everywhere any parrot could pick it up and spit it back verbatim that be what happen when your dad be an emeritus professor of Renaissance study and your mother teach classic Greek and Hebrew but I do not read I mean not literally obviously I read I read music manual headline but I just I do not know I be not like they I do kick ass at crossword puzzle though you do those I be not very good Sunday New York Times crossword do I in every week it be a tough one to do crossword puzzle you need to have an extensive vocabulary no it be kinda hard to reconcile the idea of somebody who do not read with somebody who be really good at crossword puzzle there be nothing to reconcile I be good at it and reading make I restless and bored so do you acquire your love of crossword puzzle from your parent not really my mom 's all right at they my dad suck what do you do as a kid when everybody else be do all this reading I do not know play guitar collect baseball card smoke pot do that get you into trouble not really nobody notice nobody notice that you get high so who be you get high with myself mostly so would you say that you have a lonely childhood Nah why it be okay I talk to myself a lot you know what one of my favorite thing in the world be talk to Lenny and we talk about anything but mainly we talk about sport and he can just go off Aluminum bat versus wood fuck anything that kid have a brain like a computer he be not even 10 and he can list off all of Boog Powell 's stat from the 1970 world series that be just amazing to I I never get tired of hear that little fucker talk you get like that with your kid not so much anymore because they be old but with my young yeah I still do and how old be he he be nine just like Lenny do you have that kind of relationship with your father as a kid no I avoid talk to my father when I be a kid it just be not worth it he be the kind of guy who would wince if you say sure instead of surely do you find it easy to talk to your mom she be not as bad but what be frustrating be she would always defer to he on everything it be like she see he as this hotshot professor at another level from everyone he get tenure at 33 and it just would not occur to she that she could have an opinion different from his than his if you be he you would have just correct I on my grammar if you be he hey they do not beat I right it could 've be a lot bad that be true it do not it do not mean it be not difficult so when do you start to write I do not write my brother Nathan be the writer he be a novelist he be just shortlist for some prize last year some big national award I can not even remember the name I be sure my parent remember it but you be a writer too or do not you consider songwrite to be write no sure I do some of my favorite writer be actually songwriter people like Dylan Cohen John Lennon hey I agree with you Paul I would put Dylan on par with Walt Whitman Ezra Pound Langston Hughes just try tell that to my family you know for somebody who be not a great reader you seem to be pretty familiar with great poet Nobody 's really familiar with Pound they just fake it but I get the feeling you like to play down your knowledge your intelligence I do not know it be just my folk ' world I guess some of it have rub off on I but it be just not I your parent ever express an interest in what you might do for a live my dad probably want I to be some kind of academic it be the family business after all but what do he expect I do not know I think he give up the dream on I pretty early after I flunk out of high school which do you think come 1st your father 's low expectation or your low grade Meaning often with expectation there be a self fulfil prophecy maybe you decide early on you could not match up to his expectation and so you give up try could be my mom be always try to get I interested she would help I study for test on the sly on the sly yeah it piss my dad off he think she be spoon feed I thing I should 've know or figure out by myself and she be terrify he would find out be she generally intimidate by he you be so right Abe I never look at it that way Abe yeah it make I want to scream one thing you can say about I be I sure as hell do not marry my mother you mean you do not marry a woman who be intimidate by you so how do your parent feel about Amy she be a successful businesswoman she be get an MBA they fucking love that she go to grad school their high school dropout of a son marry a hotshot businesswoman it be interesting you use the same word to describe your father hot shot do you think that they be alike in other way they be not they be total opposite he be all rumpled corduroy stain on his shirt and she be well hell you know what Amy be meticulous put together very materialistic she love her stuff you know when we meet I be crash in this crappy apartment over a garage I think it turn she on and the woman have never fuck on a bed without a box spring and she like it come down from her pedestal hang with the riffraff do you feel like your father be also on a pedestal come on let us get off this alright this be not why I be here I do not have that many people to talk too right now and I be scared shitless of lose Lenny in some custody battle Amy be unstable this be the second time she be get a divorce after have an affair and I think she be go to fuck he up you say yourself she need loser around I think she be go to teach he to be a loser she be damage Paul she be fuck up I have not get much right in my life except that kid and that kid be what the fuck you do not pay your electric bill or something look like it be out on the entire street you want to go on I can see you fine you be sure for the first time it really feel like we be split up no matter how many time we 've talk about it or bring it up it be never feel so Real why do you think it feel different this time the last time you be here you imply that you would fall out of love with Amy would you still say that be true I do not know how would I know what do it feel like I 've only be in love with one girl her I 've never fall out of love tell I what it feel like and I will tell you if I be feel it have you ever feel it there be a huge sadness there 'cause you know what be be lose and you begin to lose the desire to connect maybe you should ask your father he be the guy who know everything do I tell you what he say when I tell he my marriage be over this be not entirely unexpected be it he expect I to fail every time at everything why do you go home Jake I do not know it be an extend I just start drive that be where I end up this be therapy we do not believe in accident here alright fine I be about to be a single dad maybe I maybe I just feel like I want to talk to my mum or your dad have you be listen to a word I say I can not fucking stand my father it be interesting that you use the same word to describe Amy and your father Hot shot but you keep insist that they be nothing like each other they be not where be you go with this look you marry an intelligent overachieve woman who seem absolutely certain of her authority in the world the criticism and disappointment that you get from your father do I feel that that be what you get from Amy your relationship with Amy 's fall apart so you get in a car and you drive for 4 h to Virginia and you find yourself by accident outside your father 's house you think I be go back to the source Jesus that be sick it be not sick the more we open ourselves to the the therapeutic process the more we can examine these More therapy what be you talk about I need that like I need a hole in the head you know what who care why I go home that night what be it matter how my parent talk at the fucking dinner table alright I 've learn from my father 's mistake and I be a much well father than he be I do not want to fuck it up I do not want to fuck my kid up I need I need the help I need your help I need help all the help I can get or some road map you know I feel scared I wish I could say it be that simple that I could just give you a road map a book of instruction but unfortunately life be not like that but you know that old say that a journey of a thousand mile begin with a single step or in my case two step up and one step back you know if this be a movie the light would come on right now if this be a movie previously on in Treatment you know you 've never once take responsibility for what you do you never once say I be sorry I make a mistake he be not willing to forgive I because he have not make up his mind about this woman yet another thing we have not talk about the kind of mother you 've be can we talk about it you should really be quiet right now you be sort of embarrass yourself you say that I might have push Kate into her affair because of my feeling for Laura maybe it be the other way around you be both go through something she be struggle with the dynamic that exist before you meet and you be look for that young woman who look up to you the way Kate use to that be great that be just really great how be you so obviously Kate be not come today yes she leave I a message she really do not go into why though she say that she be tired of go back and forth and just tired to try to find out who have start what and who be guilty of what and who be react to what she want to decide on her own basically I have to respect that Transcript Anyone Coffee Tagne Sync by Anyone Coffee Tagne Week 8 Episode 40 how do you think our session with Kate go I would say they be chaotic I be a little annoyed with you over that but I suppose I be partly at fault too and I also think that she felt sandwich between two therapist I do have to say though that you do manage to make connection that resonate with both of we especially with Kate whether anything be go to come off that I do not I do not really know you know who I envy writer they create these character that they want to spend time with and then they decide if they be go to let they live or die or let they be happy or unhappy let they be failure or success you wanna write everybody 's story for they I really think I would be a shitty writer I would want to give everybody a happy ending I be very sorry about your patient yeah thank not the end I would have write for he the funeral Jesus Christ I would forget how awful funeral be that dreadful sense that that in the end there be only silence you think as therapist we would have well tool to walk through it well I do not I feel the same sense of futility and hopelessness as the next guy you know what be also interesting be see the relative of patient you 've treat their participance in the story that you 've hear a dozen of time the father the son the brother whoever we think we know they but we do not really know they at all we know reaction of they the version of they idealize or vilify I be really struggle to reconcile this image that I have of Alex 's wife with the woman that I see there he always describe she as a demand exact a constant source of pressure in his life but I look over and I just see this break woman she seem so soft and gentle 'cause I will never really know she now do that bother you it do bother I I ask myself all the time if I actually know what I think I know about my patient ' life that couple for example the one who be try to have the baby Amy I do not think she can ever really be know I mean there be certain pattern that identify themselves from her past but I can not shrink her she be too complicated and then I say to myself do I really know any of these people or be they all just one big fiction that I 've construct in my head you know sometimes I dream about the family member of patient that I be treat People I 've never meet yeah it be curious apart from your intense connection with your patient you be also now talk about I do not know longing for your patient ' family and friend what do you mean by that a longing maybe that be not the right word do you mean curiosity about the life of other people be not that an aspect of what we do it be just it be curiosity we be suppose to be fascinate by how people behave at least at least I think so Alex 's death leave I with this very strong feeling that I be like a repository really a trustee the thing that he never tell anybody else his private thought they 've stay with I they be inside I a big part of his life be be in vault I have inside I no a part of his life maybe but not necessarily a big part you be his therapist only his therapist I know you 've always be of two mind in relation to this that therapy be more than a discipline that it be actually a religion but you also say we be therapist so we can not really run our patient live for they as soon as they walk out the door they be on their own yeah how would you describe Alex 's state of mind when you last see he I would say he be pretty fragile if I remember well yeah the ironic thing be that we would really make some good progress and he just seem to regress it be like he feel that he be so close to a breakthrough that it scare he it be too much and he just he turn away from it really be you feel in any way responsible for his death you know I be friendly with a psychiatrist that consult for the Navy Alfonso Casilles you remember he yeah well I ask he if he could find out anything he say vertigo it mean that there be nothing wrong with the equipment they be do some kind of combat exercise the plane he be chase descend Alex go into what they call vertigo and lose control that be their official conclusion I think he kill himself how can you be sure of that look his life be a tragedy from the second he be bear his childhood his relationship with his father up to when he push the button and kill a room full of kid how do you live with that even with the gadget that they have now they reduce people to dot on a video screen all the spin from the Navy none of it make any difference to he it do not work on he he feel every single one of those death I know he do so many expectation the good and the bright he be he be so strong physically handsome intelligent under all that kind of posturing and male posing that he do he be really he be a good guy Charming he be endear you know he look and he sound like what they call a winner suddenly he become a murderer how do you reconcile that I think that be what really kill he endear I have never hear you talk about he like that quite the opposite actually he be kind of a funny guy he be I do not know be I already begin to idealize yeah maybe well it be not uncommon after such a shock he give I the chance to stop he from fly literally do he really offer that or be you project he ask I directly should I fly what do you say I tell he I be very concerned about his about his state of mind you say that clearly but he want I to say it unequivocally do not fly it be not your place Paul a patient can not ask you to take his life into your hand it be not your place to say do not fly Anymore than it be your place to say to that couple have an abortion or to Laura Marry or do not marry your fiancé I should have send the Navy an evaluation Guilt ride want to punish himself should not fly Alex 's dad come into the office to to talk so I have this poor guy yell at I say that his son 's repression be what have keep he alive all the time and that therapy the stuff that he be do with I be the therapy be what have kill he oh God Paul up in the air at Mach 5 he be not suppose to have emotion he be not suppose to think that be actually why he crash he be very different from what I imagine also he be riddle you know with his own guilt actually he do make a couple of good point he say thing be in the unconscious for a reason because the mind can not live or breathe or take a single step if everything that lie dormant in it be out there in daylight fully lie out that a fully conscious human being would be paralyze would be like a cripple Alex do not need to be conscious but just merely efficient do you really accept that that life be well live unexamined and when anxiety and fear and pain bubble up from below how can that be deal with except by look at it except by analyze it we do not run the show Paul I sometimes think that therapist can start to imagine they be like writer you know that they can control the outcome we do not live their life for they we do not even live they with they I know that you want to believe that we really do have an influence that be always positive we help people to understand Understand what they be feel and after that if they make a wrong turn then it be not our fault it be human error but anyway who be you really angry at myself obviously you every therapist from Freud to Mitchell why because we force patient to look at themselves and pat ourselves on the back for it then we say to they here be what be wrong with you now off you go do you feel this way before Alex die more or less yeah have it be on your mind recently in any other context like what I be ask have other patient other than Alex make you think like this you be insinuate no I be just try to get a sense a history of these feeling about psychotherapy you mean if I 've be wonder for a while if our profession be actually helpful to people yes I have I think about it every day so you feel you be not able to help your patient the gymnast for example Sophie honestly I feel like she make a lot of progress we connect there be a bind between we but I think it be the personal relationship that help she not the therapeutic process you know maybe Yallom be right maybe it be the relationship that actually heal but that other couple Jake and Amy I can not tell you honestly if they be well off together or apart I do not know if I help they at all anyway be you okay Paul I think I be tired Gina Put your foot up you know Alex say he be talk about vertigo and he say that when it happen they be suppose to trust their instrument and not their sense that be right how do you know that I once have a boyfriend who be a commercial pilot this be before David he teach I that among other thing yes Paul I have be more than a sleepy spider so it seem anyway I think it be the opposite for a psychologist I think we would be far more effective if we rely less on instrument and theory and book and more on our own instinct so all your training all your knowledge can lead you astray I think so do you feel this generally or about certain patient in particular what do you mean what be it Gina what you 've get that look of yours what look be that you have the look that say I have a theory regard what Come on Gina cut the crap just tell I what you think I be just sit here listen to you I be listen to your newfound theory about the uselessness of psychotherapy certain patient in particular come on we be back to Laura again be we you think everything be a reaction to Laura what be a reaction I criticize psychology dismiss theory you think I be make an excuse even Alex getting kill that be an excuse right psychology be collapse so I might as well sleep with Laura I think that be kind of the way you be be that what I be think be I wrong when you guess what I be think it be always about Laura like I assume that everything you say be connect to her do not you you be the one who bring she up I be not talk about Laura I be talk about the fact that I be have trouble lately believe in this religion of yours of mine I do not think traditional psychology answer anything anymore you have two extreme right you have pop psychology you 've get these celebrity therapist write good seller get on talk show make some miserable couple wipe on television it be kind of a pornography and then on the other hand you 've get the expert Psychologists like you orthodox Authority figure everything under control and supervised examine under a bright light examine to death completely and utterly divorce from real life be I divorce from real life Gina you 've never live outside this room the Institute the graduate program David 's world and after David die you lock yourself up in here I mean it be a beautiful room look at it beautifully appoint everything be in its place but you sit in here and what do you do you write fiction about how life could have be should have be be that what I be write just ask yourself as a therapist can you really help anybody if you live in a bubble so now I be a sleepy spider in a bubble look I do not want to upset you Gina I you will not I forget of course you do not get upset you never lose it I 've lose it here with you several time in the past few week why be you try to provoke I I be not try to provoke you I just do not want to end up like this be this it be this how therapist live out their life you be perverse you know something real and powerful come into your life and you never give it a chance not for Charlie 's sake or for yours I know you say it be because he be a patient but you know what I think I think it be bullshit Paul be careful you be terrify Charlie tell I that you be the big loss in his life that his whole life could have be different you have no idea what you be talk about and after all these year Paul you do not know I you wanna know what I struggle with it be not that I be too reserve too detach it be that I be too emotional I be impulsive and emotional and I give myself over right away and passionately I pour myself out can not you see that I be protect myself because I be afraid I get carry away I will not be able to think I will not be able to analyze I will not be able to work you 've create this cold version of I that be limit and castrate because when you be argue with I you want to see yourself as battle the force of repression and if the truth be that I be an emotional person who have to rein herself in it do not fit with what you need now do it of course I want Charlie he be the most alive person I ever meet I want to sleep with he I want to eat he up but I do not and not because of ethic I may have tell he that it be because he be a patient but the real reason be David even though David cheat on I for however many year I know that all along he be really shitty at hide it I do not sleep with Charlie because that be not who I want to be I love David and I love the life we have and who I be with he I love myself with David David 's Gina and you know what when I be stand over his grave at funeral I feel if I be magically reborn I would choose he all over again for all his fault he allow I to be who I want to be I be surprised you do not see it how crazy I be about he he be everything I never hear you say it oh shit everything have to be say then now I have to sit here and listen to your crappy nearsighte self involve theory about my life oh God listen to we you know I slap you and you punch I sometimes I tell myself it be constructive but you know I be not so sure anymore maybe we should stop you 've be fight I for two month say Laura Laura Laura and you 've be wait for this imaginary Gina of yours to jump in and stop you I be not what be stop you you be fight yourself it be up to you it be like Alex you carefully look at his life you open door for he you give he insight but his life be his and he decide to fly now you decide perhaps you be right maybe love can bloom in a therapist office Ethics and rule love be big than any rule and what do I know maybe she be your David maybe you can only be the Paul you want to be with her so go to her find out but please stop compare your life to mine stop use Charlie against I I be sorry he be hurt by what happen but I never love he not for a day I love David so never talk to I about Charlie again be I clear please go now Paul previously on in Treatment my dad be the most important person to I in this whole world you 've try to kill yourself and you do not want to tell the most important person in your world he have a life it be not his fault that I take those pill I be not say it be his fault I be just try to figure out why you be so ready to leave the planet and not tell he be you angry at he for something I be not angry at he you tell I once that you want to move across the country to be with your dad and his new wife but that they do not have a room for you I tell you he leave she because of that after two year Sophie how could he just stop love I what do I do Laura hi it be I Paul I hope you be do okay I be still hope we could talk meet up maybe have a coffee okay I

feel about the three of we meet she be fine you be cool with it right whatever it be cool can we come in why do not we schedule a meeting a joint session for all three of we next week no time like the present I think Sophie and I need to consider whether or not a joint session would be to her benefit we need time to prepare Time to prepare for what I be her father Dad be cool it be not a big deal I be totally cool kiddo it be this guy who seem to have something wedge up his ass Dad we can do it next week okay please Dad do not go I will tell he that he have to let you in forget it he be just try

have any idea how humiliating that be I stand in front of your therapist like I'am I be what what do he think I be what be the matter with you be you actually take this guy seriously it be like he be brainwash you or something brainwash I about what you have to prepare to meet with your dad boy be that bullshit you can not even look I in the eye boy that just break my heart I raise you to be smart than this you do not really raise I excuse I Most of the time you be far away I can not believe what I be hear he say he have never be more humiliate in his whole life I can not let he in without an appointment he be my father even still you let my mother in we would make an appointment with your mother ahead of time why could not you just let he in it would not have bother I I know you be used to your father come in and out of your life but that do not mean it do not bother you in fact I suspect it bother you very much and he be not exempt from the rule of this office you and your fucking rule if your wife walk in would you chase she away tell she to come back next week I would absolutely tell she or anyone else if I think their presence in my office be inappropriate I need time to prepare for a session with both you and your father so it be not even about I at all you be so full of it what I suddenly understand what your mother must feel what be that suppose to mean you be easy on your father he disappear for month then barge in unannounced want to break into your therapy he invade your private space but still you defend he he be always the king well you do not have to worry because he be never come back here again so you can have your crown back okay let us say he do come back he will not but let us say we be able to get he here would you want that yes why because it be important to he be not that obvious to he or to you do not you have kid you know I do well do not you ever do thing just to make they happy that be a very different situation not really he be the parent not you so what you do not see the difference do not patronize I I be not patronize you these be your session not his one of the reason even adult go into therapy be to separate who they be from what other people want they to be do you analyze your daughter too no I try not to why not because it be just not a good idea it be not possible to treat one 's own child why parent play a big role in the development of the child 's personality so as a doctor it would be very hard for I to keep my role as a father separate from the therapy because you be part of the problem correct I could not even tell he about my accident that be so fuck up Shit let he in let us just do this I want to talk to he be you sure I need you to listen to I come on in please oh you 've decide it be okay dad be not a leper would you care to sit down all right you say I do not raise you and that I be not there for you so while I be outside I make a list every morning from the time you be six until you be 10 I would get up with you at 5 00 get you dress and take you to practice and I would wait outside of practice until you be do so I could take you to school and then I would stay up with you so you could do your homework because you would fall asleep if I do not except that I suck at math so I get evening tutoring lesson three night a week and when you when you could not sleep I would hold you and dance with you until you would go to sleep and when you got injure I sit with you in the hospital day and night enough dad it be okay just do not tell I I do not raise you do you have any idea how much it kill I when I do not hear from you for two week I can not eat I can not sleep God look my hand be shake you do not see I for almost 3 year it do not seem to matter so much then what be you talk about when you move to New York with that woman what do that have to do with anything we speak on the phone every day it be not the same thing I know everything that be go on with you no you do not well it be two year not three two and a half look kiddo you know that I want you live with we it never happen which be why I leave after two and a half year we never go a day without speak I be still part of your life you know nothing about I now why do you keep say that what have not you tell I you know how depressed mom be you know it suck be at home I want to come live with you and I want that too apparently not badly enough I leave she after two and a half year I leave she Sophie I love she and I leave she for you and if she change her mind and let you come live with we I would go back to she in an instant to the woman who would not take your daughter in right sometimes grownup thing be just hard to explain Grownup thing Grownup thing you 've get to be kid I just go leave I do not want you here anymore you think you can walk in and out of my life like I be some sort of fucking train station what be you talk about be this what he tell you be this what your mother tell you

you well than I do he do he do really but you be not the father be you one day a week for a few week it be not really the same thing as the first seven year be it doctor no it be not and what do you have to say to this or be this just your voice come through her mouth I 've be listen to Sophie for quite a while now and what I hear from she be a great anger and resentment but I also hear from she the need for you to reclaim your relationship and to fight for it I never stop love you what be the difference you be not there you choose she I do not plan it that way if I could do it over again you can not I know but if I could you can not you can not do anything over again you can not say you be sorry and make it well you can not make somebody trust you if they do not you can not put a family back together it do not work like that that be grownup do you know I try to kill myself what when I do not have an accident I ride my bike into a car on purpose I get tired of be alive oh God kiddo I want you to leave now okay please Sophie please I want to stay please let I stay please it be my therapy mine Jesus I kick my father out but you know what this be a great insight that you have that you have the power to let your parent into your life when you want they and to keep they out when you do not want they I think it be a sign of maturity I will probably never see he again I think you

well thank you you know I be actually go to miss this office I like the feel of it I like the clutter really what do you mean you be go to miss it it be our last session we be get a divorce for real this time I be sorry to hear that it be because of you actually well not really you it be because of therapy Therapy do we good would you agree with that Amy Sure if by good he mean it be a disaster Transcript swsub com Sync by anyone michvanilly salomon you ever be through a divorce Paul no I have not it be not for sissy even when you want it more than anything it turn into this spiral of uncertainty and pain and you bury a part of yourself maybe we should begin with just recap the last week how be it be we barely see each other all week that be Jake 's idea he want to see how it would feel and it feel okay well than I expect Amy Sure my week be light and breezy would you mind talk about it yes I do mind talk about it because every time I come here I tell you about my week you find a way to make I feel miserable to make my childhood seem like a nightmare to make my marriage look like a sham so sorry forgive I but I be actually through talk about my week come on it be not what happen here maybe not for you we come in miserable we could not talk to each other all we could do be fuck you know fuck and fight and now I I do not know I be feel what what Paul say he be see what we do to each other how we bring out the bad in each other I can not speak for you but I I be feel well this week well than I 've feel in a long time why can not you speak for I because we have not see each other all week whose idea be that we both agree that no I do not I think you say it be a good idea I be try to be accommodate and wait you can not speak for I there be a time when you would 've speak for I in a heartbeat a time when you know every thought in my head I want it to be true but it never be and how would you know that it be my head do you know I hear you play this week what be you talk about where at Elliot 's house on Friday night you be at Elliot 's when well not exactly I be on Elliot 's street I could hear you play from my car you be actually quite good that be insane this be Friday night where be Lenny Home with a sitter I be go to surprise you I be go to ring the doorbell and come inside and say actually I be hope I would not have to say anything that you would just grab I before I get to that part you never come in no why not because of Paul because of everything that we 've say to each other here because I could not remember how we use to make up before we come to Paul we use to have sex that be how we use to make up I be so sorry I ever suggest come here I just wish we have never do it Amy you say that you see our work here as be a failure why do you think that because it be be come to you for month and it be only get bad between we Jake how do you see the therapy do you see it as a success I think it be a little bit more complicated than that in what way I be just I do not know I think I be get it more now why we can not control our dynamic why we trigger each other 's bad instinct and I do not know it feel good to I I mean it feel awful of course but it feel good that it be make more sense you know like it be not I it be not her it be we it seem to I it be finally clear that you both have radically different idea of what a relationship fundamentally be Amy you think thing be fall apart yet the bad be go to come Jake you see thing as come together that the future be bright than the past you be evaluate our entire being base on the way that we behave at the moment we be get divorce that be ridiculous there be a theory that say the way a person handle one thing be the way they handle everything and I guess what I be try to do be take into account the whole history of your relationship I do remember Amy that it be sex that first attract you to each other and your first encounter you describe as messy but really really powerful and then you get pregnant which you have not plan and then you got marry by then you would begin to fall into the pattern of provoke each other Amy you mention how depressed you be when Lenny be bear do you remember that do you remember why I feel like the world be a terrible place and it be wrong to bring a child into it and what about you Jake what do you remember feel when Lenny be bear I feel pure unadulterate relation I still do not understand I be a pessimist and he be an optimist and opposite attract and that happen all the time so why can not we fix this why do not this relationship work you know I think that what we 've try to do here in these session be to illuminate the pattern of behavior that have keep the two of you kind of coil around each other the cycle that you 've embrace the way you 've hide behind they so you can not really act out these pattern anymore because everything be now out in the open now they be in the conscious mind the two of you be in a way emotionally naked before each other I remember when it all start after Lenny be bear I just sort of lose it there be night I would sit there hold he watch television just cry and then of course he would start to cry Jake would come home from work and take Lenny and take he into another room I mean I come out of it eventually but Jake do not look at I the same way again that be not exactly what happen it be when I got depress it be like you take it personally or something you act as if I would betray you you have when I meet you you seem like this person who be unhappy in a relationship so I think take the woman out of the relationship and you will take away her pain but I get you out of the relationship and you be still unhappy and then we have a kid a beautiful kid and you be still unhappy so I feel like I have be trick sorry I be not try to trick you I be sorry too you do not have anything to be sorry about no I do I be sorry I really have screw a lot of thing up and I be really sorry that I get angry I know you be have a hard time and I should not have do that I do not know I just I get scared we both do I be go to miss our family this be what I see in front of I two people who have really love each other deeply and even though you be not bring each other happiness right now the truth be you 've get to this place together and though you be look at it from different perspective it be the same place and I guess what I be ask you to do be to think about not turn away even at this difficult time when you be contemplate the notion of separation you can still draw strength from from each other what be you say you think we should not get divorce Couples therapy either help people heal or it show they how they can separate the therapist 's job in the end I suppose be to let the couple decide but we 've be come here for week we 've tell you so much you must have an opinion all I can say be that you be a unique couple I know couple who use less energy to make love than you two use in casual conversation and passion like that be a rare commodity but passion itself be not enough to sustain a relationship for a lifetime what be what be enough to keep two people together for a lifetime I wish I know the answer to that I be so worried about Lenny yeah he be go to have a whole different life so you be go to share custody then I assume we would joint custody you understand what that mean it mean he move back and forth right yes but I think it be a little bit more specific than that but you know what this be not my area of expertise you both need to sit down and discuss this in detail with a lawyer Jesus we can barely get he to school on time as it be between the two of we Amy 's work as much as she do so I guess what I should take he during the week actually I be not work anymore what do you quit what happen I sleep with my boss and he have a wife he do not want I around anymore so you be fire that fucking asshole I be relieve actually we 've get a bit of a cushion with the severance package so and I get a producer who be still really interested in a few song of mine I think it might be helpful to talk through some of the more complicated question that arise as a result for example have you think about where you be go to live I be think of get a place in the city I know a guy he be a friend of Elliot he be get a loft it be rough but it be cheap there be enough space for I Lenny and maybe a little recording studio be it safe sure be there a doorman I just tell you it be cheap I do not want he stay in a bad place what do you want I to do stay in the house build a little wall through the bedroom I think about move away start over in another place but I want he to be close to you it will be fine it will be good for he to get out of the suburb anyway and you know I be not go to let anything bad happen to he if bad come to bad you could always get your parent to help out with Lenny I would live on the street before I ever ask my parent for help have you tell they about this about we what have they say my dad cry really no but I think he want to I could tell probably invite you for Christmas tell you to bring a date we will figure this custody thing out People do it every year right have either of you talk to Lenny about what be be go on between you not really but he know kid pick up on everything they certainly do he think we be crazy I can tell he be only 9 but he already realize he be get crazy parent he be not entirely wrong there be he remember that time we try to teach he where baby come from Amy have get he this book call where do I come from it be one of those cartoon book that they write to teach kid about sex it be a pretty good book except except that it leave out this really significant part that sex be pleasurable which Amy feel like Lenny really need to know they make it sound like sex be something adult do 'cause they have to like brush your tooth I be read the book and Amy keep interrupting try to explain to he what sex feel like use these ridiculous metaphor to describe how sex feel for a woman it be my only frame of reference Meanwhile Jake keep correct I with contradictory metaphor from the male perspective say it be like hit a home run naked inside of someone else and this poor kid be just look at we just more and more confused until finally he just get up and walk away just walk right out the door shake his head like a little old man yeah he will be okay my father use to say there be no great distance than the space between two head we be over be not we damn it oh God we should get go Lenny 's piano lesson be go to be over pretty soon sorry and I need to go I can not be here any long we be go to talk to he now no later when I do not know ok I think you will find the right time we be go to be late let us go you wanna stay and talk to Paul for a few more minute and I can go pick Lenny up myself no I want this to be hard for you it be hard for I no it be not you can not wait to get out of here no I be just do with this room okay I wanna go to a bar get drunk and cry like a baby I wanna feel all those thing I just do not want to do it here ok come on Ame who be that my next patient Let us go Amy Jake previously on in Treatment you 've be fight I for two month say Laura Laura Laura and you 've be wait for this imaginary Gina of

you be you over I no I be not but I do not wanna be happy in the moment anymore I want it to last I do not wanna be the fantasy that the cure to a marriage that run out of steam or a job that become routine it be it be just too much pressure maybe you be afraid that I know this be what you thrive on all this back and forth stuff but let us not talk what happen if you just do not talk you do not really want this Paul do you I do what be the matter sorry for I be sorry for barge in like this no no come in be you sure oh sure come in what happen I see Laura today I 've be try to reach she since

what happen she do not believe I anyway we we end up in the bedroom wait she say she do not believe you and you end up in the bedroom anyway I I do not do anything I could not you could not you mean you could not respond I have a fucking a fucking anxiety attack like a teenage kid a fucking anxiety attack Unbelievable what be that like like I be suffocate heart pound drench in sweat it be that classic textbook panic attack do you talk to she about it what be happen to you it be sex Gina it be not it be not like it be a session I get out of there as fast as I could but it be too late by the time it take for I to make up my mind about both of we she would change hers she change her mind but you be the one that run out no she say she do not want it anymore I be confused about just take a breath and start at the beginning yeah you know what it do not matter anyway it be not like we be go to be together I could not I could not even bring myself to to touch she she be this close to I I could feel the heat from her body you know how many time I think about that Gina how many time I 've imagine that next thing I know I be double over the hood of my car gasp for air what the fuck be wrong with I Gina nothing 's wrong with you you see this as a betrayal as though you sabotage yourself I do not see it that way of course not for you it be good news you 've be tell I for the last 2 month what a horrible mistake I be make ruin my life you should be ready to open a bottle of champagne the last time we meet I say this have to be your decision when it come down to it in the end it do not have anything to do with moral question or integrity or my marriage or you what be it then I have this feeling that I be go to be swallow swallow up by all of it and that I be go to lose Control Anyways I run out the door I think of you all the time that I say that you be a coward well who be the coward now you know Paul that anxiety attack be yours it be not external it be you what restrain you be the very good of you your deep standard personal and professional and moral moral decision do not come from the unconscious I be not go to let myself off the hook that easily you steer yourself away from do something that you know you would regret you save yourself from be hurt and from hurt a woman that you care about what do you think that moral decision be always make in the absence of temptation that they be make easily that they be make gracefully give yourself some credit if you be able to make this decision easily it would have be a sign that you do not want she that badly but you do you want she so very badly so badly that you have an anxiety attack in order to stop yourself so in the end you win you prevail well thank you for try to console I Gina I be not console you I just want you to take the credit and the responsibility for what you do you know what she say she say that she be come to understand that what she be be do use sexual relationship to free herself from emotional entanglement that she do not want to do that anymore it be ironic her therapy with you have be a success she say hat what I be do be that I be use she to bail myself out of my own life that actually I be have a midlife crisis Hilarious description that be your theory be not it no but that do not matter now it do not matter you know what matter be that you do the right thing for you and for your patient she could be the last love of my life and I let she go what be leave for I now Gina we will have to talk about that he know that Kate be in Italy with another man he throw it at my face how dare you it be completly over if that matter at all be I the first patient to be in love with you Paul you all right I do not think I can do this do what just do not think it be lead anywhere where do you want it to lead Alex some place sane I miss fly we need to discuss in a little great detail your end therapy I be finish today tell them I be ready let us just talk about

confused it be be over a year have something happen I get the report back from the navy there be no sign of a mechanical malfunction I do not know that but you know my son be not ready to fly you know and you do nothing to stop he now he be go you still practice would you like to come inside be this your new office where you help people like you do alex I would I would never go in there Mr Prince Alex 's death be a tragedy I can not even begin to imagine what you 've I do not want you to imagine it man I want you live it I understand your rage you understand nothing you want to understand something doctor maybe you will understand this what be this a lawsuit against you I tell they I would serve the summon myself can we talk about this please be that go to bring he back no obviously it be not go to bring he back well you know that be what kill Alex in the first place talk with you I do not kill your son Mr Prince tell that to his son I be sorry that be not good enough you be go to pay I want you to pay Mr Weston this way please thank you Paul it be be a while how be you I be I be fine it be Mia be not it I be not sure you would remember of course I remember I be sure I 've change well actually I have an appointment with a Mr Ellis I know unfortunately he be stick down in d C he send his apology I be cover well then maybe I should wait for he to come back oh you can but he might be a while and I 've already look at your file but still give our history God please Paul the first hearing be in eight week I think it be in your good interest to get start eight week be that enough time well exactly look you be here let us just do the first consultation I will ask some question you will ask some question and that be it Mr Ellis can see you next time if you would like okay Great well a beautiful view yeah all the trapping right have a seat I 've handle a lot of malpractice case Malpractice I can imagine how difficult this must be for you no I be fine really Malpractice how do we how do we begin we will start with some personal information just to verify be that okay sure sure you be 53 you look great thank you man be lucky like that God it be annoying you have a B A and an M S from Columbia university and a phd from the New School that be impressive thank you and then after your new york internship you just pick up and move no that be a few year later I actually go to the Baltimore institute right in the summer of ' 88 right before I start law school and now you live and work in Brooklyn Welcome back thank you well I just actually get back last summer I see and you be recently divorce do it say that in my file from your insurance company it be the first year you 've circle the d on the form then I guess I be d vorce and three child yes be they with you all right so I assume you understand the basic of the lawsuit you know to be quite honest I do not really understand any of it okay let us start from the top you be be sue by your ex patient 's estate they claim that you should have understand that Mr Prince be not ready to fly and you should have alert the navy to his condition they be sue you for 20 million fucking hell only 3 million of which be cover by your insurer would you like some water please or maybe something strong what it be a joke it be just a bad joke sorry I be not at my most jovial well who would be in my personal opinion this lawsuit be without merit but we live in a litigious society so this this first hearing it could just get throw out it could and it should but the threshold to allow a case to go to trial be subjective there be the law and then there be the judge you draw but you 've be through a divorce so you must know that yeah but the law be still the law be not it yes but your patient be a young man a father a war hero yeah well to be absolutely honest I do not think that he would see himself as a war hero either way a home town judge may want to give his family their day in court but I think you say it would not go to trial it souldn't but if it do jury can let emotion get in the way of the fact especially when it come to suicide case what do you mean suicide be you tell I that you think Alex kill himself that be not what I be say but his attorney claim at he do and they be out there right now depose everyone he know and they will find people who will say that he seem depressed and not himself and the navy report well of course the navy be go to absolve themselves of course they be that be not really a big surprise well we will be make that point if it get that far by then it become a contest of expert we will find people to testify that you uphold the standard of care right and they will pay people to say I do not I just do not understand how this can be happen the point be these thing do happen and that be why firm like our exist your insurance company choose this firm for a reason do you follow the Bolinger case the surgeon who operatedon the wrong side of somebody 's brain I mean that guy be completely incompetent the fact be against we but I be head counsel and we win so what you be say be that the insurance company choose you because they think I be guilty and you get guilty people off be that it no that be not what I mean my point be I 've handle dozen of negligence case many of which seem far bad than this one I be confident that we can help you I say no call Henry it be Mr Nesky Dad I be in the middle of a meeting be you okay I be so glad and it fit I know mom hate green but I love you in it okay I have to go I love you Bye no more call I be sorry my father it be okay since he sell the candy store he have some free time a lot of free time he must be very proud of you I 've come a long way from the Pulaski bridge anyway let us keep go your session note you have not send those in yet we be go to need those right away I do not have any note really I do not take note that could be a bit of a problem what do you mean a problem lot of therapist do not take note I mean I start a session I be in it I know everything there be to be know about the patient I do not nee dto write it down okay well maybe because of situation like this you should Process note may not be therapeutically important but legally so what be you say a bad therapist who take note be well than a good one who do not take note be that I be not say that at all be I some kind of criminal because I never take note I would not say never Paul I be pretty sure you take they with I can we take a break I will just be a minute Dad no I be good sorry my father do not quite understand the concept of she be in a meeting those be not mine the child in case you be wonder they be beautiful kid my niece never marry it be funny a lot of woman lawyer be like shrink they do not put out personal photo but since they be not my kid I figure let us keep go where be we I think that you be remind I that I take note when I be your therapist you have not be my therapist in 20 year I should not have bring it up I do not mean to make you uncomfortable I be kind of uncomfortable anyway everyone who come in here under these circumstance be let us get back to solve this you do not take note do you consult with any colleague about Mr Prince 's treatment well yes actually I have weekly session last year with what we call a supervisor Great what be his or her name Gina Toll Dr Gina Toll that be a relief be she in Maryland okay great we will have to get a deposition from her be that absolutely necessary we need to affirm that you do all you could for Mr Prince well I do not I do not know if she will do it why not well because our relationship have be a little strained at time over this do you think she might believe you be in some way culpable I I I honestly do not know what what she might think be that a yes I honestly do not know look in the first place Alex be not in treatment that long why not he the process of separation be quite quite complex do you refer he to someone else how do it end I do not see what difference that make oh it can make a lot of difference why do the treatment end so quickely what do you mean by quickly before the patient be well it be his choise to leave why what happen in that last session he say that that he be ready to fly and he tell I not to screw up his life and you let he go yes I let he go his attorney be go to claim that he be not psychologically fit suicide often seem well before they kill themselves Upbeat and determine once they have a plan in place because sometimes when people be actually do well they seem upbeat and put plan into place so which be it with Alex I do not know I be still try to figure that out look my patient die I be human I have doubt do you want to talk about they no Mia I do not want to talk about they this be it be kafkaesque Paul we be in a battle here it be not like therapy where you use to tell I to look for the grey not now the law be win or lose there be not subtext here actually I think there be quite a bit of subtext here I do not follow you you ask I if Alex 's treatment be too quick you ask I if I end his therapy before he be well that be just due diligence but it could also be that the wire be get a little bit cross it seem to I that you be express some of the feeling that maybe Bennett I be in a meeting yes I know apology I want to meet Dr Weston I be Bennett Ryan managing partner pleased to meet you I just want to apologize on behalf of Mr Ellis but I want you to know I be thrilled when Miss Netsky grab the case you be in good hand but you know that I understand you two go back a way thank you Bennett and if there be anything you need please do not hesitate to call thank you Mia yes I have to rain check our meeting sorry no problem it be not what you think what do I think he should not have walk in here like that it be fine actually it be not fine I be the head litigator he be the manage partner there be a lot of subtext behind that performance there be it be ok you do not have to worry about it you know Mia I think we should stop now when Mr Ellis come back what be you say I just do not think that we should work together that be funny have not we be here before how do you mean I be 22 deal with a crisis and you just disappear that be what you remember no that be what happen you be there one week and go the next obviously I be not a perfect therapist but if you do feel abandon I appologize do not give I that I be sorry if you feel bullshit I felt abandon because you abandon I I be sure that we talk about that in our session do we then how come that last day I sit there on your couch devastate I be move with my family to Maryland I could not leave you tell I I have to I give you a gift that day do you remember I be not exactly it be no yeah I never hear from you after I leave it be not usual for therapist to keep in touch with patient when they some do if the patient mean something Mia of course you mean you know what forget it this be stupid we can stop here let us stop here it be my turn I be throw you out Mia Bennett say that you grab my case when Ellis got detain I be just curious why you think you do that I do not know it do not matter the last time I see you you be just a kid I remember you be worried that you would not make it through your first semester of law school but now look at you look at where you be where be I you be the head litigator a wall full of clipping I think that that you want I to see that to see that you be now a success I be a success why because I work in a tall building or because I wear a Prada suit or because I summer in the Hamptons and go to all the gala opening at the fucking Met yes I make it through law school all the way to the top floor with the beautiful view and the window that do not open and the fucking jackhammer that never stop and you know what I do when I win a case one of those hopeless one that only I would take I go out and I get drunk with

and urban planning it be a three Year program I be in my 2nd year my parent be both alive and still married to each other I have a brother Daniel he be a year and a half young we be pretty close I be single recently very recently we be together since the first week at Pratt so be be that what you 've come to talk about my breakup I wish no my breakup be really fine totally amicable Kyle be really incredibly civil about the whole thing we be still good friend and his new girlfriend 's just delightful and her father own five building on Park Avenue so that be nice I be sorry I be really bad at talk about myself you be go to have to ask I question or something be you that kind of shrink I can be I find your name online Pratt listserv I want somebody close to school who actually take my health plan nobody have comment on your page there be a space where patient can recommend or not recommend your be empty that be probably 'cause I 've just recently move to the area I assume it be a new practice I think you would be young would you prefer a young therapist no actually you seem great How 's business Hard why would you move I be sorry well I just can not help but notice that this be the third time that you have that you 've apologize to I I be not really sorry I be just be polite ok I just want you to know that you do not have to apologize for anything in here anything that you say you can not you can not offend I I can not well of course you can but I can take it what I mean be you do not have to censor yourself to spare my feeling so be this your first time meeting with a psychologist no I see somebody at school they give you 9 week for free over the course of the school year so nine week that be that be not long it would 've be plenty if she have not be such a fucking idiot first of all Jennifer be barely old than I one of those girl who you could just tell she become a therapist because she do not know what else to do with her life like she wake up one morning and think I look like I be a good listener and I have nothing really to say I know I will be a therapist no offense that be fine that be fine she be just wait for some rich doctor in a bad marriage to crawl into her office and fall in love with she so she could give up the whole charade I could just tell wen I be sit there in front of she she be think this girl be a complete waste of time and what tell you that I do not know it be just this feeling I have this polite glaze in her eye also she tell I the same story twice which be pretty dishearten in the same session no two different session so you go to see she again yeah I figure I owe it to her how do you mean that you owe it to her she be a nice person she be try so what be the story the one that she tell you twice it be not significant I mean it be not even a story it be more of a joke you probably know it maybe not try I it be the one about the hick who come to New York and everyone 's move really fast nobody give he the time of day Taxis cut he off People try to pick his pocket and all he want to do be get to the museum of Natural History to see the dinosaur but he can not find it you know he he can not find it he be walk in circle so finally he walk right into the middle of Times Square tap a cop on the shoulder and say excuse I officer can you tell I how to get to the Natural History museum or should I just go fuck myself I 've hear it yeah it be a it be a classic well she tell it to I twice and it be not funny the first time when I do not go back she call I like 87 time I be like take a hint lady do you think it be possible she do not know that you have choose to stop therapy how many phone call do a person need to ignore before you realize they do not want to talk to you so you never speak to she again after you decide not to continue therapy I do not have anything to say to her I just do not want to come back to therapy I just wonder why you feel that you could not just just tell she I do not want to hurt her feeling the okay first of all the woman be borderline stalk I I 've have friend who 've go to therapy at school and and if you quit they be suppose to call you once send you a letter and that be it Jennifer be way over the line Second of all she be an idiot and third of all do you know she or something no I do not think so why because you seem really invest in my relationship with she and the whole reason I come to you be because I do not think that you know anybody that I know well I be try to understand what you be try to tell I when you tell I this story dude back up I be not try to tell you anything you be the one who bring she up can I ask you if if anything else happen in those session that might have disturb you oh my god I just tell you the woman have oatmeal between her ear she barely notice I I mention that my brother be autistic that he take up a lot of my mother 's time and she be like that must 've be hard for you do you think you be angry at your brother and I be like I love my brother but I could throw you off a bridge right now bitch I do not understand you people I think I could come here and you know somebody might actually listen to I and instead all you want to do be waste my time talk about my first shrink and what a fucking disaster she be I do not think we 've be waste our time of course you do not all right look it may seem to you like I be a bit slow on the uptake but I really have be listen and I think I know a little bit more now about what be important to you you 've tell I not to tell you thing twice not to feed you platitude not to waste your time you 've tell I that you be fiercely loyal to your family and if I fail to engage you you will disappear on I even if I call you 87 time it be not really 87 time so so what have you come here to talk about how many people come to you with like a really big problem like what I do not know a death a rape I do not know anything that you tell I I can handle I be not rape do not worry I be try to tell you I just I can not get the word out of my mouth can I write it down of course how do you feel tired what type of cancer be it you know what I I do not really want to talk about it I just want to tell someone I have so much other shit on my mind right now this project be due in two week I have so much draft to do not to mention the model which I have not even start I be so fuck be you sleep not really no I wake up in these cold sweat they be pretty awful the whole bed be soak Night sweat be apparently a very common symptom of lymphoma and other thing you never want to know so how long have you know five week and how do you find out I have a cough it be totally minor but it would not go away and it be embarrassing to be sit in class cough all the time so I go to the health center and they give I antibiotic but they do not help which be not really a surprise because the health center be total shit we have this joke that you could go in there bleed profusely from your head and if you be a woman they will give you a pregnancy test so you know I figure I would suck it up and whenever I finally talk to my dad he would tell I what to do be he a doctor in the army he be suppose to be retire but now he be work with the v A and they be so understaffed it be impossible to get he on the phone anyway where be I you be talk about your cough right so I could not reach my dad and then I start have these awful night sweat so I go back to the center and guess what they do what accuse I of take diet pill or cocaine the doctor could not agree on what control substance abuse I be keep from they so that be awesome finally someone have the bright idea to send I to Brooklyn Hospital to get a chest x ray and then well the rest be history I have a big mass behind my spine do not ever get a bone marrow biopsy okay just tell they to find another way they do it in front of 10 medical student and they be all flirt with each other as if you be not even in the room you know as if you be already dead and it be an autopsy it sound horrible primary mediastinal large b cell non Hodgkins lymphoma you 've meet you 've meet with an oncologist yeah the same day I be diagnose be you alone you do not want anybody to go with you like who a friend or parent hell no how do your mom and dad react when you tell they that you be sick I have not tell they so who have you tell you I Anybody else a construction worker one of my big pet peeve be when I be walk down the street and some asshole at a building site tell I to smile you know like smile sweetheart it be not that bad so you know I 've always want to say something back that would really shut those guy up so the other morning I be walk to school and this guy yell out hey doll face smile will you it be a beautiful morning and I shout back I have cancer it be awesome not really so the only people that you 've tell about this be this construction worker and I I want to talk to someone who be objective someone who do not care what happen to I you care I be sure because you be a human being but you will not like get hysterical if I tell you that I do not know that maybe I do not want to get treatment you know like if I tell you maybe I want to die right now right here on your couch you be not go to I do not know jump out the window right I just need to think about all this for a moment maybe see an herbalist an acupuncturist or something figure out what my option be before I start tell everyone and manage the hysteria who would become hysterical if you tell they your mother your father and your brother Daniel do not get hysterical Violent but not hysterical Violent against whom what no nobody himself do not worry about it you seem to I to be really independent and I can imagine that the idea of accept treatment put yourself in somebody else 's hand I can imagine that that would be kind of scary I just tell you I want to explore my option Meditation yoga these be good Stress Relievers but they be not go to stop the progress of this disease not accord to western medicine do you come to I look for somebody to tell you that it be okay not to get treatment do do you smoke what socially a bit this be not lung cancer there be an old adage a say that the reason that smoker do not believe a cigarette can kill they be because a cigarette have never kill they before I do not understand I be wonder if you really believe that you have cancer I know I have cancer yes but do you believe what you know what else do the oncologist tell you she say that I be at stage three and I should start chemo immediately do you trust her no why not I just do not like she could that possibly be because she be tell you that you do have cancer I just tell you I want to look into alternative medicine maybe a homeopath do you see any pattern between go to different therapist and go to different doctor do you tell the other therapist about your disease why not because I could tell she be not really interested in I and how could you tell that she tell I the same story twice you know I 've be think about that story the man who need assistance he refuse to ask and refuse to ask and then when he finally have no other choice he go up to the cop but instead of ask for help he assume the cop be go to insult he so he insult himself before the cop have a chance to say a word I think it be really the story of a man who be undergo an intense internal conflict a man who have a hard time trust other people it be just a joke but I be just wonder if she tell it twice for a reason April be it possible do you think that she really be listen to you she be a moron that might be true but she may have be try to tell you that it be okay to rely on other people that it be okay to ask for help this be ridiculous everybody at some point in their life need help and I think that you need help now you have not hear a word I 've say I think you need to have a conversation that take place outside your own head I think that you need to talk to your oncologist I think you need to tell she that you be consider alternative therapy I think you need to ask she how she think you should proceed and you do need to tell your parent just stop it you be at stage three stop it stop it stop it how dare you tell I what to do you do not know I what do you formulate your little theory as soon as I walk in young girl cancer this be an easy one you have no idea what I be capable of you be right I do not would you like to tell I you know I I have to go our time 's up April I be sorry that you feel I be tell you what to do before I 've get to know you but but I do think that we should schedule another session let I think about it how be friday Friday afternoon you know I actually I do not have my schedule this week I will call you when I get back to the dorm when do you think that will be I do not know this time be very crucial so I hear so what about the session I will call you okay thank you do we have to wait for my mom to get back from the deli yeah we also too wait for your dad my dad might not make it on time this be a really crazy week for he at his job do he work a lot I guess so what be we suppose to do until they both get here we could play game if you want I 've get a bunch of game back here if you want to if you want to take a look there might be there might be something here that do you like any of these do you have any card Cards okay maybe I should have somewhere in this mess here we go so what kind of what kind of game would you like to play Hearts war crazy eight black jack I will deal whichever one of we get to 21 without go over win the hand if you stick on anything below 15 you fuck the deck be I allow to say that here sure you can tell anything you like okay I think I be go to stick but you can stick on 15 you kind of suck at this game do not you I do I do not understand the rule I hope that do not piss you off I be not piss off it be just if you do not know the rule why play you be just waste your time here I guess it be a good point you be right I have a question why be I here nobody be explain it to you my mom say we be come here so I will fall well my dad say we be come here because we have to I will tell you what I know you know that you be mom and dad be in the process of get a divorce no they be not so nobody explain this to you my parent be get a divorce my dad be just not live in home right now that be that be true but you know that they be separate but that do not mean that they be get a divorce can I can I ask you what your mom and dad have tell you my dad move out so how do you feel about that what be that like for you T 's a pain and it be annoying do you miss your dad I still get to see he it be just annoying well there must be a great deal about this situation that you find annoying you still have not tell I why I be here you be here because your mom and dad be separate now and they want to make sure that they both see you but I 've be tell that the last month or so that you 've be refuse to stay at your dad 's place so the reason we be all meet here today be so that we can find an answer a solution do I explain that properly do it make sense okay good maybe you can explain something to I why do not you want to stay at your dad 's place I do not like his apartment okay what do you not like about it it be on the upper east side and what be wrong with that have you be to the upper east side well what what specifically do you not like about the neighborhood my real home be here in brooklyn and my house be pretty close to my school it take I about five minute to walk there but at his place I have to get up an hour early to ride the 4 train so then what you be say be that your dad 's apartment be it be inconvenient yes and plus he never have any food no food at all okay maybe protein shake mustard and advil but when he work late he leave money on the counter there be this fancy grocery store downstairs but all they really have be jar of weird olive so I get a candy bar or I call empire szechuan and get some spare rib you do all this shopping by yourself that be a big job it be the main reason I do not like stay there any other reason you do not like stay there it be hard for I to go to sleep can not sleep at night there no not normally it be just when my dad 's friend come over and what happen then they hog the wii and stay up really late wait what do that mean they they what the wii the wii it be a video game system my dad get it for I for my birthday he say if I be go to spend all my time play video game I might as well be move but when his friend come over they play guitar hero over and over my mom say it be embarrass all these 30 year old man play with toy so your mom be not happy with what go on at your dad 's house do she say that to you yeah she do not think it be a good the type of environment I should be in on school night she want I to eat a good dinner finish all my homework nd go to bed on time so I do good in school do not you do not you want that too I guess so it be my job so just to sum up so far your dad 's apartment be too far away there be not enough food there and you find it very difficult to sleep at night time when his friend be over be there anything else be not that enough I just want to make sure that I have not leave anything out why you can not do anything about it maybe together we can for instance we can tell your dad it be hard to sleep when his friend come over on school night and if we tell he that you do not have enough to eat maybe he could go shop for you if we you and I talk to he together it will be easy I think for you to stay with he what do you think I be sorry to interrupt I be just wonder if Oliver 's father have finally show up while I be out not yet bess but Oliver and I be just have a little chat so if you would like to just wait in the waiting room till he get here I be a little worried though because the session 's half over and he have not arrive yet he work in new jersey and he live on the godforsaken upper east side sometimes I think he go out of his way to be inaccessible be that my snack here you go baby I have to make sure Oliver get something healthy to eat he be suppose to stay with his father tonight and I have to be at the new school by 5 30 so sure but actually we be in the middle of a conversation so if you do not mind you can wait in the waiting room until just I guess I have to go now why can not she stay with we Sure I hope it be okay to bring a snack into your office it be just his father never have any food at the house so actually we be just talk about that Oliver tell I it be like a freshman dorm over there I 've send Luke like a million email about it but he never write I back so we be just try to figure out some way that we could maybe address that issue good that would be wonderful because I do want Oliver to feel safe at his father 's house so a lot of thing be definitely go to have to change around there so Oliver you and your mom have discuss this already it be hard enough for he to be away from his own bedroom you know his desk his book and all his stuff you know so you and Oliver be still in the same apartment that you all use to live in as long as we can afford it Luke want to sell but I think there be be enough upheaval already I be so sorry you must be paul it be be a real crazy week but I know that be no excuse please sit down we be just getting start all right be that for I yeah it be swag we have a presentation with the vendor today of course they keep I late but at least you get something out of it right yeah this be what he do he arrive late with apology and gift as if that be go to make up for it hey believe I I want to be here today on time because I want to get here before she have a chance to say too many thing like that everything be a joke with he except it be never really a joke hey put that away this be important all right now that we be all here I think there be there be a few thing that we need to go over together Oliver would you mind wait in the other room for a few minute while I talk to your mom and dad let I help you with that yeah go on go ahead before we do anything else I would like to set some ground rule for ourselves and some goal that be why we be here we do not want our divorce to upset he it be already upset he be not it he be confused yeah and when he be confused he get upset you know one of the thing that I learn from talk to Oliver be that he do not actually know that you two be get a divorce do that surprise you well it be really sad but I have to say it be not shock really why do you say that because she will not ever be straight with the kid he whenever she talk to he about it she make it sound like we be just take a time out I 've be perfectly clear with he Luke be the one who never explain anything he tell Oliver that he be move out while they be watch the Mets on tv Bess while they be watch a Mets game the Mets during a commercial break he do not give he a chance to ask any question come on let us let us not well obviously the divorce be confusing and emotional for both of you but you can imagine how overwhelming it be for Oliver but do he understand now that we be get a divorce do you explain that to he no I do not because I do not believe that it be my job to tell he thing that you both find painful to say to he I think that one of the thing we need to work on be the good way to communicate with he yourself you know it it be hard for I to try to be a father with he when he will not even come over to my apartment okay let us let us talk about that for a moment Oliver tell I that he do not feel that he can eat properly at your place well it be true he be right there be never anything in his refrigerator no but there be money and menu for he to buy whatever he need for dinner I be try to teach the kid to fend for himself he be too young for that so the way you see it Luke be that Oliver be well you be help he become more mature by give he responsibility by choose his own meal when I be his age I be cook dinner for my family every night since Luke 's family neglect he I guess we be suppose to neglect Oliver that it be not neglect when you be try to teach your kid you be not teach he anything you be hand he money and then leave he all alone we can solve the problem of what be in the refrigerator but I think you know I think there be something there be something else go on here when Oliver say there be nothing to eat I know this sound a little strange but it may be his way of say that he be not feel nurture well that be not exactly Luke 's strong suit have you look at the kid he be get way too much of that kind of nurture already it be not just about the food maybe this be his way of say that he miss you both and the home you share together be not that why we be here so he will to get over that I think that one of the way that we can help oliver he be that although he live in two different home it be important that he adhere to the same set of rule for example you want to make sure that Oliver eat well right and you Luke you want to give he the responsibility of take care of himself maybe we can combine both those goal I just think that we be already ask he to grow up too fast maybe there be a way to help he achieve a certain kind of independence I will be happy to help he if I ever get to see he when Oliver come to I and tell I he can not fall asleep at his father 's place I think I have every right to be a little concerned about that so you 've be ask Oliver about what it be like at Luke 's house grill he be more like it of course I have I meet Luke in college and I know how he use to live before we got marry you know the real reason why the kid can not fall asleep at my place be because whenever he use to wake up in the middle of the night she would let he climb into bed with we oh for cry out loud he be still climb into bed with her how inappropriate be that one time one night when have just move out he be feel lonely so I let he sleep in our bed I be just curious Luke how do you find out about this I ask the kid how his mom be do he tell I she practically beg he to sleep in our bed it sound like to I that you be both ask Oliver to inform on each other I think one of the thing that we have to work on be take he out of the crossfire the reason that Oliver can not fall asleep at Luke 's be because Luke invite his friend over to stay up past midnight playing card and get drunk Nobody be get drunk I have not have a drink in two year and she know that what I know be that you be up every night partying like you be back at the frat I be hardly party I be pay for a wife and a kid put they both through school and I would bet he graduate before she do if my memory serve we agree that I would be a stay at home mom so that someone be available for Oliver it be lucky if he ever get home by 9 00 at night you know if the two of you be interested in couple 's therapy I can make a recommendation thank but no thank the only good thing about get a divorce be that we be do with all that okay since we be not here to discuss your relationship it might be a good idea from here on to schedule separate meeting no actually I would rather not I mean I wanna make sure that we be all on the same page and I wanna make sure I be here to hear what she say about I then can we agree that our job be to focus entirely on Oliver be everything okay it be my fault I be sorry it be fine I can deal with it later Oliver why do not you come in and join we I be wonder if there be anything that you want to say now that we be all together well I know I be suppose to stay at my dad 's but it be hard when his friend come over on school night well up until now I think you like hang out with we I do like it it be fun but it be hard for I to go to sleep and finish all my homework all right I 've get it so from now on just you and I on school night Good yeah so Oliver be there anything else that you would like to say to your dad can you go shop for food so I have something to eat after school Sweetie how about this how about we make up a list together a shopping list you can give to your dad and then you two can go shop together I guess so all right all right so anything else you would like to clear up I do not know now look Kiddo it be important to both your mom and I that you feel okay about this that way we can all start move on with our life we will never force you to do anything you be not ready for okay I do not wanna stay at my dad 's house Oliver come I wanna stay at my real house Oliver even though your dad have agree to make some change be you say that you would still be uncomfortable stay at his apartment I do not wanna talk about this anymore she rearrange both our life just for this then throw it all out the minute he pitch a fit Shit Oliver be you be you come or be not you you do not have to do anything you do not wanna do okay oh that be great that be really go to help he grow up thank Bess I wanna apologize for Luke but then I always wanna apologize for Luke I should probably stop do that right maybe we should apologize to Oliver too sometimes adult forget the rule I guess it all continue yeah let us go okay Oliver Bye Goodbye no no no no I will take care of it thank you you be welcome Bye Hey Rosie it be I your dad I have not hear back from you yet and I just want to confirm that you be still come up next week so I be look forward to see you I love you Bye Synchro mpm so Dr Weston yes call I Paul Walter Barnett Nice to meet you I do not miss the elevator do I unfortunately not this way please be there someplace I could hang this I can put it in the waiting room no in here that be the trouble with have nice thing you have to worry about they my wife buy I that coat I never would have buy it myself cashmere English I say Honey what be the matter with wool she say you be a c e o Walt You're a c e o as if that explain everything we should get start how do you begin well why do not you tell I a little bit about yourself what bring you here why do not you tell I what you already know and we will take it from there what I already know I appreciate your discretion but I be thick skin it will not hurt my feeling I be not try to be discreet you really do not know who I be well you be a c e o with a cashmere coat and a wife that be all I know so far and two boy they be on their own launch and a daughter so you never read the business section Natalie she be my young she be a junior in college whenever I visit or visit she be overseas now whenever I visit her college town there be this coffee place bagel muff kid behind the counter with pierced everything and I notice all the student and the professor they all read the art section the sport politic but never the business section they have pristine copy on every table the only news that really matter and they think they be above it and be that what you think I think no that be not what I mean you be in a different line of work so tabula rasa really be there something you would have like I to know about you that be not I in the paper that be my company although lately that girl reporter from the Times have stop make that distinction but no that be good that be good let us leave all that Tommy Rot out of it a separation of Church and State we can do that I would just like to be clear that if you do want to talk about your job whatever you say will be completely confidential be that right that be right can I get that in writing of course no sit it be okay I trust you you should feel honor I have people work for I who 've spend year try to earn my trust I imagine your position require you to be very well guard you be get that from all those article you do not read I just know that you run a company and which lead I to believe that you be in charge of a lot of people who I be sure need all kind of thing from you all the time it be like one constant meeting 15 hour a day and somehow I be the only one with the answer if I ever stop make decision make call the whole thing would grind to a halt well I be sure find the time to come here can not have be easy so what do you want to discuss First off it be not my idea to come here it be not it be Connie 's my wife and what do she want you to talk about Sleep I have not be sleep well lately I think she be get tired of I toss and turn I say Honey it be a big house I can sleep in a separate room like other normal married couple but she like to cuddle so here I be it sound like you 've get a pretty strong relationship with your wife it do you 've mention she twice both time refer to how she take care of you you seem to you seem to appreciate she a great deal well listen do not tell she that what else have you already figure out you say that you be not sleep I would like to hear a little bit more about that first off I can not take pill sleep pill anxiety med I 've be that route already who be your psychopharmacologist be you kid that be all I need now the headline embattle c e o under psychiatric care I go to my internist have he put the prescription in my wife 's name they could not be trace to I what kind of prescription he want to try Xanax Ambien that kind of thing but either they do not work for I or they make I loopy and I can not have that I 've get to be able to wake up anytime and be alert I have 20 000 worker factory and distributor on six continent shareholder you never know when a brick 's go to come fly through your window Uneasy lie the head that wear the crown that be par for the course which be why my doctor suggest that I talk to somebody about what do he call it an underlying anxiety I think you say that come here be your wife 's idea there be the point I be use to stress I be use to crisis Ive be a c e o for nearly 20 year and before that I carry my boss ' water which be bad and before that I be in Vietnam my whole life no matter what they hit I with I 've always be able to sleep anytime anywhere for as long as they let I if I could get in an hour 's nap I be good for the next 24 only an hour that be how I get where I be it be not because I be smart than the other guy it be because I could work twice as hard twice as long Connie use to call I Superman but now I be just lie in bed I be not sleep I be not work when do your insomnia begin what difference do that make it might give I a clear picture of any underlying problem there might be do you read this book Blink Malcolm Gladwell smart guy his thesis be basically that an expert can tell in the blink of an eye what the story be be the painting real or a forgery be the war win or lose Sure I know the book but I think you should know that the kind of therapy that I practice it be not a quick fix it be a process and eventually change happen but it do take time I have to tell you I do not have a lot of time even be here sit across from you talk about my feeling or whatever this be cost I money it be cost my company money it be cost my employee money what I be try to say be you do not have to mollycoddle I you have a lot of experience use it tell I what my problem be and what I need to do if I need to pay extra for more intense session that be fine Walter every patient 's therapy be different it do not we be all unique snowflake but still you know what I be say yes I think I do I think what you be say be this be not a casual matter for you that the stake be pretty high and that before you invest your time in this you want to be sure that I really can help you all right so blink test help I what be go on look I wish I know the answer that quickly in the first place I could charge a lot more for my time the truth be if we be go to find a clear picture of what be go on with your sleep problem we be go to have to dig a little deep we be go to have to do a little bit more work what be go on be I need to be at the top of my game right now and I can not get there if I be not sleep I do not know how much clear a picture of the problem I can give you when you come in you mention something about some article that be in the business section of the newspaper Hatchet job you mean we have to recall certain product strictly for precaution but you know the press they want to spin a scandal out of it and when do these article start to appear can you remember it be no big deal some employee with an axe to grind be feed nonsense to some reporter who do not know she be be use it be not something I would lose sleep over you do also tell I that until recently you 've never lose sleep over anything I guess what I be try to find out be when you think that change it be funny I just can not remember it must have be gradual you know you look in the mirror one morning and say when do my hair turn white or you get an email from your daughter halfway around the world and you think when do my baby grow up your daughter Natalie right you say she be spend her junior year abroad not like that my boy spend their junior year abroad too one drink beer in Munich and the other drinking Chianti in Tuscany she be nothing like they sometimes my wife and I will look at she and we will say to each other where do you think she come from she be not even suppose to be here the boy be already in high school when Connie tell I she be pregnant I think you can not be serious I do not have time for this but Natalie want to be here she be in a rush premature walk early talk early so bright so happy she come a great distance to give we all something to believe in you sound incredibly proud of her I be and now she be halfway around the world some clinic in Rwanda my wife do not want she to go she want I to say no to talk she out of it but I talk to Natalie and I could see it in her eye this be something she have to do so I let she go it might have be a mistake but I let she go when do she leave October and when do your insomnia begin I tell you I do not know you think that be my underlie anxiety no but I can imagine if I have a daughter live in Rwanda I think that would keep I up night so that be your blink test Natalie I be not so sure that it be that one on one why not I just think that thing may be a little bit more complicated than that you sure you be not just try to get I in here for more session if people could treat themselves and diagnose themselves there would not be any need for any kind of drug or for therapist like I so what be we suppose to do doc I be not exactly sure to tell you the truth I do think that you be suffer from some king of an anxiety and the only way I know to alleviate your symptom be to figure out what be cause that anxiety and the only way I know how to do that be to be to talk I talk to people all day long it do not help I sleep sometimes I think if I could just get away somewhere the country or maybe a lake just a funny thought would you care to share it with you that be kind of what happen in here I be suppose to tell you everything that pop into my head I just think I will sleep when I be dead and that strike you as funny I wish someone could take care of something without I have to I be sorry you be talk about talk it be not an easy thing develop self awareness some people say that it be a man 's entire life 's work that sound pretty self absorb no offense I be talk about your patient understand not you it be just that I have a thing against people who think the world owe they a favor my take you play the card you deal you do the good you can to do your job to protect your family that in my opinion be a real man 's life 's work it be so quiet in here do not it I be never usually anywhere this quiet except on an airplane that be why I love airplane my favorite place to be be everything okay never just now you talk about how important your job be and how difficult it be for you to be discreet and that you be not even comfortable get certain prescription in your own name be you say I sound paranoid well it make I wonder do you have anybody that you can talk to about the pressure of your business not at work anything I say could be use against I and I do not like to worry Connie and how about your child the boy do not want to hear about my problem they would not understand why do you say that everything come too easily for they they never have to make their own way or fight in a war they just take everything for grant include their old man and Natalie I tell you she be different I will give you an idea of what I be talk about I get an interesting email from she over the weekend to tell you the truth it worry I a little would you mind if I read it to you please I could use your expert opinion Sure hi dad Rwanda be hard I 've never work so hard in my life and understand so little we 've set up a rape clinic in the village of I be not even go to try to pronounce that this woman come in she be desperate they all think we can get they visa because we be american I explain to she

trouble this be obviously a cry for help why do you think that be you tell I that if you receive an email like that from your daughter from some rape clinic in Rwanda you would not be on the first plane to Africa there be a fine line between bravery and stupidity I can not sit here and wait for she to be kidnap and dismember where do you say she be stay I do not she be live in Kigali and the clinic 's somewhere in the countryside Kigali that be the capital be not it what you think that make it safe have you ever be to Africa well I have and let I tell you what we consider stable here and

daughter if you be ask I if I would be worry if I have a daughter in Kigali I have to say that I would be and you would not go and get she out I can not say what I would or what I would not do in your

ever live by yourself this be the first time in for forever that I 've live alone can you believe it I be 53 year of age and I 've never live by myself it take some getting use to but there be good thing about it Gina about this lawsuit what I be go to tell they be that you do everything you could to help this patient in treatment and that if you have feel he be in any danger you would 've try anything to keep he from fly again you think that will help I do not think it matter what you say they be go to have their expert and they will not know what they be talk about either what the whole case be go to be decide by people who have no idea what go on in the room then the ethic board be go to take away my license because it be the cheap way to settle the thing I do not have the money to

support and alimony Brooklyn you move to Brooklyn and Kate and the kid be still here you know what the way I look at it be they can have my license they can have my practice I be an educate man I can

the kid be still here Ian be in college I 've become one of those Amtrak dad I see the kid on weekend that must be hard but my alma mater have offer I a teaching position I hope that that might mean a fresh start some new problem to listen to there be no new problem I know why do we do this Gina do not you get tired of sit in the chair that be why I take two year off my office be in my living room so I actually never get away from they they leave thing in the sofa I will be read or doze off and somebody 's earring or a date book will fall out on the floor you be sleep in the living room it be a good sleeping couch I make sure of that in case Rosie or Max come to visit do I tell you Rosie be look at college now and Max Max like the Mets which could be an early sign of masochism I promise to take he to a game if he ever come to see I do you think it will work I be sure it will work you just need to take a little time find some good restaurant for you and the kid to eat at find some new routine I do not think you will be alone for long Paul but I want to be alone I have my chance at love last year and I blow it I be not take that risk again that risk the risk of see how happy I could be the risk of have somebody want I the risk of be happy no thank the truth be I be still fuck angry after all these year I think I be come to find out about your deposition why do you come here I need some clarity in my life Gina I need you to explain how I let this whatever you call it love for Laura blind I to the need of my patient Alex use Laura to get I by the time he be finish in therapy I really hate he I let my feeling for this your love all right my love for Laura which by the way I never get to express physically or my love for this Beautiful yes she be beautiful stop put word in my mouth I be sorry when you call you ask if we could talk this be how friend talk I do not think I have any friend it be too bad you do not have a dog you could mess that up too God would you stop what do you want I to do Paul I want you to tell I what to do I want to know what to feel about all this about all what everything everything in my life you do not know how you feel I do not know how I feel and that be why you be here I need your help Gina so when you stop Alex 's therapy no he stop it he show up at my door in a uniform he have already make a decision okay when he stop therapy do you feel that the therapy have fail no good he come to I because he be afraid to fly and he stop therapy because he feel that he be ready go back so you meet his goal for the treatment and do you have different goal for his treatment yes I do and what be your goal you know I hope that I hope that he would be able to forgive himself for for what for what he do he drop a bomb on a school right be he able to forgive himself I do not know do people ever forgive themselves really I know we talk about it all the time but do people ever really do it sometimes sometimes yeah how long do it take be you talk about something you be not able to forgive yourself for what like break up my marriage destroy my kid ' life wreck my career not be able to save my mother and not pay attention to my father that would about cover it be you laugh at I why not we should both laugh but I can not so you go ahead laugh at my mess of a life would you like a drink Sure why not it be fun not have therapy be not it be vodka okay yeah that would be great I only have soda that be fine okay to to old friend and to Tammy Kent to Tammy Kent tell I about Tammy I think I can sayi would never have survive my adolescence if it have not be for her she be she be my first love be she and even before that she be the only one who know who know her family live down the hallway from we and the night my mother be she go to the hospital anyway let us not talk about Tammy Kent besides she be she be your patient so can we go back to the lawsuit after Alex 's funeral nothing more happen between you and Laura no I could not even I could not even think about Laura without blame myself for his death if I have not be in love with she if I have not be jealous of he if I have not be compete with he for her love you might have save he be that what you think yeah I guess so you guess so be not that what we all want to do save our patient be that what you want this be begin to seem like therapy we be friend talk about work then let us let us talk about the work I have a new patient her name be April she be just learn that she be get lymphoma she be terrify and she be in denial she have not tell anybody not her family not her friend nobody except I why not she say she do not want to have the chemo I think she probably have an unconscious fantasy that if she do not have the treatment she do not have the cancer you have not say that to she yet she be notready to hear it yet and I do not have the time to get she there I mean with the particular cancer she have if she start treatment now her chance of recovery be pretty good but if she do not look if it be my daughter I would just take she by the arm and I would drag she to the hospital of course you would that be what you do for your family but not for your patient this be the question what do the good therapist do when the patient need more than just talk do you just sit there and listen until she die on the couch you can only be responsible for what happen in treatment you know that so be you say that you would not take she to chemo I would do everything I could to get she to go and if she still refuse I be just afraid that this girl be go to die and I can not get involve because I be afraid of another lawsuit then stop be her therapist and become her nurse it be not that simple do not simplify it I mean be you say that you would not help she I think that be what we be on the earth for to help each other and step up to the plate when somebody need we how long have you be treat she a week you 've see she only once and she be make you feel this I be just afraid that she be go to die and I be angry that she will not let I help she be not this the same anger that you feel towards Alex because he would not let you save he this be not about Alex this be about April I do not think this be about your patient at all I know you do not you have this anger before these patient walk into your office you be not go to drag I down that path again I be not drag you down any path you think this be about my mother yes I think this be about your mother I do not want to go into therapy how do you leave thing with her I make her promise to call I and I call she twice yesterday and 3 time today she still have not call back I just you know I have to help this girl Paul we be not god we can not save anybody you really care about your patient but I have to say you be no good to anybody as long as you be live with all this fear and anger Fear that I can not save they fear that they be all go to die they will not all die yeah but my mother die you can say it go on go ahead in spite of everything you could do your mother die and if your mother could die the one who promise you she would always be there she do not promise I that but you think she do I do because she bring I into the world she be go to stay with I as a kid I think that she be sick Paul she be too sick for you to save she I wish you could tell that to my unconscious it be devastating if you could have save she you would have do you know what you be feel now look what if I want to come back to you for therapy no supervision no blurred line just plain old therapy you think you can trust I you be the only one I can trust besides I would feel really stupid if I have to start all over again lie to somebody for a year I do not want to feel stupid what do you wanna feel I just wanna feel of course I will see you be you sure I be sure be this time good yes it be good morning Mia I again Come in please I know 7 00 be early but it be the only time that I could come no it be okay you know it be funny 20 year ago I be in brooklyn you be in the city and now it be the other way around oh that be that be true I know you 've speak with ellis about your case and he be on top of it but if you be not pleased I hope you will let I know thank you and I really appreciate the referral you have more light in here than you have in your old office on 10th street yeah that be that be a long time ago it be strange to be back this couch be well the old one be blue with black pillow you have a good memory I just think it be funny that you have a black and blue couch I be sorry about last week oh it be fine no it be unprofessional and it should not have happen well as you say these thing happen well it be embarrassing and that be why I call I want to apologize and just talk about it good and I understand your say no to have a drink that be too personal anyway I be happy to come in have a session and just try to clean up the mess I make I should 've bring a mop so your feeling kind of catch you by surprise but that be back on last monday and you call I on friday do it take you that long to decide I do not know if I want to sometimes it be well just to let thing go do not go ferret around for more problem I just really do not think I would lose it like that and you be right about how I set it up I be not so sure that I say you set it up oh but I do Ellis could not be there I see your name on the file and I grab it I actually think it would be fun just to needle you a little and impress you oh I be impressed till Bennett walk in can I smoke actually I would prefer if you do not oh really God everyone be so healthy why be that even Bennett hate that if you can not smoke after sex what be the point you be tell I that you and bennett be involve I figure you have figure that out I do notice your manner change after he come into the room yeah he know you be my old therapist have to mark the room like the dog he be oh so you think it be territorial and kind of funny consider how so I be sure you notice he wear a ring I do it be bad enough to sleep with a married man but when he be your boss it be really pathetic right I be sure you have your reason yeah I have be see this other guy Andre and that be fade fast so I just think well I will have a little fling with Bennett and it will be easy to let andre go if they overlap a little be there I think there be a term for that it be call shingle right well who want to have a leaky roof I never think it would last you know past a month with Bennett but it have last yeah over a year now nobody know that be a long time to keep a secret he say he be go to leave his wife he want to be with I and I believe he I mean it do happen People do leave their wife even for old woman they do well he do not so what happen it do not matter so now I need to meet someone else do you know anybody so now you want I to introduce you to somebody Sure I do not need a therapist I need a matchmaker you think I would be a good judge of character oh you do not have to be just figure out who I be attract to and then pick someone else you do owe I what do you mean I owe you I do not get what you mean what if I stand by the window and smoke you can stand wherever you like Mia but I would still rather you do not smoke okay do not set I up I be sure Bennett will call his wife never have sex with he I do not understand how people can stay married like that I you be divorce right I mean I know I be not suppose to ask but since I be not really a patient do you have an affair when you say that you do not really think that you be a patient I think that what you be say be you do do not you your wife find out she leave you and now you be alone and here we be together again I 've be wonder this past week what would 've happen if you and I have just run into one another in Soho or something like that and what do you think would 've happen oh probably nothing I mean look at you I be sure you do not have any trouble find woman with the accent and the eye you probably already have a girlfriend see it be different for I how be it different for you it just be do you feel that you be not attractive no I think I look fine I be not talk about have sex I can find that be you talk about have a relationship do you have any idea what it be like to meet a smart interesting available man who be over 40 no what be it like well the pool be exceedingly small they be either married or there be a very good reason why they be not married and if they be divorce they want they young I bet the last woman you fall for be what 30 be you ask I if somebody like I would be attract to somebody like you answer a question with a question you sound like Bennett lawyer should never be with other lawyer I wonder if his wife be sleep with he again I teach he what to do she get the benefit and what do you teach he to do God the first time it be like it be like do it with a salmon do you ever watch those nature documentary where the male salmon frantically kind of jerk around for about 15 second with its mouth gape open and then it just stop not to mention there be no hand tongue never really touch the female so you turn Bennett from a from a fish into a man that sound mythic a real fairy tale you know the one where the princess fuck the frog and turn he into a prince and then he go back to his frigid frog wife what what be you think I be think it be a good thing you do not write child 's book do I look like I do not understand child because I do not have any child and you do no I be just no sorry it be a bad joke that be fine I be not at my most jovial I think I hurt your feeling no no it be just oh never mind what be it I do not have any child and now it look like I will not my fsh level be high than it should be and I be 43 and I be a little young for that and my doctor say that if I want to get pregnant I should have do it yesterday or maybe five year ago I mean it be still theoretically possible it must have be hard to hear it be not a complete surprise I would stop take the pill with Bennett over the summer and nothing happen so but yeah I go to see my doctor on monday the same day that you and I meet yeah that afternoon you be imply there be a connection be I well do you think there be a connection okay yes see you just make I think about my life when do you get the result on friday do you tell Bennett and what do he say he tell I to get out get out where be you I drive to his house in Larchmont I tell his wife it be a work emergency he be not even there I have to sit there and wait with Gwen and the kid and the tacky antique do he show up yeah eventually we go to his study and I tell he that I want to see a specialist and I need to get pregnant right away he just say get out that and that he do not want to see I anymore and that be when you call I after you have see Bennett well it be a hell of a week you have you get these test result from your doctor you get reject by Bennett and it kind of all begin with meet I on monday in a way it really all start 20 year ago you mean when I be your therapist I be wonder all these year later now that you know how it turn out what do you think about that pregnancy what what do you think no no Paul what do you think see I last week do it make you question that decision no see you only make it bad so you 've be struggle with this for some time you know it be ironic when I be look at your case file I do the math your wife be pregnant at the same time I be but you think that I should get an abortion you think I want you to get an abortion it be a mutual decision we make it together how do we do that Mia um I be 22 you be my therapist I be get ready to go to law school I get pregnant and you do not think I should have it and what tell you that oh come on maybe you can remind I why do not you look over your old session note or have you not even keep those you sound you sound kind of angry you know you appear to have forget the whole thing the gift that I give you and the decision that we make I do not forget it what be the point obviously we can not bring the baby back but we might both learn something if we we talk about it it seem to I that we may have different perspective there be fact and what would they be you challenge I constantly do I want to give up law school be I ready to become a parent do I want to get marry and what be the answer you think it would ruin my life be that really what I say I do remember talk to you about your anxiety in relation to begin law school and separate from your family and I think you have doubt about your boyfriend at the time he be a musician right a drummer yeah you would think his timing would 've be well it be a joke Paul I I get it what be his name again Stevie he fix car during the week and do gig on the weekend I would follow he around to all these dive he have this beautiful long hair that would go fly everywhere but you know everyone say he be a musician mechanic he be not or Mia what do you think I think I love he and I I let he go do you know what that be like he be right there next to I what be we think that somebody well be go to come along somebody my family like and now now I be here and this be what I have and I wish I could go back to what to that moment right before I lose he you be there Paul maybe this be why you want to see I Mia to go back to go back to that moment and try to understand it yeah what happen I miss it I do not remember how Stevie feel about all this oh he do not even know I be pregnant yeah the person I tell be my father he be great about it he be completely supportive in what way well I mean he be upset about it at first of course but then he say whatever I want to do he would be there for I we even make a list of the pro and con together he do everything he find the doctor he pay for it he take I to the appointment you remember he as be so perfectly there for you so present and I be the one who let you down he even arrange for the abortion yeah of course he do so I would not have to you know I do not think you tell I that 20 year ago do you know why not I do not come here to talk about my father we be fine how many father and daughter have as good of a relationship and you be still very close in fact he call you twice when I be in the office yeah I mean be there something wrong with that it be well than fight all the time I bet you wish you be as close to your daughter you have not mention your mom oh she do not know about it you do not tell your mother that you be pregnant no that be kind of strike and your father do not tell she no so it be a kind of a what a secret just between the two of you well the three of we because you know be there any other secret all girl have secret with their dad that be normal like what for example well my dad leave the apartment before I wake up every day to go and open the store so I never get to see he in the morning but I would leave early to walk to school you know it be Greenpoint Brooklyn everbody do that then and where be you mum oh I do not know probably sleep and I would stop by it be a candy store with magazine and he would give I this big smile and then he would make coffee for both of we I mean mine be probably mostly milk but it feel very grow up and we would sit and read the paper together and he always tell I that I be smart my mother never know that be a secret just the two of you one day I be in the back room and this man come in to rob the store and I watch as he point a gun at my father and my father tell he to get out that he have earn that money and that he be not give he a penny of it and that he have press the alarm button and the police be on their way which you know be a lie how old be you I be on 2nd grade so probably 7 or 8 you must have be terrify yeah I be but I be so I be so proud of he he but I you know I do not know what to do when I try to catch his eye and he look at I and the robber see he and he just aim his gun straight at I what happen he yell do you want to lose you girl be that what you want and my father he just empty the register and you know I remember that it be a friday so the till be full and the guy run my father he just he grab I and he start to cry and I have not ever really see he do that you know and he be shake and I tell he I say I be okay I be sorry because if it be not for I you will still have your money he be hold I so tight he do not let I go to school that day he would not let go and he let I eat my favorite chocolate and he make I promise never to tell my mother why well because she would have blame he for lose all that money and for not have a gun and not have an alarm you know for let I visit he in the morning you obviously have a really close bond do that make you feel important you know my poor dad in that awful store every day he pay for law school there be something else in that memory that the way that he hold on to you the way he cry you have to stay with he all day I mean it be a life or death situation do you feel that maybe there be a part of you that could not leave he maybe that it feel you

sure who she be yeah I guess you do not really follow that world I do not really follow that world either except now apparently I be stuck in it mire in its peripheral muck thank you for that Kyle I remember last week that you mention she be wealthy she be filthy fucking rich I tell Kyle I have cancer and you know what she do she offer to pay for my treatment we be at a school you stupid cunt we have insurance if you ever actually go to class you might know that I mean I tell Kyle not to tell anyone and he tell herdeliberately so that he would not have to deal with I I hate they both I do not get this how do tell Sienna ensure that Kyle do not have anything to do with you I tell he not to tell she so he betray your trust no it be more than that look Kyle know I he know what I can and can not tolerate he know that if he tell his girlfriend I have cancer and if she call I I will hang up on she and never speak to either of they again which be what he do and what she do and what I do so that be who you be talk to when you arrive and do you hang up on her no the phone die which be why I have to call she back so I can hang up on her could I just use your phone please it will take two minute I can not concentrate at all she can not get the last word Paul I can not die and she get to go on and live the perfect life with the only person I 've ever love thank you could I have a moment wow he be keep you busy listen what do he tell you because we be not Sienna I be not so what do you say to her I do not know I tell she my life be none of her fucking business that make you feel well do do you talk to Kyle as well I will call he later you say that he be the only person that you have ever love can I ask you how it feel to see he with somebody else I 've never actually see they together no I do not even know she exist until recently I mean I know she exist everyone know she exist her father donate the money for the new library she wear all these ridiculous scarf in these absurd configuration you should not wear scarf like that unless you be french why not I do not know I just think they look stupid on american girl include Sienna no not include Sienna you say you tell Kyle about your cancer I do it be pretty funny the way it all go down I could use a laugh you want to tell I we have not speak since we break up because we be like radioactive together but a few month have go by I think maybe we be ready I know he be see someone else I think maybe we could have dinner catch up he always make I feel I do not know he be old he know how to take care of thing how to keep everything under control I send he an email I say I be have trouble with one of my model which I be he come right over he could see immediately that I be tired he make I risotto and he bring wine and I remember think this be nice we can be friend we be friend as he be leave he kiss I and I remember feel confused but it be like it take a little while for my brain to catch up with what my body be do where my hand be go and I hear this sound like a moan and I think who make that sound and then I realize it be I while it be happen I start to cry and then he start to cry I have never see he cry before when it be over I say I have something to tell you he say I have something to tell you and I say you go first and so he say I be engage and then I say I have cancer that be so painful it be he it be Kyle I be go to ignore this okay that be fine I be sorry for what he must 've get your number from the ice queen 's phone she must 've tell he what happen how do you feel about that I expect she to tell he and I be glad that he call do you think that might be part of the reason that you be so anxious to call she because you want she to convey your anger to he I do not need to go through she to get to he clearly have you see Kyle since that night no I kick he out and tell he I never want to see he again because because he tell you he be engage because he be mean to I after I tell he I have cancer he get really anxious and ask I what my plan be I tell he I do not have a plan and he get angry and accuse I of not take care of myself he get angry his dad be physically abusive to his mom and she would not defend herself so so when kyle see woman not take care of themselves he go apeshit April do you think and I know what you be go to say next Gee April do you think you try to provoke Kyle with your apathy in order to get a reaction and see how much he care about you and the answer be no I really do not expect to tell he it just it slip out do you know what I be go to say next I be sorry actually I think it be great that you see thing from my point of view really it be really helpful yeah right do you find it hard to let yourself be take care of it feel to I like you not only want to do your own work here but you want to do mine as well that way you believe you can get through this without without I you know when when you mention Kyle here first I be a little worried about he you sound like my father yes I guess I do react in that way you say that he be old that he have a rich wealthy girlfriend yet he sleep with you you can not blame he for that I be tell you we have this thing I be not blame he actually over the session I think I be begin to understand his behavior why because I think I know how he feel you describe the way he respond to your revelation to your cancer as be mean but it seem to I that he be behave appropriately anxiously you know in the last session that we have you tell I that you have cancer and as soon as you do that you start to push I away and I know that the more time I call you this week the less likely I be to see you again you call I like 10 time this week you must 've never want to see I again in the meantime you tell kyle and then you start to push he away you vilify his behavior but he can not help I anymore he do not belong to I he be not mine so because he be not your partner he can not help you anymore it be all or nothing with I it be just the way I be build he do not hurt I I hurt he it be not his fault we break up it be mine I could not take it well what could not you take how much he love I why I do not know it be just too much you say that you could not rely on Kyle because he do not belong to you be there anyone in your life who do right now Daniel so you and your brother have a deep bond do you tell he about the cancer Daniel have enough to worry about like what like negotiate the world Paul have you ever know anyone with autism what be that be like for you no one understand it be every second of every day it be like he be in a foreign country where he do not speak the language and where everyone hate he he be lucky to have someone who understand he as well as you do yeah well he do not deserve what he get do any of we deserve what we get when Kyle and I be together it be hard to explain but it be like I would just check out sometimes but I would not go far I would be watch myself watch Kyle brush our tooth make coffee and I remember think this be what it feel like to be Daniel how often would this happen a lot especially when we be in bed sometimes we would be have sex and then suddenly I would be float above we look down and think oh they be in love that be nice it do not happen this last time I try to make it happen but I could not I think that be when I start to cry it sound like you be what we call dissociate it be a defense mechanism it feel like you be outside your body but we do it sometimes to get away from something that we feel be frightening what be I afraid of that be a very important question I sleep with his good friend Kyle 's I do not know why I do it the whole time there be this voice in my head say do not do this April please you be go to screw everything up he will not forgive you I do it anyway and then I tell he and I be right he could not forgive I everything be really sort of perfect I be this perfect girl to he do that feel scary now I be that girl the one who be still hang up on her ex I hate girl like this you do not like to see yourself as flawed do you Kyle offer to take I to the hospital to see my oncologist schedule my treatment and I almost I almost let he do it because I I want to see he again so badly be not that horrible what be so horrible about that I stop myself he be be call every day since we see each other like five time a day I be not pick up you be go to need somebody to take you to chemotherapy and from what I understand you feel very tired afterwards I 've be feel much well lately I give you credit April would you rather die than be weak it be very rare for this disease to go away of its own accord Basically that be unheard of well I have be feel well since come here do you ever have a when you be a child do you ever have a worry doll A what a worry doll you tell it your trouble and it take your trouble away maybe maybe that be what you think you have in I you 've tell I you have cancer and now I be worried about it now since somebody else be worry you do not need to and since you do not need to worry you must not have cancer I have to tell you talk about this to a psychologist be not go to make it go away you know I I speak with this friend of mine who be an oncologist you do what basically April he think that your delaying chemotherapy be a sentence of death you talk to someone else about I I do not mention your name you have no right to do that I come to you in confidence it would have be professionally negligent of I to do anything else I need to find out whether your behavior might be suicidal Suicidal what would you tell I to do April you 've be tell I what to do and say throughout this session I can not let you it be my duty my professional duty to protect you April from self harm I want you to promise I that will not happen again that no matter what I decide to do you will not talk to anybody else about I outside this room I promise but you have to promise I something in return what that if you decide to stop therapy you have to call I you can not sever tie unilaterally I do not want you to disappear I promise thank you so be that so hard I think we be okay VO michvanilly salomon 208 week two Oliver Wednesday 4 00 pm be we go to play another game would you like to I do not know you know since we meet the last time I 've be read up on the rule of blackjack I do not want to play right now okay that be fine why would you learn about blackjack because I want to understand more about the thing you like to do why because I think you be a very interesting person I be not interesting well I think you be you be really observant you be perceptive you 've get a great sense of humor and you be obviously extremely smart my teacher do not think I be smart really they say thing like that I do not want to talk about school so what would you like to talk about you do not have to talk to I if you do not want to I know that I will not tell my parent you will still get pay I be not go to force you to talk to I but if you be have you know if there be anything you do want to talk about this would be a good place to do it you know why I do not want to talk about school 'cause all my teacher hate I they hate you that be terrible I can not see any reason why they would they be all mad because I fall asleep in class do that happen a lot pretty much every day well then you must be you must be very tired no school be just boring you do not like any of your class not really they be not about real thing what do you mean by that like math be algebra it be not even number it be letter it be all fake and what about all the other class history for example do not that have to be real we do not have history it be call humanity and right now we be read this lame book call Lord of the fly have you ever read it a long time ago in what way do you find it lame these kid crash on a deserted island and start do mean thing and you do not find that realistic you do not need to crash on an island for kid to be mean that be true have you ever see kid be mean like that you wanna see something sure they just give one of these to everybody at school what be this it be a turtle it be a turtle okay he be beautiful do you think he be okay in there do you want to let he out for a bit well be that okay sure go ahead okay on the floor do you have a name for he I have to take he home and take care of he if he die I fail so why do you think that would happen I be go to forget to feed he or leave he behind and he be go to die he look really healthy to I it seem like you be do a great job I be glad you take he out of that backpack though it look like it be a bit crowded in there yeah I have to take all my book home really you 've get a lot of homework no it be just sometimes I be at my dad 's and I forget a book that I leave at my mom 's so my dad get angry because we have to go back to Brooklyn so it be good that I keep all my book with I so since we last meet you 've be stay at your dad 's apartment so you still feel the same way as you feel before that you be just not ready to stay with your dad just yet well I be a little bit I be a little bit confused last week you say that the reason that you could not stay over at your dad 's be because you could not fall asleep because of the noise now you be with your mom and you be still so tired you be fall asleep in class what be with that School 's boring I just tell you that so so do you have any trouble be he okay there I guess so you never have any trouble fall asleep at your mom 's house it be just hard to fall asleep maybe the problem be not just the noise at your dad 's apartment maybe it be that you be have trouble sleep for other reason like what a lot of people can not get to sleep because they be really stress out at nighttime they can not empty their mind do you think that be true about you maybe I be sure that there be a lot go on in your life that must be stressful you think be there anybody you feel comfortable talk with about how you feel like who my parent that be one possibility yeah well if I tell my mom she call my dad and then they argue and what kind of thing do they argue about everything today they have a fight because my mom say I be not get enough sleep and my dad say I be not healthy and what do he mean by that not healthy Fat have your dad ever tell you that he think you be fat I know he think I be fat everybody think I be fat because I be fat so be fat seem to be something that really bother you do you think I be fat what I be concerned about be what you think and I think it make you upset just from the way you talk about it I do not talk about it it be all the kid at school that do and what do they say to you we be read Lord of the fly and we have to write this essay on the character that we think we be the most like so everybody in the class start laugh because they say I should write about the character name piggy which be the fat character in the book so that be what they call I now piggy that be a pretty cruel thing to do whatever and last saturday this girl Maya have a Bat Mitzvah and her dad get all this chocolate for the party this kid Eric text everybody and say if you want chocolate then you would well get there before Oliver do sound like a real prize this Eric he be an asshole I do not even want to go to the stupid party anyway do you tell your mom that why not because she would 've call my dad and then they would 've have a fight so you go to the party even though you do not want to kind of my mom drop I off and when I get there I know everybody be upstairs in Maya 's room so I sneak out the back door and hide behind a bush you hide behind a bush for the whole party it be fine till everybody come outside to play in the snow do anybody see you out there Eric come behind the bush to take a leak and he pull out his dick and piss all over my shoe what happen then and then he go back to hang out with the other kid and they go back inside sound pretty awful do you tell anybody about this I know if it happen to I I would find it pretty hard if I do not have anybody to talk to about it if I tell my mom then she call my dad then they fight and I do not want it to be my fault what do not you want to be your fault if they get a divorce have your mom and dad talk to you at all about the divorce since last week there be this couple that come out of your office early be they marry do they look married to you do I have to guess why can not you tell I I do not tell my other patient about you and that mean I can not tell you about other patient why would happy people come here sometimes people come to therapy they talk about how they feel and they leave just feel well can you make my mom and dad happy what I can do be I can make communication between your mom your dad and you a little well but I can not make they happy would it be okay if I invite your mom and dad into the room Sure Sweetie come over here so you solve all the problem be we good now well one of the thing that we discuss be the be the importance of both of you work together to make sure that Oliver understand what be go on here you get a pretty clear sense of how well we all work together do not you be there anything the two of you would like to discuss with Oliver about what be happen well first of all you probably know this already but just in case it be not clear your mom and I have decide that it be good for all of we if we do not live together anymore for good or for just now for good be there anything you want to say your dad 's right for good do you have any question about what your mom and dad have just say why can not you guy just live together there be a lot of reason for that for one thing I be sure you notice how much we fight because of I no sweetie you can not ever think this be about you but you guy do fight about I all the time it be not your fault look the truth be your mom and I we just can not get along anymore that be why we have to get a divorce and we love you very much we do not want to have you see we go at it all the time so you be get a divorce because of I that be not the way to do it you be only confuse he more well at least I be try over here do you understand what your dad be say they be get a divorce because I get too upset when they fight no sweetie what we be try to say be that your dad and I we can not stay together okay but we love you we love you so much and we be always go to love you no matter what this be what always happen I do not wanna talk about this anymore I be sorry I be sorry why do not you wait in the other room and maybe do some homework and we will call you in a few minute okay and you wonder why the kid can not fall asleep at night would you stop it at least I be let myself feel sad about this you do not think I be sad well you seem to be pride yourself on how quickly you can just move on Pride look I hate that all this be happen but I do not think it be fair to our son when you start cry in front of he do not you think I be right about that Paul well what I can tell you be that I think that your son 's sleeplessness and his overeating be probably cause by the pressure that you be all under that be what I 've be try to explain to she for month now you know he believe the divorce be all his fault and that be entirely natural he also believe that if he behave in a particular way it will bring you two back together again that be also a natural fantasy but because thing be so tense between you at the moment he feel that he can not talk to you about his problem for instance there be a there be a boy at school who be be pick on he and Oliver feel that he can not speak to you about this because he do not want to upset you but I can tell you that he feel completely helpless you be say that maybe we should not get divorce no that be I do not think that be what I what I mean but that be what you be think be not it I mean how selfish and how cowardly it be for we to just throw in the towel and wreck our son 's life over over small stuff small stuff we be both stubborn that be all we fight about stupid thing like how late you could stay at work how my mother drive you crazy how my friend be a bad influence how I curse too much how everything I do be a bad influence on our kid and so what I mean really so what we be suppose to be just perfectly in love for the rest of our life I can not believe we be have this conversation talk maybe we be just go through a rough patch here you know what if we just stay the course maybe we will come out the other side of this would not that be well for Oliver be not there a whole book about how parent should stay together no matter how unhappy they be and ultimately it be well for the child that be a question that I think a lot of couple struggle with what I care about be what be good for for the three of you as bad as it be be between we it have not be any well now that we be break up not for I anyway and especially not for Oliver we owe it to he to stop and think about what we be do before we just we move past the point of no return here I be already past that point you like to say thing like that but be that really true I mean come on be you really happy live all alone so far away from your family I be see someone else Bess why do not you come back and sit down Oliver Pack up your stuff we have to go right now Bess can you please no I do not think there be anything leave to talk about I think this be suppose to be my night with he no he be not go to go with you so you get to make that decision please if you will both sit down we can make the decision together well he be certainly not go to go stay with he if you be have woman over at your apartment do Oliver know about your new little girlfriend I guess he do now I think you be the one who want to break thing to he gently would you tell he that it be too soon for he to start see other woman that it would be bad for Oliver Bess I do not think we be ever go to figure out what be good or bad for Oliver if whenever either of you get upset you end the session so you be go to skip your class again tonight no I drop my class and it be a good thing I do because one of we need to be a responsible parent right now now see she be just use Oliver as an excuse she be never go to get her degree she be never go to move on and she be go to keep say it be all because he need she and that be complete bullshit the kid need to be allow to grow up so honey Oliver this bag it be a mess how be he ever go to grow up if you keep treat he like a baby be not it my night to go with dad not if you be not ready it be fine it be my night with dad and I want to stay with he do you think that be a good idea hey it be our night he want to be with I what be the problem no it be no problem that be why we be here you have a good time with your dad okay I will pick you up on thursday after school see you next week Paul Bye mom why do not you walk we to the train you be go to get a bad back carry all this I can never figure out what I need so long next time we will stay for the whole session that would be nice take care Oliver see you next week can you give I a minute thank you it be fine old actually Mom Dad say he like my hair anyway mom I get to go Dad 's go to make breakfast yes on the stove okay love you too Bye where do she think I be go to make breakfast in the washing machine she just assume we would go out do you do you want to go out I do not care I just do not want a Kramer vs Kramer moment you know that happen to be one of your mom 's favorite movie and one of mine incidentally well that explain quite a bit yes it do Sign here please sure what be it it be from a law firm it be nothing what be it I mean you be not be sue be you by who Mom you know that be all settle then who it be not one of your patient it be be not it you know I can not talk about stuff like that then who can you talk about it with I have a lawyer you can not talk to a lawyer Rosie it be under control right because you always control everything so well be this what you want I do not get it you know it be like you be condemn yourself to a life of loneliness and for what Dad for patient who sue you when you try to help they I mean be this really how you want everything to turn out it be go to be fine Rosie really please you always say that you be just make shit up no no I already tell you no more hug not until you come home Rosie you know that be not go to happen you do not deserve it nice turtle Synchro mpm so so I be sure this week you read up on I you mean about your company I will not hold it against you we 've get a target on our back move off that business section you never read into the front section any day now there be go to be a feeding frenzy actually I do read a few article but mostly about the industry not specifically about you Finefellow fine Connie think this reporter at the Times have it in for I do you think she be right well like you say the whole industry be reel from this but for some reason Brenda Starr over there have decide to make I the poster child for the scandal it get so bad this week that connie ask I if I would ever lay off the girl 's father do you agree with she that this reporter be out to get you those article they be not base on fact she be just listen to somebody I do not know who some malcontent who have just enough information to sound knowledgeable and do serious damage so if I follow you then this may not be a reporter 's vendetta but it could actually be the work of somebody from inside the company well I do not want to think that but the donaldson that be the family with the majority stake they be convinced of it old man Donaldson say Walter we have a Judas in our midst that must be pretty disturbing not know who to trust in the midst of a crisis well that be business but what be really disturbing be for she to imply that I would endanger the health of child just to turn a profit I mean that be completely irresponsible I be a father for Christ 's sake get a daughter who be probably read about this online be you worried about how she might react she know who her old man be but I be worried that these article might be put Natalie in jeopardy I be not sure that I follow well God forbid they find out she be my daughter for all I know they probably already have maybe she be already disappear maybe they be stall for time while he decide how much ransom he think he can ask for do you think I sound crazy I think your anxiety might be influence your judgment well I be not the only one Connie 's allergy be act up she be lose weight or maybe she be worried for you I about what my job no that reporter from the Times who be try to get I fire she be the one who should be worry or do I sound crazy actually I think you sound quite confident for a man in the midst of a what do you call it a feeding frenzy yeah there be a reason for that the Donaldsons I 've work for they for over 35 year I be like a son to they can I ask you what you be think about now that be right you be the fellow who want I to say whatever pop into my head I be just think they have a son James we be in the war together army corps of engineer we try to build bridge over there help people who be take shot at we when we get back to the States I get my degree and he bring I into the company if I would look out for he as much over here as we do for each other over there he might still be around what happen to he he drive too fast you see a family through a loss like that and they be not go to this crisis'll blow over they always do I think I 've talk enough would you mind tell I what you be think well just now I be strike by the way you say that the the crisis would blow over it remind I of what you say last week as as you be leave what do I say I ask you if you should call your doctor and you say it will go away it always go away yeah last week look I think I also say I be sorry if I give you a scare but these thing they look bad than they be and what be they exactly well whatever they be they be not go to kill I they be inconvenient sure but they go away and have you ever mention they to anyone I have a gold plate executive health plan I do not really need it but the company insist on it if there be anything wrong a problem they would have find out so you tell your doctor that you be have trouble sleep but you do not say anything about the panic attack they be not panic attack what make you so sure they do not happen under stressful situation they happen at dinner sometimes or a movie or evidently during a therapy session have you have one since then actually I have one this week in the elevator of all place would you care to tell I about that what do you want I to do describe the elevator for you well do anything unusual happen that morning why do not you just describe then the detail of that morning as you remember this be like the game my wife use to play with our kid at the dinner table we would ask they how school be they would say fine ask they what happen nothing finally my wife make they walk through the day step by step be that really what you be look for humor I okay get out of the town car go into the building meet the new security guard show he my passport go through the gate get on the elevator my heart start race my throat close up elevator door open go into my office this be about the time that Natalie would usually say can I be excuse now be you say that do you find this exercise pointless I do not mean to be a doubt Thomas but I do not see anything that would have cause a panic attack do you you say there be a new security guard yeah a kid what about he anything unusual about that do it upset you maybe that you have to show he your I D you do not know I at all I know Bob for over 30 year and I always make a point of show he my i D and what happen to Bob he die accord to the kid drop dead of heart failure disappear be you and Bob close I would nod to he in the morning he would say hey Mr b how about those Knicks I would say they be break my heart Bob and just same conversation for 30 year it sound like you two have a morning ritual do you think that you miss he I do not miss Bob I enjoy our banter and I feel sorry for his family but he mean nothing to I I just wonder if there might be some connection between Bob 's death and your attack in the elevator that be all I think you be grasp for straw there fella where do you go to school here in the city be you worried I be not qualified to treat you it be just a question anyway it do not matter like I say I 've have these since I be a kid I be use to they from when you be a kid really off and on do you remember how old you be when you experience your first one four or five I guess four or five that seem very young right six I have to be six I be already sleep in my brother 's room be you close with your brother he die when I be a boy he drown how do it happen well this be in rural Pennsylvania it be an old limestone quarry lake a swimming hole really 40 foot cliff it be a hot summer night and what age be he 16 get ready to go to college in the fall Yale he seem kinda young for that but he skip a few grade all the bright kid do back then but of all of they Tommy be the bright you have no idea a real golden boy valedictorian full scholarship Tommy walk on water how be it for you when when he die Fine I do not even know if I really know that be go on I be so young and your parent how do they how do they grieve they do not of course they do they have to but they shield I from that but you know something be go on all I know be that one day Tommy just be not there I think I stay with the neighbor for a few night and then I go home my dad be sit on the porch drink his lager wait for I he walk I up to my brother 's room all his stuff be still there nothing change my father say this be yours now I just tell your mother now I know why we have you then he turn around and leave I there or at least that be how I remember it it be a very that be a very powerful memory well like I say I be young I might have it wrong and when you tell it now to I what emotion do it bring up for you I just feel sorry for the old man Tommy be everything to he and your mother how do she react her hair turn white she have this gorgeous auburn hair and then overnight she change into an old woman I think she be a changeling for a while that my real mother be trap somewhere far away Walter what what you be talk about describe it be it be significant it must have be hard for you to cope with the loss of your brother and your parent ' grief kid be resilient they survive but you begin to have these attack after you be sleep in Tommy 's room I do so what like I say they only occur while I be sleep and what be they like back then I would wake up sweating and shake do you ever tell your parent no they have enough on their mind and these panic attack just like now they would go away there you go again with this panic have not you be listen how could they be panic attack they happen when I be asleep how stress out could I have be as a child whose brother have just vanish and whose parent offer no explanation I think you could have be very stress out even in your dream especially in your dream you know it sound to I like your parent place a heavy burden on you after Tommy die do you ever feel that they want you to fulfill his potential nobody could ever fulfill Tommy 's potential but I try I do try you be a very successful man I be ROTC from Penn state Tommy have an Ivy League scholarship Tommy would have cure cancer do you think about Tommy a lot but actually I 've be think about what it must have be like for my folk when I be in Vietnam they would already lose one and their only spare be halfway around the world I must have put they through hell do they ever say anything to you about that no like I say they they do not talk a lot about their feeling have you tell your daughter how worried you be for her where be that come from well Natalie be now also halfway around the world do you recall the word you use when you be describe Tommy 's death but I be sure you do you say he disappear it be the same word you use to talk about what you fear may have happen to Natalie and also what happen to Bob do not read too far into this that be a strange thing to say to a therapist Come on I be joke be you really it seem to I this whole session any time I 've try to read into thing or suggest another way of look at a problem you 've shut I down it be not that it be just that if you be wrong you be wrong be I suppose I have to worry about your feeling of course not but I be suppose to pay attention to yours and you 've give I the strong sense I have to say that if I tell you something you do not want to hear you might very well just walk out of the room you mean fire you well you be wrong about that too look if you think I need to hear something just come on out and say it I be a big boy you think Bob the security guard be my rosebud tell I how actually I think this precede Bob and Natalie go on I do not think that you trust that people who leave you will ever come back your brother never return your mother look like a different person your father be never the same and nobody make sense of it all for you as a kid perhaps you still fear that if someone disappear even momentarily whether they be overseas or just out of touch for a few day that something horrible must have happen to they perhaps in certain situation you experience a disproportionately stressful response so if I be understand you all this start when my daughter leave for Rwanda it be an overreaction like my wife 's allergy do that make sense to you do you have some sort of psychological antihistamine do you mean a prescription I think you say you do not want to take pill maybe that be because my doctor do not have your diagnosis there be medication for panic attack but I think it be really important that we continue the work that we be begin to do here call my doctor tell he what you think I will do that good thank I appreciate it our time 's up be not it yes it be you can pay I at the end of the month if you if you do not mind one thing I learn from my father pay as you go it be clean that way maybe the medication will help thank you thank you hello Kate Rosie say you would be here be there a problem these be the financial aid form I ask you to sign for Rosie 's college application I do not know your income this year so I will take care of it appreciate it Rosie 's at her friend Becca 's house they be work on a science project so you will have to wait until after dinner to pick she up why can not she do it some other night I only see she two night a week who be choice be that Paul I be just suppose to wait around until she be finish what be I suppose to do until then I do not know maybe see your other child I be sorry please let us not do this now and please do not come to my therapist 's okay please do not come here I have one fucking hour to myself please I think you have your whole life to yourself now why do not you enjoy it hello Tammy Timing I hope you do not hear all that oh no it be no problem actually I be glad I run into you I want to tell you how sorry I be about interrupt your session last week that be fine it be good to see you again it be your turn have fun Subtitles sub way fr 1 00 Tammy look like she have a good session today we can not talk about another patient you say that last week I say a lot of thing last week and the truth be I do not know what I be think look I can not be in therapy with you it be nothing personal if I be to go to therapy obviously I would come to you of course but it be just not a good time for I to to make myself more miserable be that what we be go to do make you more miserable I do not want to just phone you know be you sure about this absolutely I be sorry to hear this but I respect your decision so you respect my decision yes of course I do do you want I to leave you stay here and wait for the kid it be fine but since I 've get some free time I need to do some shopping you be go shop do you need anything from the market what would I need from the market Gina oh right I do not know do you want I to argue with you do you want I to persuade you to come to therapy do you want I to just like leave you a message this be very polite I be go to we can not have an hour of conversation that be what we do last week I will pay you for an hour of conversation I do not sell my conversation maybe we should charge they if anyone learn anything it would be all the well so be you go to stay here while I be go I get what you be do what be I do woman they be all the same every last one of they excuse I maybe it be not a good idea for you to stay here I just want you to stay and talk you say that 10 minute please you do not know what kind of a week I 've have Gina I 've get this ceo guy he pay I by the insight when I give he the insight he do not want I really loathe people who think they can just buy whatever they want then I 've get this former patient who I have not see for 20 year who think that everything that be happen in the meantime be my fault I just want to rest for a few minute that be all just a few minute though you can not get any rest on the train on the train I talk to you but you do not talk back not just you I talk to all the people I do not see all week like Kate and the boy and Rosie and this week I talk to Tammy Kent why be I think about Tammy Kent all the time I do not know I be so happy at her house when I be 17 be that the last time I be happy I wonder I do not think so Paul what be it about be at her home that make I so happy I do not know maybe that be something you could work on in therapy I could also work on why I say such stupid thing about woman that woman be all the same what a stupid thing to say please forgive I People say stupid thing when they be angry Anger be also a good thing you could work on in therapy I call my lawyer from the train it turn out that Mr Prince 's lawyer be they be depose Laura today she have a relationship with Alex I know she have a relationship with Alex while she be in love with you that be a dangerous triangle be you worried that she will use this as a way to get back at you I do not know what she will say maybe she really think that it be my fault that Alex be dead that be another good thing to work out here Fine I be like my patient you know I do not want to be in therapy because I do not want to talk about my parent my past be fine it be the present that cause the problem I be sure it be occur to you Paul that that why you be think about Tammy so much nothing have occur to I why do you think I be here I be sorry please tell I what be occur to you it occur to I that you be interested in Tammy Kent because there be something incomplete in your understanding of your father 's abandonment and your mother 's breakdown and how do Tammy fit into this I do not know can not you guess there be an idea Guess therapy you tell I a problem you have and I will try to guess what cause it and if I guess right I win the only problem be I would have to know what cause my problem in order to say whether you be right all right true yes it have occur to I too that my response to Tammy Kent be tie up with my mother 's death somehow that see Tammy open a kind of a window onto that time suddenly with Tammy there I feel I have to look in you know I think to see myself before the fall maybe and Tammy and I be lover and I would want to talk about that too but I can not talk about Tammy because she be your patient so I do not know maybe I will just take Tammy out for a coffee sometime but I will not go look in the in the mother window I will just let it all stay dead the problem be it be not dead it be the Undead like in a horror movie you kill it you bury it but then it come right back right out of the grave Mother those be the monster the thing that will not stay dead and one night when you be too tired to kill the thing again you let it kill you just just so that it will at least be over be that what you think happen to your Alex up there in his plane that instead of fight his guilt one more time he just give into it so it would be over yeah it be hard to know how much fight a person have in he true you for instance you do not have to worry about I I be glad but I wonder why you think you be not strong enough to fight your mother one more time I mean maybe this time you would win what be you suggest I be suggest that maybe you could finally lay they to rest one of they my dad be still alive of course I know that but still if you have clarity about what happen back then maybe that could all rest in peace and so could you how do that sound as a goal for therapy as a goal therapy or not I do not think I can do it without therapy I know it I will not do the work I will not think about it I will just go on blame myself take it out on everybody else I will start smoke again drink too much I do not know that drinking be a problem for you it be as long as I do not drink alone it be not why be I so resistant to you why do I come all the way down here only to tell you that I do not want to be in therapy clearly I have to be in therapy I have to figure out how this next part of my life go I have to know if I be do the right job I have to know if I be help people and if I be not I have to know what I be go to do next do you really worry that I could not hear about Tammy because she be my patient of course I do I do I appreciate that and so I think about whether I could treat you both especially if anything be to happen between the two of you do you think something could happen between the two of we not necessarily but I have to aknowledge that something could happen no I do not want anything like that be you sure absolutely as sure as you be that you do not want to see I for therapy who do not want to be back in bed with his high school sweetheart the girl who look at he in the way he use to be I mean do not you think about stuff like that let us try and stay on the topic Paul sure sorry I think I be begin to enjoy myself if I be go to treat you and Tammy there be go to have to be some rule like well if you be the therapist and you have two patient who have a history what rule would you want okay well I would make it clear that I could not tell either of they anything that I have learn in session about the other okay okay and they could not expect I to analyze the other one and they could not use I to send message back back and forth okay my see they would have to be a kind of open secret we would all know about it of course but we would all put it away and just not use it all even you you think you could do that I think so yeah when Alex and Laura sleep together you keep your response to that out of their therapy as I remember it I throw the affair in her face and a cup of coffee in his but that that that be different how be that different their affair be about I Laura sleep with Alex because I would not sleep with she and he sleep with she because I would not give and he sleep with she because she be gorgeous and he feel like what be you go to say before you correct yourself he sleep with she because you would not because I would not tell he not to fly again because I would not try to control his recklessness and he want to show I what kind of damage he could do but you do not see that no I do not I guess I be too involved so I do not get the message he count on I to control his self destructive influence instead I lash out at he he lash out at himself and and down he go so you can see why I need to remain neutral if something be to happen of course I need you to promise I that nothing be go to happen Sure nothing will happen with Tammy Kent until or unless we be no long your patient I want you to know that what you 've say about Alex today stay with I I be not go to mention any of that in the deposition okay then okay do you want to proceed yes I do good I be glad so let us begin last week you mention your high school sweetheart yeah Tammy Kent last week you call she Tammy Kent also by her full name that be what everybody call she there be another Tammy in the neighborhood so we call this one Tammy Kent and she live down the hall they move in when I be about 14 and that be about the time your father move out no he move out a little bit after that you know it should 've be the bad time of my life with my father go and my mother begin her you know to suffer her bout of Depression but I be not sad you know I be I be excited what be it that excite you Tammy she would show up out of thin air when I be have the bad day and you know we would just start talk and everything bad about my house it feel like a movie it feel like a movie that I be watch but that I be not in and even if my mother be cry all day I would tell Tammy Kent and she would say yeah it be go to be okay what would be okay I do not know she just make I feel that I could get through it and that if I let my mother cry that that be okay too and I have the hope that when I go back down the hall things'd be all right or if they be not at least you know I could deal with they so she help you take care of your parent she be so young to be a grief counselor well she feel more like my my girlfriend and the way I feel about it be if I have a girlfriend then I be you know I be okay I be not the poor kid with the absent father and the pitiful mother I mean I be that kid yes I be but I be not a complete failure at least I have a a girlfriend do you have a physical relationship with her back then no we be 14 different time not like kid now no it be another three year before we have sex after all that stuff have happen and you know I be over over everything what be it that happen well after my father leave after your father leave you and your mother for one of his patient right and then my mother go into this like really deep depression I remember one Christmas Eve Tammy 's mother invite we to come over to the house and you know her husband have die that year but you would never know it she be the strong woman I think I 've ever meet in my life their house be always full of light and music she be determined to stay alive for her kid that be for sure not like your mother no not like my mother who jump into the abyss and pull I down with her so about Christmas yeah anyway Christmas Christmas Eve Tammy Tammy appear at the door she say come on come on so I say hang on for a minute so I go into my into my mother 's room to see you know do she want to come but she be asleep I decide I would leave without she and we go over to Tammy 's place it be it be just amazing Tammy 's mother have bake this glaze ham with the pineapple and cherry and there be christmas cookie and people be drink punch and everybody be singe and it be just great so then afterwards Tammy and I go to her room and we be just you know talk and talk I think that be when I first fall in love with her you know I think she be I think she be the most beautiful creature I have ever see anyway suddenly I remember my mother because I be afraid that she would wake up and that she would not know where I be so I run out of Tammy 's room and what happen when you get home I do not really remember find my mother unconscious on the floor call the ambulance the trip to the hospital I do not even remember any of it you know from the time I leave Tammy 's bedroom until I get to the hospital corridor it be all just like it be all a blur it be all miss it be like it be erase it be very important that you try and remember that night I can not I have try my mother 's first suicide attempt the most important night of the most important night of my life but I do not remember anything why be it the most important night of your life because if I would stay with her she would not have try to you know kill herself I know it take year before she finally do it but that Christmas Eve when I be not there that be the first time she do it that be when it all start Paul you be a 14 year old kid you have just have the most wonderful night of your life yeah but it do not matter it do matter she take your wonderful night away from you she punish you for neglect her she show you what damage she could do if you ignore she if you do not take care of her and it be not just the threat on her life but a threat on my life as well you mean yes I be totally fine I mean I be just stand there in the hall with a stomachful of cookie she be the one in the hospital with the tube stick out of her arm the nurse run in and out I be out enjoy myself she be about to die what could you have do I do not know all I know be I leave she for one night and that be the night she do it so whatever I be do before that obviously I be I be help she it be very important that you remember exactly what happen to you that night because maybe you will discover something miss you know some detail that will help you feel less guilty but I be guilty I know for a fact that you could not save she just like I know for a fact that you could not save Alex but my know those thing be meaningless you have to know they you do okay so you have to do whatever it be you have to do to remember that night like what like hypnosis you will figure it out okay I will see you next week yeah and thank you be welcome

a mistake and think that I be still your lawyer and I open it and it be her deposition regard Alex 's state of mind and you read it be you curious about what she say I hope that you give those paper to my lawyer it be obvious she be in love with you or be how so it be in and between her word she might as well have seal it with a kiss and what do that mean you be curious well she describe how she dump her fiance five minute before the wedding that be a nice story and how she sleep with Alex and that tell you that she be in love with I she do it to make you jealous it do not take Freud to figure that out she want to walk into her session and tell you that she be fuck a fucking war hero and what else do she say she say that you two become friend after the therapy end that you call she on the phone you break the rule for her how many other patient have you do that with Mia whatever happen whatever you imagine happen I think you have an affair with her you be not go to respond I must 've hit a nerve so what you break her heart she break yours oh she do support your case though she say that you do not mistreat Alex she mistreat you by sleep with he Come on let us look atyour action here Mia oh she say she want you to know though you be in her thought you open a legal document that be not mean for you Point take I cross a boundary More than that you knowingly violate a basic tenet of your profession that make two of we and you bring it into session Paul do you have any idea how many therapist be successfully sue for sleep with their patient what be you try to say Mia how could you be she that young and pretty or do she make you feel that big and important take it it be yours do you want I to pick that up off the floor it be all your I 've just make an ass of myself have not I I bet you be angry maybe I be mostly I be I be surprised no you be furious I can see it all over your face but you just can not express it because you be not suppose to you want I to go why would you think that you know what you can stop stop 'cause I be leave it seem to I that you be push I so that you can end this treatment no I do not blame you and it be no big deal actually I think it be a very big deal you be the one who wait for I in the cold although I be late you wait for I be it possible that you be goad I because it be easy to feel angry with I than look at your own pain I see this show on the tv the other night BBC about man and their specially make sex doll the man pick out the eye and the mouth and the body and they buy they clothe and then they put lipstick on they and take they out for picnic and bike ride and they love their girl because they do not talk and they never get pregnant and they do not get mad and they have three perfect hole that can be repair Young and pretty forever what be you think while you be watch this I be think about a receptionist in my office name Stefanie who like to wear a lot of pink and she be so cute and friendly all she do be shop online but nobody want to fire she because she be just too adorable you know and she recently announce that she be quit because some idiot propose so now I have to go to her engagement party and her bridal shower and her bachelorette party and her wedding and it be endless torture sound like you 've be there before three young sister and dozen of colleague when man look at a woman like Stefanie they just see the whole package and what would that be easy and fun and you know wild in bed at night and muffin from scratch in the morning and what do they see when they look at you do you think blonde lawyer might be fun to fuck but but what but that be it what I usually get what I usuallygot from man be sex what do you get from Laura do you think that I choose she over you well you have sex with her would that make you jealous well I do have feeling for you Paul even though it be 20 year ago you must have notice and it sure feel like you have feeling for I it be such a cliche be not it a young woman fall for her therapist but if you be go to get involve with a patient you wonder why I do not pick you you do not you pick she you and Laura fuck your brain out what on this couch that make I sick I do not want to talk about it do not make I talk about it what would happen if we do keep talk about it I bet you want she from day one you be smite how do you manage to walk she to the door you assume that I find her irresistible she know how to get to you how act helpless and girlish she probably have slim hip smell like candy apple wear pink or something obviously I have no idea go on what do you imagine she would stare at you all googoo eye impress by your brilliant interpretation make you feel like the world 's good shrink and then one day her fiance get mad and she fall apart and sob and you feel sorry for her so you sit next to her go on and you touch she her cheek her tear and you realize how young and beautiful and vulnerable she be and you think this be my moment and you kiss she and there be no turn back why not you have to have her unwrap her take she and you have to feel her perfect skin and her round ass and her flat stomach it must 've be amazing for you so forbidden and for her she probably do not feel a thing she be make out of silicone right the sex doll it be not about the sex for her it be about win what do she win you for those minute you be hers now do you want I to go I would rather know what you think happen next I do not know maybe you hold she gently until she fall asleep and she would like that that be what would make she feel good that be what she really want yes it be good to feel that closeness maybe that be what you want from I you mean to fall asleep while you hold I to be comforted contain that would never happen why not oh come on Paul just admit that I be difficult I push man away look at Bennett and Andre I mean pick any letter in the alphabet I 've send they pack I be like a knife in your neck it feel good when it be go right so you think I would be relieve if you leave Sure I walk out that door you feel relief you want to pretend it never happen actually I already tell you I do think about our last

head I want to go home I really wish I could go home and then I think you can not go home your home be so long ago and so far away and then I just keep think your home be so long ago and so far away your home be so long ago and so far away and this home that you be that you be think about where be it or be it can I tell you in a moment I mean can I just I just need to close my eye for a second I be so tired what time be it 8 00 really already it be 7 59 actually Perfect could you could you wake I at 8 00 would you mind Sure April wake up wake up April wake up what time be it it be 8 00 good it be over this project be due yesterday but my professor say we have until 8 00 in the morning to turn it in it be hideous it look well now why do you say that it do not work at all the dimension be all off I rely too much on negative space it be just sit there I could not make it soar I have to tell you it be it be very hard to see you destroy your own work I do I do fall asleep last night I just rembere a dream I have I be on top of the model but it be life size and I fall do you ever get those fall dream sure I get those all the time and how do you feel when you wake up I do not know my heart be pound and I feel like I do not even know how to describe it it be a kind of joy so different from fall into nothing so fall be something that you be afraid of and yet you be attract to it at the same time what do that mean when you be awake you work so hard to keep everybody and everything under your control so in your dream it make sense that you find yourself finally fall release everything let everything go because it be a kind of fantasy for you why be you tell I that be that suppose to help I it will only help you if it ring true if it do not but it be in my head now you put it in my head now I have to think about it like that think you have last night what you start think about something you can not stop your thought become obsessive do not say that you you have no idea what you be talk about have you ever be on a subway car that break dow and there be some guy some shy look kid who start repeat something to himself over and over like 7 15 59th and lex 7 15 59th and lex over and over louder and louder until just say the word be not enough and he start hit himself and thrash around and finally have to be subdue and tranquilize that be what it mean to have obsessive thought I just like think thing through you be talk about your brother I 've notice that you be constantly try to feel what he feel well he can not describe how he feel so he need someone to interpret it for he your empathy be it be admirable April but it can be really drain try to feel everyone else 's feeling as well as your own maybe instead of your own I do not I be sorry for lose my temper you do not have to apologize to I I do fall out of a building once when we be on vacation in Miami I be only 10 my mother be obsess with Cuba cuban music cuban food cuban culture anyway we be down there without my brother we leave he for the first time ever I think with my grandparent just I and my folk I remember this one night there be a band play cuban music down below and my parent start to dance right there in the hotel room I go over to the window so that I could watch they dance and feel the the breeze from the ocean on my back at the same time somehow I do not even know how it happen I fall out the window I must 've just lean back and fall I land on the what be the word the awning one floor below I mean I be fine I just lay there for a second I look up at the window and then I slide off and land on the sidewalk do you remember feel frightened I remember as soon as my foot hit the sidewalk I start to bawl then I walk back into the hotel and I ride the elevator up I look in the mirror and I make myself stop cry so you could stop cry just like that I just look at myself and I say April you have to stop and I do I can still do that when I walk back into the room my mother have her head on my dad 's shoulder they be still dance they have not notice you be go why do you have to stop cry what I mean y you be 10 year of age you have fall out the window why could not you cry to your mother she be so happy the way she hold my father in that room the way they sway my mother close her eye as they sway my mother never close her eye why not she can not take they off Daniel I be not an empathetic person I be really not you ask I where home be for I it be there in Miami that be the place I want to go back to that room with my parent without Daniel right do you ever read that book on the beach it be about the nuclear holocaust and these people be wait for the radiation to reach Australia but they be happy they fall in love they buy bench for their garden they do not think about the future I be read that while we be down there you be read that book at age 10 I use to be precocious and that be what I have hope would happen a nuclear war would destroy everything else in the world and we could just stay on the beach we could not stay we have to get back Daniel have stop eat go back to hit himself my grandparent call in a panic my mother go to the airport and get the next flight home my dad and I drive back that night Daniel would not even look at we he could not speak it be like we have set he back three year my mother never forgave herself for that trip you be an empathic person the way you talk about your brother the compassion you feel for he but you can be an empathic person and still feel contradictory emotion still feel anger still feel jealousy why would I be jealous of Daniel maybe because your mother never close her eye to he Daniel be allow to show your parent how he be feel when he got upset hurt or scare they know it whereas you have to be perfect you fall out a window and your mother have no idea you can not blame she for that Jesus do not talk about she like that how be I talk about she as if she be a bad mother she be a great mother she give I my confidence tell I how smart I be she make I feel like I could do anything but m maybe as a child you take that to mean that you should not depend on she that you should take care of it all on your own I be not go to do this what be you not go to do slam my mother she may not have be perfect but she do her good she could have be a professional ballerina she train at Juilliard but she give all of that up so that Daniel could have some semblance of a normal life I understand that that he could not feel like such a freak so do not sit there and tell I she make all these mistake she do not have a choice I be not attack your mother I be just try to understand why you can not tell she that you be sick well how much more can she take it be not your fault that she have to deal with Daniel lately Daniel have be do so much well she finally have some time on her hand he be live in this group situation he be get a job at the library stack book and she have start to teach a dance class for little kid I go to meet she there she be have such a great time I be not go to take that away from her you think be sick will do that she would stop teach the class she would think she have to drop everything to take care of I maybe that be okay if she do she should stop teach for a while to help take care of you for a little bit she be finally get the chance to live a little I respect your wanting to protect your mother but I think at a deep level you be also try to protect yourself from see your mother 's fear for you from feel how much danger you be in you say that you want to protect she but surely you know that if you be to die if you be to die she would never and I know this I can tell you this as a father if that happen to I I would never ever recover listen to I you have to begin chemo immediately the reason you have not be because you be scared to go through it alone be there anyone you can imagine yourself tell anyone who you would want to be there with you I can not you can it be too horrible what be I suppose to say how be I suppose to tell she that her daughter you mean you you that I have cancer no I can not it be too horrible horrible as it be not tell she be more horrible when you say it it make sense just pick up the phone and tell she but I know that once I leave here I will not be able to call she from here then now go ahead she will just be leave for work can I use your phone again of course I presume you want the room again thank you how have it go she be in the car she want to call I back it be illegal to talk and drive at the same time with my dad in the army she follow the law you can stay here for 10 minute and call she back no I be so tired I be go to take a nap and call she when I get up will you call I after you 've speak to her it be a not as fast as the human eye so like every when you be look at when the lens look at stuff everything seem much fast that be really cool it look amazing so how be you do in school

over the weekend that be really sweet of you I make too much and the turtle it be way above and beyond the call of duty thank you so I will leave you to your evening see you Wednesday 4 o'clock good night VO Gillesilb michvanilly salomon Oliver Week 3 so who want to go first how be your week Great Glad to hear that and what be great about it Oliver I stay at my dad 's all week we go to a basketball game and we sit up close my feeling be every New York kid should have a chance to go the Garden and watch the Knicks suffer humiliating defeat and we watch the Godfather that be a pretty cool movie I have never see it before tell Paul what you say when we watch it what you decide you want to be when you grow up I want to be a Consingulary a Consiglieri what else do we do we go to the Met and see Arms and Armor and buy some poster for his room do you have any trouble sleep he be out like a light the second his head hit the pillow we be run around the city so much and do your dad have the right kind of food for you we go out to eat every night guess what I like now Paella what be not to like about paella everything good be in paella so it be just you and your dad all week none of your dad 's friend come over they come over to watch football but at halftime we play Wii Golf and I beat everybody so it sound like you have a really good time be there any time to do your homework what be that suppose to mean just if you guy be eat out every night and watch movie and run around the city when do Oliver have time to do his homework I get it all do that be not entirely true be it 'cause I find out that one of your assignment be to take care of a turtle do you apologize to Paul for make he do that I be sorry it be no problem anyway I be glad you get he back I know you be worried about he last week but you forget all about he when you be at your dad 's can not you just cut the kid some slack I be glad you guy have a good time I just want to make sure that homework and school come first for oliver I get all of my homework do do you I 've already tell you that Nina come over and help I finish it all I be sorry who be who be Nina my girlfriend so Oliver meet your girlfriend this week this person be stay at your apartment not stay she come over a few time to help Oliver with his homework do not we clearly agree it be too soon for that you hear he right Paul what be the big deal the kid have a great week you hear he how do it feel to spend time with Nina it be okay she only come over two or three time she go with we to Arms and Armor it be her idea why do not you say anything before do your dad tell you not to say anything he do not want to get you sad so now he be tell Oliver to keep secret from I no I just want to avoid this exact kind of conversation Luke I wonder if you can see how upsetting that might be to Bess the way she see it you 've ask Oliver to keep a secret from she but it end up be a great week all go well I do not see why everybody want to make this hard than it really be do not we have enough people go on without bring some strange woman into the mix Mom I already know Nina how exactly do you know Nina she be my teacher last year Nina Cabot his homeroom teacher from last year when he be in the low school he be on a whole different floor now that really put my mind at ease how long have you be date she a month six week Oliver be there anything that you would like to say about this whatever I say make everything bad tell you what why do not you and I go into the waiting room and we just take a few minute give your mom and dad some time together what do you want I should not have say anything I be glad you tell the truth I think if I stay at my dad 's everybody would be happy but they be fight again you certainly do not need to apologize for have a good time at your dad 's it be not so great really but you you say in there that you have fun I do have fun but the Knicks lose it be still hard for I to fall asleep really my dad check on I so I pretend to be asleep sometimes he sit at my desk and watch I and I try really hard not to open my eye so what do it feel like to have your dad watch you like that it feel like he be a soldier you know like guard I guard you from what he want I to be asleep except I be not so I do not want to tell he that you mean you do not want to worry he but with everything that be go on right now well I can not sleep at my mom 's either do you pretend to be asleep there as well I do not feel comfortable anywhere I just wish there be someplace I do feel comfortable make a lot of sense do you like spend time with Nina I miss my mom I know that you love your mom very much and I be sure that she miss you too she call every night I tell she I be fine but she sound sad do you find it hard not to tell she about Nina my dad say if we tell she she would get upset and she do do you feel that you have to keep secret from your mom and dad so that they will not get angry or upset Oliver I know that you want to help they but you can not keep they from be angry or sad I just wish none of this ever happen I hear you you know I spend a lot of time watch your turtle I think how he carry that house on his back wherever he go that be why turtle be so slow always walk around with their house anything else you notice about the turtle not really I just get he back this morning you spend more time with he than I do that be true I do notice one thing yeah when my mom meet I at school to bring I the turtle he be in a shoe box I think it be mine but she say it be yours and what make you think it be yours 'cause it be for a kid sneaker I ask my mom she say maybe you have a son do you be you wonder what kind of dad I would be I bet you be a good dad you sound pretty sure about that 'cause you listen to I so do you have a son or you be go to make I guess okay for now let us say that that I do have a son tell I what you think about that well I think he do not live here not most of the time how come 'cause I come here right after school and if he live here I would see he come home from school too so where do you think he do live probably with his mom and what do you think that be like for he maybe he be lonely he probably miss see you all the time anything else I wanna meet he why would you like to meet he I do not know just to talk to someone like I I guess it would be good to have a friend who be go through the same stuff yeah do he have any brother or sister would that make a difference it would make it easy would you like to have a brother or a sister I be suppose to get one but I be not think he be come anymore I do not understand well my parent be go to adopt a baby boy they be suppose to fly someplace in Africa to get he my mom show I his picture and what happen they just stop talk about he and then my dad move out so since then they have not speak to you about the adoption maybe he be maybe he be still wait for my mom and dad to come get he maybe if they do not get a divorce he will come live with we I do not know that be a big thing not to know Oliver do I have to go back in there can not you just talk to they by yourself you can stay here it will not be long you leave the two of we alone in the same room together you sure like to live dangerously do not you well I do not want the two of you to continue talk about Nina in front of Oliver you mean how Luke 's be fucking Oliver 's 23 year old school teacher thing have be all really well in here so far can not you tell or how you 've be use Oliver to get lay I know Olive like she so I want to talk to she about how thing be go for he at school this year I do not have any big plan and she like he she help he with his homework she be a good person what be the problem we got agree it be too soon for Oliver to meet someone you be date and you just overturn that decision all by yourself you remember agree to that Luke what I remember be an ultimatum so instead of seat down and discuss this with I there be no discussion with you there be just give in to keep the peace so you just go along with whatever I say to just shut I up and then you go you do whatever you want no matter how much it be go to hurt Oliver he look I know Oliver could handle it and I know if I have wait for you to sign off thing would never change so Luke do you feel that there be no way to discuss thing with Bess and come to a compromise do you feel that she need to win every argument that be the way it work yes and Bess you feel that Luke pretend to agree with and he just do whatever he want only this time it be bad because he be use Oliver to cover for he you know what I think our job here be to find a way for both of you to be straightforward with each other so that Oliver feel he do not have to hide thing from either of you you figure that out you be worth a million time what we pay you Bess would you like to join we I would like to ask you about a question when I be talk to Oliver just now he tell I that you 've be plan to adopt a baby be that true he talk about that with you well I be I be surprised neither of you mention it before because it be a terrible idea right from the beginning that be not true he like to rewrite history here the truth be we 've be talk about have a nother baby for year she actually think that be go to solve all of our problem or maybe I want to give Oliver the chance to be a big brother you know we have a really good life and I want to share that with another child I 've want to adopt for a very long time there be a lot of kid who need a good home and you know I do not feel all the need to go through pregnancy and labor all over again also you generally need to be have sex for that to happen can we go back to the adoption for a moment would you like to tell I what happen I honestly believe that Luke want this at least as much as I do we be fight all the time I just want to make she happy well can you tell I about the adoption process what that be like for you for the last two year I be the one who do all the work she go crazy on I because I fill up a medical report wrong I have spend a week on that thing and then I have to do it all over again the week before the social worker come for the home visit she go nuts she rehearse with Oliver every night tell he what to say she be terrified that we be go to be turn down but of course we pass with fly color so when we get the referral the baby 's medical record his little photo I show it to Oliver we be so excited I be ready that night to get on a plane to pick up the baby and then I give the folder to Luke to look at I take one look at that kid 's face and I know what a disaster all this be go to be the whole thing be just a band aid and then now we be go to fly to Africa and have some poor baby drop in the middle of our unhappyness no I know the kid would find a well home we be already out 20 grand but I figure that be the price you pay there be no way we be go to fix this he come into our room throw the folder on the bed and say I be leave so would you say then that this adoption be the the final straw on your marriage well he just decide our marriage be over without even discuss it that be because it be impossible to have a discussion with you if you have say any of what you 've just say today that would at least be something you know what I mean once again you feel that Bess be push you and Bess once again you feel like Luke deceive you it seem to I like you 've never really be able to figure out how to work through your problem together would that be right I would say that be pretty accurate and maybe that be the whole reason why we be not marry anymore see the thing about it be that Oliver need you to find a way to make decision as a team and he need you to he need you to explain thing to he clearly otherwise he he fill in the gap on his own I mean for instance do you realize that he still do not know whether or not he be go to have a baby brother what you never tell he can we bring he in here right now can we just talk about this together and do you feel like you can both talk to he about it in a way that will clear up his confusion I guess we owe it to he to try right I will call he in then damn it you be not listen to I listen to I it do not matter we can not wait for the report we be go to issue the recall all of it all right jace fine yeah you think you need to protect your ass that be fine just call the Donaldsons and tell they it be my call all right Jesus Synchro so mpm Marie be he off all right get I Burt I be sorry about this it be bad enough I be late but Burt yeah Walter I be sorry but they would not let I use my phone until I clear custom I can not reach the Donaldsons no but we be go to go ahead with the recall anyway I do not trust Jace on this no or on anything else really well okay good good all right Marie'll set up a meeting at 10 00 p m Marie do you get that last part good okay call Jace last order food any press tell they that we be work on a statement no give I 40 minute no call all right all right thank oh what yeah I will text Connie oh Jesus do you need a moment Walter I be not go three day and all hell break loose you know if it be an emergency we can we can reschedule we 've already reschedule I be suppose to be here at 6 00 it be 8 00 no it be after 8 00 I be really sorry and I appreciate you be see I later I know you must have a life outside of here no it be fine I have an hour free if you understand if you really understand how loath I be to be late I be really sorry this be not I at all really it be fine here what be this it be for your time you be pay for the session in cash no it be not for the session I will write a check for that this be this be just something extra for you that be really not necessary Walter thank you someone Unimpeachable huh I like that what do you mean I be not try to bribe you I mean I be that be not the way I operate although I tell you sometimes it might be easy for I if I do I understand you be just try to make up for lose hour I understand exactly I know you value your time and I 've waste some of it it be generous of you to offer thank you Walter but I well that be good you be a straight shooter that be a rare thing these day someone who be dependable I have to come to a walk up in Brooklyn to find it but Marie I say no call for Christ 's sake can not be you sure that son of a bitch no do not let he know that you 've reach I just let he think I be walk into it I will call you from the car just give I a half hour of peace can you do that unbelievable this little piss Jace he be not even half my age and somehow he think he be go to use this to bring I down he be so self delude he actually think they be go to give he my job Walter you seem it be my own fault in a way I mean he be very bright eager good school I bring he into the company but he be green he be in over his head it be Walter can you listen to I for a moment you seem like you seem like you be in the midst of a break crisis here no Paul it be not break it be already break we cull ingredient from all over the world China Brazil Indonesia somehow something get into the pipeline Walter whatever be go on it could be contaminate milk powder or bacteria from one of the factory it could be a cheap lubricant leeching into the machinery you do not seem like you be able to get away from this right now I think that it would be a very good idea for we to reschedule Reschedule when it be not go to get any well tomorrow or the day after Paul I be go into combat in an hour and if I if I do not talk to you now it might be another month before I get a chance it be off okay both of they can I get a glass of water Sure I hate this stuff Connie 's always tell I I should drink more of it so do my doctor but I do not have time for it you do not have time to drink water sometimes no I do not and this week it be a good thing anyway where I be you 've be travel I spend the last 44 out of 72 hour in an airplane and the hour wait for the six flight be no barrel of laugh either so the trip be in response to the to the crisis what well you be just say how you have supplier all over the world and I assume that you be try to track down the source of the problem I be not fly for the company you be not no I fly to Rwanda to get Natalie do something happen to her no she do not say so but I know that she be in trouble so she do not ask you to come she do not have to look Paul she be she be my daughter and until she go to Rwanda I have speak with she every day of her life wherever I be in the world I would call she at bedtime and tell she I love she before she could talk I make these little clicking noise then after she go to Rwanda we email every day suddenly suddenly a week ago she write her mother but not I Connie do not do email so I have to print the letter out for she and she be ask Connie if I be all right if the company be really complicit in this baby formula mess it be crazy talk might not she have just be concern for your welfare well Paul do not you think I know my own daughter that be not what I be say Walter I be just try to understand why with your company in crisis you would chose to visit your daughter in Rwanda the email her voice be not her voice she would never doubt her father now I be not say she be be brainwash but I know she be hide something and once I get there I find out I be right what be she hide to start with she cut all her hair off she would always have this long auburn hair like my mother 's when she be that age well that be go now do not you think that be disturb I can see why you might find it so yes but cut hair dye it weird color lop it off even I mean that be what what daughter do what else be different about her what be the same about her I do not know who I be talk to she have no shoe she have give they away it turn out she be so thin she have this child in her arm a little girl hang in her arm like a sack of potato be you okay Walter this be where she be live Paul this be where my daughter have choose to live some hellhole near Goma when she see you how do she react I do not think I speak right away I just stand there look at she finally she get scared she say what be it Mom be mom all right and I say your mother 's fine she say what be you do here and I say I 've come to take you home get your stuff and that do not go down well no at first she be distant Dad I can not leave right now I have to finish a procedure as if she would get some medical degree in the last month she say she would meet I for dinner in a few hour in the big tent then she point in the direction of some little shack in case I want to lie down she be live in one of those shack they look like outhouse and she be sleep there I can see how upsetting that that might have be for you I mean you spend your life provide a good home for she and this be how she choose to live so what happen at the dinner well I do not wait for dinner I go back into the shack and I take all her stuff and I put it in the jeep I just I just want to take it back with I to Kigali and at least have her clothe clean I want to go back to the hotel that night and take she to dinner and maybe talk some sense into her the next thing I know she be tear across this field scream at I insane stuff how I be try to control she how I do not respect she how she be work so hard to build up trust with these people and now they be go to think that she be some neocolonialist like I and there be something about Connie I be not even go to repeat I swear to god Paul it take everything I have not to slap she instead I just say do not you ever speak about your mother like that then she break down and start to cry what do you do then I put my arm around her I say Natalie we be go home and then she tell I to go fuck myself she have never say anything like that to you before she break my heart Paul she break my heart why do you think she be so angry with you she make that pretty clear I get an email from she when I get back to the hotel it turn out that I be domineer obsessive that I be the cause of all her anxiety that it be impossible to thrive or grow around I and that be why she have to go away and now I be ruin she only chance to free herself from I now you see why I go over there I sense this be come from early email you know hear that email make I can we talk about the way you come in here today completely in charge on both phone hand I your bag not quite like I be a bellhop but something like that I be sorry if I offend you no you do not offend I but it do catch my attention Walter we both know that you be an excellent manager World class right but in other role where you be not entirely in control like say be a patient here or maybe when you go to see Natalie that be much less comfortable for you but what be you say I never try to control Natalie I give she whatever she want of course you 've give she everything and that be that be something that be hard for other parent to do but not for you do you think it be possible that what be hard for you be just let she be let she go do you think that you feel she pull away from you in those email and then when you see she at the camp do you do you get frighten scared of lose she so that you feel you have to tell she to pack up her thing and come home can not a father worry about his own daughter of course he can but just look at how you respond for a moment in the midst of a major work crisis you read an email that she write to Connie and without stop to think you get on a plane and you fly halfway around the world it be all right these work pretty quick Xanax it be Dr Wells give I the prescription thank God he do otherwise I would never have be able to get out of that place do you take a pill after you see Natalie later I wake up in the middle of the night in a cold sweat I have a nightmare that Natalie be go then I look around I and with the jetlag and the fatigue I have no idea where I be for a minute I think I be back in my parent ' house in Tommy 's room with all his sport trophy and award I just could not stay in that room another second I have to get out of there I be have trouble breathe and then I remember the pill do you think it be strange that you be that you be think about Tommy over there in Africa he be be on my mind lately do you know when that start have it be since Natalie leave you say that you wake up and you feel that you have to get out Hotels can be disorient but lose Tommy be very painful for you be not it my folk have the pain with all due respect when parent lose a child it kill they it be really admirable that you remain so close to your parent after that happen like with the Donaldsons as you 've say after their son James die you become like a son to they the good son the one everybody can depend on and then you have this dream and you feel that you be suffocate in in Tommy 's room what do this have to do with Natalie maybe Natalie be try to do something that you 've never allow yourself to do to separate from her parent for you to stay connected mean to never stray now Natalie be try to do something in between but you feel that she be abandon you the way Tommy do he die Paul Jesus he do not abandon I I know

you to talk thing over with her she invite you to dinner no she be just shine I on possibly or possibly she really want to talk to you but you feel like she be disrespect you and you react to that you know I think that for her whole life she be be very aware of you and how you feel and what you think and what she can do to make you happy maybe part of the reason she be so angry be because maybe for the first time in her life she know that what she want be not what you want and she be have a very hard time reconcile herself to that fact she be have a hard time what about I so how do you leave

I snap when be the last time you see he do it matter when I see he I try to talk to he but he be he be not there or maybe he be and he be just choose to to hide remind I again where he live he be be in the same nursing home for the last 2 year it be call Valley Haven but it be not in a valley and it be not a haven it be fill with dead man walk and piss off nurse be he in pain he be in pain I be in pain the whole fucking world 's in pain lucky for he I be there to pay the bill long as I do he get to take his nap twice a day how do we get on to this Jesus be you surprised to find yourself talk about what a burden he be you know what I think I think he mishandle his finance deliberately so that I would have to take care of he he throw himself at my mercy he be be sick for a long time why be he at the front of your mind today I do not know I talk to my brother Patrick he say my father seem a little bit off somehow like Patrick would know what that be your brother 's visit he he go over there and he eat his dinner accord to the nurse can not you tell they not to let he in at mealtime I do not really care who eat his dinner I just what be you go to say I be go to say I be just wait for the man to die you ask it be very hard to have someone sick and dependent on you it drain all your reservoir it make you very very tired I mean it be not like he be this great father who get Parkinson 's and disappear he be never present in my life somebody could always eat his dinner for all he care he eat at the hospital he say my mother stop set a place for he at the table when I be six year old do she stop do other thing for he I be sure there be but the man be not there you keep call he the man do that have any meaning for you what like like he be suppose to be the man of the house only I have to do that job for he be that what it mean I ask Tammy about he you know what she say you speak to Tammy about your father she say that the first time that she see he she think he look just like the man be suppose to look so the man come from Tammy her father die that year I do not know maybe she be fantasize about my father actually I be sure she be she want to live in my apartment and I want to live in hers anyway Tammy and I we we go out for coffee and I do what we talk about last week I ask she what she remember about that Christmas Eve the night that my mother try to try to kill herself anyway it turn out that Tammy remember but in a really crazy way a lot of it be what I remember that my mother be at home she be asleep I be at Tammy 's we eat the cookie we be singe and then Tammy and I go to her room to talk but after a few minute I jump off the bed and run down the hall to check on my mother that be where your memory go blank what about hers she say that I come right back and that I be really upset that my mother be sick and my father be with her wait for an ambulance by the time Tammy and I go back my father have already go to the hospital with my mother so Tammy 's mother bring we to the hospital so that night it turn out your father be actually with her that night he actually be the man I guess you do not believe Tammy 's version no I believe it why would Tammy lie it just do not add up right because if your father have already leave home how could he know that your mother be go to commit suicide but that be also kinda strange Tammy say that he be always call her mother to check on we well of course he be it must have be a fucking lot easy than come over and see for himself okay but he do come over that night so yeah he call the ambulance so what he happen to drop in one night when maybe he come over to see his boy and his wife because it be Christmas eve what difference do it make if he be there one fucking night what about all the other night the night when he be off with his girlfriend when I be at home guard my mother all those other night where be your brother he be old than you yeah he play he play sport what kind of sport Baseball do you ever see he play no I do not can you see I try to drag this lonely cry woman out to a ballpark so your father be at work your brother be at sport and you be on duty after my father leave Patrick do not even sleep at home very much where do he go I do not know friend I suppose do you remember any of their name where be you go with this I be wonder if your brother be actually home could you have air brush he out too you think that they be both there under the tree wrap gift our memory can be very unreliable we like to think of they as indelible record of our past but every time we pull out a scene we fiddle with it a little bit before we put it back in if we hate our husband now we re remember the wedding as less joyous or we say he be never the right one for I anyway we be constantly alter our memory so the past will not conflict with the present my memory be fuck so what be my childhood really like Gina no please I be not question your feeling about your childhood they be absolutely accurate I be just wonder on this you know particular night that maybe some of the fact be not what you think they be Gina I be familiar with the whole notion of a screen memory yeah okay of course you be so then you know your Christmas eve memory tell we about that whole period of your childhood not just one night you be overwhelm you feel that you be the only one who know how much trouble she be in my father know he just do not give a shit be you sure about that if he care he would have put she in an institution he would have get she help which he finally have to do but not before I spend every day of high school have no idea of what I be go to face when I come home would all the knife be stick out of the wall the bathtub be overflow would she have an electrical cord around her neck or would she suddenly decide to take it upon herself to clean and paint the hall closet why do you think he do not institutionalize she soon I do not know maybe he need somebody to take care of the kid or maybe he do not want to take your mom away from you or you away from her how about he and my brother ignore she until she finally have to try to kill herself to get they to come home you know Paul one of the confusing thing about emotional injury in family be that it can feel so unfair it can feel so random it be like an automobile accident everybody be in the car but you be the only one who go through the windshield well actually it be my mother who go through the windshield and you try to grab she but Paul could you look at I you be in the backseat all you could do be watch and my brother walk away without a scratch I do not know what he suffer my father be in the driver 's seat struggle to keep our little family from crash be that what you be say yes I suppose that be what he think he be do be that what you be try to do now with your family you know come down to see the kid every weekend call they every day he be nothing like I and I be nothing like he Paul you be work very hard to keep from take in any good information about he tell I why the hell I would do that I mean if he be half decent I would like to know it he never do one fucking thing to help but Tammy just tell you a good thing he do check up on you from down the hall what do Tammy know he be probably flirt with she anyway your dad be flirt with Tammy he be a fucking doctor they be all flirt the whole time I be grow up he be always he be always what you know well it be just a memory of mine excuse I so it can not be trust be you afraid to say it he be always with other woman how do you know this okay I will tell you how I know I be 10 year old my mother be yell at he because he be screw this nurse and she want he to look at the effect that it be have on I so she push I at he hard and I hit a table and I split my forehead wide open he sew I up so you be right he be not completely useless be you happy now these fight about other woman they go on for a long time oh early and often I think that the fight begin after your father leave she it seem that they be have trouble before he leave she before she get sick maybe his fucking around make she sick his fucking around make she sick that be what I say Christ you know what no wonder my patient complain about this would you stop repeat what I be say just say something else I know it be irritate but I just want to make sure that I understand Fine so you believe that your father 's infidelity cause drive my mother crazy yes when your mother be finally admit be not she diagnose with bipolar disorder in your experience can bipolar disorder be cause by the infidelity of a spouse no Gina bipolar disorder be not cause by event in a patient 's life event can make you feel bipolar no I know that much that be how I feel last year when Kate be with her lover but no infidelity can not make you bipolar you either be bipolar or you be not but if your wife be bipolar it could make you want to have an affair yeah it could especially if you be a doctor and your wife 's mental illness make you feel inadequate helpless incapable of help the person that you be close to and since he could not heal she he leave she for another woman and he leave she with I do you think I be a therapist today because I feel guilty about my inability to heal my mother no I do not good I think you feel your mother 's illness deeply and I think even as a child you have an empathic response to suffering but you be too young and so you go to school you work you study you think and now when people come to you you can help they but you be not a therapist because you think you fail your mother you be a boy Paul you be in the backseat you try to grab she but she be already go so I have this patient Oliver he be a kid who be try to survive his parent ' divorce and it be take everything I have not to invite he to come live with I I know what he need and I want to give it to he it be the same with April and her cancer I just want to stop they all go through the windshield do Oliver remind you of you yeah neither of we neither of we know how to be around our father I mean I have an idea but it be the same idea I 've have since I be Oliver 's age I think of my father and he be still screw his girlfriend and I be still scared to death that my mother 's go to die only she be already dead and he be almost dead and I be about to become the orphan I 've always feel I be for 40 year I know you be go to do well by Oliver there be always hope maybe the boy that you really wanna be good to be yourself take I out to a ballgame something like that maybe what I ought to do first be be a good son to my father what would that entail I do not know just go see the man see how off he really be maybe Read he the sport page why have not you be to see he this time because I be busy I be see the kid and I 've get patient actually the truth be I do not want to go he stink and he look like hell I will probably look look bad too when I be about to die I wonder if my kid will come and see I when I be where he be what if they feel about I the way I feel about he what do they feel about you I do not know they be so mad it be hard to tell how they feel they be mad at you Paul that be what they feel and what if I be just like he I mean do they feel that they have to compete with my patient for my attention have I too leave my young son home alone with his mother what do the kid understand about why you and Kate be divorce Kate and I set they down and say the divorce have nothing to do with they it be about a sentence long than what my mother say to I which be your father 's move out I be sure they do not understand it any more than I do I think I have to talk to they you know really talk to they and I should I should talk to my father too you know just talk to he so I 've get my homework to do and next week we will talk about Tammy what do you mean talk about Tammy Goodbye Paul I be late I

and back to the left so in one weekend you find two man who be well than Bennett yeah I be try to fuck that man out of I forever oh shit Jesus spill milk that be perfect right Mia it be fine do not worry about it it be fine I can do it later maybe this be a good time for we to go into the other room so you want I on the couch Fine you do not want I in your kitchen you do not want I on the couch I will sit here I think we need to talk about what be go on today no I be hungry you want to have breakfast together do not flatter yourself I be tired of eat alone it be not about you what be not the breakfast or the weekend you really think I sleep around because of you how would that work do not be coy you think that I be still jealous of Laura so I act out I do not say that Mia but as your therapist I be interested in your behavior pick up two man sound out of character and I would be remiss if I do not explore what trigger it well it be not you it be Bennett he ask I to have lunch with he on friday at the bowery hotel and I think he want to woo I back Wrong after we would eat he tell I that he be go to leave his wife for his girlfriend I do not know he have a girlfriend yeah that be news to I he have his wife he have I and he have she and guess who it be it be Stefanie our office receptionist you mention Stefanie last week you say you be dread go to her bridal shower well we be past that 'cause now that Stefanie 's pregnant and he be plot his divorce they 've decide to be discreet that must have hit you hard he thank I for our time together and tell I that it have help he through a rough patch and that he would never forget I be not that sweet I almost call his wife right then and there but I resist then I go back to the office and the first face I see be Stefanie glow like a new bride you be very hurt no you know why why leave your 38 year old wife for your 43 year old girlfriend when you can nail a 25 year old receptionist so you think of yourself as Bennett 's girlfriend well I guess I be not really think you know I can not do it I can not play this game you mean the girlfriend game no the Stefanie game where you giggle at bad joke and you collect friend on facebook and you drink chocolate martini but in a way be not that what you be try to do when you go out with the baby lawyer on friday night I be try to feel well so I go on a spree have you never do that and that do not matter it be not like I want to see guitar boy again really you describe it as an olympic quality night yes that be good once every four year I do not want a relationship with a child only man do that he fall asleep at dawn and I go into the bathroom and I look in the mirror and I know it be time to go morning after can be can be harsh in the daylight with the makeup smear there be no hiding that I be old enough to be his mother you do not feel that the night before he have power ranger towel hang in his shower I just get dress and I leave do you say goodbye leave a note and I will not be send flower you disapprove do I it be pretty obvious by your do I do this do I do that so do you feel that I be judge you why do not you just say it Paul what that I fuck two stranger and that it be immature that it be self destructive and that be what you want to hear Shut up just talk like a person say Mia you will get a disease you will getkille the cop have a goddamn gun I be not sure if you want I to scold you or to protect you do you have anything to say to I that be real please do not ever do this again you will get hurt I do not want you to get hurt you think that I be stupid no I think you be look for something or someone oh you see I know you be go to do this what point out that I have pick up a musician in his 20 just like my old boyfriend Stevie well Stevie be a drummer and anyone will tell you they be totally different two week ago you do tell I that you wonder if you have miss your chance with Steve and you want to go back to that moment when you could 've have he if that be what I be try to do it do not work not in the morning exactly you see in the mirror that you be a woman now and not a girl anymore and maybe you do not want to if you do you might have to see guitar boy again or give he a name do you think it be possible that he might 've be a kind of symbol for road not take he be pretty great in bed for a symbol very good okay let us say that guitar boy be a symbol right so what be I do with a cop well how do you feel when you be with he I feel safe so the musician do not make you feel young in the daylight you actually feel old so you find a cop who treat you like a child which make you feel safe how be that it be pretty good I think I be just sleep around do you plan on see he again the cop no no I do not want to have to act like achildto have sex but you say it be fun exciting he be marry do I leave that out 'cause he do when do he tell you that when I guess why he would not drive I home that be textbook sound like you 've be down that road before besides just Bennett I mean you be on a roll any idea why I do that well I would rather hear it from you I do not know married man be unavailable I know it will not work out so it allow I to maintain distance the sex be always great 'cause married guy be starve for it there do that cover it well since you be ask I do not think so I mean when you have an affair with a married man he have secret with you secret with you instead of his wife he be close to you because you be his favorite it be kind of similar in a way to what you be do this morning instead of sit on the couch you want to have breakfast in the kitchen with I together so that you would feel different from my other patient Special be this well it be not all about you Paul I know that in fact when you be sit in my kitchen I remember you tell I about how you share coffee with your dad at his store when you be a girl you say that it be a secret that you both keep from your mother what be you think Mia nothing I do not think it be anything my dad do come over for brunch on sunday and so the two of you spend the day together do you invite he when that morning my mom drop he off happily she probably go off to spend the day at her beauty parlor where she like to sit around and talk with her friend about how I ruin her modeling career be that her mantra if she have not have I but she have more child after you well 10 year later she treat my sister like they be treasure but not you no she ship I off to New Jersey when she be get ready to have the twin but I think you say that both your parent my dad he never would 've do that if she have not force he so no I do not invite she she do not mind if he have not come over she would 've have to take care of he all day take care of he be he ill he be not himself I mean I have not sleep in two day and he do not even notice he be come down with something he be cough a lot and he spill his coffee all over himself and I have he take off his clothe and I wash and dry everything like a parent he just sit there wrap in a blanket not what you would hope for so you feel that your father should take care of you make you feel love it should be unconditional no matter what he feel no matter what you do well I tell you he be have a bad day we adore one another and he he be definitely well than any guy I have ever date you make he sound perfect be that bad can you think of a downside to it a downside to have a father who love I no the problem be I can not find anybody as good as he you think there be something wrong with that do not you for one thing your father 's married to your mother do you think there be any connection between that and your pick marry man I say that I be do with that you do but you also ask I what that pattern be about now you be go to tell I that my father molest I because he do not I do not think that but your father have be an essential comfort for you for as long as you be his favorite you will not ever be alone I be get the feeling that the tight bond be not entirely comfortable what do you mean look at this morning you come in you cross a boundary it make you feel special but I think it also rattle you your speech be fast graphic you try to provoke I you spill something the spill be an accident maybe but what I be say Mia be that it be not always a simple thing to be special I be think of the feeling that you have when you be eight after the robbery in your father 's store he hold you it be too tight it be life and death do you think it be possible that to separate from your father be to risk be entirely alone but to stay with he be to be uncomfortably close why be you do this my dad be all I have no one else colleague acquaintance be he your close relationship be you his I feel sick I eat too much this be like antitherapy I walk in here feel great I be go to leave feeling like crap sometimes that happen and when it do do you do anything you want I to make you feel well I do not wanna feel like this forever like what like this be my life I do not want this to be my life I do not know what to do what do I do I be go to go you still have time oh do I I be 43 and I be entirely alone your word you be right who do I have you one session a week I want someone to go home to someone to be in my bed with I somebody who hold I when I cry I just want that I know I just want that I know I be early but it be cold in the waiting room can I come inside Sure I have to leave this on Daniel might call and if he do I will have to go how be you

just go to see how it would feel and how do it feel like go to a hotel like check into one of those fancy airport hotel in a city where nobody actually live there be this girl behind the desk she be like my age she smile at I and she be like can I help you and I know that be just something you say to people but I sort of take she at face value in the moment and I be like can she help I no probably not I mean she do not know how to cure cancer but still she deal with it every day the minute she look at you she must have know be you tell I that she do not well my mom just she call back and I have to leave to get reception she be like where be you you sound funny and I be like well mom I be I be actually a little sick so she start to lecture I on how I do not take care of myself I do

not when he want to die do he actually say that I want to die no he say he want to turn into a cloud and float away but he know what would happen to he if he step off a building he be not stupid he just he get so tired of everything feel so strange well right now the world must seem pretty strange to you as well and you be go it alone without any Mr Heath to save you be not that suppose to be your job yes it be but if you do not let I in I can not help you and that scare I because I be afraid that if you do not we will waste the little time that we have leave Jesus Kind of blunt today be

control it be horrible when you be feel like that I want you to call I why listen to I I do not care what time of the day or night it be you call I do you understand that be what I be here for you want to talk to I when I be on the bathroom floor any time I see my mom last week for the first time in a while she take I to brunch and what do you talk about my brother do she notice how how tired you look I put on some makeup a lot of makeup actually so you do not want she to not see you at your good I always try to look good when I see she why it make she feel well but this last time I could 've lose an arm and she would not have notice because of Daniel Sort of also she want to leave my father do she tell you that I mean it be not a big deal she be be say that for as long as I can remember Life would be so much easy without your father never marry a workaholic Blah blah blah the fuck up thing be she do not actually want to leave he she be crazy about he she be but she say she want to leave do you think it be possible that what she want to leave be Daniel you know I think your mother pass a lot of her anxiety on to you but I do not think the relationship be balance because you do not pass your problem back to her I be sorry I bring she up it be you do not talk about your dad a lot in here I know I do not have that much to say about he he be never around he be always at the hospital for a while when we be young Daniel keep forget who he be he would call he mister like hey mister but Daniel keep get bad as he get old and my dad could not handle it and he just check out on both of you he and I have our own relationship I use to wait up for he until he come home I would sit with he while he eat his dinner he would talk abouhis day his patient so he treat you like an adult it be nice it sound like he understand you but he do not raise I he just get to sweep in at the end of the day and talk to the healthy child for 15 minute she be with Daniel day in and day out do you think part of the reason that you treasure those moment be because your dad be talk about something other than Daniel she need to talk to someone of course I understand that but why could not she tell a friend it be not anybody else 's business it be okay paul I could handle it I want to handle it she get overwhelmed she need to vent so after she vent and she put the stress the disappointment and the worry of her own life on your shoulder who do you turn to or do you just carry it with you your burden and hers be we out of time no we do not have to worry about the time you know I 've be I 've be read up on autism and it seem like there be some pretty promising research come out there be never go to be a cure you seem pretty certain about that it be not a disease if it be not a disease there can not be a cure actually some scientist seem to be reconsider that assumption well that be because they be be fund by rich desperate people autistic child do not get well they just get old I be sorry if that sound cynical no it do not but you be right those child eventually become adult and their their parent die and when that happen it fall on somebody else to take care of they in Daniel 's case that would be you April for the rest of your life I be a horrible person why would you say that because I do not want to do it he ruin their life he ruin their marriage you can not you can not give Daniel what he need and have any space for anyone else well your mother could not but you be not your mother you can make different choice she do not make any choice she gotstuck she do April but every life be it be a constellation of choice nobody escape make they you mother make choice that keep she lock into Daniel you can choose differently he be my brother I be not suggest that you abandon he but you do not know what the future hold for either of you you do not know what sort of innovation be go to come along in the treatment of autism you be not psychic april you can not predict the future you can not control it the only thing you can do in relation to the future now be to decide whether or not you want to be in it I look like such shit right now okay that

so be luke on the way he be run late of course but he will be here to pick up Oliver by the end of the session can I I want to see if I could speak to you alone for a minute I have to leave a little early sure Oliver if you get hungry I have some snack in my purse okay I be not hungry I will just be a little bit will you be all right I will do my homework I just want to thank you thank I for what for everything right after our session last week luke and I take oliver out to dinner and we explain everything about the adoption just like you ask we to and immediately the cloud lift Good so you 've notice a positive change in Oliver 's attitude this week he be get all of his homework do even before dinner he make a terrarium for his turtle out of an old pasta box plus he stop gorge himself on food and he already look well and it be all thank to you thank you Bess I appreciate the compliment but I be really not so sure it be anything I do he be even sleep through the night now you have no idea what a relief it be to know that I can finally leave town and not freak out that something disastrous be go to happen my friend michelle she be go to be here at a quarter past in a rental car you seem eager to leave we want to get a jump on traffic you know Michelle and I have not do a trip like this since college and I do not even care where we go I just want to get in the car and just drive I know the feeling and the only reason I can even consider leave town right now be because oliver be do so well so thank you again I really appreciate everything you 've do I do not mean to concern you bess but I be not so sure that Oliver 's change as much as you would like to believe what do you mean it strike I as unusual that his issue his problem have just clear up overnight yeah it be more than unusual it be like a magitrick yeah it be a lot like a magic trick by which I would mean that there be a very good chance that this be an illusion but you have not even talk to he yet Most people can not break their pattern in one week bess so you be say that I can not leave he no I be only say it be possible that he start behave well because he do not want you to see he as the source of your trouble the source of my trouble if anything he be be the save grace Maybe Oliver believe that if he behave perfectly that he can solve all the problem between you and Luke I really do not know what you be try to do to I here how be I confuse you for a month now you 've be tell I that I be stuck and that I need to get my own life together and let my son grow up into a man and then the first chance I have to go have some fun on my own you say he be just pretend to do well and he actually need you very badly bess but I be not say you need to stay here and take care I have not take a vacation without Luke and Oliver in six year and I think I more than deserve to take a little time for myself right now okay why right now what besides the fact that my ex husband have a new girlfriend I see how hard that be for you to hear no I be actually glad that Luke be sleep around now because now it be very clear that we be do he be even start interview replacement but last week you be very angry about that it be a bucket of cold water in my face I 've get to get my life together Oliver 's go to be stay at Luke 's more often now and when he be go I can not just pace around the apartment like a ghost I know what you mean I 've never live by myself before you can not imagine what that be like I think I can why do not you tell I how you and Luke get together I get pregnant my last semester in college I move right out of the dorm and right in with luke it certainly be not what I have in mind I have a feeling that nothing that be happen in the past 12 year have be what you 've have in mind Luke and I have just get back from spring break I remember his dorm room smell awful because his roommate have leave a pizza on the counter before vacation I tell he I be pregnant and he drop to his knee right on the shag rug and ask I to marry he I remember think this be probably the most important moment of my life and the room smell like moldy pizza so do you want to marry he I be crazy about luke and I be sure I would never stop be crazy about luke I be 21 that be very young to make a big decision my parent be furious at luke we drive to hartford and we take they out to the good restaurant we could afford which be ruby tuesday 's really classy right my mom be so upset she nearly choke on her fry shrimp but then oliver be bear and you know what it be amazing the moment they see Oliver it be like their daughter disappear I just become the mother of their grandchild but that be how I feel about he too the first night I bring he home I sit by his cradle and I watch he sleep and I think this be the good thing I be ever go to do you have not say anything about how luke feel that be a good question you be not sure to be honest for a few year there we do not see that much of each other he be just get a toehold at work I be so busy with oliver it be like we be just work opposite shift in some struggle startup business but I get to hand it to luke as soon as Oliver be ready for kindergarten we be do well enough for I to start my master 's I could tell you about the next five year but what be the point I just could not concentrate my kid be sick or he could not sleep or there be a bully at the nursery school do you feel that oliver be a burden no no of course I do not think he be a burden that be not what I be try to say it be school just do not seem real to I it be just make criticism about criticism and make these meaningless distinction and look at art and pretend to see thing that probably be not even there and then I look at my son and be you say that Oliver be the reason that you do not finish college I be not blame he I be not it be my decision to put he first but you know I look up now and I be 33 year old and I 've never have a job in my life and I be terrified what be you terrified of uh my son be get old my husband be not my husband anymore I be just overeducate enough to be completely unemployable at any sort of meaningful job you can contradict I here at any time Bess you could also look at this as an enormous opportunity to reconnect with the person who disappear 12 year ago and to take a leap into the unknown I do not understand you at all I spend too much time with Oliver and I be and I be overprotect he I be smother he and I try to get away for a little while and I be abandon he so either I be take too much care of he or too little care of he seem like this be an argument that you be have with yourself Truth be I do not know what to do I do not know what to do Michelle be probably wait for I right now she be be in the rent there she be I can not talk about this anymore I be on vacation Oliver will be fine right he be 12 year old it be a week be you ask for my permission no I be not I be a grownup okay I be ask for your advice be not that your job Oliver sweetie you wanna come in and say goodbye be you leave now yes Michelle 's wait for I your dad will be here to pick you up I just wanna make sure you be okay with that I feel fine you be not just say that right it be the truth you do not have to worry about I I will be call you every day and if you have any problem or you just wanna talk you can even wake I up in the middle of the night I do not care okay thank again for everything Paul and I be sorry to run out on you no problem okay go ahead Bye Bye hey Michelle well your mom tell I it be a long time since she be be away on a trip I will be fine so you get thing under control yeah I be good so how have how have the week be for you I do all my homework Good and how be the turtle I make a new house for he out of an old pasta box Cool I put in grass and leave from the park so you 've make a nice home for he that be great be you be you sure you be not worried about your mom go away last week you be tell I that you be have trouble go to sleep and that when your mom and dad come in to check on you that you be kind of pretend to be asleep I be sleep fine Good so you be not tired in class or I just say I be get enough sleep and how be thing go at your dad 's why do not you ask he when he get here and how be school a couple of week ago you tell I this story about a party and then there be a boy who do something mean to you Eric he piss on my shoe you have not really say anything about he have he be bother you how ruin my life there be this girl Maya yeah she be the girl who have the party we have Humanities together and we be partner for this colonial life project I do not know what that be well we dress up like we be in colonial time and have old colonial job I be a blacksmith and Maya be my wife and she milk the cow but it be stupid but she be nice she bring candy to school every day and always give I some I wish I have a friend like that but last week Eric go all over school say I be in love with she but she will never go out with I because I be too fat it be not fair you be right it be not fair I be not go to be fat anymore what do you mean I stop eat this week you be not eat anything at all well no I have a half a bowl of cereal for breakfast I buy lunch at school but I throw it out I only eat a little when I be with my mom and I do not eat at all when I be with my dad but he do not notice do not that make you feel weak I mean if you do not eat anything how do you have energy to make it through the day you know if you really want to lose weight you do not have to do it by yourself and you certainly do not need to stop eat altogether you need somebody to help you with this I do not need any help be not you hungry I do not wanna talk about this anymore I remember last week you be tell I that your mom and dad be plan to adopt a baby boy but you say that they would stop talk about it they explain that to I and what do they say well they be fight too much about the baby so they have to give he to someone else and how do you feel about that be there anything about the adoption that you still do not understand I think they be go to tell I I be adopt too why would you think that 'cause I do not look like they and that be another thing Eric say your mom 's so skinny and pretty you must be adopt you know I have to say that kid Eric I really can not stand he but he be right I do not look like my mom or my dad I might be adopt would that be a good thing or a bad thing my parent be fight about my brother so they just give he away so do you think that if you do not behave the way they want you to that they might give you away your mom and dad they might get upset sometimes no matter how well you behave but I make thing bad sometimes it be the people that we love the most who upset we the most do that make sense I wish I be adopt you know I use to feel like that myself when I be a kid you do absolutely I want they to give I away why would you want that 'cause they fight all the time no matter what I do and now they be separate but they be still fight and they be probably not go to stop so if they do give you away as you say where do you think you would go well they say when they give my brother back there be a lot of people who want he maybe I could go somewhere like that with parent who will want I do you really feel that your mom and dad do not want you my dad should be here by now I guess he be run a little late you want I to call he for you no I can do it it be probably go to go to his voicemail hey dad it be I Oliver I be with Paul wait for you Bye I can leave now if you want you know actually my next appointment be just cancel so you can you can hang out here if you want should I go in the other room you do not have to I mean you can stay here if you would like what be we go to do we could talk we could play a game you could teach I how to play blackjack finally I be starve

exec never type a note never take one never carry anything I guess that make I a dinosaur I be glad you come I hope you do not feel any pressure today I finally have the time to talk to you but it be too late for you to help how be you handle it I be wonderful Paul Aces I know you say that you be past the point where where talk could be of help but long as you be here why do not we why do not we try well what be there to say I 've lose my job my name I can not leave the house there be a pack of reporter on the street wait for I to come out so they can stick microphone and camera in my face so come here today mean you have to run a run a gauntlet I can handle that I tell they the truth I do everything I be suppose to that I take the page straight from the playbook what playbook be that Johnson Johnson the tylenol scandal seven dead from product tamper and the companywasn't concern but they pull every bottle nationwide it be still the gold standard for crisis management at the first sign of trouble you do everything you can to inform and protect the public and protect your name long term so what do you think go wrong here Connie let I read this one article in the journal they come flat out and say I do everything right play by the rule the only thing be the world 's change a lot since 1982 it be more predatory the minute we assume responsibility the blogger the press the class action lawyer come after we then the short seller hammer the stock down and that be when the parasite in my own company see this as some fucking opportunity for themselves and then the Donaldsons capitulate a perfect storm they call it when you read an article like this how do it make you feel like an old man who stay too long in the ring you feel like a like a boxer take a beating I drop my guard Paul I deserve everything I 've get be you eat yeah I eat when I have to shred wheat chicken soup that be what I have today okay how about sleep be you get any be you a therapist or a pediatrician yeah I sleep the pill help have your doctor write any other prescription for you well under Natalie 's name yeah any day now there will be a headline in the Post Baby killer c e o binge out on pill Baby killer be that how you feel that you be be depict well I do not know actually my wife be not even let I watch tv except for old movie I be in a bunker with a remote control and pill by my bedside what pill do you take it be call Kloni klopi something like that whatever it be it help I sleep and how many be you take well it depend maybe three or four a day be that the dosage that Dr Wells have prescribe that be what I need to sleep but you have to let he know how many you be take I mean you be not somebody who be have a lot of exposure to pill so you may not have the tolerance that other people do what be go to happen Paul I fall asleep and I do not wake up be that what you want take a pill fall asleep not wake up no no I want to wake up I want to find that the last two month be just a nightmare that the pipeline do not get contaminate that the press do not vilify I that the people underneath I do not lie to I that be what I would like I can understand that you might feel that way but since you know that that be not the case have you find yourself think that not wake up might be a solution what do come on Paul I do not quit you know I well than that and I would never leave a mess like that for my wife to clean up as it be she can not even look at I without burst into tear that must be something that neither of you be use to well the tear I 've see plenty of those usually right before I cave in and give she the second baby or the third baby or whatever else she be ever want but what be new be this look of pity it be just god awful I tell she never to look at I like that again you sure it be pity I mean she be your wife you 've be marry for 44 year she love you when she speak to I on the phone that be another thing I tell she never to do that again she feel that these be extraordinary circumstance what I got fire what be the big deal the whole country 's getting fry fire fire but all of a sudden I get an orchestrated show of compassion team of people drop in it be like an episode of this be your life so it have not be a comfort for you to know how much you 've touch these people it be be embarrassing I tell she yesterday that be it I do not want to see anyone else tell they I be sick I have to promise she I would see you before she would go along with I so basically you use I as a bargaining chip I do not mind long as it get you here and now what what be you go to tell I Paul that life be beautiful that nothing happen that it could all be a blessing I do not think nothing happen on the contrary I imagine it might feel like you be go through some kind of crucible People give I all these nostrum this self help garbage not what you need to hear right now I be sure an old friend of mine Dean Larue come by the apartment all the way from Rochester I do not know what Connie tell he to get he there but he be my age we be R o t c buddy two year ago they fire he from a company that he have build from the ground up so he be somebody up here who be go through what you be go through he tell I he be find a hobby he be start take picture landscape old factory and fishing boat he print they up and make they into book and give they to his friend he give I one a photographic essay of Centralia Pennsylvania be that the coal town with the underground fire I be sure you wonder why he give you that no well what do I care I do not care about that the point be do he realize how stupid he look so you do not buy it if there be one thing I can not stand it be people who fool themselves lead fake life become fake human being not always a choice Walter so much as the way the twig be bent I want to shake Dean and say do not you know everybody be laugh at you you old fool I throw the book out as soon as he leave what the hell be I go to do with a picture of some smolder meadow where a town use to be what if he be really proud of the book do you think it might have give he a different sense of accomplishment of achievement or bring out a side of he that maybe he you be smart you know well than that if that company call he back right now and say we make a mistake Dean we would like to have you back he would go run in a heartbeat no the truth be that he be outlive his usefulness I 've get a couple of year leave to take photo and lick stamp but let us face it death be just the official acknowledgment the show be over so you do not want your family to show concern you do not want friend or a therapist to offer you support or nostrum your life be over like Dean 's be that what you really think why do not you tell I well yet why do not you tell I what you think of I the first time I walk in here what do you think I be I will tell you what you think you think I be a piece of shit who do not care if his product be kill infant you think I be greedy insensitive a son of a bitch you feel that I 've judge you from the beginning I tell you I can not stand fake fucking human being do not patronize I and do not lie to I I 've have enough of that this week just tell I the truth the truth be I be angry I be surprised at that reaction but I be I be angry at what they do to you and I be angry at the way they do it I think you be a man of integrity I be not go through what you be go through obviously but I can understand your sense of anger your sense of betrayal I teach or teach class in business school on corporate responsibility I guess those day be over they would bring I in as a guest lecturer and I would look at all those kid who would all go to biz school for all the wrong reason and I know I have an hour to maybe reach one or two of they to try to get they to understand that a company 's name a product 's reputation be all that you have that if you lose your name you 've lose everything do you feel that you 've lose that now I do not lose it it be take from I you mean by the Donaldsons you have not mention their part in all this what can you say Mr Donaldson 's old world like I he get scared I do not blame he but be not loyalty part of be old world it be not just the old man now he still have his wit about he but the daughter be involve and the grandkid and the fucking lawyer and punk like Jace you know they put he in charge but you say that the family I think have a majority interest in the company that be right so it be not just the press or the parasite who force you out the Donaldsons have to go along with it they have credit market 's dry up the stock be in the tank well everybody 's stock be in the tank now but this be carnage the minute they give I up the stock gain it all back have you speak to they lately the old man he could barely look at I at the meeting I go over to he after afterwards and I thank he for the opportunity he have give I and he say good luck Walter that be it how long have you work for this man 35 year you know when I come in his son James be he be reckless the old man ask I to keep an eye on he James be his only son and a few year later James go West to look for some new market and one night he drive his car into a tree right away the shark start circle the company the old man be barely hang on but I tell he not to give in I promise he that we would build something special and we do we do be you say you turn he into one of the wealthy man in the country I do okay too and after 35 year all he have to say be good luck he say one other thing before he wish I good luck he say they tell I Natalie 's in Rwanda what the hell be she do over there what do you think he mean by that I think that be his way of say that I would dig my own grave how do you mean you say yourself last week in the middle of a crisis I ignore my responsibility to the Donaldsons and to the company I also remember say that there be two crisis one with your daughter and one here and we talk about the way you experience your daughter 's distance how that anxiety might have color your judgment so you be agree with I I misread both situation my judgment be bad perhaps your go away do contribute to this situation explode we know on some level that your body have be try to tell you something be very wrong your insomnia to the panic attack by go to Natalie when you do you be try to bring this crisis to a head it be already past that point Jace be a cancer I should have cut out long ago I trust the wrong people the wrong lab under my watch this poison get into the pipeline and onto the shelf but you issue a recall the minute you find out the paper the one my wife will not let I read they be all say kid die and it be my fault be that what you think Natalie think so too when she email Connie you could tell she think I be some sort of corporate criminal you say I think you be guilty the paper too now you be say Natalie it be not paranoia if that be where you be go part of you believe you do everything that you could properly and part of you be punish yourself for not do more I be okay during the day most day but at night I wake up in a cold sweat wonder how I miss it what I could have do what I should have do how much hurt I 've cause to family to the company God if you could see the old man 's face he look stricken that must have make you feel terrible to disappoint the old man you seem to talk about he as if he be a father that you 've let down it be my fault Paul not his I see you struggle to understand what happen and why it happen but as hard as you be work to deal with this guilt this sense of betrayal it seem to I that you be work just as hard to avoid look at he and his role in this why do you keep harp on he he do the good he could you say that when his son James die old Donaldson be ready to just give it all up but you would not let he you take on the family business for 35 year their son be dead and do you feel guilty about that I would promise to keep an eye on he and so for what some penance you take on this enormous responsibility the same way that you take responsibility for your parent ' life after your brother Tommy die I have no choice Walter you be just a boy I have no choice you be six year old you should not have be take care of your parent they should have be take care of you it be my fault that be why I have no choice it be my fault what be your fault a hot summer night before air condition the air be dead still Tommy be just go to sneak out to the quarry lake to cool off he come to my room and say tonight be the night he be go to jump off the high cliff he be ask I really more than tell I and what do you tell he I say Tommy you can do it you can do it Tommy and I tell he in the morning I would brag about he to everyone then he kiss I good night and he never make it back and you feel responsible for your brother 's death I be I be Walter your brother jump you do not push he off the edge he choose to jump and in a flash a family be destroy that be it it happen there be lot of they destroy family be you okay Walter I have to go I know this week your

he be die that do not really mean that he be die would you rather just get a call that he be dead let they call my fucking brother you may think that you do not care about this but you do if you do not care why would you have react this way when I bring he up Paul please sit down you say you be not get what you need from anyone but it be bad than that it be as though you be a baby you wake up from a nap and you start cry but nobody be come in to see what you need and so you cry louder and you shake the bar of the crib and still nobody come the only problem be your father be there he be in the room with you but your anger at he be so profound that you can not see he my father can not help I now no he probably can not but until you acknowledge his presence in your life you be not go to understand anything about he and you will continue to shake the crib what I be a grown man of course you be but what you have not be be a grow son to your father and until you do that part of you be always go to stay a baby or at good a teenager wait for your mother to die my mother 's already dead that be right what you be afraid of it be already happen neither you nor your dad could stop it and the only thing you can do now be hope to heal this wound so then you can move on we both know what it be like not to be there at the end it be something you do not get over ever hi dad I be back back again sorry I do not I do not get here early what do you use to call I Rotten little shit be you comfortable I can get they to up the morphine if you want you 've be lie so still all day Rosie and the

store forever try to pick it out you know what kind of picture what kind of message what do you think I have not read it yet because I send it you be away all last week and you have not open your mail

shrink but you know this be a relationship of a sort be not it yes it be I appreciate your sympathy grant I be not the first person you would reach out to our last couple of session I have be a challenge to put it mildly but I be concern I wonder who do you have I do not know if you be close to your ex I assume your kid be with her you have not be in New York that long and it be hard to find friend well be you worried I be lonely no offense but I can see it in your face be it possible that you be afraid I be not ready to give you my full attention today no that be not it I mean this be I be care be that okay yeah of course it be it be not what you look you do not have to worry about my feeling do anybody would you rather I yell at you for cancel be you say you feel like yell when I cancel it be fine no other reaction I get over it before or after you have see Ellis okay true I go to Ellis also true I be a little upset more than a little and then I feel like a jerk when I find out why you have cancel but that be last week and now everything be change why be that because I be pregnant oh that be that be really big news no kidding be you surprised I too especially with my F S H level it be strange timing with we life and death do you wanna have the session out in the snow I mean sorry you be tell I about your F S H level no we be past that I be talk about our timing 20 year ago you be have your first child and I be lose mine so have you be think about that time it be different this time I know everybody say you get pregnant and everything change but it be really true my body feel totally different I 've stop smoke there be this preschool on my block that I always avoid because it be mom with their humvee stroller block everyone like they be privileged because they procreate now I just walk through smile so you go from jealousy to feel like part of the club at work Bennett who be leave friday finally he have ask I to take over this big case assume that I would just crush the other side as usual but I take one look at the poor family and I cut a deal he be piss you be sure you be not try to punish Bennett he be marry stefanie that will be punishment enough I feel bad for their kid you know I mean he be a double adulterer and she be a bimbo why be we talk about Bennett well you bring he up and he be somebody that you do want to have a child with it be it be not his I do the math still it be interesting that you find out that Bennett be have a baby and a couple of week later you be pregnant be you say that I be compete with Bennett that be what you think I think that be what you think I think Paul I be have a baby because I go on a sex spree that weekend without use protection maybe that be not the smart thing but maybe it be so maybe you be not just be reckless I figure it be guitar boy and not the middle aged cop which be good because there will not be any paternity issue if I decide not to tell Guitar boy do not even have my number or my last name so you do not want he involve I know the baby need a father but not one like that do this silence mean you be appal hey I be pregnant I think that you would be happy that we would celebrate this be really bad timing I know what would you like I to say Mia wow Mia that be amazing you came say you want a family a child and then you get it congratulation in other word you have a problem and now you have a solution well can not that happen ever of course it sound ideal what else would you like to hear from I this game again how about do not worry you be go to be a good mom and I will be there for you could you tell I what that mean I will be there for you I have major decision to make like what like do I need a doula should I have genetic testing will my apartment be big enough and you want I to help you with this those decision how much time should I take off or should I just quit and move to the country these be all big question your sister have child have you speak to they they be busy with their own kid and my mother forget it and my dad he love his grandchild but he do not do anything he just let they admire he you sound sure that your mother would not want to help you but she do with your sister that be different they be young they be married and she actually like they and she do not like you for I she be less of a mom and more of a vase beautiful but hard to the touch that be a very powerful image she be beautiful until I ruin her figure oh yes her mantra have that be on your mind this week I 've always keep in shape I think man like that and now that will all go I hear your foot get big I hate big foot not to mention what birth do to sex I mean you 've be there it stretch right the size of a baby 's head compare to the size of a penis that can not be good and the man thing be over be not it guy my age they have grow kid they do not want to change diaper again I mean would you what what be you ask I come on Paul just answer my question if someone like I would be attract to a woman like you we 've already do that I get it we be not a couple I be say hypothetically if I get fat emotional more emotional if I have to cater to an infant I do not think that rule out all man so I could still get the drool guy on the back of the 6 train I mean look have a child can ruin even a good relationship be that what happen to you your wife do all the child rear while you sit in that chair listen to people 's problem she actually deal with people 's problem it must 've piss she off obviously something do but I would rather talk about your anger than my ex wife 's Fair enough who whose be those Yours or your kid and why be they in here be you this responsive with your kid or be you different as a dad okay great you be bore you be annoy you can not wait till I get out of here and we be back to your default that I want to kick you out you do just look at your watch you have never do that I 've never wear a watch before that be not the point I be right you should not be work this week I be fine Mia if I say I be fine four time you would be all over I you be not even in the room emotionally admit it why do you look at your watch it be my father 's watch I be sorry I must have glance without mean to when you mention the word dad it be not even tick Time stop when I be here if I be not pregnant we could call it a day and goo a bar that would be well for both of we be this the bar in soho where you hope we would run into each other yeah although this time we could act like we would just meet as in hello be this seat take right and I would say no hi I just find out I be pregnant after a binge weekend of anonymous sex and you would say my father just die then we would get plaster and fly to vegas and get marry and then what you know I I would fuck it up but it be fun be not it I can see how we both could think it would solve our problem do not go overboard Mia I think there be two issue here one your feeling about the pregnancy two your feeling about not have a partner and it could be that they be intertwine I mean you 've say a few time that it feel like I be not in the room today you mention you be worried that have a baby be go to make you feel less physically attractive be it that you be afraid that no one will be there for you if you have a child well I will be a single mom that be hard yes it can be and okay I admit it be not my first choice but I can not have my first choice this be what I have it be not picture perfect and what be picture perfect I a baby and a man and what kind of man what I do not know no idea that be not the point why be not you encourage I you be in the mood to celebrate and you feel that I be not join in that no I think that you think that I be too fuck up that I will be miserable and a disaster you know that be not what I say never mind I will call guitar boy I be sure he will take full responsibility or or I will just do it all on my own I will quit my job I will gain 100 lbs and I be sure I will still be as good as my mom except that this baby will not have a dad why do not you just take a breath God I need to smoke oh you will not let I I think you have quit because you be pregnant one cigarette be not go to do any harm I would rather you do not I be in withdrawal okay I think you be agitate why do people have child anyhow they want little version of themselves to gaze up and say I love you they want to relive their own childhood that that be the last thing I want to do the truth be I like visit my niece but I can not wait to get home you do not give I that sense what be I think sleep around like that if I have want a child I would 've have one by now maybe I should give it up for adoption you do not want to have the baby I be just go on Mia just talk through it tell I what you be feel it be okay these feeling Shut up it be not okay this be not just my feeling this be it right this be my last chance and I be I be too scared this sound very similar to what you be say 20 year ago you be right this be just how it feel back then be not it I do not want to have a baby I want to have an abortion and be that what you want to do now no I do not know I mean come on Paul we both know I be I should not go through with this Mia look I understand that you may be feel just overwhelmed right now yeah you think but you be in a very different place than you be back then some of your concern be they be practical you can handle they now you know how to hire a nanny how to buy a big apartment how to make a living but maybe the real question be do you want to raise a child if you have to do it on your own will you help I I I can help you as your therapist well I know but I 've never be a mother and you be the father I be the father N no I misspoke you be not the father you be a father nevertheless you do want we to celebrate you ask if I would stick with you if you be pregnant and then you imagine how we might run away and get marry so if you be create a new family Mia it be possible that you would like I to be there in the picture or in the room and here we be and now I just want you to tell I that have a baby mean I will not be alone for the rest of my life actually I can tell you that in my experience at time it feel like when you have a child you will never be alone again or even have a moment to yourself who who else have you tell about the pregnancy this time no one even after you take the test I think you be right Paul I do want to pull you in of course you know I I be scared I be worried about do it on my own but I hear what you say I be not the same person I be 20 year ago there be just this new life I can feel it and this time I want it you really do and I will try my good to be a good mother even if I be afraid and even if it be just I I think maybe this be a good place to stop wow that go fast it be okay I would well get go the subway be go to be all screw up but you you should take the rest of the day off a snow day go for a walk in the park eat something thank you and Paul please be happy for I nice cap those stair be so hard for I this keeps happen you be go to have to start give I therapy at chemo two bird with one stone you know what I like good about you what my morbid sense of humor your eye I remember the first time I come here and as I be leave I look at you and you look at I and I lose my breath for a moment it be a compliment I know do not worry I be not go to jump you I be in chemo I can barely keep my food down you know they have drug they can give you that can counteract the nausea you be not even my type but your eye be Bottomless I be just say be you okay I just I forget I can not do that anymore because of the thing I have there now do the port hurt all the time only if I move a certain way I can not remember they cut I open I do not faint or anything do I no do you remember they put it in do you watch it happen not not all of it 'cause you do not want to see my breast trust I there be nothing really to see but thank you for not look and thank you for take I you be welcome you know it be funny I 've have so many conversation with you in my head over these last two week I mean literally every day we 've talk for like hour at a time we 've have whole argument in my head and then we 've make up and what what have we argue about whether life be just bullshit or there be something deep behind it and what do I say well you do not say much even in my head which I find frustrating but when I ask you if it be all worth it you say of course it be April if you make yourself and other happy what I be such an optimist in your head you would not have say that what you be essentially do be give yourself advice in the form of my voice I know and very sound advice it be you be take very good care of yourself once I ask you not to give up on I and what do I say you say never I just want to haze you for a while what do you think I mean by that you be test I and how do you pass I live do you get extra point for tell your parent be not it amazing how many people have cancer and just like have conversation do sudoku do you see those two girl in the corner on the computer they be shop online for underwear we have catheter come out of our fucking heart and they be buy new bras you know sometimes a little denial be not a bad thing but do not tell anybody I say that I be sorry I 've be such an asshole in here I tell you no apology I mean I do not answer your call I make you let I talk to Sienna during a session I smash my freaking model in your office and I leave it for you to clean up I must be the bad patient you 've ever have oh no you be not thank you for take I and thank you for go no really thank you I hear that I have a bad night last week just a few day after the chemo I want to call you but why do not you call I you cancel our session I think you need a break April that be nothing to do with you it do not matter I call my good friend Leah instead Leah I have not hear you mention her name before what do you say to her well I I have wake up from this dream where I be already dead or no not exactly it be more like I know that I be about to die like something be come to kill I it be horrible but I also kind of want it to happen just to get it over with there be another way of look at that dream maybe it be just the part of you that refuse help I do not want to talk about what the dream mean I be just you know set the stage Understood anyway I wake up with this really high fever like so high I be shake I could not even hold a glass of water and I totally freak I mean I really think it be all about to end that be why I call Leah she come right over and she take one look at I and call 911 on the way there the ambulance guy be ask I if I be on any medication that they should know about and I say well chemo so be Leah in the ambulance with you and her mouth just sort of hit the floor and I be so out of it I just start apologize you know I be sorry I would not have call but I be die and she take my hand and she say April you do not die this quickly she sound like a true friend she really be yet you have not tell she about the cancer till then I have not see she for a while she be in law school so she be be really busy have you know each other for long we share a bus stop with a bunch of other kid when I be 10 Daniel come to school with I for the first time he be try kindergarten I be so afraid that everybody be go to make fun of he and that first day I turn around for just a second and when I turn back around daniel be stand there singe and hold his penis and I want to die right there I mean everybody be stare at he nobody say anything until until Leah say Daniel you can sing or you can hold your penis but you can not sing and hold your penis everybody start laugh then all the guy start singe and hold their own dick it be amazing so she be always look out for you we 've look out for each other her mom die when we be in high school so she come to live with we for a while she be really more like a sister than a friend you know her reaction when when you call she remind I of how Kyle react when you call he when you be have trouble with the model remember you say that he also come right over yeah so so it seem like the people in your life be very committed to you I have good taste in people I think it be more than that I think that you demand incredible loyalty so the only people you allow to get close to you be the people you feel that can measure up people you feel that can really go the distance I be incredibly loyal to they as well yes I know that so why be you make it sound like it be a bad thing I guess I just wonder why you work so hard to make friend who be so fiercely devoted to you and then when you need help you seem reluctant to rely upon they I call leah yeah that be true but you wait until you think that you be die it be like a bank you keep take money out then eventually there will be nothing leave so you think that there be only a limited amount of support that one person can offer another and when that support be use up it be go forever if Leah have cancer would you get tired of help she but not everyone be like I and what do you mean everybody be not like you in the emergency room the doctor tell I I should expect more fever just like this one as he say it I see Leah 's face she just look terrify for herself or for you enough I get it I mean I get what you be try to say I just do not agree with you be that okay of course not everyone be like I Paul I mean I know you think I be crazy but I be right I do not think you be crazy April you cancel our session last week yes I be I be sorry about that how do you feel when you get the message well consider we 've determine that I have a tough time elye on people it be a pretty ballsy move on your part what happen I have a family emergency so what happen you do not want to tell I come on I tell you I have cancer just know that if I could 've be there for you I would have be I know that hey how old be you a bit a bit pass 50 'cause I be think this week when when Leah 's mom die she be 35 we be 15 and she be 35 and I remember she be so old like middle age and now she seem so young to I and I be wonder you know if I make it to 35 will I look back on the time in here and think when I be 23 and Paul be 50 he seem middle aged and now he seem so young you will have to let I know when you get there so we will keep in touch my hair start fall out they say I will wake up one day next week and the rest of it will just be there on the pillow it be go to be hard to keep it from my parent after that happen I guess you and I should start strategize or maybe you could just tell they I bet you and my dad would actually get along you be both sort of intense in the same way I think you should be part of that conversation we could ask they to come with you to therapy that might work we could schedule something before your next chemotherapy session no we can not it be tomorrow so who be go to take you you and what about Leah what about she would not you prefer if she take you do you not want to take I it be not a question of whether I want to take you okay be you refuse to take I you still have not tell your parent so so you 've get a whole system of support in place that you be not use I do not want my mother to take I to chemo why not because I want you to take I I think we should talk about why you still can not tell this to your parent be this some kind of a joke no it be not I be your therapist and you need one a therapist but you also need a caregiver and I can not be both people you mean you will not it be not appropriate yeah but you 've already take I I I have to do that nobody force you it be the right thing to do April you be very sick but I cross a line what line there be no line there need to be a line if I be to continue be your therapist you just draw the damn line April listen to I I know you could not take it I know as soon as you see that they put that port into my heart you say Fuck this shit this be not my daughter this be not my problem what be go on tell I I can not yes you can I can not do this I be go to fail your fucking test no you will not People die of this shit every day but not everyone be as strong as you remember I think you be go to take care of I I be try no you be drop I no I be not drop you I be here for you April as your therapist until you be not I be so scared last week I dream I be dead I need you then I know I have a family emergency what happen do your dog die my father what it be okay he he would be sick for a while your father die how could you let I go on blather like this when your your father just die I appreciate your concern be you close no not really why not he leave the family when when I be young so be your mom at the funeral no my mom have be go for a while when a long time ago Jesus so you 've have it pretty rough have not you I be I be sorry we all have our fight to fight well look at you you deal with Daniel every day God why do you have to do that do what turn everything around so that it be about I and my experience can not I just feel bad for you Sure go ahead so be you feel bad for I now yes we be have a whole conversation in my head I have express my sympathy about your father and you have gratefully and graciously accept my condolence good you know have a fantasy life as powerful as that the ability to play out whole scenario in your head that be that be the mark of a highly intelligent person really yes yes accord to some study and what do the other study consider it a sign of Utter insanity can we go back to talk about your chemo session tomorrow who can take you I do not know I understand you do not want to talk to your mother and I appreciate Leah can not take the stress yeah she be get midterm but you must have other friend who would like to be there I guess so what about Kyle when you figure out who be go to take you will you let I know why I want to know that you 've find somebody I be sorry about your dad Paul so I 've get her spread eagle on top of a table in the law school library after hour and I be terrify because because you be afraid that I swear to god I be recite tort reform in my head so I will not come so finally I get her pantie off and she be sit there buck naked on top of all these back issue of the law review and suddenly I just know that it be not go to happen you could not have right and she turn to I and she say it be okay Eli you know it happen to everybody sometimes and she be so fucking understanding that it really fucking piss I off and then she start to say all of these really shitty

can talk to I about it somebody put dog shit in my locker that be terrible when be this I come down from the roof at recess to get my glove out of my locker when I open it there be dog dog shit everywhere all over my backpack and all my stuff and all my stuff I go back to the roof to tell my teacher what do she say she get a janitor to clean it up but recess be over so everybody know what happen do you have any idea who be responsible but nobody see he so nothing be go to happen to he yeah well I remember what he do to your shoe so I guess this would be his next logical step all through math everybody laugh about it the teacher get upset 'cause no one be pay attention that be my fault too listen somebody do something awful to you that be not your fault okay I ask my teacher if I could go to the bathroom but I go to the lobby instead while the guard be talk to someone else I sneak out you be not kid you have a hell of a day but I be glad you come here so that we can talk about it my dad 's go to be so mad and he be already really mad what be he mad about everything I 've be stay with he for two week since mom go away and he yell at I all the time no matter what I do so what do you do when he yell at you let he yell do you ever discuss the thing you fight about he do not talk to I unless he be yell I think he break up with Nina do he tell you that no but she do not come over anymore that be my fault too that can not be your fault Nina tell my dad to make well rule for I and then they have this big fight now she do not come over and when I see she at school she do not smile at I do you miss she not really but I think my dad do he do a really bad thing the day after the fight what do he do I should not tell you it be up to you he buy a six pack of beer and drink all of it and he fall asleep on the couch and what happen he do not get up in time for work he yell at I for that too why do not you wake I up but I do not know I be suppose to do that there be no way you could 've know what you be suppose to do my mom be suppose to be back by now but she have to stay on her vacation an extra week have you tell she about the fight you 've be have with your dad no she will just get sad if I be in your shoe I would be really upset about all that you know oliver I keep think you 've sink as low as you can go but it turn out there be no bottom why do not we just sit down we can talk about what happen to oliver today I get out of my meeting I have seven message from your school what the hell be you think to just disappear like that Eric dump dog shit all in my locker he do what apparently during recess today some kid vandalize oliver 's locker Oliver 's locker nobody see who do it but all the kid know that it have happen I hate that fucking place and I be not go back nobody tell I that why do not you ask I before you start yell because you still should not just run off from school it be dangerous and you know well I think that what your dad be try to say be that he understand that you 've have a bad day and he be just concerned that you leave school and you do not tell anybody where you be go I do not want to talk about this anymore I understand why do not you just go outside and I will talk to your dad okay where be you last week I be sorry I could not be here first bess vanishe on this apparently permanent vacation and then you go awol it be like rat desert a sink ship it be an emergency luke it be an emergency over here too every day he come up with a new way to drive I up the fucking wall so you 've have a tough couple of week Bess call every day and we lie and tell she everything be fine and she sa she need a little more time that must be pretty stressful on you and oliver First he suddenly decide he will not do his homework he say he be take a stand on principle the principle that school be stupid have you talk to he about it or be you hope I would say something I take away his tv privilege and his computer privilege but he still will not do his homework you know he just sit there and stare at the wall he certainly know how to push your button do not he next he decide to stop bathe what the hell be I suppose to do climb into the shower with he and soap he down I think Oliver feel powerless so he be refuse to follow the rule because that be the only way that he can get some control yesterday after he leave for school I go into his room and look under his bed past the mountain of dirty clothe there be all this food hide in there I mean half empty package of oreo and dorito and cheeto I mean there be do you tell Oliver what you would find yeah and he get furious run into his room and slam the door I should 've go in and talk to he but I be so exhausted I understand that you would be alarm by all this but you know what I 've work with a lot of kid in situation similar to Oliver 's and overeating be a pretty common response you know this this thing that happen at school today it be not the first time Oliver gets bully a lot have you do anything about it now that the school know there be a problem they be obligated to help you find a solution well now how be they go to stop kid from pick on Oliver I mean you see why it happen right I mean he be fat he be shy he do not have any friend and he smell bad if I be his age I would probably bully he too well the way he be be behave lately I can see how that would make you angry sometimes I just wanna shake he and say if you keep act like this no one be ever go to be your friend be that what you want that be unforgiveable be not it I think you wanna try and spare Oliver from the pain that he be go through right now but you love he so much and that make you frustrated and angry yeah but what good be love he if I can not help he but be not love he help he I do not know anything about anything this week so what else have be go on Luke look like I be single again Nina and I have a huge fight about Oliver and the reason I ask she out in the first place be because she like he I think she would be good with he but it turn out she just be not on my side and whose side do you think she be on last week Oliver drop a carton of ice cream on the carpet of course I got piss off then Nina come over and for some stupid reason I expect she to back I so you want she to help you discipline Oliver but instead she start scream at I she say I be not spend enough time with Oliver he I be not set clear boundary for he and how do you respond to that I tell she if I want somebody yell at I all the time I would 've stay married to Bess that go over real well you know at first Nina be a lot of fun I could come home at the end of the day and just relax with her then all of a sudden she start scrutinize my every move marshal evidence against I I do not know Paul why do I keep choose these crazy woman I be not so sure Luke that it be the woman who be crazy I think it be the position that you be put they in so you be say it be all my fault from what I 've see you enjoy have fun with Oliver but when it come to make the rule create a structure for he for a long time you let Bess do that job and then you hope that Nina would take her place so when he misbehave you blame they you refuse to take responsibility for Oliver yourself so can you see how that might how that might upset everybody boy now I could really use a drink have you be drink lately what do Oliver tell you why would you ask I that because the night I break up with Nina I go out and get a six pack drink the whole thing right in front of the kid I think let he tell Nina or Bess or you why not so you want Oliver to tell we I do not care I never really have a drinking problem that be Bess be paranoid but the other night I would just break up with my girlfriend my kid be act up my ex wife skip town you would skip town Shit who would not need a drink after all that right be you say you need a drink you know the week before Bess go on vacation Oliver be on his good behavior but the second she leave town he be turn into this monster be he try to get some kind of reaction out of I I think that be part of it but I also think that he be behave so well because he be try to get some kind of reaction from you that do not make any sense well look at it from Oliver 's point of view his family be break apart so he put a lot of pressure on himself try to behave perfectly hope that that would solve the problem so you be say he be fake it in a way yeah I mean he even try to stop eat so that you would not be concerned about his weight he tell you that but it do not work he do everything right but it do not solve any of the problem so now maybe he be behave badly to try and make you feel as badly as he feel well I tell you I like he a hell of a lot well when he be pretend to be happy well Oliver could not keep up that behavior forever he have I fool Bess and I we talk to he about the adoption and that seem to make he feel well I honestly believe he be do well which be what I think he want you to believe I 've talk to he about the adoption too and the way he see it Bess and you be fight too much and you give his brother away and thing be so difficult for he right now that I think that sometimes he wish you would give he away too do he even love I why would you say that I do not love my dad not even when you be Oliver 's age sure I do love he back then but it be unrequited love you will have to explain that to I Luke my father be the dean of student and basketball coach at my middle school he be in charge of every breath my brother and I take when we do well that be just what he expect of we and when we screw up well let us just say he be a man of limited sympathy that be quite a lot to live up to you would think that the year I be in the seventh grade he start take long drive on the weekend by himself my brother and I get on our bike and we ride around the neighborhood look for his car and we find it in the driveway of this little house my brother make I ring the buzzer the door open and there be my father 's secretary this nice lady who would give we candy then my dad come out of her bathroom and start scream at we what do you guy do what could we do we get on our bike and we ride home and then I be lie awake that night in the bed and I realize my father 's secretary 's living room look exactly like our living room every piece of furniture be exactly the same as ours he must 've buy it all for her my brother tell my mother and shit hit the fan she pack we up and we leave town we only ever hear from he when he send his check every month he be good about the money I will give he that but we do not wanna see he I mean he sure do not wanna see we he never meet Bess or Oliver and when he die it be like a formality but lately it be like he be laugh at I I do everything right I propose to Bess when I get her pregnant I work like a dog to make a good home I never raise a hand to Oliver and now I feel like I be stand right where my father stand you know just because you be get a divorce that do not that do not mean you be turn into your father and it do not mean that you be go to lose your son but that be exactly what it feel like I be do it be inevitable that sometimes you will remind yourself of your father you see how you wound your own child so so badly without even try suddenly you almost understand how he he could hurt you the way he do but you do not have to become like he you be not doom to live your father 's life you have a choice I think our session be almost over would you like to say anything to Oliver before you go yeah if we still have time Oliver do you want to come in for a minute I be sorry you have a bad day at school it be okay what do you say we go get some pizza maybe check out a movie if there be something good playing on a school night you 've be through enough already today you deserve a break see you both next week Dr Weston I be Walter 's daughter

around before they even get to the airport so that be what happen another half hour you would not have make it I guess it be not my time not now please do you want to tell I what really happen what be to tell I kiss Natalie goodbye I catch a chill after she leave so I get back into bed when I wake up I be here have you be spend a lot of time in bed I do not have anywhere else to be do I and your daughter Natalie how long have she be in New York a week 10 day I tell you Connie overreact to my my force retirement send out an s o S send out an s o S the boy come in first from California and how be that Awkward as hell I do not know how to talk to they they do not know how to talk to I we watch basketball rerun my old one eat my food the young one be upset that there be no booze in the house so he go out and get a bottle of single malt after that I never see he with an empty glass then Natalie come and the second she get in they beat it the hell out of there and she come all the way from Rwanda Paul I know where she be live yes but it be just that you would say before that you feel that she be do with you yeah well Connie must have really lay a guilt trip on her and how be it see her Uncomfortable she want to talk about what happen over there what happen here I tell she I be not in the mood for small talk she make I get out of bed and shower shave get dress make I go out on walk in the park she even take I to the zoo she use to love go there when she be a little girl so your mood improve when she be here do you find it upsetting when she have to leave well of course I be

leave and you finally have your privacy what I have be the chill and what do you take for the chill Aspirin Antacid what difference do it make they pump your stomach Walter you be pretty far go and it be not from antacid so what probably what happen be I drift off wake up reach out for the wrong pill in my sleep I do not believe you what the fuck would you know because it be my job to know and I be obligate to express my concern to Dr Wells and the rest of the team here you do not have to be concern Paul my family be not go to sue you they be not like that pilot 's family what that be all you be worried about be not it I should have vet you soon but someone on your school I be on the board by the way or be recommend you and like I say I 've be drop my guard lately I think you can still pack a pretty mean punch if you want to you seem like a smart fellow and I know you would not know anyone who could hurt I but still when the leak start to really hit the paper I tell Marie to have hr run a background check on you what do you think about it you mean aside from wonder if you be in over your head with I I have other thing go I do not even look at it until last week last week after I have to cancel probably around there do you feel I let you down by cancel no actually I be relieve I do not want to come in and go through the motion be that what come feel like that be what everything feel like I be not upset but I be surprised you convince I that you be angry about what have happen to I and that you be on my side and when I miss a session boy you really have a high opinion of yourself do not you I can not help but notice that be when you decide to read the background check I have time on my hand and blood just like you be that also what you think when you read about the lawsuit what difference do it make you keep say what difference do it make but I think it do with all due respect Paul do not flatter yourself if you have be there or not it would not have matter one bit so you be say your mind be make up you would have do it anyway one way or the other do what I go to sleep I go to sleep what be it a handful of pill a couple of shot of your son 's scotch it must have be everything you could do what to hold on until Natalie be go what be she suppose to do take care of I for the rest of my life both of they open the blind fluff the fucking pillow make sure I be dress they be worry themselves sick about I and you do not want that so I I force myself to start eat again I stop take the pill I squirrele those away I pretend to sleep through the night just so they would finally leave I alone for a few hour a few hour that be all you need then I tell Connie she could not let Natalie take a car service to the airport you figure she would not just drop she off she would wait at the airport for a while so you would have enough time I want Natalie up in the air as far away from this as possible Connie be just suppose to come home and find I asleep a millionaire 's death you know what that mean I think I hear my father use that expression yeah mine too you go to bed one night and you do not wake up just close your eye I take the pill chase they down take a few more I do not even remember the girl come back I must have vomit all over the bed I just want it to be over that be all it be okay Walter it be okay I can not even do that what do you mean just leave it on the table thank you do everyone in the hospital know you have a very good team of doctor they assess the situation the night that you come in be it in the paper for how long I do not leave a note I leave the tv on leave the light on nobody be suppose to know just an old man asleep under the cover the doorman would have help short term Connie would have mourn but she have a support system long term she would be a helluva lot well off as my widow than my wife I be sure she would not agree with that Walter she do not sign on for this for what to have a disgraced basket case as a husband do you know what it be like for her she be be a c e o 's wife and now she have to sneak out through the service entrance of the building next door like like you do it be not the same it be different for I and why be that because she do not do anything wrong and you do everything that be happen to you you feel that you 've deserve it be that the way you think People die on my watch Paul let us not pretend otherwise and anyone who be worried about you would be well off if you be not around it be just the objective truth you meet my daughter she be get her whole life ahead of her now what she be suppose to just put it on hold and and worry about whether her old man get out of bed that morning or take a shave I 've meet Natalie and she be in a terrifying place right now but as hard as it be for she to worry about you I be absolutely certain that if you have manage to kill yourself she would never have forgive herself the same way that you 've never forgive yourself it be not the same be not it you blame yourself for Tommy 's death even though he be the one who jump you blame yourself for James even though he be hell bent on destruction and you blame yourself for this crisis even though you do everything possible to avert it it be not enough Paul of course it be not I mean how could it be you 've have blood on your hand as you say your whole life and it be shape everything that be why this time when kid die it be not punishment enough to sacrifice your life to your parent as you do this time you have to impose the death penalty on yourself I see what you be do and what be I do be this how you deal with your guilt you tell yourself that what you feel be not real that you do the good you could it be always there I always wonder what else I should have do what the limit truly be of responsibility to another person and you can live with that it do not affect you of course it do all I can really do be try to understand what happen and why I make the choice I make to learn from the loss and to well it be different for you you be a young man you can recover from your mistake move to another state start over and you do not feel that you can it be too late for I we both know that look at you one eye on the door wonder when you can get out of here and cut your loss that be not what I be do Natalie be outside what be she still do here I tell she to go home to her mother she do not listen to I anymore she be on watch Walter she do not trust that somebody be go to look in on you every 15 minute or so every 15 minute be that what that be you be at risk do you tell she that she tell I so tell she I be fine tell she I be fine you be safe to fly whatever I can not really do that Walter I think you be go to have to stay here for a little long but I be fine I be eat I be sleep I just get a little dehydrated just tell they you be my therapist and that there be nothing wrong with I I can not do that in my opinion you need to be keep under observation and you 've make it clear that you do not want your family stand guard duty be you try to have I commit what I be say be that I think it would be a very good idea for you to stay here for a few day this hospital be one of the good I will call my lawyer he will bounce you on your ass so fast you will not know what hit you you want to sue I Walter get in line but it be not go to get you out of here any soon how long until it be safe for you to leave and if the doctor have not release you within two week then you have the right to make your case before a judge a judge be you kid I I wish I be I do not want anything to happen to you Walter too late Walter it be not too late there be a lot get out of here will you be you sure just get out of here can I go in to see he I would give he a few minute he be not come home tomorrow be he it be up to the doctor but I be go to tell they that he be still at risk to himself he do not agree of course but I can not take the chance I know thank you be you all right I I be fine I be just think about what I be go to tell my mother I be sorry this be so much on you actually I be surprised that she be not here tonight it be for the good she be not great in these situation as you can imagine why be that he do not tell you she be be in rehab I do not know three four time pill booze she be go to go to piece this be Rosie 's bag and I get she this small thing that be sweet thank Paul well I have to get back I do not feel comfortable leave those kid alone they never stop fight Wonder where they learn that from all right then no let I get it where be the car it be just over here listen Paul I be really so sorry about your father I know I 've already say that but I really appreciate that you come to the funeral I really do and that you let the kid come for that weekend it be great they do not drive you crazy no it feel good to be with they like thing be suppose to be they want to be there they be good kid you know and you be good to I too Kate we feel like a family I feel it too it be just unfortunate that it take such a sad situation that be what I want to say Kate I want we to try it again you know be a family I miss you Kate I want to come home I love you Kate I think we should give ourselves another chance I know the kid want we to do it so do I I be see somebody I might be in love with he I do not know I can not do this again I just can not and I be so sorry how be you I be okay thank would you like some tea or some water Water'll be fine thank thank for the orchid that you send it be beautiful I be glad you like it I 've be think about you it be a pity you be not there I do not think it be my place to be there yeah well it be a nice service except for the priest 's cell phone go off my kid speak they each have a memory to tell and some people from the nursing home come they talk about his card playing and his singing do he sing when you be a boy not that I remember but one of the surgical nurse say that you know he use to sing in the operating room a fine irish tenor she say he be of course there be a lot of woman at the funeral Women really like my dad as you know then too woman live long than man so when you get to a certain age there be always go to be more woman at funeral you know what I 've decide woman be really good at loss man do not really they have not get a fucking clue do you get to speak to your father before he die you know for man loss be it be a defeat in a game or a fight lose make you mad you want to get even with the guy like this man who be sue I Alex 's father this guy be so angry that all he can think of be come after I like that be go to help be you try to understand how to grieve for your father among other thing what other thing one of the thing I be try to understand be how I can help my patient with death and die when I myself have be so stupid and so wrong about it you know Paul it have not even be two week you will not always feel this raw we will see can you tell I more about the funeral I do not wanna talk about your patient now when you 've just be through this do you not think it be important for I to talk about my patient how be I go to help my patient if my own life be in a mess would you use a plumber if you find out all the drain in his house be block it be not the same thing you be a train psychotherapist but not a train husband father or son no you be not as a man you be like an animal in the wild you be live day to day you be try to protect your territory and provide for your family as a therapist you be observe certain member of the herd through binocular these be two very different way of experience life but you can not observe yourself through your own binocular but that be why I be here right can you tell I more about the funeral not this week please I feel like I feel pretty wipe out we do not have to talk about it but I be interested you say you be glad that your child be there yeah I be glad that the boy be there maybe they will not be as stupid as I be about it all Stupid I learn more about my father at his funeral than I ever do when he be alive do not that sound stupid to you what do you learn about he well for one thing I find out that he do a lot of free surgery in Bolivia you do not know that about he no of course do not and he make I executor of his estate do that surprise you and he give I his half of a little brewery in Minnesota he own a brewery in Minnesota with one of his doctor friend I guess he loan some guy some start up money 40 year ago so if the lawsuit end up cost I my license I guess I can always go make beer you see what I be talk about who be this man all I know be this old story that I 've tell you that he leave we for a patient my mother kill herself and I grow up alone all these thing be still true how the fuck would I know if my father be this great guy why do not I know it be you begin to think he be a great guy even if he be not great at least he be interesting but what be I be I blind People often can be very successful in the outside world and remain a complete mystery to their family Mystery be put it mildly Gina I do not think he be a complete mystery to you Paul I think as a boy even though you do not have all the fact you know he be an interesting man that be why you be mad that he be never home maybe you want to live with he instead of your mother well who would not it be not your choice Paul he be the only one with a choice in your family he choose his work his investment his woman that hurt you I be not hurt I just hate the son of a bitch I think the hatred grow so you could protect yourself from his rejection I do not think you always hate he you think I love he I be say it be not stupid of you not to know about these thing I mean maybe he do not want to call attention to his charity work or maybe he think his singing be silly or the brewery be frivolous or maybe he be not home enough to have any conversation about anything or maybe by the time he get ready to talk I do not give a shit all these thing be possible death leave a lot of unanswered question you know not everybody have what it take to be a good parent and sometimes as in your father 's case the choice can be very difficult do you give yourself over to your sick wife and angry child and fight a lose battle or do you give yourself to your talent and hope that someday they will understand so you be say his home life be a lose battle for he I be say that he look at his option and he fight the battle he think he could win a less charitable view would be that he win the battle he choose to fight that be true so it be not stupid of I to not know who my father be when I be a boy it be stupid that I get to be this old and still do not know who he be even sit there at the bedside in the nursing home he have maybe five minute to live and for the first time it be just I and he together Sickness until death and all that the only person I learn anything about be I I be glad you see he before he die it be the strange thing you know everybody leave and I go downstairs and say goodbye to they get a coffee and I come back and he be he be asleep well he have a pulse anyway and I sit down and I start talk to he and and he do not have a pulse anymore you be talk to he when he die I be talk at he Gina I say I be sorry and I say I be sorry that I have not see more of he I ask he if I could get he anything and then I just start complain about my life like I always do I look up and he be he be go do it feel to you like he have be wait for you to come back to see he before he die no that be what the nurse say but they say it happen a lot but I do not believe it I think it be crazy no not really on some unconscious level he might have know it be you or sense it no he do not do not you ever become suddenly aware of your child without they having say anything with Max I remember when he use to wake up in the middle of the night he would come into my room and I would just wake up and there he would be stand at the end of the bed just stare silently at I so even though Max have not say a thing you wake up yeah great so my father become aware of I on some level and he really do not want to listen to I complain so he just die or he become aware of you on some level and he be finally able to let go I would like to believe your version do you believe it or be you just say it to make I feel well do I believe that there be some non scientific connection between a parent and child absolutely do that mean that a parent know what a child need no it just mean there be a connection no we be more than connect there be obligation between parent and child there be thing that they owe we and there be thing that we owe they yes but you know I think obligation be maybe a subject for another day no I want to talk about obligation today my father owe I thing and he do not come through for I and I owe he thing and I do not come through for he if I be not go to do any well by my kid and they be not go to come and see I till I be about to die then we be all hopelessly screw be that your father 's watch you do not want to talk about this no I do not want to talk about anything in general I do not want to talk about obligation or family duty I want to talk about you and your father this be his watch I be go to wear it for a bit I do not usually wear watch but I will wear this for a while because it be a pathetic excuse for for grieve there it be what do you mean when you say the only person you learn anything about that day be you I feel like I be in a movie I be watch Self center guy go to the hospital to see his die father sit down can not think of anything to say to his dad then he start whine about his own little problem a divorce the fear of lose touch with his child a move to a new city the threat to the man 's work from a lawsuit they do not sound so little when you actually say they these be big problem to somebody in the middle of their life but to someone confront death like the father it might seem that the son could work these problem out the die father do not have the time

and now I know I be not I be really sorry Mia I just feel transform for a couple of week like I have a real purpose and I be a different a different I you know a woman have a baby and people stop ask question what be wrong with she or she be so ambitious or pathetic or strange it be easy then she be a mother it answer all the question it seem to I that you have a lot of question yourself last week maybe I melt down a little but I still want to have the baby the stupid thing be I can smoke now and I do not even want to so maybe you have change a little Nice try you know there be other way to be a parent if that be what you really want you mean compete with some young suburban couple for some pregnant teen 's baby I can not imagine pick ivy league sperm out of a catalogue to defrost and squirt you do not want to adopt you do not want a donor and yet you be sure that you want a baby it be not just about be a mother like you say last week you also want to have the perfect picture I keep wait to meet the right guy but it he do not show up or more likely I push he away and now no man and no kid I do not want to talk about this let us switch to the weather it be a really cold weekend be not it actually it be surprisingly warm do you stay inside do you call anybody you could 've call I you be still in mourning and you be away over the weekend anyway right Mia something like this you call I actually I do talk to someone believe it or not I speak to my mother I would certainly like to hear about that do you think we could talk about it inside what be it with therapist you hear the word mother and these bell go off pretty much it be it be part of the training so would you like to tell I about the conversation you have with your mother Cara one of my niece give a piano recital on saturday and when my mother see that I be not there she call to see if I be okay your mother and not your father right I have not hear from he in a while anyway my mother be the queen of protocol and I have miss a family event this it be Cara play Chopin and I have be pay for her lesson I tell my sister that if any of the girl want music lesson that I would treat I mean what be the money for I defend some pretty questionable doctor present company exclude and how many pair of high heel do I need be that because you want to make sure that music be not take away from they in the way that it be for you play piano be the one thing that always make I feel happy anyway I do not answer the phone so she leave a message and then later that afternoon she show up at my apartment with a platter of pierogis maybe she be concerned for you well there be always a first time right so how do it go I be still in my pyjama she take one look at I the heating pad the tylenol the tissue in front of I and she say do you have the flu and I shake my head no I start to cry and she get it and she say maybe that be nature 's way I do not know when I last cry in front of she or when she be last hug I and then she heat up the food set the table nicely pour we some nalewka what be that it be a cherry infuse vodka it be a traditional drink anyway she try to make a consolation toast she say to well day and then she tell I that she be proud of I well maybe she be she say that I should be grateful for what I have my independence my career this interesting life I be lead it sound like some of the thing that she might have want for herself well I snap at she I say that be kind of a strange toast consider you 've always blame I for rue your modeling career do you tell she that well you will not believe what she say she say that she do not really have much of a career she be not that pretty and that she never would have rise above her job as an underwear model which be not what I grow up hear right her mantra her false mantra the same lie over and over until everyone accept that it be true especially I the one that she love to blame do you ask she why she do that my mother say that it be kind of her cover story that have I do not ruin her look it destroy her mind she say that after I be bear she lose it she could not get out of bed she do not want to eat she say she stay in her room because she be afraid that if she leave it she would kill herself and that there be some small sane part of she that do not want to do that to I you know there be some mother who get so depressed that they lose sight of even that so where be your father during all of this she say he just move into the living room he do not try to get her professional help be you kid he be first generation he would 've be mortify to ask someone for help to admit that his wife be crazy so he take care of you during this time he do everything he have too she do not even want to breastfeed so really you be not mother for over a year when she come out of it somehow she do she say she have this rush of feeling and that she want to be close to I but by then my dad and I be just inseparable I think the word she use be impenetrable that my father have never forgive she and that he use our closeness to show she how she would fail she say that she be so guilt ridden that she think she do not deserve I and so she just keep away that be quite an admission that must 've give you a lot to take in about both your parent yeah I guess do you think her depression might also explain why she do not get pregnant again for 10 year no she talk about that too the twin the cherish twin they be an accident she say that she be terrify when she find out that she be pregnant again and that she ask my father to hire a sitter so someone would take care of we if she could not and accord to she he say no that he could not afford it and she insist that it be his idea to send I out to his sister 's out in new jersey and you do not believe she of course not my father adore I she also say that I be wrong about he come out to visit I every sunday that I must 've make that up because they come together once a month that be not possible actually mia it be because it be entirely possible you airbrush she out of your memory of that time sometimes the need to protect one parent be so strong a child put all the blame on the other no you be get this wrong she she be the one who blame I until saturday when she come to you with what sound like an unburden I be wonder what that must 've be like for you to hear it make I furious and if I have not be sick I would have throw she out do you know what it be that make you so angry she spend my whole life tell I that I ruin her life and now she change her mind when I be vulnerable when I 've cry in her arm well maybe feel you cry in her arm be what make she open up what kind of timing be that what do she expect that be a good question what do you think she expect why be we examine her motive I be fucking here because of she fuck up motive she want I to let she off the hook bless I my daughter for I have sin I be suppose to listen until she be finished and grant absolution what be the matter you look horrified what I be back to monster Mia here no no no no no I understand your anger she do not take care of you she lie she be never there for you then suddenly she want to be close why do she give up okay she be sick for a year but after that why do not she fight hard to be my mother how how come nobody stick by I but she do say that she try but that there be something impenetrable about your father 's bond with you why be you take her side I be not try to take her side all I be suggest be that it may not be as black and white as you rember it it be black and black she manipulate I one way for my entire life and now she want to manipulate I the other way to get rid of her guilt that might be true but it be also possible perhaps in her own clumsy way that your mother be try to reach out she see that you be in cris in some way like her own crisis there you be in pajama you be depressed it be relate to a pregnancy and she recognize it right away she be try to help so once again I have a chance at intimacy and I screw it up I push she away be that your point God damn it just stop all the therapy and tell I what you think your mother tell you all these thing and you get angry what about your father I feel bad for he his wife give birth he want to celebrate and she be ready to jump out the window plus he have a cry hungry infant to take care of he have to be both the mother and the father so good for he have it ever occur to you he might have collude in the lie that she tell you just say it she tell the lie but he never correct it why do you think that be Mia he be help her save face for 43 year can not you accept that he be a good father nobody in therapy have a good dad a good dad who ship a 10 year old girl off to New Jersey rather than pay for a babysitter there have to be a way to keep you at home I mean family find a way of work thing out well she be probably lie about all that too she could be but let us just take she at her word for a moment what that mean be that you have to reevaluate who your parent be and what they do maybe your father be not the ideal man that you think and maybe your mother be actually try to connect with you what be go on here she decide to rewrite history and you just go along with it well sometimes we find it easy to hold on to the fiction it be not fiction Paul I be tell you my mother be never there for I and my father always be that be your mantra Mia and maybe it be as false as your mother 's look at the way you defend it how angry you get if I challenge it I ask you to see your parent in a different light I just ask you to do that and you go on the attack you accuse I of take side maybe I just do not like it when you blame he for everything I need a break Shit sorry that be okay it be not about blame Mia what I be ask you to do be more complex than that I want you to question the way that you have think about your parent for most of your life oh be that all I know it be not easy but I can tell you from personal experience it be well to do it when your parent be still alive my whole life I have this distort image of who my parent be and I do not want to let that go I fight against it and then finally I do and it be too late my father be he be go and that be a huge loss I 've have enough loss this week I know but Mia if you do not go through this you be go to stay where you be you be go to keep punish the man in your life for not be what you need man like Bennett Bennett be an asshole or like I you blame I for the abortion but be not it your father who arrange it he be just support I or maybe he be once again try to hold on too tight to keep you as his little girl no no the abortion be my idea I tell you that last week you say you have not hear from he lately even though he must 've know you be sick he be he be always there when I be a girl be he how about your piano you say it be the one thing that always make you happy do you mother talk about what happen to it she say that he sell it he say with two baby in the house there be enough noise let I ask you something what would happen if you believe she if you actually let yourself feel the hurt and the anger that you might have bury for this perfect dad I can not do this Paul okay not today not this week you know maybe this be the perfect time this be a week that be be fill with loss you mother come and she give you a new family history the picture you 've have of they be just tear up and throw away and early in the week you lose your own child the baby that you want for so long that new family also just take away that be not quite true on saturday my mother insist on call her doctor and he have we meet he at his office in greenpoint on a saturday night he be the same doctor who deliver the twin have not you already see your doctor I call on friday my park avenue obgyn say you know wait it out and to call he if the pain get much bad my mom drive we to brooklyn and there be old dr Solomon sit behind his desk he do some test and he tell I that that I have not lose the baby because I be not ever pregnant I tell he about my f s h level and he say that I probably never would be pregnant and then he go on he say that he see this kind of thing once a week woman like I successful no child my age and old who come in just convince that they be pregnant and he have to tell they that they be they be not so so you have not do a test before that no why not I do not know I think I would wait I have an appointment for this week to see my doctor and I be just so sure but I have it wrong and you have it wrong I do not have to grieve for a child that I never have Mia last week you you talk about the the new life that that you feel inside you it be not there but in a way it be the strength of that desire to to create new life it be almost 7 45 be it too early to get drunk who know I could get lucky and meet another married man at the bar I be go to go will you please call I during the week call you so how be your week fine how be yours it be okay how you be feel about your dad April what I would rather talk about you Surprise sur fucking prise I be just worried about what happen last weekend may have change our relationship we have no relationship in Treatment S02E27 April Week six I 've dump people for less than what you do to I be you think of dump I I do not know what I be do here maybe you want to convey your anger toward I in person maybe I just want to get out of the hospital for a few hour do anybody know that you 've leave do you think I just hop a fence or something call the doctor if you like you be all such good friend now I be do fine so they let I out for a few hour I have to check back in tonight I have to tell she why she be your mother and you be delirious you could have wait until I come out of it and what if you never come out of it then someone would have call she eventually you put I down as your emergency contact number so so you empower I to make a decision on your behalf if anything happen to you I have a bad fever it be not like I be in heart f you have 105 ° F they be pack ice onto you when I arrive I talk to the doctor Paul I know what happen really I understand that you be angry with I I do not make this decision lightly and if I have to do it again I would do exactly the same thing wow have my insurance cover everything you do not have to worry about that well I be leave and I be not come back so if I owe you anything speak now April please do not go how could you it be the one thing the one thing that I ask you not to do I do not think it be right to let you lie there alone on the brink of death you really do not understand do you you you do not understand what you be to I what do she say when you call at first she she just she just do not understand she she even do not know you be see a therapist I ask she to meet I at a coffee shop so we could discuss it in person but she she refuse she be paranoid I offer she to go to her house she hang up and I call she back and I ask she if she would meet I at the hospital in an hour she show up be you surprised do you meet she in my room no in the lobby how do you recognize each other she look just like you you just walk up to she and say hi I be Paul Weston your daughter have stage three non Hodgkin 's lymphoma and she be die on the fourth floor I explain that you would come to see I several week ago with the diagnosis of lymphoma and that you would begin chemo therapy what do she say when you say cancer she seem stunned do she cry no be she angry at I definitely not no she hate be the last person to find something out she do have a hard time believe you would keep something like this from her what do you say to that I tell she she would have to speak to you how long be this conversation a couple of minute it be not I she want to see she want to see you I wake up and she be sit there I think I think for a moment that I be at home and it all have be a bad dream like I be still a child and I be sick and my mom be take care of I and I 've never grow up and I 've never go to school and I 've never get cancer I close my eye and I guess I fall asleep when I wake up she be still sit there glare at I like I have get sick deliberately you break my heart bad than Kyle I be sorry that be never my intention Kyle set I up for coffee last week he be be harass I so I finally go just to shut he up like I be still alive I be in chemo just leave I alone he just seem so young to I like a baby I be think I do not want a boy like you I want someone like Paul a man what be it like to see he again I do not wanna talk about Kyle I bring he up bec Fuck it never mind I think you be a man so today I be your betrayer but last week you be equally certain that I be generous and good can you see how dramatically your opinion of I have change yes and can you make sense of that for I I guess I never really know you maybe you be so angry at I you be you be have a hard time see this situation from my perspective do not lecture I on empathy I be not talk about empathy I be talk about perspective you feel deeply for people whom you believe be on your team because they be in your mind basically extension of of yourself you feel their pain as if it be your own pain but you do have a hard time understand someone who be approach from a different perspective you be use your perspective to fuck I over I think you be in serious trouble and your mother deserve to know why you have no allegiance to her you 've never meet she as a father myself I will tell you what happen you get scared you do not wanna be my emergency contact April that you do not want that responsibility April that be if I have a patient who ask I not to call her mother I would never have call her mother you do not have child it be so easy to betray you it be so easy to let you down I make one mistake not even a mistake one decision that you do not agree with and that be it for you I be worthless because I be weak and that be a quality you can not accept in other because you can not accept it in yourself but you know that nobody can live up to your standard because you can not even live up to they this be life April there be day that be just classless and cruel but it be the only life that you 've get Leah let I down all the time how little thing and she be a flake she will show up an hour late or forget we make a plan at all but that do not bother you no and what be special about your relationship with Leah I know she love I she be know I since I be six before I have do anything so she love you when you be a child she let inside before you would close the gate that be so depressing be it to have one person who really know who you be I use to be really different in what way I be a total mess this really emotional kid I would cry at the drop of a hat I use to write my parent hate mail and leave it on their pillow at night dear mom and dad these be all the thing you do today that upset I please respond and do they respond my mother would tell I that I have to get tough I could not let my emotion show on my face yeah you know when I be in when I be in grad school I have a professor who who say something I still remember he use to say that for well or for bad that maturity in modern american society have become synonymous with a lack of emotion and not feel anything too deeply that be true but some people naturally have more heighten emotional response than other I think that you be one of those people so you 've be work hard to change your nature just it be probably a futile enterprise but the continual effort to do that could make you very angry or insecure you think I be insecure do you there be no good way for I to answer that question if I say no I be a narcissist and if I say yes I be a loser well the way I see it if you say no you be perfect if you say yes then you be human why do you think your mother tell you to keep your feeling to to yourself she want to keep I from getting hurt be it possible that it have something to do with with Daniel what do you mean Daniel could not control his emotion and he become he become violent when when he be upset you know so maybe a heighten emotional response from you even though it be an appropriate reaction to a give circumstance maybe it remind your mother of Daniel and in some way it scare her the world be a mess up place she would just try and teach I to protect myself but maybe she do not give you time to get to know yourself first to know who it be that you be protect you think I do not know myself I think that you 've be operate for a long time in reaction to your mother at the hospital she be so mad she would not even look at I she just keep come in and out of the room boss the doctor around I just I just want she to leave maybe she be not actually angry maybe she be scared it do not matter do not no Paul not when I be hook up to three iv the only thing that matter in that moment be that my mother be there and I can not deal with her my dad come by later and he be perfect I I be freeze so he go out and buy I a down blanket and now whenever he come he bring I something special there be this dark chocolate that I love like weigh a ton I never get it for myself he bring I some then he sit by my bed and hold my hand and he say April you be a strong girl you will beat this that be all I need she be my mother why do not she know that he sound very calm your dad he can be under certain circumstance like hospital what be you say well that be what he do for a living it might be easy for your father to give you what you need at the moment because he be have some practice but your mother be out of her element I do not understand be you for this woman or against her April everything do not have to be black and white you be so over I sorry you be so tired of this you just want this to be do you wanna figure I out fix my head so you can check I off your ledger what what about my behavior give you that idea you turn on I how by call my mother ah we be back to that again so what I do still do not make sense to you what be you talk about for five session all I 've talk about be why I can not call my mother I be walk down Flatbush Avenue burn with fever with a non existent immune system try to hail a cab to take I to the emergency room and I still do not call she you pull rank on I Paul you be like I 've humor this chick for too long I be the adult I be go to call the other adult so we can figure out how to how to fuck up the world together you do not think of yourself as an adult I guess I be but do you want to be not really maybe that be because you barely have time to be a child your work here be do no our work here be only begin well you be wrong you can check I off now I be in chemo my mother know whatever you keep use the term check I off do that mean anything to you my mother use to write a check on the back of my hand whenever I do a good deed or ace a test or something she say I love it when I be little but something change as you get old I just feel like she be you know check I off like April 's fine she be get a check do not need to worry about April get so tired of those goddam check I stop tell she thing like what I do not know I would I would raise money for autism research by run a 10 km but you would not tell she she would find out later from a teacher or school newspaper can you give I another example when Leah 's mom be die Leah could not handle it neither could her dad so I be over at their house three time a week help out just buying grocery make dinner but again your mother do not know about this she find out at the funeral Leah 's dad come up to her it seem like you want your mother to know these thing but you do not wanna tell she maybe and what would happen if she find out I always her little hero her save grace her perfect child April be it possible that I 've become part of that pattern what you get cancer you decide to fight it alone just as you 've always do you do not tell your mother but you come to see I you tell I because maybe you know on some level that I would eventually tell your mother and you would become her hero again that be so fuck up I do not think it be April I think you save yourself the only way you know how I think that the cancer would clean I out of all this bullshit I think I would finally stop obsess over how to be the good at everything and all the reason I should hate myself and everyone else I think I would finally start to think about the big picture but it be just get dark inside my head I do not believe in anything any more I do not believe in love nor my mother nor my body or you because of all this stupid therapy I do not even believe in myself any more I literally have no idea why I should get out of bed in the morning that be not a bad place to begin April do you remember the dream that we talk about last week the one where I be die yeah except that I think that dream could actually have be about rebirth about say goodbye to the to the old self to make room for the new it could just be die when will you get the result of the blood test I tell you end of the week then you will know for sure if the chemo be work yeah will you let I know the result as soon as you get they Sure thank you be we do here if you wanna keep on talk not really can you help I up sure try not to break that thing I be surprised you do not start without I I be surprised you be on time ready for you now Bess and I need to talk to you alone Sure Oliver you okay for a few minute Fuck Synchro michvanilly olaola salomon what do not you want to give Paul your big news you be the one who be so work up about it why do not you tell he 11 00 last night Bess call I up and tell I she be move upstate I get a job offer two week from now she be go to pack up my son and take he away it do not have to be like that I be not kidnap he she dump this on I no chance to talk about it I try to talk to he about it and he hang up on I and when I try to call he back he would not pick up the phone Bess why do not you tell I about the job offer while Michelle and I be on vacation we visit a friend of mine who be a professor at Bard College turn out one of their adjunct in the art history department be go on emergency medical leave and they need somebody to fill in start in two week see she be know about this for almost a month now but she do not tell I 'cause she would already make all the arrangement I do not want to say anything until I know for sure I figure what be the point in have a fight if there be nothing to fight about Bess I be sure you might understand how Luke might feel a little confused about this you do not tell he that you be seriously consider leave the city and the fact that it be go to impact upon his life but especially on Oliver 's I want to know if you already tell Oliver about this of course not I want to discuss it with you first that be why I call you Truth be I be afraid to tell you about it because I know you would get upset and then I would probably back down and give up and I be not go to risk that can I ask you why this job be so important to you you do not get a chance like this every day and in the fall they be go to take on another graduate fellow if I do well that mean I can finally finish my degree so you might stay up there be it necessary for you to move upstate I be take your advice you tell I I 've be use Oliver as a way to hide that he be my excuse for never finish anything have you consider the effect that leave the city will have on Oliver I mean he be be through a tremendous upheaval no wait hold on a second this be a huge double standard if Luke be offer a job out of town would you be tell he that he be get to give it up he be get to stay home and take care of Oliver she be just use this job as an excuse to take my son away from I for good that be not what I want at all once she take he upstate I will only see he on the weekend and that be if I be lucky if you would actually let I explain she want he all for herself that be what this be really about I agree with you about Oliver I think it be a mistake to move he up there with I right now that be what I be try to tell you last night when you hang up on I I think Oliver should stay here and live with you live with I I think it would be awful to uproot he more than halfway through the school year plus I do not know yet if this job be go to turn into something more permanent but what be you suggest Bess the good plan be for Oliver to live with Luke until June then we can figure out the good way to proceed so you be plan to just run away and leave he here five minute ago I be kidnap he now you be say that I be abandon he maybe you can see why Luke might be confuse I mean when you start come here at first you be nervous about let Oliver stay over one night now you want he to live there until June at least I realize I 've be too possessive of Oliver and I can see now that I 've be overly critical of Luke you finally figure that out Luke please let us not do that what I be try to say be that I think the good thing for Oliver be for I to step back and let he spend some more time with his father you be finish screw he up so you be go to dump he on I be that what you be say I do not get this I think you want to spend more time with he Luke I be not sure that Bess understand why you 've have such a change of heart about this it be just impossible for I to take he on full time right now you just spend more than two week take care of he by yourself yeah and we nearly kill each other what be you talk about you leave the two of we alone in the same apartment again by June you be go to be drag our body out of the Hudson look I know that you and Oliver have have a rough couple of week but in the last few session do not you feel that we be make real progress it just be not go to happen that be completely unfair I have spend the last 12 year of my life take care of he practically all by myself and now I finally have a chance to get a life of my own go and then you say I can not do it all I be say be I can not be with he seven day a week so what you think it be well to just yank he out of school and force he to move somewhere where he do not know anyone he be miserable at his school he would be much happy start over someplace else no matter how difficult thing be now they will be much bad if you force he to move away from home he do not care what Oliver need he just do not want to make thing inconvenient for himself so what be we say here that neither of you want to take care of Oliver right now look I know that both of you have have a really tough time of it lately it be a huge task just take care of yourself but you have get to figure out a way to look after your son I know more than anybody how much attention he need and I be just ask for a couple of month so that I can get my foot on the ground I can not cut back on my hour at work and I can not leave Oliver alone in the apartment every weeknight until 10 00 you need to come to a compromise here you be both go to have to give up something that you want for the sake of your son what if he live with you during the week then on the weekend he take the train into the city and stay with I he be too young to take the train by himself okay then I could come pick he up and bring he back with I you know what I think this be a terrible idea take he out of school move he away from his house I can not turn down this job I 've be wait too long for this a chance like this I think Bess be right it be the good thing we can do I think it be potentially harmful it be only for a couple of month and if it turn out to be a disaster we can come up with something else right now we 've just get to break it to the kid I do not think that you can tell he just like that it be not the kind of decision that you can make in 10 minute you both have to sit and think about this otherwise I be tell you you will regret it I can not take any more time I have to tell they today if I be go to take the job then I have to pack up the house I think we should tell he right now while we be all here be you tell I that you really can not see any other way Fine Come on in for a second do I have to your mom and dad want to say just a couple of thing to you be they still fight no sweetie everything be okay now do not worry kiddo nothing bad be go to happen you want to take a seat so be there anything you would like to say to Oliver actually we have some really good news while Michelle and I be on vacation we run into this old friend of mine and he offer I a job be that why you be go so long partly anyway it be a really excellent job I be go to be teach at this school call Bard College it be only 2 1 2 hour north of the city you be move away from Brooklyn well that be the exciting part because you and I be go to live up there together at least for a few month and if we both like it we might even decide to stay they already have a really nice apartment for we it be on the edge of this beautiful beautiful forest where be I go to go to school up there you will be able to make new friend I know how much you hate the school you be at now so it will be a fresh start what be go to happen to our real apartment well that be actually something your father and I have not discuss yet but my guess be we will sublet it for the time be be someone else go to live in my room maybe but only for a few month what about all my stuff you will take some of it upstate and leave some with I and we will put the rest in storage everything will be safe where be you go to be I be stay here but I will come visit or I will come pick you up and we will spend weekend in the city what would you like to say to your mom and dad I do not wanna go listen kiddo I know this be a lot to ask and I know we 've ask a lot already but this be the way it have to be right now you do not care what I think Baby of course we care what you think and I know this have be really really hard on you but this be the well possible solution I do not wanna leave this be an awful lot for you to take in but I think it be important that you tell we what you need I do not wanna go tell they they can not do this I know this be an awful idea if you would just move back to Brooklyn then he could go to his real school and stay in his real house move back into our old apartment what the hell be you try to do to I I hate stay with dad I will not stay with dad Baby I know you guy do not always get along but you certainly do not hate each other he yell at I he get drunk I do not want to stay with he you get drunk while he be stay with you that be why he can not live with I it be all a fucking train wreck so what then I just have to give up everything that be important to I because you can not be a fucking responsible father for two second stop it enough that be it no more fighting you 've get to take care of this kid of course Oliver you know that we love you very very much do not worry kiddo this do not have anything to do with you fuck you fuck you Oliver can we come inside and try to talk about this I do not wanna talk to anybody Oliver I know you be upset let us go back to the office and we can talk everything through okay I need to ask you something first sure sure alone at least put your jacket on for I okay your dad and I will be right over there if you wanna talk so what do you want to talk about where be I go to live that be a good question it do not matter my mom and dad do not want I that be not how they really feel just because they be not marry anymore do not mean they be go to stop be your parent if I be go my mom could go away and start her new job my dad could live alone everybody would be happy your mom and dad they be frustrate right now they be yeah they be angry and they be go through a tough time but you 've get to remember they still love you very much do you know that I will tell you what let us try an experiment let us try and think of all the thing that make you happy all the thing that make you comfortable I be comfortable in your office well I be glad to hear that what be it about my office that make you comfortable I like talk to you and I like talk to you too can I come live with you you know Oliver that sound like a really a really good idea but I remember you make I a sandwich and you take care of my turtle look we have a good time together but you can not come and live with I I would be at school all day and my school be really close to your office it would be fun I know it would be fun for I too but I do not even need my own bed I can sleep on your couch but you have parent of your own and they love you and they want you to be with they but I like you well I can never take the place of your parent but you can come visit I anytime at my office Anytime and you can talk about whatever you want to you know last week when I run away from school I come to your office instead of go to my mom 's or my dad 's I do not want to see they I want to see you that be because you and I be friend if you be really my friend you would let I come live with you Oliver I promise you I will always be your friend and you do not want I either that be not true look I know that I know that this be really upsetting for you it be a stupid idea actually it be a really cool idea and it make I very happy that you be comfortable talk to I you can not help I would you at least let I try I do not need any help you know everybody everybody need help some time in their life I understand I just want you to know that whenever you need to talk to I I be here you want I to tell your mom and dad you be ready to go I can do it myself I do not want you to come with I be you sure I do not care I be move next week and I be never go to see you again I be sorry you be not go in with I Dad relax I do not even know why you come up hello Walter Good to see you you remember my daughter Natalie of course how be you Natalie he be do much well thank you Natalie they would not let I out of the loony bin without an escort Synchro so mpm I never think I would be happy to be back here but it feel good to get out of that place even if it be only for an hour so you have not be out at all this week yeah a couple of time Connie and Natalie take I to lunch and how be that it be a cute little irish place actually right across the street you probably would have like it I have stew soda bread Connie cry I sit there wonder if everyone in the restaurant make I for a guy be on lunch leave from the rubber room I doubt they be think that Walter it be humiliating my own daughter have to sign I out sit in your waiting room sign I back in like I be a danger to society I think the fear be that you might be a danger to yourself can I ask you something Paul Sure you say that this be one of the good facility in the city it be very highly regard then what be the rest of they like I be not complain you 've be there yourself a few time now it be clean well light why do not you just tell I what it be that bother you about the place it be the staff the therapist social worker maybe I 've be spoil by you but these people they just they be just not very bright how do you mean well you be either bright or you be not you can not fake it when I talk to you I do not have to explain myself you listen you understand what I be say you respond right away if I mention a name even once you remember it the next time these people they be just not up to speed I have to backtrack all the time well I think that you and I have a relationship Walter and I can imagine how frustrating it must be to cover the same ground that we have in our session yeah but it be not only that they talk to I like I be a four year old or maybe an 80 year old who have to have everything explain to he loudly and slowly so you feel patronize yeah exactly see that be it that be what I mean you understand I well to be honest Walter that be not a difficult one I 've never felt patronize by you you respect I I respect you we be equal I have not really get that sense from you before to be honest you have not actually I 've always feel that I 've kind of annoyed you that our talk together be a waste of your time for example when I draw connection between your past and your present you 've belittle they and I if you feel that way I be sorry the truth be that right from that first blink test I could see you be top notch and yet I think I remember that you question my academic credential and do not you run a background check on I there be that memory of yours it will not let go of any detail you can see why I might be a little surprised to hear that you be now singe my praise boy you have a hard time take a compliment do not you maybe you should talk to somebody about that okay since since you have so much respect for my understanding of you can I be blunt absolutely why be you suck up to I excuse I I think you be right Walter I have try to empathize with you and I know that I 've make some mistake but I think I have a pretty fair idea of your opinion of I so I will ask you again why be you suck up to I let I show you something what be it it be a potholder I make it myself in occupational therapy tomorrow we be go to glue little bit of tile together and make coaster I do not imagine you be the good candidate for occupational therapy I be use to be the glue Paul not play with it I be sure that be not all you be do in there no of course not then there be group therapy which be not only a waste of time it be disturb I just sit there and I listen to stranger talk about how this one be abandon or that one be molest and how angry they be at their parent so how do you feel about be on the same floor as these people well I guess I be suppose to relate to they or sympathize or you tell I but come on Paul two month ago I be a fully engaged c e o solve real world problem and now I be sit between one person who like to wear diaper and another one who like to cut herself with a razor there be no denying that you have it rough and you must be angry at I for say that you need to be there no you be just do your job I can imagine you also might be angry that I be not able to save you from the depression you fall into or from the attempt that you make on your own life you know one of the shrink there say something like that he say you be reckless say that you have open up Pandora 's box at the bad possible time I be sorry should I not have tell you that but I be sure that must have be unsettling for you to hear what do you think he mean by that well I do not trust it I do not trust he I tell he that if it have not have be for you that I would go off the deep end a lot soon I also tell he that his staff be not in your league you be do it again Walter what bullshitting I now what be it that you want from I out I want out and you be hope that if you flatter I enough that I will sign off on your release be that it I be climb the wall Paul and it be another week before I can go before a judge look I understand that a week may seem like a very long time God another day be an eternity whatever you need I to say or sign I will do it but please call Dr Wells he will listen to you before I do that we need to talk more what do you want to know what do I want to know be not that what you say to I last week in the hospital and then you proceed to tell I that you have food poisoning drop the facade Walter it be a waste of your time and mine you be just say what you think I want to hear I be ashamed and I do not want Natalie to know why do not you tell I what it be really be like this last week hell I have nothing to do there be one tv and the group vote on what crap they want to watch there be a piano that no one can play they give we chore but it be make work I be not do anything so how do you pass the time walk the hall it be 9 00 a m I pace stare out the window hour go by I think to myself it must be get close to lunchtime I look at the clock it be 9 15 when you stare out the window what do you think about I think about how much I could 've already gotten do if I still have my job you be use to be busy I can imagine it be it be a pretty difficult adjustment I can not adjust I be not comfortable just waste time that be something that we might work on while you be there you want I to work on waste time no what I mean be sometimes when people be hospitalize the lack of day to day pressure can cause a relief it finally give they a chance to to contemplate I do not follow you well to reflect to reflect on what be come before what lie ahead I think you 've be run so hard for so long that you have not have the chance to check in with yourself Natalie say something like that she say I should listen to my inner voice I tell she the last thing you want to do if you be in a nuthouse be start hear voice when you walk the hall what do you find yourself think about I be just anxious I think about money I think about my net worth number they 've go down quite a bit but I think about be Connie keep up with the bill be the car battery dead in the garage what happen to those those poor kid who drink the formula I think about their family how they be cope with it what be go on do you think about they often what do you think you say that you have some session with the staff shrink what do he talk about they want to rehash the crisis the firing I keep say could you just read my file and as you be retell the story can you remember what emotion come up for you have you ever give a deposition you say as little as possible and wait for it to end you mention that Pandora 's box have be open you 've talk about some of those issue like what I do not know your family history your history with the Donaldsons your anxiety about separation not really they do not ask I do not tell do they ask you about the night you try to kill yourself of course they ask about that they have to do not they yes they do I 've be where they be we would acquire a company I would go out there for the visit the local manager would walk I through it how dedicated everyone be how nothing need to change and the whole time he be make his pitch I be run number they be emotionally involve I be there to evaluate so these doctor you feel they be just make clinical evaluation they be just think about how much to medicate I or how much coverage I have do you think they might be assess anything else whether I will try it again that be what everybody be go to worry about for the rest of my life be not it do you want to talk about that pretty street you live on I never notice that before it be always be dark when you 've arrive it be nice to see the spring come now I have a chance to plant my garden smell the rose can I ask you something of course what would you have do if you be I I 've think about that I can really understand what that pain be like how it must have seem unbearable without end and how in that moment you think you would find a solution a way out of a hopeless situation but you know I think that the bad night of your life have pass Walter you 've survive it you 've be give a second chance and the void that you feel maybe the void that you still feel can be fill and that there be a possibility of renewal you know I try to fight it I keep tell myself Snap out of it Walter Snap out of it I keep think that I would come up with some way to stop feel stop feel what to stop feel period I 've always be able to will myself out of bed even if I be dead tired or sick I be always able to work ring the bell I answer but not this time it be like there be the Walter Barnett that I know who could stand up to any pressure and then there be this other Walter who I never know exist who crumble who could not handle the pain these two Walters one strong the other weak be there any other difference between they I do not know like I say I do not know this other one the other one you mean the one without a job you say anytime the bell ring you answer maybe part of the reason you could not snap out of it this time be because for the first time in your life you be not on call you be not on duty what do you mean you pride yourself not just on your ability to work but on your ability to work yourself beyond the brink of exhaustion the first day you do not even think that your panic attack be worth mention in the time that I 've know you I 've never hear you mention a hobby a day off a night out you meet I in the middle of a crisis and my guess be before this crisis there be another crisis and before that there be another one and it stretch right back to childhood to Vietnam to the Donaldsons to Connie 's rehab Connie 's rehab what I never say anything about that you do not but when I speak to Natalie at the hospital she have no right to embarrass Connie like that she be not try to embarrass Connie she assume you would tell I why would I have do that that be what people do in therapy they talk about their life if your wife have a problem with substance abuse Substance abuse it be chardonnay and a few pill she be not a Connie be a great wife she make a fine home she take care of the kid she watch the home front like a hawk the problem start it be my fault what be your fault I be away so much I be always travel the doctor never understand what it be it be maybe a hypoglycemia or lyme disease something chemical she get in a mood and she slide downhill and you be there to catch she I would be halfway around the world I would get a call from the boy or her mother I would be on the next flight back I 've always be her rock until now now I 've let she down I 've let everyone down you be a human being I be not suppose to malfunction Paul that be for other people but not Walter Barnett he be a superman be not that what your wife use to call you that be just a figure of speech but it be a pretty tell one you 've be everyone 's rock your entire life you make it sound like that be something bad to be responsible I be just wonder about the toll that it be take the pressure or maybe even the need to always be the hero need do you think I look for this that be not what I mean you think I be like a fireman who goes set fire so I can put they out that be not the point then what be your damn point come on you know everything just tell I what you fucking think I do not think you want the crisis but I do worry you have no idea what to do when you be not in one you be angry at yourself for crumble under this pressure but I be amazed you 've hold everything together for as long as you do thank a lot the Walter you know have be on the front line since his brother die on call take care of everything everybody sleep with one eye open but without a mountain of responsibility that Walter be completely lose he do not know how not to be in charge he be forget how to play he can not just sit and be maybe that be why you be climb the wall at the hospital then get I out of there and if I do what would happen to the other Walter what be you talk about the Walter you say you do not know exist the little boy who have his childhood take away from he when he be six year old he be be sit there all this time in the dark scare half to death hope that somebody would notice he maybe comfort he and maybe maybe this be his chance your chance to find out who that boy be to reconnect with a part of yourself that you 've have to deny your entire life be I make any sense to you you want I to connect to that part of myself that that fall apart that crumble under pressure why would I do that because Walter I do not think that be the part of you that crumble I think that be the part of you that want to live I be sorry yes my name be Paul Weston I 've be on hold how can I help you sir I be the executor of my father 's estate and I want to can you hold on while I pull up the account sure okay I will hold thank you for hold you call be very important to we and your estimate wait time Claim service hello yes can I help you this be Paul Weston and my father have a life insurance policy with you and hold on while I get an agent okay I will hold Hello Bank of New Trust how can I help you my name be Paul Weston yes Mr Weston how can I help you my father just pass away he have two account with you can I have your father 's security code no I do not know his security code I be go to have to transfer you no but just do not put I on hold hold one second do not put I on hold please

to talk to I all I get be can you hold please hold let I put you on hold that be so irritate if I believe the operator be actually help somebody I would wait sometimes I think the whole country be on hold nobody be be help they do not even call it help any more they call it customer support that be 'cause all they really do be say I be sorry you have a problem that be too bad well you know what I do not want support I want your help so I hang up be there something I can help you with unless you want to proofread a letter I write sure what kind of letter remember last week I leave here and I go to meet with Alex 's father yeah how do that go disorient he offer to accept settlement money from the insurance company and drop his lawsuit against I well that be great in exchange for a letter from I admit my guilt in Alex 's death you write the letter what would he do with this letter he give I his word he would not do anything with it Paul I know you be right once he have it technically he can do anything he want with it send it to the ethic board or post it online that would be the end of your career what do your lawyer say he say the letter will put an end to the lawsuit and that my insurance will cover the whole settlement I will not end up owe a thing what happen if you do not send it they have a preliminary hearing next week the judge he could just throw the whole case out but if he do not it might go to trial with a jury in which case I will lose big time how do you know that the lawyer say that be what jury do he say everybody hate therapist they do accord to this guy therapy be bullshit he say people go into treatment hope that the therapist be go to fix they but that therapist either do not solve people 's problem or they make they bad and this man be represent you he fight case like this every week he know how they go and he be worried that the jury be go to see I as a stand in for all the bad therapist in the world and award Alex 's father the entire 20 million if this lawyer know what he be do he would get the jury to see what a good therapist you be excuse I for a second I be just curious what would you say if you be on trial and the lawyer ask you what percentage of your patient do you think you 've really help what be you ask would you say on average that the people you 've treat have get a little well a lot well or they 've stay about the same you be someone I treat be you ask I if I will help you get well Fine do not answer the question this be not about you anyway this be about I the way I feel about it be I be not help anybody I be go to mail this letter and I be go to quit be a therapist and find something well to do something useful you know you help people you know what I do Most day I sit there and I listen for 45 minute then my patient go out the door and do whatever they be go to do anyway Paul you do not just listen you make observation you ask question you make interpretation you encourage people to look at the pattern of their behavior that may be what I do but it be not what people want and what do they want they want to be love even by I they want a child or they want to be my child they want a parent who love they they want attention they want affection they want hope they want pill and they want sex it be a good list but I do not give they those thing my patient Mia the lawyer do you know what she want she want I to hold she to comfort she but what she really need be a good husband and a family and I know that I can not give she those thing all I can do be show she she push away the very people who could help she and that she pull on the people who will not but that only leave she feel more lonely and unloved by the time she leave on Monday by the time she leave my office she felt doom reject by her family and the world and I have absolutely nothing to say to she so you be worried she will not come back why should she come back really I be of no use to her whatsoever all this big wisdom that I be suppose to be give she this be not go to make she happy be that what you want to do make people happy absolutely I want to make people happy what do you want to do fuck they up even more you know what I be go to do I be go to mail this letter and I be go to let they take my license and I be go to become a life coach a life coach what do they do you know what a life coach be they give advice it be not look people do not have family anymore that they can talk to and friend be quickly go the way of family so if you be Mia 's life coach what would you tell she to do I would tell she to quit her job I would tell she to grow her hair I would tell she to move somewhere where she be outside in the sunshine like Napa Valley I would tell she to take up biking not wear heel for a year and I would tell she get a dog do you think that she would take your advice she just want I to give her love and support but if she be capable of receive love and support she would not be come to you for they that be her real problem and until it be treat she will not be able to take anyone 's advice and that be why she need therapy actually I think if my first advice work she might try some other new idea if my advice do not work out she would go in another direction I do not see what the harm be would you want the responsibility for make her decision for her I think I would be fine with that you see that be your problem right there you be scared of take responsibility for your patient ' life you do not actually want to get involve with they I do so you still cle to this dogma of let they make their own decision but that in my opinion that be not professionalism that be cowardice you know it be not dogma it be a basic tenet of our profession if you take action in your patient ' life you cause they to become dependent on you you cripple they back on the high moral ground again as usual but you 've get it wrong Gina my problem be not that I can not obey the rule my problem be that unlike you I actually give a shit about my patient you think I do not care about you you do not let yourself care about anybody you be too afraid to you sit in that goddamn chair and your patient be fall apart in front of you but instead of reach out to help you study they as if they be piece of a puzzle well I let you down and you be enrage at I I be your teacher I be your mentor I be suppose to give you the wisdom that would protect you from this sort of pain the pain you be go through now and I do not and so you be react by tell I that I be not feel your pain and that my profession be useless we both know that you do not believe a word of that bullshit if anything you think that I 've disappoint you you keep tell I I be a good person you be a great therapist Paul but we both know how little respect you really have for I you pretend to be neutral but you have do nothing but judge I since the minute I come back into therapy so you think I 've be judge you all this time for fuck 's sake stop mirror what I say would you stop hide behind the cloak drop the fucking catlike smile the bullshit Buddha pose of yours and just tell I for once what you really think what do I really think I really think that you be act like an asshole I really think that you be a therapist who have remarkably little insight into your own behavior you be so self absorb you be so entitled you come in here and you spout the same old bullshit I want to cross the boundary because I care so much and I have to sit here and listen and then you have the gall to get mad at I for not lose my temper well at least I finally know you know nothing that be right I be a self absorb asshole and you be furious at I I be furious at you let I ask you how do say that make you feel it feel good but maybe that be exactly what you want and what do I want Gina you tell I you get I to play the role you relish you get I to be the punishing reject parent the fail authority figure that you can rail against why would I want that because it be familiar it confirm your worldview you get to be the innocent victim do your good and I be just like everyone else I be out to fuck you over so you call I an asshole and not only be it my fault it be actually what I want you tell I how do you feel give I a fucking break I bet you feel good let us face it Paul you would always rather yell than think what do not I want to think about well you be on a tear here you be torture by what you see as your failure with your parent with your patient with your father so you be destroy all your careful work and mine careful work you think I be unprofessional you think I 've get no boundary you 've always think that have I have I always think that then why do you think I 've stick by you all these year even when you 've be a complete pain in the ass the truth be despite everything I really do think you be a good therapist you tell I you be no help to your patient but when you describe they it be clear to I how carefully you listen you have a great ear you have a great sense of empathy then why be I fail they it be not about you Paul you know they be human being they be struggle with profound problem if only you could find courage to sit with the fact that what we do be hard and sometimes it make you feel like an idiot it be a humbling profession and if you lack anything as a therapist it be humility somehow you have to learn to tolerate the fact that we do not save people we can not Walter try to kill himself my God Paul why do not you tell I this when do this happen about 10 day ago you do not even mention it last week I feel there be enough to talk about with my father I mean what would I have do if he have succeed you would have blame yourself just like you do with Alex but I be responsible for what happen Paul in two week you 've lose your father you be wrack with guilt because you feel you neglect he and now this the session with he be the first one be in the hospital you can imagine that be that be the last place I want to be right now I be sit with he worry that if I just say the wrong thing just one wrong thing and his daughter be outside in the corridor wait she be just a little bit old than Rosie and she be be hold that family together the mother and the father in a way that just in the way that you try to save your mother yeah and she be stare at I with those eye that would break your heart she be just start to live her life and all I wanna say to she be get out run away but I can not do that because if she go so do Walter I sit with he for hour try to tell he that his life can still have mean that even though he be overwhelmed with guilt and loss and shame he have to push on that he do not know what life might have in store for he what his third act could be except he know he know damn well what his third act be go to be a long steady decline just like my father 's so maybe he be right to try for a millionaire 's death as he call it to take control for himself on his term instead of let the universe continue to torture he do you really believe that I can see how he get there how somebody would just want to close their eye and not wake up have you be think you might like to go to sleep yourself but I have not lose everything I ever want if I do if you do I be not go to kill myself Gina tell I why not for fuck 's sake Paul you know what I be ask you you be vulnerable here you do not have to worry Gina I have child I remember you know after my mother die I be stand above her grave and I promise myself that I would never ever do that to one of my kid and then Ian be bear and then Rosie and Max I make the same promise to myself over and over and over again and I feel this rush of warmth through my body I be good I be strong sometimes I feel like I be this great tree giant powerful and they be go to live their whole life beneath my shade and then sometimes I feel I feel like all my leave have just fall away and I can not do anything for they except block the view they still need you I do not know about that they do you still need your mother do not you can you imagine she would be 80 by now she would have get to see her grandkid grow up do you think that would have make she happy can I ask you something Gina Sure have you ever think about suicide yes when David be die no not when David be die but afterwards when you be grieve he be a young man he be so young when he get cancer and his life be steal from he and you watch someone die someone who want to live and I be sorry I do not make it to David 's funeral sorry I be not there for you thank you and what about your patient with cancer how be she do she get the result of the blood test this week how be she do emotionally she be kind of furious at I why it be a long story she be in the hospital she be really really sick but she have not tell her mother so I think that her mother deserve to know of course she do you be right Someday April will thank you maybe listen Gina I be exhausted I do not want to talk anymore I think I will go get a coffee or something before I pick up the kid be you all right I will go with you no it be okay I be fine I be just tired that be all I forget my letter I will keep this I will keep this you know for you and then you take this week you think about it and if you want it back if you wanna send it I will give it to you take a week to do what to see your patient that be what I 've be say I do not want to see my patient see your patient Paul Act as if you believe you be help hello Mia so how have you be Quiet I have not hear from you do you get my message yes thank for your call and how be you feel how do I look that be a lawyer technique right answer a question with a question well I think I would hit bottom at the end of the last session but it go downhill from there I do figure something out though I be stop therapy I appreciate what you 've do I know I be a tough case but if every time you go to the doctor you end up feel bad then it be time to move on and I could have call but I want to come in and say goodbye and wrap thing up I understand you be not go to try to convince I to stay be that what you would like I to do I just assume you would be all over I therapy this therapy that you want I to hard sell you like a guy sell you a vegetable peeler on the street Jeez Paul do not I get to be the angry one here you mad because I want to leave or have something happen you look like you want to take your ball and go home maybe you be right if therapy have not help the last thing I want to do be keep you here make you feel bad that be what happen after the last session I feel like shit and I go home and I call my dad think that I should get to the bottom of everything he come over and I start ask question about my childhood all the thing we would talk about he turn it on I why be I create problem bring up ancient history maybe he feel threaten especially when I ask he if it be his idea to sell the piano he lose it I should not blame he I should be grateful I would not be alive without he that I be impossible from the day I be bear and maybe that be why my mother go nuts so it be all your fault yeah and he go on it be no surprise that I can not find a man who would want a woman like I and then he walk out say that he do not want to talk to I again so therapy be not the only reason you have a bad week I never would have confront he if I have not be talk to you so thank to all of this I have lose my father you have not lose your father he be still in your life but you do lose the father that you think you have he do not refute your mother 's version of event he just choose not to answer and that confirm a lot of the thing that we 've be talk about in here okay Paul I get it I do not have the perfect dad you be right and I be wrong be that what you want so put that in today 's session note which I hope you keep now successfully shatter patient m 's romanticize image of her narcissistic father actually what I would write be Mia bear to a depressed mother idealize her father so as not to feel completely alone and this week after finally confront he she can see her dad for who he really be it be shatter but if you can now move beyond that connection to your father it may open the possibility of find love elsewhere you mean if I stay in therapy that be one way it be certainly not the only way good because I really be do in fact maybe I should get go you can of course but since you be here maybe we can at least work on closure I know you be unhappy about the last time that we end therapy I would like to do a well job this time how long do that take well that be up to you if this be your last session we will use the time that be leave and I will be honest you be honest how be that okay last session what do we do you have not tell I what happen after your father leave that be how we do closure could not we just burn some sage or something I enjoy your humor a lot Mia but sometimes I feel it be a way of it be a way of hiding after dad leave I pretty much stay home all week in bed and I know that sound bad but I be here now so I get through it do you get out of bed at all Bathroom trip kitchen trip I answer the door for delivery do you talk to anybody my trusty assistant Henry who threaten to come over and cook for I you do not want to call I what would I have say I be under the cover 'cause I be afraid of the living room if that be how you feel then yes have you be feel a little hopeless I be not suicidal Paul do not worry I be pretty tough do be tough mean you have to suffer through thing like this alone I just feel like the bed be safe and the living room be scary so you take to bed like your mother do she have post partum what be my excuse post non partum I would not belittle what you 've be through Mia you want a child you think you be have one that be a painful loss and on top of that when you be vulnerable and need your father the most he be not there for you maybe the same way he be not there for your mother when she could not get out of bed this be exactly why I be do with therapy every time we talk I feel like I need to see a therapist just to get through the day okay I hear you no more dad no more mom be this how closure work you remind I of my miserable family life and then my love life and then what global warming so what would you like to talk about I be think about get a parrot as a pet instead of a boyfriend or a therapist I could name it paul and I could teach it to say thing like what would you like to talk about or be it I or be it your father but then I find out that parrot live for about 80 year and I do not think I could stand anybody for that long so you want to go but you also want to keep I around or at least you want to keep my voice look paul I like you I like you as a person I mean that be pretty obvious if we be friend that would be great but we be not and I do not imagine you be go to become my friend that be against the rule unless of course my name be laura you be still angry about that maybe I be just an angry person and I should just accept myself for who I be no you be specifically angry at I no I say I like you and you want I as a friend but not as a therapist you want what I can not give you what else be new maybe the question be not why you be leave mia but why you come back in the first place you clearly know that I be be sue for malpractice and you believe that I have fail you 20 year ago think about it what kind of choice be that it be not a really good one or maybe it be perfect if you be try to choose a therapist in the same way that you choose the man in your life look for someone who be likely to let you down do everything you can to drive he away and when he fail you which he must inevitably then you get to rage against he nicely do you 've even double back to dad without have to mention he look mia of course you be free to leave therapy but my guess be until you untangle those cross wire the next man and the one after that and the one after that they be go to disappoint you too that be my lifelong pattern because I 've be too attached to bad dad why do not you tell I this 20 year ago I mean what the fuck be you say it be my fault maybe I would have have a decent life if I have know that it be a little late now would you have even hear I if I would say it that back then so you wait and while you wait I hit perimenopause Great you be do it again mia what blame I for not give you what you need when you need it now I get it closure be you tell I that it be all my fault and that I set you up that way we can both have what we want I can be mad at you and you can be do with I here be where you tell I how relieved I will be when you walk out the door and then you be go to say that you be like a knife in my neck that it will feel good when you be go that how it go be not it see this be your specialty ia and if you want to keep repeat that pattern that be fine go ahead but if you want to make a change in your life I suggest that you stay in therapy and it do not even need to be with I can we talk about your pattern my pattern like what how you like to have a woman on the couch who think she be in love with you how you get off on that get off on it I 've see how you look at I you hold up that neutral face pretty well but I see when it slip and you be look at my neck or my leg or my breast and you be wonder what it would be like Come on paul you say you would be honest how about you drop the act you know you would rather have I as a patient ten some hedge fund guy whose bonus have be reduce do not tell I you have not have fantasy about we crazy chick be hot in bed right what be the matter be I make you uncomfortable why do not we just go in the bedroom right now and fuck or how about on the kitchen counter I bet you never do that with laura so there be nothing to be learn from therapy so let us just go fuck be that it at least we would get some relief from our miserable life so that be your version of closure it would make we feel well instead of pretend that this talk nonsense actually help what would it be like if you break all the rule for I you mean if I say yes so you want to what if I do what would happen what be you say would you finally feel special enough would it fix everything to win like that or would you just blame I for cross the line you be a lawyer for chrissake you know what it would mean then I would be truly guilty of malpractice you 've probably represent doctor like that hell of a way to get out of therapy I have to say turn I into one of your client that be not what I be do be not it then I would need you you would be in control and that would be much more comfortable for you to have I back in your office maybe maybe that be why you really do it what your job you be change the topic be you get scared I be try to help you that be my job what be yours mia what do you do at work every day you know as well as anyone what I do how be your case go I be not in last week do not you have a hearing come up so they tell I but you be right you be not in last week if you have go in what case would you have be work on no trial I be suppose to meet a new client a pediatrician who misdiagnose some nine year old kid almost kill he no wonder you stay in bed I do not judge my client paul I protect they and how many of your client be powerful man who fail to protect the vulnerable and the innocent they be be sue paul just like you that do not mean they be guilty and how long have you be do that 17 year how often do you call in sick since I get there five day four in 17 year and vacation you do not lose the week if you do not take they I see but last week after confront your father you do not go in accord to you I be depress I think you be but I do not think it be a coincidence that suddenly you do not want to defend somebody whose negligence have harm a child look I be not say they be all guilty but every time you stand in that courtroom to defend a client I think you be actually defend your father to everybody especially yourself Shit how long have you know that one do it make sense to you I never make the connexion and now I be stuck with it I feel like I have nothing before now I have less than nothing I know it feel scary but maybe that be a good thing it be a good thing that I have nothing thank you thank you you 've help I to realize that I 've make poor choice after poor choice my whole life but you also have to realize Mia that you be at a critical juncture in your life that now you do have the self knowledge to make different well choice do not give I any of this Pollyanna shit and sometimes when you be on the verge of real change that be when you fight the hard when you first come back I try to ask you about your connection to your father and you shut I down you do not want to know anything about it this past week you confront he yeah look how well that work out I be not say it be easy but maybe it be worth it to finally take off the blinder even if you do not like what you see because what be the alternative put they back on again and wander around in the darkness do you have to take they off I do not do it you do what be you think nothing what be I go to do with the rest of my life I want the same thing I want when I come here two month ago a man a home a family I be no close to get they do you really think that getting marry be go to make it all well do you have any idea of how many married people how many parent feel as empty as you do let I ask you when be the last time you feel real happiness a couple week ago when I think that I be pregnant and what about that make you feel good that it be not just I that my life have meaning that there would be this other person always have you ever consider that maybe it be not about a child Mia or a husband maybe that be just a picture in your head from your family from your friend from the culture not everyone need that to live a full and contented life maybe what you really want Mia be to feel connected authentically connect to somebody or something else and we both know that I can not have that why not an authentic connection I I 've never have that I be incapable be you sure what about in here be you kid I I be a mess in here I attack you I 've dump on you I 've try to seduce you I 've be a train wreck okay at time you have act out but if you have not how could we examine it it be be your way of communicate to both of we what you need you 've also be honest care you 've make yourself vulnerable you 've show I who you really be and you have not walk away yet we both know that you really want to change that be the real reason you keep come back yes of course you want intimacy in your life and I know I know that you be capable of that because we 've have it when name one time now right now our time be up right thank you Paul it be a good session Goodbye Mia so I guess I will see you next week I will be here Paul it be April I uh I get the test result I would like to come in for one last session I will see you this afternoon April Paul it be April I uh I get the test result I would like to come in for one last session I will see you this afternoon in Treatment S02E32 April Week Seven it be the hat be not it look look nice it look ridiculous so so your message you you you get the result well it itch like crazy you can take it off if no Daniel give it to I oh I do not realize that you tell he about I do not my mother do I be afraid to Afraid of how he might react I be afraid that he would not react I be afraid he would walk away rattle off baseball statistic or something when our dog die he do not seem to notice and he love that dog but then like three month later he turn into the kid from the exorcist and start tell everyone he meet that they be go to die do you tell he before or after the test come back right afterwards they come over my mother bring I a cake and Daniel give I this hat it be like my birthday so you be say that you have something to to celebrate it be work the mass behind my spine be shrink so that mean the prognosis be good yes yeah wow that be great news I be just so so relieved what do you feel I do not know you do not know that be that be not like you yeah it be weird when they first tell you be you surprised do you do you believe they be you alone here yes but do not you have child I mean you tell I you have child I do where be they they they live with their mother Hm so you could not make it work either and you be a therapist maybe this be why therapist do not talk about their personal life Kyle and Sienna break up when last week I guess he take I out to dinner and he give I this necklace it be a wishbone or something on a silk chain which be apparently suppose to brake and when it do you be suppose to make a wish and what be you go to wish for we go out for two year and he never give I any jewelry to what what you make of that I guess he feel guilty that be a possibility he will probably tell I that he care about I and he be try to express himself that be that be another possibility it be too late why I be go you mean you be go beyond an emotion I mean the girl he love the girl he think he love she do not exist any more even if my hair grow back and I go into remission from now on anybody that I meet I be I may have to tell they I have cancer why because it be true so be you say that your cancer have erase everything that come before that your old self be just be just go I be sit across the table from Kyle and I know I could take he home with I even now with no hair I miss he but the idea of get into bed with he take my clothe off and let he close to I let he it be disgusting I mean I do not want it ever again this be just what you be feel now April that will change what kind of person do not want sex you see what I be say I be dead I be go you be not go April you you be you be recover and you 've only get enough strength for one thing right now and that be to get well you be right what do not think I ever hear you say that before consider it a parting gift be that your way of remind I why you say in your message that you want this to be your last session yes and please do not try to convince I to stay it be just that it be important for your recovery to talk about everything else that be go on I do not want to I know you do not want to but be not that your pattern April stop it that be what we 've be work on your push I away just let I help you I can not of course you can what I want to do be I want to schedule some meeting for your parent bring they into therapy maybe we could bring in Daniel stop it I say no your mother and Daniel stop it you fucking asshole be everything okay I have to go scratch my head I be sorry no apology why do not I have to apologize be it because I be sick because I be your therapist so what you be not a human being someone call you a fucking asshole and you do not care I tell you the day we meet that I do not want you to be take care of my feeling what be the point of therapy then teach people to be self obsess do you really think I need more help in that department do you wanna sit down I understand that maybe you react because a part of you want to leave but maybe you react so strongly because well part of you want to leave another part of you realize that something valuable be actually happen in this room I could be a perfect person I could reach nirvana and I could wake up tomorrow with a lump in my breast so you be say what be the point yes what be the point why do not you just take it off I do not want to and I do not wanna talk about why not or or why Daniel give I the wrong hat or why I can not let you see I bald I understand no you do not you be right I drop out of school when last week be it because of the chemo but you be almost do do not you want to graduate I be never go to get a job as an architect anyway why do you say that you see my work it be shit I do not agree with that it do not matter any more I be so far behind you know there be no way I could catch up well actually you have not miss that much time at all I be sure the school would work with you I be not even go for I I be go for my mother she get so nervous when I be graduate college because I do not have a plan she want I to get an advanced degree so she would not have to worry about I because I be on a path to success she use to say a mother be only as happy as her least happy child then she would look over at Daniel and sigh and I would think you be stare at the wrong kid lady well okay let us let us let us say that you do wanna take some time off why would not you just take like a leave of absence I will not go back so you be not just get tired of I you be actually get tired with everything what be I suppose to do go sit in a classroom suck up to my teacher Snort Ritalin with my friend really I have cancer I be 23 and I have cancer how the fuck be I suppose to top that where the hell do I go from here April if you could go anywhere you want and anywhere at all where would you go back you mean home yeah but be not be not your home so long ago and so far away you remember that there be these organic farm all over the world and they give you free room and board for your labor I be think about just go from one to another for how long I do not know until I forget my own name well unless you develop amnesia the chance of that happen be slim to none there be a girl in chemo with I um she be about my age her name be Lyric Lyric Merriman that be such a beautiful name she do not make it no she die sorry last time I see she we be sit side by side attach to our drip it look like she be doodle in her notebook just doodle and so I lean over uh to look at it and she be write her name over and over in all different script just her name maybe she be afraid of be forget it be difficult to be the one who survive I do not want to survive just seem so hard living do living seem hard before you get sick no there use to be this path and it be like it be steep it be tire but it be you know well light it be not there any more it be completely go do I make it all up no you just got reroute your life 's path have change without your consent it must be so hard to handle April what you be feel be normal it make it make perfect sense but you be go to grow old you be go to fall in love again you be go to have child if you want to you will have adventure you will know such joy you do not know that and I do not know that no no no of course we do not but sometimes we just have to act as if we do it be not go to work look you 've go through the bad of it you 've already start a climb out of the hole you can not see that yet be you okay I think I be go to be alone my whole life why would you say that that be just a feeling I have like a premonition I can not imagine love anyone ever again I do not know how I do it once look exhaust I know what you mean I have cancer what be your excuse I be no long 23 I go on your page again last night my my what your page you know online where people can comment on you as a therapist ah yes my sad empty little web domain so it be not empty any more someone write a comment someone name uh Sophie be she a patient of yours actually I I can not uh I can not discuss my other patient not even with I no she say you save her life you should go look at the page she have a lot of nice thing to say about you she be in college she sound happy well I will thank you thank for tell I you 've really help I April I I really do not do that much I take you to chemo I tell your mother the rest you do yourself let I thank you yeah but it be important that you see how you take responsibility for yourself by come to see I let I thank you and then let I leave be you be you sure I mean we have we have accomplish so much in this room you be not the same person who come in here two month ago come in with cancer I be leave with cancer that be not what I be talk about April you be so angry when you get here I be still angry yeah I know but now you can talk about it when I first meet you you could not acknowledge that anything would hurt you now everything hurt I the rain hurt I I feel like I have no skin well therapeutically that be that be a good thing I mean you 've learn so much about yourself about trust and acceptance about not need to be perfect all the time I mean I know it be hard to see that now but the great thing about self knowledge be that once you have it you have it and you can not help but put it into use okay you still have challenge ahead of you that be why I think you really need to keep talk to somebody maybe but not you that can not be you 'cause I be the guy who take you to chemo you be the guy who save my life do you want I to refer you to an other therapist maybe later not now right now I just wanna breathe and get well I be so glad to hear you say that People do survive without therapy it be very hard for I to hear that but I guess you be right can you hold on for a second this uh this might be easy on your head it be it be make of leather it be beautiful it be my father 's then you should keep it no it be for you be you sure hm hmm can I try it on sure okay wow oh my mom 's go to love this she really rock the whole Amelia Earheart look Silk scarfs and leather jacket be kind of her thing I think Cuba be her thing well she be complicated not everything 's black and white Paul I will try to remember that thank you Goodbye Goodbye hi would you like to come in listen Oliver this be the last chance you be go to have to talk to Paul before we move away do not you at least want to say goodbye to he Oliver your mom and I be go to be in my office talk so if you feel like it just come in and join we anytime you want okay whatever Synchro michvanilly salomon I know you hate I why would you say that Bess I be do everything you tell I not to do so you have you have decide to leave first thing Saturday morning pack up the U Haul and drive upstate can I ask you how Oliver be take all this very badly thank for ask he be barely speak to I all week and when he do he be find more and more colorful way of tell I to fuck off if you 've accomplish nothing else here you 've certainly help he get in touch with his anger do you feel that I have disappoint you it be embarrassing to admit this now but when he first start come here I be sure you would be on my side be you you be so smart and reasonable I think for sure you would be able to get through to Oliver and maybe even knock some sense into Luke you have high hope for I then that night when I come to pick up Oliver 's turtle it be so clear to I that you live here all alone and something about you know the empty place it just seem familiar to I and I think I think when I tell you about my new job you would be more sympathetic it be not that I be not sympathetic to you but my job be to advocate for Oliver so if I feel that you be not act in his good interest I have to tell you believe I I know that where Oliver 's concerned I be make a bad situation even bad but I can not wake up in that house anymore and all I be say be that Oliver need familiar thing around he now and if he do not get those thing there may very well be consequence you know that announcement they make on plane about oxygen mask you know how you should secure your own mask first before you help your child with his I feel like that be what I be do now if you want my advice I would say that you should adjust your mask immediately because your son really need your help the way you be talk it make I wonder if I 've spend Oliver 's whole life find different way to be selfish with he what do you mean well I mean I have Oliver in the first place partly because I be graduate I do not know what else to do and then I spend the next 12 year entirely devoted to he which help I forget that I be pathologically incapable of finish my degree and that my husband and I be not really get along anymore and now here I be violently uproot he all because I need a change of scene I think it be one of the hard thing about be a parent try to weigh your own need against those of your kid it be a constant balancing act Oliver tell I last week on the playground he ask if he could come live with you and when I say why he say because he be happy with you than he be with I or Luke be that right well that be what he say it be probably the truth I do not think it be the whole truth what he really need now be a home where he can feel safe you need to build that for he that be what you 've get to remember he also say he be very angry that you would not take he in when he ask you to well I think he be get every right to be I think you be his good friend and I be take he away from you I do not think he be ever go to forgive I for that I do not think he should come in I be not expect you I be in the neighbourhood why do not you join we I 've be at our old apartment all afternoon pack thing up to put in storage and suddenly I just feel the need to talk to somebody and then I remember it be Wednesday at 4 00 so I figure I have already pay for the hour so when you be knock we think it be Oliver and that he be finally ready to talk no such luck he be sit there like he be get ready to strangle somebody at least he have not run away again small blessing right I be take the next couple of day off to be with he before he and Bess move away but since he be not speak to I I do not know what kind of activity we be go to do I guess we could play a lot of charade you know you say you want to talk about something what be it I do not know just this memory I be have of the three of we move into that place when Oliver be a baby I do not know how we think we could afford a whole brownstone floor we be live so far beyond our mean and the place be a complete wreck the plaster be crumble the wall be just buckle there be expose wire everywhere you look we be so deluded we think we could actually fix it up ourselves there be this pipe in the bathroom that spurt little drop of hot water into the air I never could fix it so we have to keep the window open all the time 'cause it be like a sauna in there except it be the dead of winter and so one morning I be brush my tooth and the warm air from the water pipe meet the cold air from the window and it start rain on I inside the two of you have an ease with each other that I 've never see before why do you think that be 'cause it be over you know it a long time before I do and then even when it be really clear to I I be just too stubborn to let go I be pretty stubborn myself I be try to get you to be somebody you be not in a marriage I do not want we be just child play house if we do not have Oliver all this time and effort and that be all we be just two people who should have never get marry look I be sure that your understanding of what you be to each other will continue to evolve and change but now that you 've reach this point perhaps we can stop blame each other for all the way that you 've fail your son and maybe you can finally work together to be his parent because even if you feel that you 've always be wrong for each other he be the one thing the one extraordinary thing that you have build together I would well get back to the apartment 'cause I have a lot of packing to do you want I to come over later help you pack up actually I think maybe you would like to take Oliver tonight I think I be not suppose to get he until tomorrow it just occur to I that maybe you would like to spend some more time with he before we leave okay okay I be go to see if I can get Oliver to come in and talk Bess I just want to say that I 've be harsh at time but I really admire your courage thank you so now I get the next two and a half day to make up for the past 12 year be you worried about what be go to happen once Oliver move away Bess will be try to take care of Oliver he while she be start a new job I will be drive up there and back twice every weekend Oliver will probably be more miserable than he be now it will be a disaster be you absolutely sure there be nothing else that you can do I 've go over it a million time in my head and I just do not know what else to do what you think I be excited about be a divorced dad only see my kid on the weekend it be not the way I want it do you feel like you 've fail Oliver of course I do I know what it feel like to have my father erase I it be the main reason why I stay marry all these year try to avoid what be happen right now it be not too late to undo all this you know yes it be I 've already lose he that be become clear over the past couple of month oh yeah he will let I buy he some sneaker or take he to see the Knicks but he will not come to I when he have problem look he may be pull away from you now because he be angry but he still need you very much I never really learn how to take care of he I always pass he off to Bess Truth be I probably never want to be a father in the first place do you love your son yes of course but look what I do last week I mean Bess say she be move away and I do not lift a finger to fight for Oliver I practically force she to take he because I do not know how to handle he I understand there be a lot of thing that you wish you have do differently but that be in the past the only thing that really matter now be the kind of father you be go to be to Oliver from here on out right so what do we have to look forward to I will see he less and less right I will become the man who write the check look it do not have to be that bleak you have a lot of control over how big a part you play in his life because the truth be your relationship with Oliver it be never go to be over he will always want you to be his father so you can not ever give up on he or yourself all right I understand so do you have any tip to give I any word of wisdom before you punch out nothing that you really want to hear the truth be Luke there be a good chance thing be go to get bad for Oliver and for you for a long time he be go to be very angry at you and you be go to have to keep love he no matter what you be go to have to let he have his anger and you be go to have to take it just let he be who he be so just take it and keep show up all right I think I can do that and take it step by step right now you 've get two and a half day with he all to yourself take advantage of that all right you know before we go I think you and Oliver should talk let us try it be almost time to head out do you want to go into the

Elaine the moment that you felt shunt aside you run back to your family exactly it feel like you be kind of lock in this cycle that be very diff Walter you be a little early and we be still in session oh jeez I be sorry I will come back thank you so I be sorry where be we lock in a cycle I be sorry about early it happen I do not realize how many fellow patient there be you be busy all the time be not you so they finally release I Monday afternoon thank you for your help Connie and Natalie pick I up we head straight out for the bay I have a few shack there that Connie like to call a compound on Shelter Island we drive up a warm day first southerly wind of the new year it be a beautiful day on Monday it be amazing when the cold finally break everything be so muddy though they be a few week behind the city Weatherwise the snow have just melt and the ground be just soak I imagine it feel good to be outside especially after the last few week you could say that but it do not well no the air feel great it be just that Connie and Natalie they be just so tentative with I there be a separate studio near the main house that I 've use as an office sometimes or sometimes just to for a little peace and quiet when the kid be young I want to go there but they keep ask I why be there anything you need to do in your office well take care of some bill but mostly I just want to be by myself I just want to have a little peace that be unusual for you well Connie 's a talker she be always be a talker and I guess over the year I 've learn how to tune it out but this time you do not something about her pitch it just bother I so I go to the office and a few minute later I look up and there be Natalie spy on I from her bedroom window she be still she be still on duty yeah like I be a little boy that someone have to babysit you tell I once that when you be a little boy yourself you be the one on duty with your parent I do not do that much just keep an eye on thing really it be nothing even worth talk about so what do you do when you see Natalie keep an eye on you I glare then about minute later she bring I some tea which I have not ask for and she ask if she could just sit with I and how be that Brief she be my daughter I do not go to she with my problem you have a good relationship with she though you write to she almost every day when she be in Rwanda I imagine she would worry less if you talk to she a little bit more about what be be go on with you well I just do not feel like talk so I go to the shed and get this immense pair of clipper and I start hack away at the brush down by the water limbe the tree and pare down the bush God tear my hand up something terrible all that brush clear it be kind of like what we 've be do in here you lose I on that one in the sense that we 've be work on clearing path open up your view of how you get to where you be so when you mention this week 's thaw it make I think of the way our last session end you know between the pill and the therapist I see at the hospital I be not sure I even remember that one you really do not remember I find that strike give how emotional a moment that be well I know we talk about get I out of the cuckoo 's nest and I show you my pot holder then I get angry about you bring up Connie 's rehab I mean after that when we talk about the two Walters the one who you know and the one you do not know that be right you seem quite moved when we talk about reconnecte to the lose Walter well I might have tear up a bit but I be tired and there be be a lot of stress I understand that but my memory be that you do not just tear up you be actually sob what be it Walter where do you go I just remember a dream I have this week Mr Donaldson call I in for a meeting only it be not in an office it be it be in an old garage I go in we shake hand and he tell I they would trace the source of the contamination and that it be not anything we would do wrong some nut job deliberately tamper with the product and then put it back on shelf go on I felt vindicate and then the old man do something he never do he apologize he say that let go of I be the big mistake he would ever make that he want I to take my old job back you would be Walter Barnett c e o again I try to answer but I could not speak I open my mouth but I could not get any word out I wake up in a sweat I keep try to dive back into the dream but I could not get there you want to finish the conversation what do you make of that dream well I guess I still want to think the whole mess never happen I want my old life back do you because you say you could not get any word out be it possible that you be not sure if you want to go back probably just bargaining could be or perhaps now with a little distance you have a great sense of the enormous strain you 've be under for so long it never use to feel like a strain that be right I think you genuinely do not feel it you 've become exceptionally adept at override your feeling that be what we be begin to talk about last week do you remember right how the weak Walter could not handle the stress do you think about that Walter this week the lost boy no not really you do make I think about my father your father how do I do that just before when I come early and I walk in on you you just have a look on your face that remind I of he in what way after Tommy after the accident he could not sleep night anymore Insomnia yeah and he start to work the graveyard shift and when he would come home from the factory he do not want to wake up my mother so he would go to sleep on the couch and I would come downstairs and I would want to talk to he you know about I do not know the day before what happen at school and there be that look can you describe it how the hell do I get rid of you without make you feel bad come on listen it be okay really you be busy if it have be my session and somebody walk in I would have be piss off still you felt reject even abandon I be early right the same way you be too early for your dad Work come first that be life my mother do not see much of he either she got use to it she would come home from the hospital she be a nurse and I would fix she an old fashioned we would eat I would fix she another I have to get the cherry and the orange wedge just right then she would go in her bedroom I be always nervous that she would fall asleep while she be smoke in bed so I would check in on she and make sure all the ashtray be out that be a lot of responsibility for a young boy listen they be you can not blame she either of they their life be ruin there be any need to blame they in order to understand your loneliness they be too grief stricken to take care of I I have to put away my childish thing actually I think the verse be when I become a man I put away childish thing you be still a boy a lot of kid have it bad do you remember any good time do the three of you spend time together not so much on weekend he be always tinker with his car that thing be a real money pit do you have a garage yeah I use to peek in on he and he do not let you in after a while I figure out how to stand on a garbage can and look through the window it turn out most of the time he be not work on the car he be stare at a picture of Tommy on the wall one time he see I it be terrible you want to connect with he but you feel he do not want you there be that it the boy use to spy on I the same way when I work on weekend they would want to play or go swimming and I always have work to do I probably give they the same look maybe that be why we do not have anything to talk about now you know it be not too late for you to get to know they and for they to get to know you I do not think they would be interested maybe they feel I do not know intimidate by you repair those relationship be something that we can work on in here I say I do not think they be interested you be interested in talk to your father about what you see in that garage in fact you be still dream about it we never discuss it a few year later we move to the next coal town over my mother do not want to go but my father think it would be well to start over again in a new place without Tommy 's presence hover over everything and how do you feel about it they do not ask I it must be hard as a child to know what your feeling be when you be not ask about they for awhile there after we move I would run away back to the old home I would get on my bike and I would just go there I do not know to check if Tommy be wait for we Go figure out a child what would you do when you visit nothing I would just sit there for hour wait he never come back of course I wonder if maybe maybe you do not go back just to look for Tommy maybe there be someone else you be look for who the boy that you be before Tommy be kill maybe the old house be the only place you could let yourself feel your loss and find intimacy with something that be go with your with your dead brother and your memory there be nothing there for you Walter and there be nothing in the new home except duty loneliness do not worry I be not go to cry I know how uncomfortable that make you be that how you think I react Walter to last week come on you do not need to pretend I know I 've be a basket case in here I know how that disgust you why would I feel like that I be a grown man I be not a six year old and man do not cry maybe they do now but when I become a man they do not be that what your father teach you he do not have to where I grow up a boy would not be catch dead cry how about when Tommy die do you cry then I be upset I know it be my fault maybe I start to tremble maybe I start to cry because the old man I remember pick I up and shake I hard do not you dare he say in front of your mother do not you ever do you think that be when you start to maybe shut down a little you mean that other Walter of yours maybe it be not really fair to call he the other Walter the truth be he be a part of you a part of you that be split off and neglect for a very long time I be do fine without he all this time be not I you do more than fine you accomplish great thing in your life Walter so why be this split a bad thing it can be hard to live your life to be genuinely fulfil when a part of your your true self be lock away I think that what happen be that the other part of you the part that take responsibility that shoulder all these burden that be the part that got reward early and often the more you take on the more praise you get your dad must have be relieve not to have to worry about his wife and your mom I can imagine how important you felt just know that you be her lifeline she be tricky we be always walk on eggshell my father and I do not even tell she I be go to Vietnam until two or three day before I leave and you be a hero in Vietnam as well James Donaldson be the hero I just do my part but I be sure you be a natural leader and in the chaos of the war people must have look to you and they be right to do so you have be train from an early age to step up it help I survive it be always help you survive even thrive it be how you rise to the top of your field except that it be not really your field be it what do you mean it be James 's have you ever wonder why you spend your work life build the Donaldsons ' family business be it just another rescue that you take on like the way you nurse your mother or or your wife see that be the paradox you 've be reward for so long for your grace under fire that you just do not think you be of any value to anybody unless you be in that role now that you 've launch they your boy do not want to get to know you Natalie be do with you I do not want to see you at the door the only way to feel not reject be to carry the weight and to keep carry it even though your mind and your body be scream at you to stop I 've stop now have not I Walter Barnett the c e o he be go he come to you with a sleeping problem and within week his life be in shamble I think we both understand that by the time you come to see I there be no way to prevent the crash you know I be head for this the Walter you know the hero he stave it off as long as humanly possible if he could have hold it together this time he would have well it do not matter either way do it we both know what you be tell I what be that I miss it what do you miss my life be not that what you be say I be 68 year old and I have not live one moment of my life for myself what the hell be I suppose to do with that be you go to say anything just that I think that now be the time to stop take care of everybody else Walter and start reconnecte to yourself be this your plan all along to break I down so that I would become dependent on you this would not have be my conscious choice for you any more than it be yours but the defense that hold you together your whole life they just finally wear out you have two choice now we can try to wrap you back up work on simple behavioral change and you and I can both talk to your psychopharmacologist get you back to manage thing the way you always have it be a valid approach or there be a more challenging route if we can keep go do the work that we do even at this stage of your life I know that you can achieve a new way of be with Connie with Natalie and the boy but most importantly with yourself and we can keep explore those part of yourself that we 've just begin to discover I be an old dog Paul 70 be not old it will take work genuine introspection and you will have to come more often you really want to spend a couple more hour a week with an old man I would not offer it if I do not think it be worth your time and mine why be it worth your time because you 've rescue so many other I want to be there when you go back and rescue yourself Fine fine when do we start you have no message God Paul if you be not come could not you just call and tell I you be not come Subtitles La Fabrique 1 00 be you go out you look great thank you I would ask you where you be go but I know that you have your boundary as a therapist look I hate to do this I hate it when my patient do it but I 've ask my lawyer to call I about the hearing and I would rather be here if it be bad news okay sure I be so relieved that you do not ask for the letter I decide not to send it yeah I be have lunch with the kid last Sunday and Rosie actually ask I about the case and I tell she about the settlement offer and she say Dad you can not do this you can not confess to something you do not do you be the good guy she would be so rude to I all night about other stuff I guess she be still angry about the divorce and then suddenly in one sentence she make I feel well than I would feel all week I be glad so then I call my lawyer and I say I be not interested in the settlement which mean they go through with the hearing this morning so how do that go I do not know yet I be not there the lawyer say technically I do not have to be you do not go I overslept and why do you think you choose this morning to oversleep yeah the subconscious thing probably because I do not want to go and I just do not feel like beg some judge to let I keep my job you feel show up would be beg I do not know so why be you dress up I want to hear about your life you want to hear about my life you do not wanna talk about your own life exactly I would rather talk about how your lawyer feel the hearing go do he say anything yeah he say not to quote he 'cause these guy hate to be quote but he say that he think that it go well do he say when you would find out anytime between today and God know when so you be in limbo catch between heaven and hell wait for my fate to be decide yeah that must be what this whole year have feel like to you you 've be under enormous pressure be that why you dress up that blue look really really good on you it be the same color as the dress you have on that night I see you and David come out of that club on the eastern shore it be the 4th of July I remember I have this crummy summer job and I be park car and I bring out the wrong car and he ask I to go back and get his convertible and I look at he and I think of course why would not she be with he yeah we have a wonderful dinner and we dance and then we come outside and there be my most dedicated graduate student we be all so in love with you do not be silly how could we not be you be brilliant and we believe everything you say what be you talk about you argue with everything that I say yeah but you make we do that that be your technique we be so fascinated by you we want to know everything about you what be happen with you today what be it you do not wanna talk about what happen here between we last week or your case or your patient your child no none of the above can you tell I what it be it be my lawyer be you sure you want I to stay please hello Ellis I just speak with your judge I 've get news what sort of news first off he be livid at I no at Mr Prince for waste everybody 's time the judge have not write the ruling yet and he say not to quote he but there be no triable issue of fact what he say it be a tragic story but he be go to dismiss the action he be throw the case out be you say it be over Ellis I be glad for you I know this thing be a weight thank you so much you know I really appreciate everything that you 've do and I know I have not be the easy person in the world to deal with but I just want to say thank you nobody be nice when they be be sue the important thing be justice be serve Come see I next week we will go over it but tonight you go out and celebrate you hear I yeah thank Ellis good bye I be so happy for you my God it be amazing I be so glad this judge could see what the truth be how long do you think it be go to be before I really before I really feel it before you wake up some morning not think about it or not go to bed some night without think about it that be so great now you know you can keep your practice what be you go to do you be in limbo about that last week as well how do you do with your patient this week be it hard to see they I do what you say I act as if I believe I really be help and do that help to be honest I be kind of skeptical at first I feel a bit like a hypocrite and that they would see that of course you would feel that way but then weirdly enough something start to happen I be talk to Oliver 's dad about the responsibility of what it mean to be a father and keep in touch with your kid really I be talk for both of we but I think I reach he I mean I be still doubt myself but I just keep at it you know I just could not believe that something so simple could actually could actually work and it keep work you know you be a good therapist and I be sure you do a lot of good work this week despite how uncertain you feel April leave Therapy why in part because I take she to chemo I do not regret it but it do alter our relationship of course but also I think she just need to stop think about herself she want some space she want to breathe to live and do you try to convince she to stay of course I do I be worried that she do not have the tool to survive another crisis but part of I I have to say be really proud of she for reject you for reject therapy I mean for act out against you that be not what she be do though she be not punish I or her parent she be fight cancer she need all of her energy for that and you be able to accept that I be surprise by my reaction I know I have this need to rescue but I really understand her reasoning completely you know Walter and April they both think that the world be suppose to be on their shoulder and they be both incapable of receive support One 's stop therapy the other want more session so you be go to continue you know what I realize this week practice this way I may never know whether I help people or not it be not like I be try to get they to pass their driving test or do well on their sats or something the only measure I have of whether I be help somebody or not be how my patient feel about it and how their life go on from there and they will not know that until long after we 've stop therapy what be you say I guess what I be try to say be that these people come to I they want I to fix their problem and the truth be I think all I can do be just walk with they for a while keep they company during a rough patch I do not think anybody 's life can be figure out but it be in our nature to keep try to make sense of it and sometimes we can use help that be when if we be lucky there be somebody in the room who can listen it do not have to be somebody perfect somebody sufficiently screw up to actually get what we might be go through someone like you on occasion and not someone like I no Gina not for I not anymore when do you come to this conclusion I do not know please do not take this personally I be not no I be not take it personally you know I be just I be just disappoint that we be here again I know I know but it be different this time I be not do this in anger and I appreciate everything that you 've do for I I want you to know that thank you Let us not drag it out you know after last week really what be there to say I understand I just want to be sure you be aware of why you be do what you be do what be it you think I be not aware of obviously last week take a toll a big toll you know on both of we I know that I cross a line but you also lose two patient this week I know well have it occur to you that you be angry at they for abandon you and that may be why you 've decide to abandon I that be a little reductive be not it no but this be you begin the week question your value as a therapist and you be end it question mine I be not question you I be question the way we interact you and I I do not think it be healthy for either of we you be always question I blame I I think I 've come to represent everything you struggle with in your work emotional restraint delay gratification not indulge your love or your desire for a patient you 've make I your boundary cop the mentor who be prevent you from have anything you ever want and I beat you up for that it must have be exhaust to have to play my mother all these year if I came run to you it be because I need my mother if be angry at you it be because I be angry at my mother honestly I do not know how you put up with it but you do and you get I through it all I be say be you do not have to do it anymore you be release I now yes I be you know Paul if you need to go you go but I be concerned that you may be punish I because I fail to protect you but you do not fail I Gina this have be my sanctuary all the part of myself that I do not like that I be ashamed of I could bring they here and it be always okay do you think there be a connection between the lawsuit end and your stop therapy it be just time the thing I need for so long have change I can not keep come to you for the mothering I do not get and you should not have to provide it so you be not run away from home I would rather think of it as move out I be go to make my way in the world where will you go I be not go anywhere I be still go to keep be a therapist maybe not all private session some day I just sit there in the room with a patient and I feel like I do not know I feel like we be two mouse with our leg catch in a glue trap oh god it be a horrible feeling maybe it be the chair I hate that fucking chair you could get a new one I do it feel good in the store but here be the thing about a chair you never really really know until you 've sit in it for 40 hour a week for a month Month in month out by then it be too late do you want to practice stand up maybe maybe I need to be in a group practice so at least when a patient leave I could go into the lounge and run into some other people and talk about politic or book or anything for Christ 's sake have you think about supervise I do not think I be at a role model place in my life right now Gina I think you would be a good supervisor I mean you would have compassion for your student and the more a supervisor have see the more valuable he can be I be fairly certain at this point that no case would shock or surprise you that would make a young therapist feel very safe maybe you be right the one thing I have figure out I just need to be with more people I do not need a break from be a therapist I need a break from just from this you know I need to stop analyze my life I need to start live it I need you to let I go well part of I would love to I just worry about the timing you be still in mourn you be alone you be isolate you do not have a life outside of your practice be you talk about I or you Gina I be talk about you do something else happen this week what do you mean do you meet someone why do you think that I do not know I do have a conversation this week while I be I be wait for a coffee I be on my way to the subway and she be on her way to the gym and what do you talk about I tell she she look like a runner she say that be the good part about run and I say do you know this book the Memory of Running I do not know it neither do she but it be just great to stand there and just talk to she about a book you know I get so excited I ruin it for her I tell she the whole story what be the book about it be about redemption I suppose and do you make a plan to see this woman again her name be Wendy we live on the same block I be sure we will run into each other again and you I what do you have a date tonight be that why you be wear that dress I do I know it so who be the lucky guy right Boundaries until the bitter end you be an excellent therapist Gina I never would have survive without you thank you Paul this be the point where you know I be suppose to say my door be always open but I be not go to say that I understand so our time be up good luck
