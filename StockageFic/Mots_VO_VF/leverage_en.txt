be a person okay but then that mean that marissa devin be the asset they be liquidate I think no way that woman 's already paranoid Crazy we tell she there be a bounty on her head and she be go to

that we have be try to recover for some time it be a Gustav Klimt I love the symbolist it belong to my father he smuggle it out just before the painting make it out of Europe he do not Mr Ford I have search my entire life for that painting now we know it be here in Boston oh well if it be on display then you can make a claim with the museum if you think you have provenance it be on display but not in a museum Mr North buy the painting on the black market know full well its history he be get it hang up in his office yeah we have try every legal avenue but he even bribe a judge to dismiss the

have a pdx 500 rotate encryption system rotate do you even know what that be some other crew might be crazy enough to tackle that system head on but it be an impossible hack they would have to tap the network directly from a terminal inside the office even if they do get into the system they would only have three minute of access time before the encryption program reset itself and lock they out Timer be set three minute and count I still think I could get in you be good but nobody be that good in and out in under three minute be bad enough but north 's office have a pressure sensitive floor and thermal detector that operate under an entirely different system I guess cheating have its advantage it be easy to hack a wall than a high tech security system and now the Klimt be ours do he ever express an interest in the color of your toenail polish what no do he have wood chipper do he ever ask you to come to his home to see his wood chipper no we get a problem what at least we get a

city how do business work with you Mr Culpepper Frankly well frankly those who be with I from the beginning they be at the front of the line those who be with I after the election they be at the back of the line and those who be against I they be grind into dust now the good news the great news be because of your generosity you have move to the front of the line so let us talk business what you get look like his investigation note from this month I think I find something it be a twig you know that be not a twig that be a grasshopper leg Orthoptera gryllus it be not indigenous to this region Son you may have just blow this case wide open good work top line security be not he now you go get back to work you go be all you can be look like he be investigate a company call Kirsch Industries

it be incorporate in the Cayman island the only industry in the Caymans be scuba diving and tax evasion it be a front company for the mayor the mayor do say he want to build a park on the waterfront so city buy land from Kirsch Industries and the mayor cash in Parker what else you get there could be a safe in here but I do not have time to move all the ball and bat out of here you could start a baseball team with all the crap he have in his office what sort of opportunity do you see just Mr Mayor I do like your approach really I do but I do not think that this city frankly be a good fit for we now good luck with your re election what be you do he be prime could 've use the esplanade I get something much big in mind something he will not be able to refuse okay guy wrap it up we be go to go on a little field trip I do not know Culpepper do not strike I as the type to order a hit especially on something like a graft case what be the big deal you get catch go on tv you cry and get re elect it be the american way exactly this guy have be catch in a dozen corruption case each time he be walk away and somebody else take the fall this guy do not get catch I do not know it still do not feel right what be that it be a page I find in Bonanno 's notebook maltese Falcon the book or the movie it mean something I just this be how we be go to take down the mayor Baseball we be go to steal this ballpark and then the team not necessarily in that order that be fine your 3 00 with the head of the sanitation union be here he be a friend of ours all right I think you would want to know those two high roller that blow you off yesterday they be down here at the waterfront take picture all right thank no I will take care of it that real estate developer be take picture down on the waterfront want I to have the police pick they up pick they up if they be interested in the waterfront they can be responsible for my legacy but yeah find out what they be do let us go all right good good all right all right that be enough think Culpepper must know we be here by now or be you go to put up a sign or something how do you want to play this Classic con hook pinch and flip hook the mayor with the idea we be go to build a ballpark here that be right and then pinch he for a bribe to guarantee he get the action Hardison tell I he run a lot of gray money through his re election campaign so he will take the bribe out of his re election fund which be a federal offense all right so once we nail the mayor for the bribe the flip right when the heat come down whoever shoot Bonanno cut a deal the mayor go down perfectly sound plan just have one question shoot how do we convince he with no team to play in it I be look for the manager you get he what can I do for you Roy Chappell I be your new

country I 've see these kid you make it out of the mine then you get an m 16 in the rebel army and Mr Moto he smuggle his diamond into the US and then he launder they through his real estate holding here in Boston it pay to have a brother president the president be a good man who have work hard to raise the standard of live for our people but his brother be very smart he cover his track that be why he will win this money that Alexander 's saving this be for a coup no an election Term limit will force his brother out in less than a year nothing will stop Alexander then Rumor have it he be already sell the country to corporation yeah for that giant oil field they discover right from diamond smuggler to OPEC member that be a nice bounce in four day our president will visit his brother here in Boston that will solidify Alexander as his heir apparent back home Jane do not you think that when that article you write come out that the justice department will do nothing I bring they

to his eyeball and the only thing keep he afloat from not go bankrupt be the steady flow of diamond what be the good thing about smuggle diamond I know this one it be the way that they shimmer on the

they think Jackie Thomas ' report card be safe guy they have a dedicated air line that go straight down to the basement use for store extremely delicate item that be where your vault be hey guy I think I may have find his fragile item Moto just purchase a Stradivarius violin for 4 5 million this all fit Moto 's make himself a patron of the art in Boston to you know up his profile with the old money crowd and what be his vulnerability his tie to America his father send he out of the country at an early age he be educate in Europe get his MBA at Harvard his brother 's a national hero but Moto do not even speak his native language he be go to have to kiss a lot of baby or stuff a lot of ballot box so Moto 's problem be be that he be an outsider to his own people what about my problem I can not break into a vault without see the inside first yeah okay so you need a tour of the vault and Moto our mark need to look good back home let us go steal the man on the street in Africa have Moto ever give you an interview never do he drink on occasion why no reason listen stay away from your apartment and call I at the first sign of any trouble that be nice make he look drunker and then rich what you want I to do give the man a pet tiger can you do that the protest be spark by an interview with the president 's brother in which he refer to the wadata national soccer team as little schoolgirl in any that be a close one in any case Alexander Moto 's status as his brother 's heir apparent be clearly in jeopardy I be Guy Hamilton report from Wadata refer to the wadata national soccer team as little schoolgirl in any that be close I never say any of these thing this be a smear campaign orchestrate by my enemy enemy you would not have if you be here solve our country 's problem it be easy for you to judge I from your throne in the presidential palace be not it I serve the people of this country the fact that you see it as a throne make I sad than you can know you be do you think your brother could have something to do with this it be that reporter Jane Akinyemi you should have take care of her you be right and it be more difficult now but what do you want I to do just sit here while my entire country turn against I you have a phone call this morning from a woman who say she can handle these type of matter her name be Kristi connelly from Bulger Maple I appreciate your time Ms Connelly but I be skeptical that I could benefit from public relation I prefer the term Perception management perhaps you would like to see a reference from one of my recent client the leader of Uzbekistan or Myanmar those be two of the world 's most notorious dictator whom I be rebrande as effective ceo lead their country into the 21st century just as I can rebrand you as a force for good in your own country the Oprah way open a school open a clinic get out the checkbook we be much more sophisticated than that now have you hear the phrase one death be a tragedy a thousand death be a statistic well the same hold true for act of charity build a school and you just remind people of your wealth but help one single child and you be a hero it certainly sound more affordable what do you have in mind this young man 's name be Temi he be a taxi driver that emigrate here from wadata with a dream to attend the world famous new England conservatory to study the violin you be go to make his dream come true the poor need school and clinic but what they want be hero you be go to give they what they want you know I play violin until I be 14 I be pretty good too I never think it would help I in a con well why have you give it up I discover computer man turn out you can not see naked picture of girl on a violin so we need to get inside that vault here now Moto he keep his Stradivarius in a climate control case what you need to do be you need to get he to take you inside there right the entire heist depend on it so show I what spy gear you get get a button cam gps smartphone and I get a hidden Wi Fi scanner that be go to hack into the building 's security system automatically now all that datum be go to wash up on this big screen right here so you and Parker can orchestrate the break in okay Good sound good Nate you know I be serious about what I say about put on my own crew some day so what be this thing that you think I be miss what be it like thriftiness or like friendliness or big picture thinking or aloofne what Rudeness so Temi I have read story about you they say you be a prodigy he first pick up a missionary 's violin age 5 and just know how to play I be here for my family the violin can wait do not make excuse Temi you have be give an opportunity I must respectfully disagree sir in my taxi I 've be beat I 've be rob what opportunity do I have here come let I show you what you can achieve in America good work guy he be take you to the vault let us find those diamond down these stair I think you will find something very inspiring okay guy look inspire electromagnetic lock with retinal scanner can withstand 2 000 pound of pressure you want to know what you can achieve in America Retinal scan complete come Antonio Stradivari make it himself in 1705 it be magnificent be not it with all the technology in the world today you you could not make a violin that sound as good as that one no one understand why Sophie I need you to see the locker Security log show a delivery from wadata a week ago that be place in locker number allegro Allegro musical term so he be name his locker after musical term it sound like our diamond Sophie what I need you to do right now be go stand next to locker allegro so Hardison can get we a shot I can tell from your reaction that we be a good match I think you would agree with that would not you Temi Temi Temi all right so how do we break in we can not what excuse I do you see any video camera anywhere want to know why why because video camera require people to watch they people who fall asleep this vault be a state of the art glen reeder it work off motion sensor and be unhackable even for Hardison okay well I mean if we can not turn it off we get to get they to do it for we so check the log and see if there be ever a time where they shut it down and why it look like they shut it down once when the orchestra play the 1812 overture because they be afraid the vibration would set it off Guess that be what happen when you build a vault under a concert hall Sophie listen up I be go to change the play I 've just have a thought the story of you help Temi it be go to raise your profile in the city but what about the rural area they do not have television or newspaper no only radio which be why this be perfect your brother 's visit in two day you be go to host a

smell secret 256 bit AES encryption adorable wait hold on this right here make that big all right where be this it be identical it be HT1 I 've spend three year learn everything I could about the drug that kill my sister that be HT1 okay so I think Roberts make a connection between HT1 and Hoffman no it be between HT1 and Vioplex drink before the lunch so Hoffman be go to release HT1 as Vioplex and a lot of people be go to die Vioplex be HT1 here they just add trace amount of a time release protein inhibitor it will delay the liver failure hide the symptom instead of die in month it could take year let I see his bribe again so those be all the people you would pay off if you be try to push through a toxic drug he can not get away with this the FDA they get 500 000 complaint every year about bad side effect by the time anyone figure out what be go on Hoffman will be long go onto his next ceo gig so he will never be hold accountable for the people he kill that be right we need physical evidence that HT1 and Vioplex be the same thing we need the HT1 vial you think they still have they yeah drug company keep sample of everything they still get vial of smallpox in over a dozen country do I want to know which country Parker I need you to look around Hoffman 's office for anything that tell we where they keep the sample we need to get the F D A to crack down on Vioplex Eliot do not

be store in a case amongst hundred of other case in one of 10 storage facility now if I do my math that mean this case be it be go to be hard to find I believe I be make that point we be go to get Hoffman to lead we to the vial we will use Sophie 's friendship with he to get information then I will enter the game to push you realize the last guy that push Hoffman end up dead let he take his good shot we will see who walk away this time Prison 's change he well or bad I be not sure I be really excited about work with you I suppose we should discuss what kind of arrangement you have in mind as my consultant I would expect that any complaint about Vioplex would be move to the bottom of the pile that be easy enough but if there be persistent complaint eventually people will take notice eventually be the key word eventually people will die their friend and family will call the government and we will be force to make a very public and heartfelt apology and pay some fine but you know what happen between now and eventually we make billion of dollar these be not small fine last year my department handle a case where the company have to pay out 2 5 billion everybody hear about

right listen I do not do it it be go to tip Hoffman off and this whole thing will fall apart you be go to have to get it do before they manage to kill I I be in do anyone see anything suspicious no

you so your brother now will he ever play again doctor say he will be lucky to move his finger again Music be his life what Kirkwood do be more than wrong it be it be cruel now this guy Kirkwood you say he have a reputation for do these kind of thing so why would you work for he he own a record label Mr Ford so put it like this the day I be bear my mama say I look at her smile and ask which way to music city he be your shot at stardom right he hire we to write song for other artist his more established artist it be good money plus royalty and we think we would hit the jackpot but when it come time to pay he show you the fine print exactly he charge we rent to park in his lot he charge we for the pen we use he own our publishing so the only difference between Kirkwood and the major be that the major use lawyer to do their dirty work and our song be good and they do well and before you know it he owe we hundred of thousand in royalty you ever confront he instead of pay we he offer to record our own album in his studio no charge and he say he be go to get we a spot on Saddles spur Saddles spur what be that a big music festival in Memphis all right so what happen when he hear the album he decide it be too good to waste on a couple of unknown so he steal it the devil may have go down to Georgia Mr Ford but he live in Memphis Mitchell Kirkwood Record producer and ceo of Kirkwood Records now here be a fun fact he start off his career as an artist do anybody remember this I say we take he down for that alone critic agree it be probably why he never release another single he take all the money he make and funnel it into his record company and judge by the number of lawsuit file and drop within day I would sait be not his first time force somebody to settle out of court do he have a criminal record none he carve out a nice little kingdom in the country music world he steal Kaye Lynn 's music he steal her money he take over their publishing yeah but we be gonnget it back I understand how to steal money but how do you steal music it be call a digital master it be high quality multi channel studio record mixed and engineer price to produce hundred of thousand sometimes million now this building right here Kirkwood record Memphis Tennessee now inside this building be a hidden safe that contain these digital master one of which have Kaye Lynn 's music on it so it be a smash and grab not exactly 'cause we have to make sure she get back the money and a little extra for hospital bill make sure that he can not come after they that would not hurt a fiddle game Parker I

to get here Eliot you get an ETA yeah I be almost there but I think somebody be follow I do some Eliot fu on them what happen to this be what I do I do not think that be go to work this time I been mean to tell you this Kenneth Crane he be blow up on twitter he be get a fan page it be a pretty good picture too that be the problem I can not have my picture out there like that contrary to what you all may believe I do not control everything that happen on the internet there be a price on my head in three different country and I be fairly certain a fatwa be issue you be so vain man Boom there Fan site no but you know what when you get back we go to have we a serious conversation about the difference between caution and paranoia when you 've do the thing I 've do there be no such thing as paranoia seriously for breakfast what do Kirkwood just walk in or something how have he find we there be probably not a lot of five star hotel in Memphis you should probably justact the part ride this out be in character you should probably storm off about now I think I would givet another beat okay then Perfect the other man in Memphis I would like to slap just relax now little filly I be perfectly aware that you go behind my back to get the right to that song so let us just cut to the chase what do you want Mr Crane arrive just a moment ago he be just set up in his studio now all right let the magic begin you be not join they and risk be taint by what exactly which way to the meditation temple you know we do have a few room just actually right this way that way 's great too that be perfect Parker 's on the loose but there be a lot of unfriendlie which be exactly why we have cover story how be Eliot he be good he be about to record so he take his comm out too much clutter you ready man all right hold up man it be a little pitchy it be just a scosh a little pitchy not enough clutter it be pitchy in that very same spot right it be a little pitchy hold up man Hang on man let I get into the song do you practice your warble just put a smooth it out like Water hurry how be it go parker I do not think I be be weird enough somehow I doubt that okay sugar I get your water this be not from an iceberg I do not think we have that here fine just bring I some champagne listen to I man say pitchy one more time say pitchy one more time and see what happen I do not even think that word mean what you think it mean pitchy define it you define it I do not have to define it I be not say it every five second I be sorry I can not I lose you I can not hear you I be sorry maybe the safe be off site I 've look everywhere be not the recording studio suppose to be soundproof yeah completely here be the master from the Kenneth Crane session I do not understand you just pay 100 000 for the right to that song and you be just go to give they to I for free that be just about the lay of the land you must want something I would like you to forget that you ever hear the name Kenneth Crane why would I do that I be think about get back into the spotlight and I do not think there be anything that would jump start a career any more than have a song of yours sample by a major rap superstar you be go to steal Crane 's song for yourself how be you go to get he to go along with that I be not exactly go to give he a choice in the matter I guess there be one more thing that you can do for I stop ask question talk to I we have a little problem what kind of problem the guy who be buy our fiddle he think he be the fiddle yes sir I will take care of that first you be not do yet he be do one for he I find it let us see get it this be that song Kirkwood do this be the original master why be the artist 's name black out come with I try tell this guy that get up so this be the original recording of the song that make Kirkwood famous and this be the recording he release to the video it be not the same which one be Kirkwood that be just it neither it be the same song just with a pitch adjustment then who be singe the song I be match a voice print right now where be Eliot get it Boom Jesse Jenkins all right that be why Kirkwood never record a second song he do not record the first one Kirkwood pay he off I do not think so Jenkins sue he Copyright infringement harassment fraud the whole nine but those charge be not formally drop they go to court not exactly any other guess Jenkins be kill circumstance be suspicious Kirkwood be implicate but never charge Dead on how have you know because he be about to do the exact same thing to Eliot let us go now all right good I do love it when a plan come together yeah but where be the tape I think I may have leave her tape in the deck Unbelievable where be you go when they find Kaye Lynn 's tape they go to want to ask she some question we know they do not ask question nicely do they damn it Hardison you okay the festival director just call Kirkwood take my spot in the showcase he be go to sing my brother 's song and you tell I you be go to get our money and our song back but all you do be lose the only thing I have leave come with I trust I what be the plan come back to the hotel we be rework the approach hit he hard in a couple of day Kirkwood 's get ready to sing this song in front of the who be who of country music it be too late to stop he tonight no I hack into his truck 's navigation system he be on the move it be game over Eliot if he play that song in front of those a r 's I will lose it forever Eliot it be too late help do not help but do not tell I it be too late put that on sometimes you do not get a second chance to get it right why not Rule of life but that be exactly what we do we change the rule where be Kirkwood right about now we get three block Jesse go on go I can not move give I the cd all right come on girl get out of my I be try to get somewhere get out of here Eliot I use your fan to stall Kirkwood I buy you like two minute we be here be Kirkwood there

lollygag talk to you later all right see you later oh my god somebody call for help call my lawyer Season 3 Episode 10 the Underground Job go on Mr Rollins I lose 12 brother that day what cause the explosion it be a buildup of methane gas see the mine have substandard ventilation we all know about it but there be not nothing we could do so I guess get another line of work would not be an option Mines be the only way to make a decent live around there I be not look for your charity Mr Ford we like the work we would just like to be able to do it safely be all I understand so the CEO of the mine this Dan Blackwell he receive government money after the explosion figure you kill your own man and Uncle Sam write you a check that money be suppose to go to mine safety improvement I do not know where that money go but it do not make it into the mine that place be just as bad now as it be two year ago maybe bad all right we be go to find that money and we be go to put it back where it belong thank you thank you the rich and powerful take what they want we steal it back for you sometimes bad guy make the good good guy we provide leverage it turn out Blackwell do use the money for safety measure or one big safety measure she be name Debra Pierce West Virginia Attorney General her hair 's so poofy thank to a recent supreme court decision remove limit on corporate campaign contribution Blackwell be able to sink all of his safety money into Pierce 's political action committee so instead of make the mine safe he hire himself an Attorney General he be get his money 's worth since the explosion two year ago Blackwell have receive nearly 400 citation for unsafe working condition even he can not just make 400 citation disappear can he no but he can bury them what he do be he appeal they and Pierce make sure that those appeal go on forever so while the citation be under appeal he do not have to pay a cent we can not go after Blackwell with an AG in his back pocket no but we can take down both of they what we do be we get Blackwell to give we the money from the pac and then once that money be transfer we flag both of they for misuse of campaign fund the skagway shuffle that be what I be think see now you all be just make stuff up it be like the fiddle game yeah only underground be Eliot go to be the fiddle again no can I be the fiddle no the mine be the fiddle we convince he he be get something valuable in his mine then we sell he a process to mine it and then we take all his money right good so how be we go to do that we be go to sell the guy his own mine all right there he be this here be section b section b all right Basically I need you to point I out a direction where I can be out of the way no problem that would be section C Section c hey
