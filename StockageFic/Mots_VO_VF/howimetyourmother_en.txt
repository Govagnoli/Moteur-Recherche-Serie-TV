get marry every wedding invitation present a strange moment of self evaluation will you be bring a guest or will you be attend alone what it be really ask be where do you see yourself in three month sit next to your girlfriend or hit on a bridesmaid I always check that I be bring a guest I be an optimist who the hell be I go to bring to this wedding Ted have you ignore all my teaching for the

good boyfriend in my sleep I can rock a killer foot rub with one hand and brew a kick ass pot of chamomile in the other that would make you weep Hell I 've forget more about microwave fat free popcorn and watch Sandra Bullock movie than you will ever know but thank for your concern rook let I ask you one question sure do you mind if there be a sink full of dirty dish not really then it be Lily 's problem not yours but if I say that to she it would only lead to a fight so you fight see Robin and I never fight of course you do no and here be the secret every time it look like we be about to get into a fight why be there a bag of pantie label April 2008 in your closet so any time you think you might have a fight you just get up and leave 100 effective can not fight if you be not there that be what Gandhi teach we that be not true I can not believe that Robin put up with that do not worry she be get a great way to avoid fight too be tie machine washable no they most certainly be not why what be in your hand my God what be in your hand okay so you walk away Robin get naked those be the two stupid way to handle conflict I 've ever hear the naked thing be not bad that feel kind of weird okay call I crazy but when a problem come up Lily and I actually talk about it there be so many great thing to do with the human mouth why waste it on talk but if you insist here be what I would say about the dish if I be Lily 's husband Barney you be home Dude get to the point all right thank doll Sweetie be you go to wash that I be glad you bring that up no and here be why Lily I know you do not like a dirty sink but do that make it my job to keep it clean I mean if one day I look up at the living room ceiling and think hey I would like a replica of the Sistine Chapel up there would it be your job to paint it no of course not exactly so baby by the same logic if you do not like look at a sink full of dish should not it be your job to clean they thank for explain that I get so confused that be because you be a woman I do not even know why we be laugh of course you do not you be kid I with this Hang on Ted let us hear the man out once I have her attention it be time to bring out the big gun look I love you but baby with the little energy I have leave after work I want to shower you with love not wash some silly dish you be right I will do the dish right after I do this now turn around firm be you go to hit he or should I he be right no he be not Marshall look at I do not get draw into Barney Stinson 's circus tent of funhouse mirror and flawed logic this be exactly how you get the earring back in ' 03 that earring look cool it do look cool do not it stay with I Barney be wrong no he be not I hate do my dish right away you just say you do not mind I hate it Ted I hate it with a boundless burn fury I hate it I hate it I hate it you be welcome hey guy good there you be you will tell I the truth Barney say that you two never fight I guess that be true tell ya no way I love you both but you be the two most emotionally ill equip individual in the history of relationship you two must have have at least one fight you know what we do there be one small dispute about which one of we be more awesome we just call it a tie sand have sex speaking of which I be so glad we be go ski this weekend I need a break the upstairs neighbor be drive I crazy yeah it be bad I be

the bear skin rug at our ski chalet Ready Bye guy Bye have fun you know with his crazy well think out theory that probably would work Marshall I be just go to say this one more time it be a bad idea I think it could work two more time it be a bad idea listen Barney lay out some logical point Lily be a reasonable woman I think that if I explain it to her she will get it and I will get my way no she will get mad and you will get in a huge fight Slap bet Slap bet Baby could you wash your dish Lily I be glad that you bring that up can I stay here tonight I will make up the sofa buddy the ski bunny be back hey guy how be your trip so perfect we just spend the whole weekend cuddle by the fire no black diamond but a lot of red heart okay I be go to go unpack hey you man what the hell have get into you two when do you become so nauseating be not it great to finally see she fulfil emotionally spiritually and sexually I date she for a year how be your weekend terrible and it be all your fault okay I take your stupid advice Baby could you wash your dish Lily I be glad that you bring that up and here be why so it be like this okay sure you want I to go ahead and wash my dish but maybe I want you to paint the ceiling right like maybe I should say I will wash my dish if you get up there and just you paint naked baby on the ceiling you know it be just like I do not know what happen I be a lawyer I argue for a living but when it come to Lily I just get all fluster how could you not I mean the girl 's all eye and boob what happen to the I be tired after my drain day and I want to use my leftover energy shower you with love argument I should have write that down look Lily I I make more money than you excuse I Dance for I Dude it all make so much sense when you say it but when I say it it turn into a fight and once Lily and I start fight the fight start to mutate and multiply Sure it start with the dish but then so you be say that you should not have to wash dish because you work hard than I that be not what I be say but it be true and then all of sudden we be fight about who work hard I teach kindergarten I be mold the future leader of tomorrow you eat cookie and glue stuff and soon more fight spin off I can not believe you would rather be kill until there be more fight go on than you can keep track of if you need to go in the middle of the night either turn the bathroom light on or sit down my mother do not hate you she be neutral about you I be not scared of your shine impression I just do not need to hear it especially at night Danny 's not here Mrs Torrance please do not do that Man Lily fight dirty she be small but vicious like a badger that your brother 's catch and starve for five day and then put in your sleep bag I should go home and apologize what you need be a surge fight hard Picture it Marshall never have to wash another dish as long as you live yet all the dish be always clean why this would take all the anxiety out of snack no more hold open your shirt to form a makeshift bowl for your salty treat that world be yours Marshall reach out take it dip it in some ranch dress enjoy yes right Barney 's stupid idea be what get you into this quagmire there be no exit strategy just wash your stupid dish those dish be my manhood and if I want to leave my manhood dirty in the sink cake with ketchup and pasta what be you eat then damn it that be my right I will wash my manhood when I be good and ready where be he not sit Barnstormer Ro Ro now you have adorable nickname seriously what be go on with your two nothing we be just happy it be

you do I do not have the heart to tell stop because well good for they so I just welcome they to the building have a hard candy nod politely at some racist comment and then leave over the next couple of day Barney and Robin continue to be happy than ever and Marshall and Lily continue to fight I do not care if the dish be not do if you care you do it Great then I do not care if you have an orgasm if you care you do it I go 18 year without the touch of a woman I can do it again you might have to and I continue to hear more bagpiping than a St Patty 's Day parade I do not know what to do Lily

maybe Barney have it all figure out he and Ro Ro be the good couple now we have be dethrone you know what I be not buy it all that cutesy lovey dovey crap that be not they and I know for a fact that Robin hate nickname Thanks Robbsy Wobbsy I do not do nickname finish with the sport page Sherbs seriously stop Robin it be T Mose I do not like they on you either well she obviously like they now and

Dinner 's ready do you make any for I no but it be your favorite we need your advice so Barney and Robin tell they all about their fighting and let us just say that in comparison their little dish spat seem pretty tame and by the end Lily and Marshall both have the same reaction I will wash my dish right away from now until the day I die I do not care when you wash the dish but if it be with cheese base like a nice ziti at least soak it of course baby I love you I love you too see how do you just do that how have you just fix everything I do not know I guess sometimes you just have to set your ego aside and remember that the love that you have for that other person be way more important than win more important than win stop stop it seriously what be the secret look the honeymoon period

and true my mom say she do not have the hip to birth an Eriksen child but um you guy think I be the reacher that be why Lily 's not jealous the settler be never jealous of the reacher because where be the reacher go to go the settler Lily be the good thing that the reacher Marshall be ever go to get no okay yes I be lucky to have Lily but Lily be just as lucky to have I okay neither one of we be the reacher Dude you be so the reacher you be get she a horse what take the hit take the hit thus end modern architecture 's very brief experiment with the v frame house excuse I a second what be you

like watch a well light aquarium but not as interesting and now that I think about it not as well light the truth be we watch it for the drinking game the who now her morning show come on so early we be usually still at the bar so whenever she do an interview you have to drink every time she say but um but um but um apparently she say it a lot it be funny I have a drinking game base on Robin but it be actually on Robin I would pour peach schnapps in her belly button we agree we would not do this sorry you be right she do not like it anyway say it wake she up do she say but um that much that night we find out just how much she say it that be great this be not your first Spelling bee be it Third Good for you interesting article in the paper say that in every relationship there be a reacher and a settler really let I see it I be not in this newspaper it be in one I read a while back this newspaper remind I of the other newspaper Anywho what do you think about that well I guess sometimes that be the case but not in ours what of course not right say gun to your head you have to say one of we be the reacher well I would say it be neither that be what make we great now there be a gun to my head and our future child and our future cat or monkey depend on who win the game we 've be play for three year no reacher no settler how about this this go on for a while until finally our two kid our eight grandkid our 11 great grandkid be all on a plane pilot by Oprah and it be about to crash into an art museum with all of your favorite painting and the only way the only way to save everything be just to answer the question be you the reacher or the settler and Oprah 's try everything everything you have to decide now well I guess if I have to say then maybe I would say I be the settler how could you say that she think that she be the settler I mean that be it I get to prove to she that I be not the reacher I get to make she jealous that be easy here be the plan step one sleep with Jenkins Step two I sleep with Jenkins first step three we do step two first I be go to go get start on step two I get something remember the other night the game when you be put in the 50 hole whatever just another night for big fudge you think she be into I full on lady wood of course a plan taketh shape if lady Lily 's jealousy young Marshall can not budge then perchance fair gentle big fudge can make she jealous let I try that again if lady Lily 's I get it I have get a great idea be it clean your hair out of the shower drain it be like you be try to carpet the tub if you want to print out one of your lecture or something I could read it on air come from a more entertaining source your student might actually pay attention and learn something you be entertain last night there be three minute of dead air while you sew a button back on your sweater look just because your class like I more than you you be a drinking game what that be why they watch they make a drinking game out of you every time you say but um they do a shot I do not say but um I 've never say but um I guess it be not a very good drinking game which would mean last night when I play it I do not get super waste and throw up all over myself wait I do both of those thing so face Lily and I be go to go back to that college bar again and we be wonder if maybe you want to come you could just watch I

Mosely may not be as handsome as you be as tall as you be I be tall than that guy and our sex life be terrible once he even fall asleep while we be do it it be one time I be on cold medicine what nothing this be a terrible movie and it get everything wrong remember how I propose to Stella that spontaneous moment in the arcade I do not have a ring so I give she a toy I win from a crane machine that be so sweet so romantic a little cheesy well here be how it go in the movie look if it will shut you up I guess we can get marry be not you go to give I a ring no can do 's ville baby doll here
