somewhere in the city a killer be on the loose Josef want I to hunt he to keep our secret safe I just want to make sure he do not do it again you do not have to be a vampire to get a taste for blood you startle I I be Mick St John right my wife mention you come by the house you be look into Kelly Foster 's death uh murder do you mind if I ask who you be work for I be work for Kelly well then I want to help in any way I can she be an extraordinary girl and I I truly care for her so there be a relationship I already tell the police everything I have nothing to hide if I do do you think I would be talk to you that piece be over 500 year old from the reign of Sigismund I the sign of Vilnius a lithuanian vampire god Vampire god huh you know that be interesting because Kelly Foster show up dead with two bite mark in her neck well clearly someone be try to make it look as if I have something to do with it maybe that be because you keep tell people you be a vampire I be a vampire really well not in the way most commonly portray in dime store novel when most people hear the word vampire they immediately conjure up an image of some undead monstrosity run around at night try to drink human blood I hate that a real vampire be simply a person bear with the ability to absorb and manipulate pranic energy Prana be a hindi word mean Life force yes very good real vampire have a critical energy imbalance so we must seek out pranic energy and absorb it could not you just have a double espresso or something fresh blood have a very high pranic energy content hence the blood link to vampire but when do correctly a pranic ceremony can have salutary effect for both participant so tell I something professor do the salutary effect kick in before or after the sex with your student I think we be through talk all right thank you you know if one of the killer you put away ever want to get even all they would have to do be wait for the Cochinita Pibil to go on special vampire slay rock L A Publicity spawn tip Carl yeah and copycat do not be mad I give you the vial of blood it be inadmissible do you have it analyze be it from a person of interest the professor of darkness you have his d N A on file look he volunteer a D N a swab during his first interview Cooperative yeah that be what they always want you to think what do you have on Chloe Jones you talk to her she seem a little edgy she should be we find a stalking and harassment complaint file against she with the campus police file by Kelly Foster Chloe say they be good friend they be we also find a blood pendant at Chloe 's apartment they be both sleep with the professor well threesome never end well Huh do not ask it be about time you get back make yourself at home I do and pour myself a drink you seriously drink this stuff what be it like nonfat soy vegan blood if you do not like it I do not say that be you sure get out of here actually you get any freshie around yeah of course not be I suppose to know why you be here Josef it be possible that there be a core truth behind the vampire myth perhaps there be people with certain genetic predisposition who actually could require and digest blood vampire expert Beautiful now we get the food mouth off about the farmer the whole city be talk you want to know what they be talk about Us so it be a slow news day oh that be not it it be a reporter from Buzzwire she start this whole killer vampire thing a Beth somebody Turner you know she yeah we do some breaking and enter together Hmm well you my friend must get she to stop what do you mean like she be drive along and suddenly her car explode I be think you would ask she nicely but fielder 's choice the killer be not a vampire Josef there be bite mark two stab wound and the blood well you hit an artery you be bind to get some of that oh so you be tell I some poser wannabe drink blood out of a snoop dogg chalice be behind this yeah something like that hmm why have not you kill he there be more than one suspect so kill they all that be what I would do hey look I know you have moral and scruple and that be fine sort of but you be not the man I on occasion pretend to respect if you do not get this under control hey you have a soft spot for the mortal one a fascination with all the charming thing they do while listen to the tick tick tick of their own looming demise that be fine it be good everyone need a hobby look people be not go to suddenly believe in vampire because of a Buzzwire article be you willing to take that risk if everyone have vampire on their mind because of some reporter suddenly thing get notice we get notice I say I be on this good 'cause if that reporter actually find out who we be she get a Pulitzer and we join the list of extinct specie we be on the same

to be able to live with human well if I be you I would pay a visit to the clean she know where all the body be bury so to speak I 've never need a clean service however a lot of vampire but she be necessary to mentain the balance Mick st John do not tell I you need you need a cleanup no what happen here Mr Sloppy and mr Stupid over there get a little carry away off their midnight snack these two Accidents happen everyone feel bad but at least they call for cleanup yes let us take a walk anything unusual about your recent call we 've be a little busy than usual couple of coed on the

accidental kill I haul my guy all the way from the westside but when we get there no vampire no kill I do not even get out of the car so do you uh get the name on the vamp who call it in come on mick you know how it be all call be confidential that be why the system work really 'cause uh he leave this behind I be go to find he eventually the reason there be no body there be because it get up and walk away a turn go rogue if I do not find this guy there be go to be a lot more clean up to do with no one to pick up the tab the vampire who call for cleanup be name gerald stovsky you find this

ago who be they after hey tierney 's boyfriend over here go save yourself see you later hey hey you little punk give I that camera man you kid you know how much this thing cost the camera lose boy you should be ashamed of yourselves make a living like this talk about bloodsucker it be perfect we work at night we can get place other people can not you be a smoker what be you do kid what it be go to stunt my growth what can you tell I about dean foster he be a little intense for the work I mean we will take a picture of anyone but old dean scoff well let us just say he lack diversity in his subject matter let I guess tierney taylor where can I find he nobody be see he since she die he be probably curl up in his shrine room cry mm hmm can you keep your colleague off I in the name of vamp solidarity we would love to help but you be a celebrity p I now you be the story dude well the movie 's dead the studio pull the plug I hear the studio think the movie be curse sometimes I even think there be a curse you know every time we be ready to roll something happen like the fire on the stage and the boat sink heal the bay 's still on my case for that one now tierney 's accident except it be not an accident look like murder now who would wanna murder tierney well that be what I be try to find out well that be pretty ballsy of you miss turner chase down tierney 's killer you should sell I your story I could get cameron diaz to play you easy well why do not you get she to replace tierney nah tierney be the movie the studio'd never let I do it without her you think I kill she I love her people kill for love all the time tierney and I fight sometimes sure but we we always make up at the party what be the argument about I find out she be hide something for I okay I be upset the two of we we do not have secret everybody have secret scott not I and tierney I hear a message that her business manager leave for her she pay this paparazzo dean 50 grand to keep some photo off the market when I ask she about it she blow up I figure dean have snap she fool around with some other guy maybe you even there be nothing go on between myself and tierney yeah I do not want to believe she be cheat on I but when she would not tell I my band have not hit yet tierney have and um it be tough sure but we love each other and um whenever tierney be keep from I we we would have work it out come on what be you do I be watch for paparazzi I figure we get about ten minute before they track I down vehicle approach or less mick oh god mick here pant let us get inside you okay yeah without a life vest I would be stick again wish I be much more masculine I get a partial plate number off the car whoever be after you be wait wait after I yeah what do you think they be try to kill I they be head right for you I push you out of the way you have to push I out of the way because I be stand next to you maybe they be after both of we I mean my case and your story both connect to tierney right maybe we be close to a killer than we think what do abbott say there be definitely something weird go on with the movie and uh now the studio 's shut it down they be not go to replace tierney no but the movie be insure so the investor will get their money back what about tierney 's boyfriend we find out that tierney be pay dean off for what I do not know but scott think tierney be cheat on he and that dean have find out and blackmail she maybe she get tired of pay he and he kill she or she be not really pay he at all maybe the boyfriend be lie to cover up his own guilt no the boyfriend 's only crime be be in an emo band what be wrong with emo nothing when they be influence by husker du but now they all just copy jimmy eat world and well that explain dashboard confessional do not it I like dashboard confessional no you do not where you go home not alone you be not somebody just try to kill you well you can not drive I there be paparazzi outside well then you should probably stay here then with I oh wow from date to speed date no I do not mean with I with I I mean I just I can not drive you and my couch be comfortable and besides I sleep in my freezer upstairs so okay well well safe than sorry okay clear throat and you know I mean if you need anything I be uh I be just right upstairs anyway in your freezer yeah sweet dream you too now wake to the sun I calculate what I have do like jump from the bow just to prove that I know how you know tierney spend 1 000 a month on cat groom cat groom type on keyboard wait whoa whoa here be something a check for 50 grand to dean foster scott be right tierney be pay he off this be weird her her business manager ryan gold he write all her check right well there be a payroll account which be how he gets pay but every month like clockwork he also write himself a check from her personal account 20 grand a pop maybe she find out gold be embezzle from her ben I sort of remember see that guy be not go to stand up in court look depose he again somebody try to kill I last night ugh listen I have to call you back seem to happen a lot well I would not say a lot stammer I be look into the tierney taylor murder scoff because I ask you not to and the car that almost run I down might lead to something important can you run the plate why I what if I tell you that everything I 've find point to one suspect and he might be the same guy who try to kill I which suspect would this be dean foster paparazzo with an unhealthy interest in tierney yeah well tierney be not the first you know about he yeah he be a person of interest look five year ago an actress file a restraining order against foster which he proceed to violate with wild abandon threat management got involve but foster would not back off the actress finally move off to london and foster move on to someone new so tierney become more than just a subject to he and then she reject he and he kill she it be possible yeah well why have not you pick he up because we have not find he yet cell phone ring I got to take this I will get back to you on the license plate all right everyone think she be one of those vapid little girl who run around without underwear get married to ys they meet in gas station bathroom sigh tierney be not like that sorry ahem you be probably look for what we owe you actually I be here to talk about a payment that tierney make to dean foster it be a private matter what about the 20 000 check that you cut each month from tierney 's account be that a private matter too yes leave it alone well you can tell I or I be go to find out myself and if I do that it may not remain private tierney taylor be not her real name she legally change it her dad be a drunk he would slap tierney and her mom around and thenne day her mom have enough she snap she kill he when she get out of jail she be an emotional wreck and tierney buy her mom a house hire staff private doctor but the payment they could not trace back to her so you make they in your name that kid would 've do anything to keep her mom out of the limelight and then somehow dean find out despicable freak so in the middle of everything else we have to find the money to pay he off everything else her movie lusitania tierney be shell out her own money for costume swimming lesson abbott keep say he be go to reimburse she and she keep believe he because he swear he would not make the movie without her frankly I be surprised he stick to his word I think it be the studio that shut the movie down no it be all abbott 's decision hey mick what be up no go on the business manager I do find out that tierney be pour a whole lot of her own money into the movie though and it be not the studio that shut the movie down it be abbott then why would abbott telle the studio be behind it sigh look go see logan see what you can dig up on abbott beth turner dean foster do you get my e mail picture of mick st john yeah he be not a story without tierney taylor buzzwire 's not interested I do not send they to buzzwire I send they to you so how do st john get hit by a car then just get up and walk away I do not know I be willing to bet that you do know what do you want you get a tip on a hot story I be go to be the first person that you call from now on I get all of buzzwire exclusive otherwise mick st john become my number one priority it be up to you logan discover that abbott be break he spend all of the investor ' money before they even shoot a frame of film he need the insurance to pay they back and the only way to do that be if the plug be pull on the movie and that mean getting rid of tierney mm hmm hey abbott hey I be just uh I be just head off to a meeting for your next movie fish get to swim I will never you know forget tierney yeah I neither there be one thing we be hope you could clear up though sure yeah um I be I be glad to help but you know what I lefty phone inside I will be right back okay he be make a run for it yeah they always do chase people be so much different when you be a vampire a vampire be always in control it be easy to forget that it be not just a game and I can not deny the rush please when I catch the bad guy I do not wanna kill she then why do you I have to pay back the investor with tierney go the insurance kick in force majeure it be not an act of god when you kill somebody abbott you murder that girl she would have do anything for you but you kill she my investor be bad news they be go to kill I I have to shut the movie down look I I try other thing I sicce the paparazzi on her I think it would stress she out I try to get she to drop out of the movie on her own and nothing work let us go man hey who be that man jason abbott woman mick do he kill tierney taylor man do he kill tierney taylor hey get these vulture outta here camera shter click man hey abbott why would you do it I run the partial it trace back to abbott but I guess you already know that huh we just come to talk to he

expose he move on change city name start all over have you ever do that no but I 've be careful and lucky I suppose one day my luck will run out but until then listen how about dinner tonight arbor bistro it be a great restaurant they grow all their own vegetable you be go to get so tired of watch I eat I hope so it be a date the rest of the paparazzi have move on but dean will not he will not stop stalk mick and eventually he will get a picture of mick vamp or drink blood you know this whole digital revolution be bad for vampire back in the day a photo do not matter because vampire come

standard issue josef this guy 's dead Hank mottola die three week ago from acute pancreatis so so he die before any of this happen the fire the murder the the break in I sense a conspiracy theory come on when crime be commit by dead people this do not suggest to you any kind of vampire involvement our break in be commit by a dead man this can only mean one thing a minimum wage peon make a clerical error no Hank mattola be a vampire work with coraline to stage this whole thing seem a little uh elaborate do not you think what be elaborate dump a body fake a few photo come on you be talk about stage a murder and a fire that exactly parallel the way coraline die do not you see this be just the kind of mind game that reek of coraline or not you need to take the tinfoil hat off boyo step back get some perspective maybe you could help I do not do perspective you could help I look through our thief 's house I could use another set of eye and tooth where be we again City of palmdale next time I will try to find a beverly hill thief thank you sure this be mottola 's house the suspect killer who be in league with coraline yeah I be sure so now mattola'sin league with coraline yeah that be right come on well why do not you just let I in the door look can not we hire someone to do this oh so this be how the little people live huh oh vinyl recliner have craze killer write all over they do not they Josef if you be not go to help can you at least be quiet I would love to help mick I just do not know what we be look for oh that be weird that look just like coraline and you only worse must be the woman who die in the fire maybe coraline stage their relationship too Morgan have a copy of this on her bedside table oh a little french for I I could not finish it yeah it be coraline 's favorite book hey what do you got her camera steal by a guy who be be dead for three week I got to get eye on this girl for myself yeah you do hey morgan this be my associate josef it be nice to meet you the suspense be just kill I what be the surprise over here go on open it my camera how do you do it you recognize this guy yeah that be he that be the thief you be amazing it be nothing special his print be in the system the camera be stash at a safe at his house and who be that in the photo I presume that be the woman who burn to death in the fire your thief be her boyfriend he kill she he set the fire to cover it up and he come after I because he think I have incriminate evidence right well we will see when the police get a match on her molar so that be that not quite there be one little catch this be the death certificate of the man whose fingerprint be find on your front door from three week prior this guy be dead when you take his picture he fake his own death or he rise from the grave he must have fake it right that be the only explanation where be he bury he be cremate his ashe be now at hollywood forever well not if he fake his own death we need to go to the cemetery and see if his remain be there do not you think we should let the police handle this yeah you get your camera back this case be over wait a second the thief be a dead guy and you guy be not even just a little bit curious come on we can not stop now you be right Morgan be a perfect doppelganger for coraline she move like coraline she sound like coraline she do not flinch even when I bait she about come back from the dead the nerve but mick it be not coraline I could smell morgan in there she be not a vampire she be a human and there be no way to assimilate that fact into any conspiracy theory about coraline come back I know but no there be no but but what if it be coraline and she be reverse it reverse what you do not even get it do you what this mean it mean that you be lose it it mean she be find a cure a cure there be no cure for vampirism mick if there be I would know about it and not that I would care and personally there be no way I would ever go back to the mortal coil that be you I would you see that right there that be your entire problem there be no way to un become a vampire mick I think this have to do with beth I think beth be why coraline have come back now because she can not stand to see I with a human be that what you be go to say she can not stand to see I happy look I appreciate you know the unwritten rule that we do not give each other advice that we do not nag what be you say one of these day you be go to have to stop hate what you be God this whole story just get crazy and crazy no joke it be like one of those true story

anything but all this blood yeah and there be no sign of a body you know I really think he be dead what do you think be go on I think that shepherd 's family be more loyal than we ever think and they have a sick sense of irony the d a Got special permission to keep some trial memento in his trophy case one of they be the knife shepherd use in ' 93 yeah hey we get a real problem I know the D A 's go miss he be probably dead well he will not be the last where be you I be I be head for buzzwire I will see you there Shepherd 's fingerprint be on the bloody knife but the cop assume they be old preserve from the original crime yeah I be not so sure listen to this Shepherd 's memoir be mostly messianic rambling but a couple of day before the execution everything change like saul on the road to damascus I 've see the light and be give a choice death be just a horizon and I will rise like the sun blood be the key to death 's locked door blood be the key be that about yeah become a vampire I do not even consider it I mean a vamp could not survive long in prison there be constant supervision there be no access to blood so it be not possible it be possible if it happen right before the execution so how do you start a manhunt for a dead man you verify the dead part an execute man 's body be hold in the prison morgue for ten day if shepherd 's go vamp I will find an empty drawer okay we 've get a body find the D A Shepherd 's rise all right and he be piss when most guy have houseguest the checklist be obvious anything moldy in the fridge any private magazine leave out for I it be a little more complicated the window and door be all reinforce the lock be 10 inch steel strike dead bolt there be electronic surveillance on the front door so you will be safe you will have to excuse the mess I be not expect company this be really nice of you ah mi casa es su casa that be spanish by the way for keep she out of my stuff do not you think she would be okay with police protection I would not be okay with it Shepherd 's a vampire he know what he be do find the D A 's dead body at the morgue have make carl convince that shepherd 's family be on the rampage Good let he think that why so long as the cop be go after family member I can hunt shepherd in peace in peace yeah I have to go but I will be back Beth be go to stay here with you now um if you guy get hungry we will order in I would recommend not go into the office okay okay or upstairs or through the gray door wow this all sound so alice in wonderland beware the bottle that say drink I okay have last couple day shepherd be on display like a lion at the zoo it be not the easy place to turn a guy into a vamp have to be someone hide in plain sight Officer mick st John a p I yeah the L A p d be stretch pretty thin at the moment bring in a couple independent to help with the grunt work we already have guy look at the crowd footage all I know be I be suppose to watch shepherd 's surveillance look for any unusual activity it be probably go to take a couple of hour so if you could uh thank you very much vampire visual comprehension be off the chart so it will not exactly take hour the priest convert he all right drain he at confession and turn he at final prayer so the priest turn he all those hour spend pray be preppe he for vamp life explain the bloodlust how to get through the execution escape the morgue that explain why he do not eat his last meal yeah well it be not what he be hungry for anhe good on every news channel 's get mr Quinlan 's murder I be sorry I know you guy be friend we be not friend exactly he be just kind to I after shepherd kill my parent you be so brave to testify yeah I testify it still do not get shepherd out of my head even now it be like it be like I have some horrible connection with he you need to break that tie or he will never go away be that what you do when you say you learn how to block out what happen to you um sort of but I I also have something to grab onto someone the man who rescue I he be fearless it be terrify but as long as I be in his arm I know I be safe who be it well when I be little I would call he my guardian angel when I be a teenager I use to picture whoever I have a crush on you know johnny depp robert downey jr and all I get be a 60 year old bald therapist name bob do not quite seem fair well now you have mick on your side I feel safe with he give the complex history of religion and vampire a church be not where you would expect a vamp to find sanctuary Bless you my child forgive I father for I have sin it be be

you I be the one who want a confession if this be about donovan shepherd I do not know what he be go to do when you turn a serial killer it be not too hard to guess where be he now where be he now I can make you talk I will answer your question if you let I go why do you do it money for all their fault human get one thing right the 800 000 drake pay for the memoir so the survivor ' fund be

what if coraline find a way to become human again Oy First mick now you there be no cure for vampirism no magic pill no click your ruby slipper together and rejoin the mortal coil become a vampire be a one Way street there have to be a way I think mick look when it come to coraline Mick do not think with his big head you have to understand Mick and coraline 's relationship be one of those terrify completely self destructive freak show that you spend your whole life search for know it can only end in one or both of you dead that be your idea of love what can I tell you I be a romantic this be coraline 's house in hollywood where they first meet yeah it be quite the scene back then she could really throw a party so you know her Met she for the first time in new york Lincoln be president Mick say she be a courtesan yeah well coraline be a lot of thing to a lot of people Most of they man but mick be different yeah she want he and get he and then really work he over but eventually the crazy get to be too much and mick want out you know he would break it off but uh coraline be like a bad drug habit he keep go back to she until she take I Mick could not stand the thought of a child die because of he finally one happy family it be too much it give he the strength to break away once and for all I remember the fire I watch her burn I have not be able to ask mick this I know he feel guilty enough as it be but why do coraline choose I maybe she think she could put a little family together and settle down like the woman who get pregnant to save a bad marriage why you specifically you be probably just in the wrong place at the wrong time but it do not work she do not get he back look I think you know mick well than that and you know coraline for a long time so if she be back

come with I I be not go anywhere I want you to tell I about lance and what you take from he Lance be from a very powerful noble bloodline so what do he want with you be this about the cure Coraline you be a vampire again but you be human I see you I smell you you eat food I be human so there be no real cure the cure be mortal itself it be only temporary well what be it wh where do it come from it be an organic compound develop by a noble bloodline in the 18th century from local plant in this noble bloodline there be seven brother all turn by the same sire a cousin of king louis xvi MY brother a toast to our SIRE and to OUR BLOODLINE you be tell I king louis xvi and various member of his extended bloodline all vampire there be much more to the french revolution than be write in history book the existence of vampire be uncover they try to execute we by hang but eventually realize that burning or decapitating be the only way to do it ultimately the guillotine be the method of choice during the reign of terror so the reign of terror be partially a mass purge of vampire a vampire genocide a suspect vampire 's finger be burn and if the finger blister he be mortal but if the finger immediately turn to ash they be stake and then send to the guillotine the compound temporarily mask the characteristic of vampirism it allow those who take it to pass the test to IMMORTALITY and lance be a member of this bloodline he be so that be how you get the cure where be it I wanna see it here I take it from lance a year ago how do I use it how do it work you put it into an open

probably curl up in his shrine room cry mm hmm can you keep your colleague off I in the name of vamp solidarity we would love to help but you be a celebrity p I now you be the story dude well the movie 's dead the studio pull the plug I hear the studio think the movie be curse sometimes I even think there be a curse you know every time we be ready to roll something happen like the fire on the stage and the boat sink heal the bay 's still on my case for that one now tierney 's accident except it be not an accident look like murder now who would wanna murder tierney well that be what I be try to find out well that be pretty ballsy of you miss turner chase down tierney 's killer you should sell I your story I could get cameron diaz to play you easy well why do not you get she to replace tierney nah tierney be the movie the studio'd never let I do it without her you think I kill she I love her People kill for love all the time Tierney and I fight sometimes sure but we we always make up at the party what be the argument about I find out she be hide something for I okay I be upset the two of we we do not have secret everybody have secret scott not I and tierney I hear a message that her business manager leave for her she pay this paparazzo dean 50 grand to keep some photo off the market when I ask she about it she blow up I figure dean have snap she fool around with some other guy maybe you even there be nothing go on between myself and tierney yeah I do not want to believe she be cheat on I but when she would not tell I my band have not hit yet tierney have and um it be tough sure but we love each other and um whenever tierney be keep from I we we would have work it out come on what be you do I be watch for paparazzi I figure we get about ten minute before they track I down vehicle approach or less mick oh god mick here pant let us get inside you okay yeah whoever be after you be wait wait after I yeah what do you think they be try to kill I they be head right for you I push you out of the way you have to push I out of the way because I be stand next to you maybe they be after both of we I mean my case and your story both connect to tierney right maybe we be close to a killer than we think what do abbott say there be definitely something weird go on with the movie and uh now the studio 's shut it down they be not go to replace tierney no but the movie be insure so the investor will get their money back what about tierney 's boyfriend we find out that tierney be pay dean off for what I do not know but scott think tierney be cheat on he and that dean have find out and blackmail she maybe she get tired of pay he and he kill she or she be not really pay he at all maybe the boyfriend be lie to cover up his own guilt no the boyfriend 's only crime be be in an emo band what be wrong with emo nothing when they be influence by husker du but now they all just copy jimmy eat world and well that explain dashboard confessional do not it I like dashboard confessional no you do not where you go home not alone you be not Somebody just try to kill you well you can not drive I there ' paparazzi outside well then you should probably stay here then with I oh wow from date to speed date no I do not mean with I with I I mean I just I can not drive you and my couch be comfortable and besides I sleep in my freezer upstairs so okay well well safe than sorry okay clear throat and you know I mean if you need anything I be uh I be just right upstairs anyway in your freezer yeah Sweet dream you too now wake to the sun I calculate what I have do like jump from the bow just to prove that I know how you know tierney spend 1 000 a month on cat groom cat groom type on keyboard wait whoa whoa here be something a check for 50 grand to dean foster scott be right tierney be pay he off this be weird her her business manager ryan gold he write all her check right well there be a payroll account which be how he gets pay but every month like clockwork he also write himself a check from her personal account 20 grand a pop maybe she find out gold be embezzle from her ben I sort of remember see that guy be not go to stand up in court look depose he again somebody try to kill I last night Ugh listen I have to call you back seem to happen a lot well I would not say a lot stammer I be look into the tierney taylor murder scoff because I ask you not to and the car that almost run I down might lead to something important can you run the plate why I what if I tell you that everything I 've find point to one suspect and he might be the same guy who try to kill I which suspect would this be Dean foster paparazzo with an unhealthy interest in tierney yeah well tierney be not the first you know about he yeah he be a person of interest look five year ago an actress file a restraining order against foster which he proceed to violate with wild abandon Threat management got involve but foster would not back off the actress finally move off to london and foster move on to someone new so tierney become more than just a subject to he and then she reject he and he kill she it be possible yeah well why have not you pick he up because we have not find he yet cell phone ring I get to take this I will get back to you on the license plate all right everyone think she be one of those vapid little girl who run around without underwear get married to ys they meet in gas station bathroom sigh tierney be not like that sorry Ahem you be probably look for what we owe you actually I be here to talk about a payment that tierney make to dean foster it be a private matter what about the 20 000 check that you cut each month from tierney 's account be that a private matter too yes leave it alone well you can tell I or I be go to find out myself and if I do that it may not remain private tierney taylor be not her real name she legally change it her dad be a drunk he would slap tierney and her mom around and thenne day her mom have enough she snap she kill he when she get out of jail she be an emotional wreck and tierney buy her mom a house hire staff private doctor but the payment they could not trace back to her so you make they in your name that kid would 've do anything to keep her mom out of the limelight and then somehow dean find out despicable freak so in the middle of everything else we have to find the money to pay he off everything else her movie lusitania tierney be shell out her own money for costume swimming lesson abbott keep say he be go to reimburse she and she keep believe he because he swear he would not make the movie without her Frankly I be surprised he stick to his word I think it be the studio that shut the movie down no it be all abbott 's decision hey mick what be up no go on the business manager I do find out that tierney be pour a whole lot of her own money into the movie though and it be not the studio that shut the movie down it be abbott then why would abbott telle the studio be behind it sigh look go see logan see what you can dig up on abbott Beth turner Dean foster do you get my e mail Pictures of mick st john yeah he be not a story without tierney taylor buzzwire 's not interested I do not send they to buzzwire I send they to you so how do st john get hit by a car then just get up and walk away I do not know I be willing to bet that you do know what do you want you get a tip on a hot story I be go to be the first person that you call from now on I get all of buzzwire exclusive otherwise mick st john become my number one priority it be up to you Logan discover that abbott be break he spend all of the investor ' money before they even shoot a frame of film he need the insurance to pay they back and the only way to do that be if the plug be pull on the movie and that mean getting rid of tierney mm hmm hey abbott hey I be just uh I be just head off to a meeting for your next movie fish get to swim I will never you know forget tierney yeah I neither there be one thing we be hope you could clear up though sure yeah um I be I be glad to help but you know what I lefty phone inside I will be right back okay he be make a run for it yeah they always do chase people be so much different when you be a vampire a vampire be always in control it be easy to forget that it be not just a game and I can not deny the rush please when I catch the bad guy I do not wanna kill she then why do you I have to pay back the investor with tierney go the insurance kick in force majeure it be not an act of god when you kill somebody abbott you murder that girl she would have do anything for you but you kill she my investor be bad news they be go to kill I I have to shut the movie down look I I try other thing I sicce the paparazzi on her I think it

vampire lab let us take a look upstairs Jacob 's room would be right under here he be here this be where he watch jacob and this be the door he come in who be have physical access to the attic we renovate last year other than the contractor there be dozen of workman okay we be go to need those name if he make a secret way into jacob 's room maybe he make a secret way into the house or find one that be already here a lot of these old house have coal chute like this one and it be a way into the house it be be open recently once he be in the kitchen he could take the servant ' stair to the attic and take his time to take my son so jacob be right the monster be in the wall and in the floor and in the ceiling how do you know about the coal chute I grow up in a house like this here in L A yeah and what school do you go to you investigate I now depend you get something to hide no not anymore the paparazzi expose my deep secret shoe size 10 1 2 favorite color blue Boxers not brief how do we get on to this delightful subject we digress look I know the other two crime scene be in different part of the city but they be all turn of the century victorian maybe our guy work on all of they

do not have a lock of hair in the family bible but every soldier have to fit his life into a box this I keep so robert 's contractor 's legit but he hire a lot of labor off the book so they could either be nice guy from the home depot parking lot or convict felon but I do have well luck with the other crime scene both house have be renovate within the last year the first victim be take from a 1911 victorian in ocean park the second be take from a 1903 victorian in pasadena do they both have coal chute no but ocean park have a wine cellar with an access door and pasadena have an in floor heating system riddle with a bunch of old steam tunnel both have be seal up for decade have they both be open recently Yep I bet you 100 even the owner do not know those entrance exist you would win

be a reporter Mm hmm I think we can both agree that I 've get a pretty lame story I would not want any of my client go to court with it but I do not kill Dominic you tell Talbot that he be already in the tank when you find he I be try to get he out I mean it be stupid and and too late anyway so why do not you tell Talbot you be with Josef because we be uh and then afterward I I go to the bathroom to get clean up but at least if you be with Josef it give you some kind of alibi but then that would give the police a reason to look at Josef more closely I can not risk that I mean you know what it be like keep their secret be the number one rule it be weird talk about they with someone else we be member of a very exclusive club you and I I know it be none of my business but your arrangement with Josef be you ever afraid that he will go too far that he will accidentally turn you Josef 's careful although yeah sometimes I I do wonder you would want he to turn you no chuckle I mean no of of of course not Beth can I talk to you for a minute thank you do she tell you anything new no look if there be some kind of kinky go wrong in the hot tub she should just say so why do you think there be something go on between Simone and Dominic Dominic 's coach say she come to all his game she even leave with he a few time sound like something to I have you interview Hank bishop yet he and Dominic get into it at the party no he be go by the time the cop get there they be still look for he how long be you go to keep she till I figure out what she be hide 100 million worth of architecture and all the paper talk about be Dominic 's death at least I get a write off hey where be Simone Talbot 's still hold she he be not sure if Dominic 's death be an accident or not he say Simone know Dominic well she never say anything to I Talbot think they be sleep together well we be not exclusive and anyway what Simone do when she be not with I be her business how very egalitarian of you wow that be a big word look forget Simone okay there be too many vampire mix up in this look do not worry we will find out what happen to Dominic before the cop start ask the wrong question we will start with Emma and Jackson Dominic 's manager Good I be go home it be past my bedtime Josef 's upset I think he be jealous and that blood be not the only bodily fluid that he and Simone be exchange it be hard to believe he would get that involved with a freshie especially with a freshie Josef have his rule Chuckles Josef say you would be come by and that you be how shall we say Friend of the family I guess I be yeah chuckle so I see you with Jackson at the party how do you two meet oh I come over from ireland during the famine bury my family there I be turn on the ship never even see who do it how horrible yes well my brother be a boxer so when I land in new york I go to the fight search for something familiar and Jackson be there the moment I see he he feel like home he make you feel safe you

do not I be just say Vampires get need why do I even talk to you about this stuff you 've obviously block out all memory of what human woman be like yeah well I need all available brainpower to figure out vampire woman it be a shame about Dominic yeah Emma and I have be manage he since he graduate he would have be great in the pro everyone love Dominic I see Dominic with a blonde cheerleader at the party Lisa yeah Dominic be uh Lisa 's boy du jour it be not serious you know she Met she in new york back in 1923 I think she be a flapper then she be a vampire and love every minute of it let I tell ya I do not get close enough to she at the party to tell do Dominic know no no of course not he do not know about any of we all right guy good practice Lisa you must be Mick how have we not meet before it be a cruel world I hear you be look into Dominic 's death that maybe it be murder yeah or an accident somebody get a little rough they find vamp blood on the body not mine not that night you be sleep with he though we hook up once or twice I be into jock this semester oh so how long you be in college 40 year or so it be the perfect life for a vamp nobody notice when you sleep all day and there be a constant rotation of frat boy too drunk to know when a hickey be not a hickey no one notice the puncture mark in the neck that be not the artery I go for oh okay hank let us go over this again I do not kill Dominic then why have you run it be not safe here you got to protect I Sure but listen who exactly be we protect you from from her she kill Dominic throw he around the room like a rag doll snap his neck like it be nothing so you be not feed on Dominic no way he take our team to the tournament three year in a row he need his strength Emma be careful too at least I never notice anything wait a minute Emma Emma monaghan Dominic be sleep with his manager yeah for the past few month do Jackson know not from I no way I would get in the middle of that and then I see her face her eye well who be it who who would you see it be Dominic 's manager Emma hey listen Hank say he see Emma monaghan kill Dominic during rough sex we be go to go pick she up hey Mick I think Dominic may have be with Emma in the locker room and hank see she kill he Talbot 's on his way to her office now stop he how what be I suppose to say I do not know anything just stop he well he be just bring she in for question what be she go to do well I do not know but I do not think Talbot want to find out then you have to get there first I be on my way no no Emma stop no I will not go to jail Emma Emma put the chair down okay be you here to help I or they you okay yeah Emma stop it stop stop this be not how this go you know that I will not go to jail okay we will figure that out but think about what you be do you be endanger all of we think about Jackson I guess we know whose side you be on how do she do all this psychotic break maybe definitely psychotic yeah but I just I think hank be exaggerate well that be not so bad a homicidal desperate vampire be in custody and she be go to need to feed soon it be very bad so this be what 150 year of marriage look like check out these wedding license they 've get a new pair of name every 20 year or so yeah one thing about be a vampire you get to reinvent yourself over and over again but no matter who they be or what they do they always stay together it be so romantic they probably have a double wide freezer as well Emma say Jackson ask she to turn he that he know it be the only way they could really be together well at least Jackson have a choice what about you have you ever turn anyone into a vampire sorry uh all we get be tap we do not have many human over to the house that be fine thank you thank you so you do not know about Emma and Dominic never suspect a thing but like they say no matter how long you know someone you never really know them I think we be happy how long can Emma go without feed she would not do anything stupid you sure about that she just need to know that she be not alone that we will figure this out let I talk to she can you get he in to see she yeah Jackson I be so sorry I love you why can not we hear they they do not want their conversation to be overhear they be speak below audible hearing level you can hear they right yeah I never mean to hurt you what have she say she be tell he she be sorry he be sleep with Lisa I get angry I forget my strength then when Dominic tell she he be see Lisa she lose control he be dead before she even realize what she have do do you love he of course not it be nothing so you throw away everything we build together everything we be to each other Y you betray I for for nothing it be not about we or you it be about I be with Dominic it make I feel young until he dump I for a young model if only he know the truth I be sorry I know I screw up but it be an accident this be first Degree murder that be life in prison I will never survive that Josef already have a lawyer work on your bail it will not come to that no it will not St John side with the human he be the one that let they put I in here what be wrong he will get I out you go out there and you tell he if he do not not only will I tell the cop exactly what I be but I will tell them I be not the only one Emma that be crazy you tell he that I will do it I will give up his name all of his friend every vampire in los angeles you have 24 hour what be wrong what do she say but how could the judge deny Emma bail hmm whatever happen to innocent till prove guilty Emma be guilty I know but simone make her sound innocent and halfway through her speech even I be buy it do not matter we be go to work this out oh yeah you know simone look a little green when she leave court today like uh she might be afraid you would blame she for the judgment and by blame I mean kill she no I tell she it be not her fault I be not mad she like you you know who do not like I she tell you that she do not need to and I think the feeling 's mutual now do not that violate one of your rule yeah several hi Simone I I be so sorry I know I should have call first no that be okay come in you know about the other night I just I just feel like I should apologize no no no it be okay I be just upset it just look kind of uh intimate yeah feed they blood I mean I think it be intimate but to they it be just
