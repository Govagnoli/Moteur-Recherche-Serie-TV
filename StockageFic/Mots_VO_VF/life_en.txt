off a few time Smith you can go ask he I be not afraid except for the Confusion over your pen I be not lie once Homeless guy no I never see a homeless guy live back there you be not real bright be you Mr Smith about average I guess why be there a reason you ignore the alarm and the call from the neighbor about a scream I do not like go by the Sand place it make I kinda sick 'cause they be gay no 'cause I be lazy be we do okay the guard do not know Easley be live in the backyard mean he do not back Easley 's story maybe the guard 's lie the coroner find fiber it look like the shooter wear glove the guard Smith wear glove that night we test he there be no gunshot residue Easley say he see James let us see if James say he see Easley yes this be my jacket and these be all our thing be these steal from your house the night your husband Len be kill no we throw these thing away month ago where do you find they a concerned citizen turn they over to we with this where be the rest of it sorry well the rest of the thing that be take it mean the world to I that you find Len 's ring but you do not find anything else you seem surprised I be not surprised disappointed the thing that be steal be the thing that Len love good a watch his mother 's candlestick they uh they leave all the expensive thing how would they know what be most important to Len I I do not know but whoever do be know Len well really well so if the neighbor be near enough to hear a scream what else do they hear Len and James be a great couple they love each other so much you never hear they fight no that be why I call Smith right away when I hear the scream but it take he forever to get here tell they about your theory Drew it be not a theory Stephanie it be not anything I just hear Officer Smith say thing terrible thing homophobic thing particularly about Len and James Drew think that Smith kill Len he think it be a hate crime I never say that yes you do all right do not be a liar I mean you be such a hypocrite oh hypocrite my my have somebody be read do not talk to I like I be an idiot well then do not act like one all rich people be crazy it be not just you I think I will give you my card

Sand I want your promise my identity will not be reveal we will certainly do all we can to protect your anonymity why do you think your husband be the person who kill Len Sand because sadly my husband be a homosexual he be have an affair with Len Sand I think Len want to call it off so Drew kill he you see this you see the murder I see Drew leave Len 's house that night after I hear the scream that be why I call Smith the security guard to tell he that I hear the scream because I do not want Drew to know that I see he you hear what Drew say he be try to frame Smith for this do you have proof I be his wife he hide thing from I I would not testify against he anyway Truth be I love he I just can not stand to live with this anymore look if we solve this fast we will not have to book Easley why

say that she see Drew leave here the night of the shooting do you ever suspect that Drew and Len would have an affair no I an but they be good friend I always use to tease len that he and draw would make a great couple I suspect that draw be closet but I look it be it be possible we do not have enough evidence to take to a grand jury to charge Drew or James we get an eyewitness who say it be James a drunk homeless guy that we should have book eight hour ago if the grand jury believe Easley we can arrest James plus Easley will not last in jail no if we do not book he we be go to loose he

Bye the reason why the bank of l a Shoot Out be such good stakeout talk be there be so many cop on scene there be so many different story there be not any different version there be one version the official version really well my old partner bobby 's version be pretty intense the street in front of the bank a sea of uniform all that noise how exactly would stark know about that he be there right in the middle of it Stark tell you he be in the middle of it yeah why there be always that guy which guy be that the one who want to be there so badly he change the story to make it happen there be no uniform in front of the bank that day at all but all those round fire over 1 100 round fire but they be all tactical Tactical Swat be on a training exercise one block over they be there first that be why no civilian be kill that be why no police be shoot that be why we study it but bobby say I do not know what your old partner tell you but if he be in uniform which he be he be work the barricade

get up on that witness stand and tell them exactly what I say you say more than you think oh what be wrong with you what kind of a bitch show up where a guy be try to get right and set he up to get shoot at and throw in jail you be not go to jail you be go home he be not admit to anything more than consensual sex and I be pretty sure that be not a crime it be confuse what to do I say we let the

then he will not pay again that be why he be not list in mr Farthingale 's evasion file he be not not pay how would farthingale get hold of something like this oh you would have to look for some kind

part where you have a relationship with master chang you go to the zen center too do not you amy that be you Younger but you right I would drive luke there he be not a very good driver his mind be always somewhere else I understand that Detective reese do not let I drive we also hear that master chang would take you into his office for a little one on one enlightenment while your professor be out on the mat that be not true who say that who sit in the third chair it be a trio you and your husband play yes who sit in the third chair my son I would like you to leave do your husband luke know that you be have sex with tim chang I be not that be a lie as a rule old man get really upset about stuff like that be it true that those zen master know all the secret place okay that be enough I

sometimes they be the guard sometimes they be his cellmate and sometimes sometimes I think they be even len lyle but I be not so sure about that last part it be confuse take a look at this come here so in the play your character 's in the electric chair that be right old sparky but of course you yourself be never in the electric chair not my body my soul man in that chair every day ready to die now watch this here be my favorite part how do you two meet I write to len lyle and I write back and she write to the parole board yes I do it have become clear that len lyle be not the man that go to

of they and the guard too yes and the guard too so hard to understand you got to watch it more than once what kind of bat do you use when you do those three girl it do not say in the program you be
