star or an aurora then they have someone to turn to all the time to whom to which to say do you see that do that really happen and in a life that be full of amazing moment it be important to have confirmation the second be consolation married people provide consolation for each other when bad luck death or even the simple sadness of the passing of beauty become hard to make it go on then you have someone to turn to for a hand for an embrace for a kiss for consolation and last but not least there be joy it be not a c word but then life and love be surprising you may kiss the bride oh my

Darling who be Gustav go ahead tell he Gustav be my uh pet name for Brian jr it be a nickname kind of Nickname really yeah it be a rather unremarkable occurrence between a father and son be it true you force Brian jr to lie to your wife and pretend he be a swedish orphan whose parent die in a car accident no no it be a bullet train accident not a car get your fact straight but you do make he lie no I offer he an opportunity to work with I to smooth the way towards build a new family structure by soft pedaling as it be the nature of his involvement with I and by make it a fun game be not it also true reverend Darling that you keep Brian jr on a diet of swedish food include fermented milk and reindeer it be once it be a 1 day thing and do not you forbid he to tell the truth to your wife until he be so paralyzed by fear and guilt of hellfire and damnation that he have to confess the truth himself I need help I 've get this little romantic rendezvous tonight and uh I be wonder if you

and not mine yours Brian that first day that I meet you at church you sit and talk with I for hour about faith and solace yeah so what about it so you be the one who teach I to bring my problem in life to God have you think about do that I know this whole get together may seem a little old fashioned but I think it be time to cut through the haze of go between and talk in person hey I could not agree more Paddy I be glad you come thank you as long as everything be move forward dad I be happy no hard feeling so what be you do with my son do what no what be the nature of your alliance hold on a second be you kid this be none of your business anymore dad you do not have to answer that no no no I be happy to I be ecstatic I 've simply offer myself to Patrick as an advisor and a friend during this time of transition so you be not use he as a pawn to enact revenge against I huh um I think that Patrick 's pedigree combine with his passion for social justice be go to make he a very effective senator I be excited to be on his team that be all Dad try not to make a fool of yourself okay what be this all about Tripp it be about the chill heartlessness of a man determined to tear asunder the long stand family tie in the course of his vendetta do you want to tell they why you want to destroy my family or shall I you know Lisa I um I 've be mean to apologize to you but I keep put it off you know for the wedding for Karen 's behavior she can be so rash and thoughtless sometimes and I know how proud she be and she would never come to you herself what be you talk about you present yourself as a some sort of modern day saint but that be not who you be at all you be not motivate by benevolence you be drive from your very core by an obsessive malevolence against I and my family I 've get to get go Paddy hear this out Tripp none of this be personal it be business so your family 's history with my family have nothing to do with it what be you talk about Tripp I do not know what his real name be before but as soon as I find out everything fall into place his parent use to work for our family for a long time do you want to continue or shall I what happen oh it be nothing really I be sorry I uh well I assume you know um you and Karen have be so chilly that what happen I would love to hear what you think you know your father be my mother 's lover well that be the rumor and my father could not live with those rumor true or false so he dismiss his parent and they flee to the Soviet Union with the belief that communism speak more clearly to the plight of african americans but it be not so rosy over there be it his family end up in a siberian work camp and they die there leave you an orphan be that true it touch on the truth well you know Karen be in a bit of a depression you know post divorce and a little intoxicated and she she apparently kiss Nick and declare she undying love for he she can be so impulsive no it be the truth and it be the truth that you hold I personally responsible for the death of your parent see I do not need some desiccated old man to tell I my history desiccate especially one who get it all wrong my parent do not go to Russia by choice your family force they there no you 've get it all wrong I be not dry meat and your parent be not deport from this country and you know it no no but once their name have be hand over to the state department they be for all intent and purpose hound out of this country so yeah their death lie at the foot of your family completely all right I 've hear enough look I do not know who be tell the truth here okay but the fact that you lure all of we up here for this little performance of yours and then get everyone else involve with your game that arrogance be precisely why I stop trust you year ago and why I will never trust you again do you understand if you see Ellen tell she I 've go out I will head home as well I wish this have end differently well it end exactly as I expect it to end with a crafty denial Night Tripp good night well at least it be out there for everyone to know excuse I it be so sick Simon Simon you tell I this be not an ambush I do not know anything about it you need to stop lie to I I will not be play no one be play you if that fossil want a war that be exactly what he will get that be what you will both get Simon Simon Simon this be all Tripp I have nothing too with it that be the truth the tru oh the truth oh the truth be pretty malleable around here all right all right all right just listen if we be go to go any further I need to know one last time whether you be with I or not well if all you be do be exact revenge then no I be not Nick I be not exact revenge but Tripp Darling own half the city be not good for the people of New York he be a dangerous man I know that Tripp have make some shady business deal but dangerous yes do you remember Kenneth Darling Tripp 's brother Simon come on the only people who think that Tripp have anything to do with Kenneth Darling 's assassination be crackpot conspiracy theorist on the internet and two people who be actually suspect in the killing both of whom have since be completely discredit yeah you be probably right because bad thing do not really happen it be all just a story right where be Nick I be not sure Scotch uh oh it be empty sorry be you this drunk when you kiss my husband and tell he that you love he at your wedding actually no I be sober and so be he hey there you be be careful she just find out about our kiss at the wedding it be not our kiss Karen Unbelievable you be

much well 'cause I know I do not deserve much but please help the arbitrator to understand that I love my son oh I be so sorry and please give she the good sense I think this be yours no it fall out of your from reverend Darling to accept my generous donation thank you amen so you be just go to leave right now I be go to my parent ' house I need some time to regroup Lisa the only reason that I do not tell you be that I do not want to waste our time argue over nothing it be basically a peck on the cheek her lip my cheek how many time do she have to kiss you before you put a stop to it I can not control what Karen do be that go to be your excuse when you two sleep together she be delusional Lisa I 've tell she over and over there will never be anything between we but she live in this world
