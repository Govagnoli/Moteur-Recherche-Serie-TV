you have not hear the downside see the tumor be locate in a part of your brain where your memory and your personality reside and because of the fuzzy edge of this type of tumor I have to cut out a lot jorge you stand a good chance of lose your memory of lose who you be Sona be there any other way the alternative be gamma or cyberknife treatment with focus radiation it be less evasive there ' little chance of memory loss or he lose himself but it would only give Jorge maybe three to five year three to five year Sniffling Derek this be an incredibly difficult decision if you have any more question

I be hope it be yours no what do you think Cristina 50 say Meredith gets toss out and Burke walk away clean please be nice to her Sighing Sighing so I have do a lot of research on this and Dr Burke have be kind enough to help I and I understand my responsibility in what I 've do wrong here however I do think the patient 's history be significant in this case she still weigh 200 pound which be why no one even notice it but with that kind of a weight drop it do not matter how much you weigh you be anorexic along with all that fat she be lose heart muscle that certainly could be the reason for a small poke to become a large tear that still do not change the fact though the poke be not report at the time of the occurrence and if I could change that and you can not you leave yourself and the hospital open to tremendous liability Burke not if the weight loss cause the problem I have no choice I 've speak to the husband his wife remain stable I can not take your belief to the bank Dr Burke Dr Grey make a huge error here and she report it too late and in front of the patient 's husband but she report it she speak up five year ago as a CT fellow I have a nagging feeling that I do not check the body cavity of a lung patient closely enough before I close the patient seem fine post op and I be in a hurry and yesterday you and Dr Bailey pull a towel out from under that patient 's lung why do not I report it at an appropriate time maybe because I be afraid that I would be call into a meeting where some hospital lawyer 's fear of liability could end my career even great doctor make mistake and when we do we 've get to have a chance to speak up without fear of retribution or everyone suffer Dr Grey speak up Meredith Responsibility it really do suck Meredith you ok yeah one

you think I would miss this what kind of idiot light a cigarette in a hospital apparently people do idiotic thing all the time Chief Chief I think you be go back to New York I think it be time for a change you can not do this you can not be here sure I can it be easy Sublet the apartment sell the practice he be a liar and a cheat the man be one of the fine plastic surgeon in this country his department will generate twice the revenue neurosurgery do Money that be why he be here why do you think I be here this this be why I leave you I think you leave I for Derek I leave New York because of he he be your good friend for year right up until the point where he have sex with my wife we all make mistake Holy crap be you pregnant oh this be just perfect an adulterous love child go along

cut I loose and let I in on a surgery I might actually learn something like Sloan 's burn case I be go into plastic anyway do you think that Mark Sloan have anything to teach you he be just like you

day be impossible I will come by for a consult in the morning I be a good starer doctor could I get a word oh how be you feel harold Feelin ' great Feelin ' fine it be just that the oncologist he say that uh if the cancer be in other organ he say that maybe you would not proceed with the surgery that be right harold if the cancer 's spread to your other organ it would compromise your ability to

talk about his dad we do not we do not talk about anything really he just talk 's overrate oh so you and Burke still be not uh George tell I well see you talk about that yeah a week ago if this keep up you and burke might be the very last thing we ever talk about so what be the last thing you and burke talk about silence be overrate where be Rachel she go to go make some phone call try to get her shift cover you know Jilly um your parent be still here they be and I be not the one who call they yeah you call they right and I be guess they have to fly in from somewhere so you call they what yesterday the day before I go to an e r a while ago and they tell I to see an oncologist but I could not afford my rent let alone pay a bunch of medical bill but then I get scared you call your parent I do not know what else to do you send they away because Rachel 's my good friend and and after she be baptize she decide to leave the community which mean she be shun but I could not just let she go out in the world all by herself so you be shun too no because I have not be baptize yet so I could still go back but Rachel would never do you want to go back I think about it it be my home you know and if I be die I want an amish funeral I want to be bury in the white dress and I want everybody to be there it be your home but I make a promise to Rachel Cradle to grave how do Jilly let it get this far it be frustrating be not it and it be entirely preventable and treatable if you catch it in time but you got to catch it which be why I want to open a clinic if she have have access to a Free Clinic she probably would 've have a pap smear every year and would not be deal with infertility and premature menopause at the tender age of 23 you want to open a Free Clinic at Seattle Grace why Illness catch early mean few unnecessary surgery few unnecessary death but I mean why because and if I can get the support that I be look for I need suction oh no my god what the tumor 's invade through the cervix and into the bladder which mean she be a stage IV well we be not do this operation today we 've get to close she up there be nothing more we can do here O'Malley his dad how far'd he run before his body have the good sense to pass out 12 mile you 've get to be out of your mind well he could not have expect a head cold and a couple of aspirin to do he in he probably feel dizzy mile before he pass out he should 've stop sit his ass down he be in it to win I understand that you can can you well surgery be the most competitive field in medicine we be all here to win it be a long road Dr Yang when you get to the end of it you be not go to care about win you be just go to be relieve that you make it to the finish line you tell Sloan what Mark Sloan you tell he the Chief be

until we figure out what the hell be go on how be he do he be tachypneic but his B p be start to stabilize he be do well on oxygen it be a good thing he get out of there when he do Dr Shepherd what be it can you sign this I just hear how can I help you be off duty you should be with your mother I do not want to spend time with my mother the chief be down Alex be down I would like to help Dr Grey you want to help talk to your resident what do you get they find an herbal supplement in her purse the lab guy think it combine with the chemo chemical and turn her blood to some kind of neurotoxin we be lucky they be not all dead the only reason she be alive be because she be intubate who get they out of there O'Malley George Callie she be toxic her blood be toxic not our marriage you think our marriage be toxic okay all our people be be treat now what do we do about her Dr Grey your holter monitor show you be have multiple run of tachycardia every hour so Dr Burke would like to do a radioablation why would he recommend surgery when medication can keep it under control because Alzheimer 's patient be not always compliant with their med and apparently Meredith say you be particularly difficult I could elect not to treat it at all your stress test show coronary artery disease that couple with the tachyarrhythmias could cause too much stress on your heart which would eventually what would you do if the thing that define who you be be take away Tell Dr Burke I do not want the surgery I be s I be very sorry Dr Grey but technically that decision be not yours it be Meredith 's this be a maxi pad Heavy flow day Mini pad pretty self explanatory just peel the label and stick it and the tampon we 've already go over so be we clear on everything Kelley I understand that you be a little mortified that your dad drag you in here but can you just talk or nod or something I get it okay how be it go with our very first patient Kelley 's a woman can I just go to the gallery and learn something if that be okay with you uh Mr Hanson if you could go to the front desk and fill out some paperwork I can get you outta here of course of course uh thank you since my wife die I I 've be in the wood a little with Kelley okay yeah be you okay Kelley any cramp 'cause a heating pad could I be pregnant if I have sex last week like before the period thing start 'cause I do and it would really suck if I be pregnant 'cause now the guy be be a real jerk and he be totally ignore I at school so I really hope I can not be pregnant I can not right any way you could like answer I before my dad get back I be not sure refuse treatment be what you want to do apparently what I want do not matter it be not even legally bind so it be really about what you want Meredith you be in charge you think I like make these decision for you do you think it be fun to get call from the nursing home ask whether I be plan on give the nurse who change you every morning a christmas tip but I do it because you have manage to alienate everybody else in your life and I be the only one so I have to step up and do it you want to know why I be so unfocused so ordinary you want to know what happen to I you you happen to I then let I refuse the heart surgery no why not because kill my mother be not go to be another thing that happen to I these suit be airtight yeah these pack recirculate the air trap inside these battery have not be charge long I be guess you get about 30 minute before they die and you have to come out my god the anesthesia 's wear off she be wake up 30 minute start now she be fight intubation we go inside before these seal be secure we would not last five minute and she will die these guy be two minute out she do not have two minute Addison get the hell outta there she be awake Mark she be awake and open on the table I need to know her weight so I can dose she with the propofol she look about 60 kilo it be okay you be okay it be okay got it I get you I get

stop the S v t okay okay hold on hold on please hold on please hold on hold on okay okay okay okay okay you be good sharp under pressure you will make an extraordinary surgeon Dr Grey I need to ask you will it get in my way can I have both can I be a great surgeon and have a life because there be this man who just ask I to marry he and I know you try to have both but you split up with Meredith 's dad and I know it be none of my business it be none of your business and I do not try hard enough thank you be you feel well oh I will be once my patient be off the table look at these two a heart surgeon and a neurosurgeon perform a bowel resection you think the world stop when you stop but it keep on go People perform your surgery well than you could the next generation come up and you be scared you will be forget your mother stop for five year and you become someone accord to her I do not accord to her I be a disappointment well in a perfect world she would be able to tell you she be proud of you but it be not a perfect world and your mother be not a perfect woman I think the person she would most like to see right now be you the only thing your mother want to hear from I be that I regret stay with Adele that be the only gift I could give she and I can not tell she that that be not true they will not fit stop right there the bowel swell you will not have any room how much time do you have eight minute okay now listen to I and do everything I say Kelley your pregnancy test be negative and you be clean for S T D 's oh thank god Great thank I be also ground for the rest of my life Kelley be polite I be sorry sir but polite do not seem to be get you two very far Kelley your dad tell I you lose your mother a few year ago and I want to say how sorry I be you probably have a million question and if your mother be here I be sure she would have more eloquent answer than I do but I think that she and I would actually be say the same thing which be if you keep go the way you be go you will get an S t d you will get pregnant you will increase your chance of get cervical cancer you be not be smart and you be too young for anyone to expect you to be smart the way you need to be when you be have sex which mean you should not be have it I think he like I oh honey I know you do I know you do okay you be go to live Callie wait I be a little bit heroic in there I think you would be proud of I Proud you be poison and you think it be about I it feel like an anxiety attack about I you see we we be fine when we be in our Vegas bubble when it be just room service and pay cable and we it be bliss but then you get around your weird and judgy friend for one day and suddenly you be rack with uncertainty toxic gas level uncertainty I guess it be too much to hope you would just stand up for I Cal and my middle name be Iphegenia okay I can not wait to hear what your pal have to say about that so that be pretty cool what you just do go in and put she back under cool or stupid take your pick okay all right I get to go what be go on the chief figure out the anesthesiologist do not have time to drop an N G Tube so now they have to place one and decompress and repack her intestine and close and they be about to run out of air Holy crap this so beat tampon train Preston you will need to milk the bowel to get out the excess fluid pack she and wrap she and get she

Dr Sloan do you want to go first I be not go in there what it would be irresponsible for the remae healthy attending to expose himself to the neurotoxin a neurotoxin whose long term effect we be still unaware of so I be stay in here I can swim 3 length of my parent ' pool underwater you be up Dr Yang let us get she a mask Sloan give she the lap pad you be go to wet they and pack the cavity if you

for Alzheimer 's and you and I will have another chance to get to know each other you will have a chance to get to know I to see that I be not even remotely ordinary so I wish you would have the

what we can do to improve Mr Benton 's experience it be just a cold Nasal lavage because we care Nasal lavage get yourself a bulb syringe squeeze an isotonic solution into one of Mr Benton 's nostril it will squirt right out the other side incredibly restorative Rinse and repeat Rinse and repeat it be not what you think I I mean it be it be uh it be just not an affair though I guess technically it be but we be in love the uh the kind of love you think you be never go to find and then you do and the fact that he be marry seem a small price to pay for be happy you know at least most of the time

at least you know he will never lie to you guy like he they they mess around in their 20 but then they you know pack it in and and teach their kid to play catch maybe I need to stop think about both of they and I have to stop think about Izzie Stevens Hey Callie here be the thing when you be obsess about something like that there be generally a reason what the hell be you do Nasal lavage why

for chief resident but chief resident be not really about big think it be about patient care okay so let us see what we can do to improve Mr Benton 's experience it be just a cold Nasal lavage because we care Nasal lavage get yourself a bulb syringe squeeze an isotonic solution into one of Mr Benton 's nostril it will squirt right out the other side incredibly restorative Rinse and repeat Rinse and repeat it be not what you think I I mean it be it be uh it be just not an affair though I guess technically it be but we be in love the uh the kind of love you think you be never go to find and then you do and the fact that he be marry seem a small price to pay for be happy you know at least most of the time but then five year go by and he still have not leave his wife and you must think I be a terrible person no no no judgment whatsoever I mean I know I should leave he it be just do you have any idea how rare it be to find someone you can work and play with and we love each other how wrong

good for I right now I 've have some personal issue I I do not know what your personal problem be and I do not care I do care about your career so let I make myself clear this be a mistake it be like we be on a train that be go 200 mile an hour and it would just be so nice to get off and just stand on the platform just for a minute look like I be off the train our parent die when a parent die it do not make any sense so you make a lot of really terrible decision that you be go to end up have to live with for a long time you should go you be still on the train it be okay you have to go go go go go Addison Adele what be you do here what happen a fender bender I be fine I tell the e r resident I be fine but all right I be go to page Richard I will let he know you be here oh you will do no such thing Addison Richard can not know I be here we be separate my life be none of his business I be serious uh all right well let us get you check out do you have any um any pain any anything well there be one thing I should probably mention I be pregnant the baby look fine on the ultrasound but you be spot a little it be nothing severe but I would like to hold you overnight for observation Overnight oh no I be sorry but for just a couple of hour at least look it could be nothing but a pregnancy at your age be Terrifying Embarrassing I be go to say a miracle I do not know I resign myself to the fact a long time ago that I would never have kid and here I be 52 about to be divorce and pregnant may I ask who the father be you may ask look all I be say be that if Richard find out that you be walk around this hospital carry another man 's baby Richard be not go to find out because neither one of we be go to tell he Chief Addison I just hear the news you you hear who tell you what what do you hear that Joe and Walter be adopt be the birth mom here I would love to put in a good word Chief you do not want to go in there it be a young girl in the stirrup you know her equipment expose right you do not want to see that no I I do not want to see that be you go to give I an inspirational speech too I can not talk I have a patient to prep this be not about you and I this be about Meredith what be we go to do there be nothing to do what I be not even go to be here in a week so so your transferring to another hospital mean we be not go to be friend anymore why be you do this George do not you hear a word of what Bailey say what be we suppose to do carry he down the mountain he be our friend and we leave he there if we have not we would be dead too you know that Dale be right you do not you do not do that you do not climb all the way up there together just to leave a man behind I be be stalk by pregnant woman you be an obstetrician and barren you know apparently as a healthy successful woman in her 30 I do not deserve to have a baby maybe I would have a fighting chance if be gay or a teenager or a member of the A A r p oh that suck it really no no not you too oh no no I be not I be just I be think about it that be all oh I do not know I do not even know it be just that with George go to Mercy West next year he be yeah they have a spot for he and we need a fresh start we need to get away from all this crap it might be a good time it be a great time do not let I and my fossilized egg discourage you be we go to be friend still if I get pregnant absolutely not hi chief O'Malley finally come to see I about that letter from Mercy West no sir I be here about Meredith I have to say I do not get it why would anybody waste their time freeze and climb up the side of a glacier it be a way to test yourself you know your strength and endurance you put yourself through a situation like that and you know exactly who you be what you make of have you do it before Dr Burke no you I use to all the time in college really really yeah it be intense I mean it be painful and hellish and you think your lung be shred but man when you get to the top there be nothing like it make the whole climb worth it how be it go bad than I think there be nothing here we be go to amputate both you can not amputate both of his hand I be not the left hand less damaged I do not want to take the man 's hand Dr Stevens once the infection get that deep the only way to save his life be to make the cut the patient 's laminotomy happen at what level Dr o'malley the level of maximal neural compression between the pedicle of the fractured vertebrae very good you must have ace your exam today I do not know about aced how do Meredith do yeah she be kinda do not worry though I talk to the chief about what she do not tell you all right here be the thing the Seattle police department 's be on this for week they 've be in contact with missing person from all 50 state Canada the FBI you know how many people be try to find you yeah yes that be right you do know you know exactly how many relative you have you know if your parent be dead or alive you know if you 've get a

fine but all right I be go to page Richard I will let he know you be here oh you will do no such thing Addison Richard can not know I be here we be separate my life be none of his business I be serious uh all right well let us get you check out do you have any um any pain any anything well there be one thing I should probably mention I be pregnant the baby look fine on the ultrasound but you be spot a little it be nothing severe but I would like to hold you overnight for observation Overnight oh no I be sorry but for just a couple of hour at least look it could be nothing but a pregnancy at your age be Terrifying Embarrassing I be go to say a miracle I do not know I resign myself to the fact a long time ago that I would never have kid and here I be 52 about to be divorce and pregnant may I ask who the father be you may ask look all I be say be that if Richard find out that you be walk around this hospital carry another man 's baby Richard be not go to find out because neither one of we be go to tell he Chief Addison I just hear the news you you hear who tell you what what do you hear that Joe and Walter be adopt be the birth mom here I would love to put in a good word Chief you do not want to go in there it be a young girl in the stirrup you know her equipment expose right you do not want to see that no I I do not want to see that be you go to give I an inspirational speech too I can not talk I have a patient to prep this be not about you and I this be about Meredith what be we go to do there be nothing to do what I be not even go to be here in a week so so your transferring to another hospital mean we be not go to be friend anymore why be you do this George do not you hear a word of what Bailey say what be we suppose to do carry he down the mountain he be our friend and we leave he there if we have not we would be dead too you know that Dale be right you do not you do not do that you do not climb all the way up there together just to leave a man behind I be be stalk by pregnant woman you be an obstetrician and barren you know apparently as a healthy successful woman in her 30 I do not deserve to have a baby maybe I would have a fighting chance if be gay or a teenager or a member of the A A r p oh that suck it really no no not you too oh no no I be not I be just I be think about it that be all oh I do not know I do not even know it be just that with George go to Mercy West next year he be yeah they have a spot for he and we need a fresh start we need to get away from all this crap it might be a good time it be a great time do not let I and my fossilized egg discourage you be we go to be friend still if I get pregnant absolutely not hi chief O'Malley finally come to see I about that letter from Mercy West no sir I be here about Meredith I have to say I do not get it why would anybody waste their time freeze and climb up the side of a glacier it be a way to test yourself you know your strength and endurance you put yourself through a situation like that and you know exactly who you be what you make of have you do it before Dr Burke no you I use to all the time in college really really yeah it be intense I mean it be painful and hellish and you think your lung be shred but man when you get to the top there be nothing like it make the whole climb worth it how be it go bad than I think there be nothing here we be go to amputate both you can not amputate both of his hand I be not the left hand less damaged I do not want to take the man 's hand Dr Stevens once the infection get that deep the only way to save his life be to make the cut the patient 's laminotomy happen at what level Dr o'malley the level of maximal neural compression between the pedicle of the fractured vertebrae very good you must have ace your exam

if Richard find out that you be walk around this hospital carry another man 's baby Richard be not go to find out because neither one of we be go to tell he Chief Addison I just hear the news you you

no no not you too oh no no I be not I be just I be think about it that be all oh I do not know I do not even know it be just that with George go to Mercy West next year he be yeah they have a spot for he and we need a fresh start we need to get away from all this crap it might be a good time it be a great time do not let I and my fossilized egg discourage you be we go to be friend still if I get pregnant absolutely not hi chief O'Malley finally come to see I about that letter from Mercy West no sir I be here about Meredith I have to say I do not get it why would anybody waste their time freeze and climb up the side of a glacier it be a way to test yourself you know your strength and endurance you put yourself through a situation like that and you know exactly who you be what you make of have you do it before Dr Burke no you I use to all the time in college really really yeah it be intense I mean it be painful and hellish and you think your lung be shred but man when you get to the top there be nothing like it make the whole climb worth it how be it go bad than I think there be nothing here we be go to amputate both you can not amputate both of his hand I be not the left hand less damaged I do not want to take the man 's hand Dr Stevens once the infection get that deep the only way to save his life be to make the cut the patient 's laminotomy happen at what level Dr

the stupid thing I 've ever hear in general people can be categorize in one of two way those who love surprise and those who do not I do not dude you be late I 've never meet a surgeon who enjoy a surprise because as surgeon we like to be in the know we have to be in the know because often when we be not people die and lawsuit happen be I ramble I think I be ramble I think I see a pneumothorax

try to insert my banana bag which sound vaguely dirty but it be not I can do it so how be it go with Addison bad mood good mood yay my husband pick I mood uh I think it be more of a I hate the smell of charred flesh mood before you judge I I know there be a train accident People be very badly hurt and that I be a vapid narcissist when you mix I with alcohol in case you be wonder I know that well for what it be worth I take issue with her salmon color scrub I mean what self respect surgeon wear salmon color scrub this be what I be say thank you Yang how be that wound look pretty clean some dirt and gravel mostly this guy be lucky it be a guillotine injury if we do this right he will have full use of his leg Dr Shepherd it will wait I be fine Derek just adjust to the light all I be say be there be no shame in take a little more time off it do not make you old or tired or rusty yeah okay that come out wrong you be the only attend neurosurgeon you be obviously need elsewhere and I be fine here page I if you need I when you be finish clean that wound you can help I here Dr Yang be the wound clean Yang yes sir I but but what if your plan be to be a watchdog for Dr Shepherd or if you think your job here be to babysit I then you can think again I 've be a surgeon long than you 've be breathe and if I be not ready to be in this o r I would say so be that understand yes sir now do we have a problem Yang uh yes no sir I I be thrilled to learn and I be grateful to be here it be just that sorry his leg what about they they be both leave find the man 's leg Yang find it now yes sir be it go straight through her spine it be T8 's completely crush what happen uh tequila I be keep an eye on her look at this these people be still alive they be still make small talk the pole 's tamponading the wound as far as we can see it be hit the aorta look at he it be right in line with his inferior vena cava be there any way to operate without separate they no if we remove the pole then they will both bleed out what if we do not move the pole what if we move one of the patient off the pole to get the saw in there then we can hold the pole steady in the other one move it very slowly and repair the damage as we go who which would you move with her aortic injury her chance of survival be extremely slim no matter what we do but if we move she we have a real shot at save he well I could argue since her injury be more extensive we should move he give she the good shot we can so basically whoever you move do not stand a chance so how do you choose how do you decide who get to live we have to make this call soon if we want a shot at save either one of they I would like to examine they before I weigh in I will wait for your page Dr Grey Dr Grey need to get herself a blood alcohol test before practice any medicine tonight what no I be totally fine look totally fine right okay I be fine regret that last shooter about now be not you what be you do in here uh the leg you bring in with the amputee I do not bring in an amputee okay well um one of you do and it be um because all paramedic look alike to you right doctor okay really I can not straddle another giant ego

it will not be easy sometimes it be impossible to find the vessel and complication can arise but yes I can operate so there be a risk a very large risk yes and what happen if you do not operate the good case scenario be that the bleeding resolve itself or it could continue to bleed and cause the brain to swell which mean what most likely without the operation you will die but the operation could kill I too right they be equal risk both way what do I do what would you do I can not answer this for you can I have that spatula please thank you you want that butter to melt not to boil Dr Burke how do you learn to cook like this my mother own a restaurant in Alabama seriously seriously do Cristina know that no actually she do not she do not ask a lot of personal question she be kind of hard to

reassignment surgery on your daughter yes without her know all she be say all her life be that she want to be normal she do not feel normal why can not we just put an end to her agony well first of all remove her male sexual organ may not do that in fact it could do just the opposite but her hormone can be control with an oral medication we just want the good for bex to do surgery and alter her body permanently be well I just would never do that on someone who be unaware of the procedure and you be go to be hard press to find a surgeon who will Bex will learn the truth someday h how do you

Shepherd ask I to talk to you about your daughter and her pregnancy we 've make up our mind she be have the baby I know kendra mean the world to you and I know the terrible grief you must be go through right now but from a medical standpoint this be a very bad idea well if we have want your opinion miss we would ask for it it be just we we love our daughter please try to understand I do understand I do you think if you love her enoughor love her baby enough that it will keep she close to you but she be already go and if you move forward with this you be risk well I mean if kendra be to contract an infection she could pass it on to the fetus it could cause brain damage we be take our chance they keep organ donor alive after they be go why not kendra Organ donor be not keep alive for six month your daughter be brain dead she can not regulate body temperature hormone output these thing be very important for a fetus you guy can regulate that stuff right we could try I well then try damn it what the hell 's the problem here the problem here as I see it be you want to use your daughter 's corpse as an incubator that be the problem okay I be sorry would you excuse we please what what be you do derek let go of I those people just lose their daughter I know that be my point derek they need to face that she be not come back a little sensitivity would be nice here okay they

save a dozen other life and from what I know about kendra what I 've hear I get to believe that if she have the choice between where she be right now and save a dozen other people she would save those

believe I sir you want this totay a hypothetical because I be think if something like that do happen you would be duty bind to report it and the hospital would be in danger of lose its accreditation as a transplant site so hypothetically hypothetically if the patient get bad would it be unethical for he to receive the heart even tugh medically his worsen condition now put he at the top of the donor list hypothetically how bad be he in the few hour it would take a new lvad to be deliver he will be dead our responsibility be to the patient if medically he be at the top of the list then he should get the heart Hypothetically thank you sir but practically whoever remove the patient from the lvad I expect to be give name and there will be severe severe consequence yes sir wait hold on Dr Hahn can not stop now karev I only have a few hour to get this heart into my guy Dr Hahn U N o S give the heart to seattle grace the transplant coordinator already call and stop your guy from be

you do not quit you do not talk to the press you don'T bitch to the coach you just you just go out there every sunday and you make the block and you take the hit and you you play to win you show up and you suit up and you play because it be your freakin ' team I know your type you be a surgical junkie yes sir I be just say it be not go to be easy for you to be away from the o r that long no sir and if youant to get back to the o r you be go to tell I what I need to know be not you you be right it be not easy for I to be away from the o r it be not easy for I to sit in front of you or any other authority figure for that matter and not be able to give you the exact answer you want to hear I be the one with the answer I 've always be the one with the answer but right now sir I do not have any Dr Yang how do you keep your edge sir because I watch you and you 've be do this a long time and and you be clean you be focus you be the job nothing get to you and the thing be sir be I be like that until I get here until I actually start do this job and now everything be be fuzzy or that be beside the point no see sir this be the point because I can not tell you what happen in that room I can not tell you and before I could have no guilt no loyalty no problem before before I would not have even be in that room I would not have get involve I would have never freeze in surgery and I would 've tell he what I think he should do I have an edge sir I have an edge and I 've lose it and I need it I need it back so if you could just tell I how you keep yours and how not to be affect I know I could be a great surgeon so if you could just give I the answer I would really appreciate it you be excuse dr Yang but you be excuse I will tell you I will tell you who cut the lvad wire sir no you won'T if you could just please I do not want to know not from you yeah I have the answer but I can not tell them to you I be not go to be responsible for you become less human I be a pretty girl what I be not be arrogant it be just it be just kind of a fact for a long time I make a career from my look so I get it I be a pretty girl and not in a from a certain angle way in an obvious way it be the blonde thing and the big boob thing big boob be key to obvious pretty if you know what I be say Dr Stevens that be how man see I I be not a smart girl or an interesting girl I be a pretty girl the blonde and the boob it confuse guy into thinking that I be someone else and I be use to it I be use to they walk away when they realize but then denny go and ask I to marry he be that why you cut the wire he do not make I feel like I be a pretty girl he make I feel like like I I think he might know I and so if I do cut the lvad wire and I be not say that I do but if I do then no I do not feel guilty and I know that I should and I would if it be anybody else but I can not feel anything but happy be not you go to say anything or I be not go to break I be start to get a little freak out but I be not go to break it be not because I do not care because I do care what you think about I I do care I just can not tell you what you want to hear which seem to be a theme in my life right now just 'cause you can not say something do not mean you do not want to you can want to very much you can be with a person and be happy with they and not love they or you can love someone and not want to be with they you do not need to love someone to want they oh it be frustrating you know when your brain tell you what you want and what you actually want do not match up it be exhaust and well it be complicated but that be life and life suck I 've know you for a long time I know your mother and father and I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that you do not cut those lvad wire Meredith I need you tell I who do it I 've be go over this and over this in my mind try to piece this together it be you you be the reason my parent break up and it be not just an affair she really love you it be not

that kid 's dad I mean his son be paralyzed and the guy be still ride he Focus more on the medicine three and less on the tragedy Three be that a nickname you could say that so how would you proceed dr Grey oh um you will not be able to operate unless you realign his spine would you and how would you do that Traction halo very impressive dr Grey your intern year 's off to a good start how be it

send she into arrest anybody get so much as a bad feeling we stop and we reassess she be go to make it right he say he be go to give her baby up if she do not make it she have to make it Kinda busy right now Lex Road trip Mr Brotherton we need to go now I will send Dr Grey out to you with periodic update I promise I be go to do everything in my power to fix your wife get a thing for her you do not have a thing for her I do I do I have a thing for her go to end badly you do not know yes I do what do you know you be date the Chief it be not funny anymore it be overuse Lover 's quarrel oh Jeez we be not quarrel it be not a quarrel more importantly we be not if I go through the trouble to choose a movie he should have enough common courtesy to mention it if he make other plan a phone call a note something and if he'not go to pick up my shirt just tell I I will pick they up I be perfectly capable of pick up my own shirt no you be not you be not capable of pick up your shirt you be not capable of do anything on your own if I be not around you would starve in a dirty shirt and die a lonely death oh for God sake I offer you a place to put your trailer and you 've be take advantage ever since you can not pick up the dry cleaning or do the cooking so I have to pick up all the slack hold that think you see he can not handle the truth I definitely have a thing for her do you have any idea why the brotherton ' baby be still here I believe Dr torre decide to keep the baby here for another day why would she do that if Dr Shepherd be ready to discharge she I do not know you would have to ask Dr Torres I mean if it be I and the mother keep code I might keep the baby around so they could get a little more time together and why do torre have Stevens and Karev put their patient in the same room that be a clear violation of protocol you would have to ask she but those two patient be impossible and neither one be willing to follow post op instruction so I mean if it be I I would put they both in the same room so they could encourage each other to get out of here and she tell Dr Yang to find a new specialty that be a pretty odd thing to say to someone who have such an affinity for cardio again you will have to ask torre but maybe it have to do with the fact that Erica Hahn 's put she through her pace so Yang need to see what else be out there otherwise she will not fight hard enough to stay with cardio I be just guess you need to ask torre that be just what I be go to do it be be an hour we should 've hear something well the fact that we have not hear anything be good that mean that they 've get she in the o r and they 've open she up you know every step of this that she survive be good oh God so we be able to find one puncture in her remain lung we be prepare to place a patch over it and hopefully at be the only leak and hopefully the patch will hold I should be get back you know you say your wife bond instantly with the baby for some people it be like that for other people they need a little more time with a baby before they can feel like a family I bet you know she well than you think you do all I know be that she cry okay and she eat a lot we be go through formula like crazy and she sleep with her hand up under her chin and she like my wife Teresa soothe she you know she put her hand on her back she let us her suck on her finger but that be all I know that be five thing no one else know that be five thing the patch be secure water please all right let us see if I earn my paycheck today go to manual give I a breath no bubble so far so good

rheumatoid disease because of his high CRP and se rate or maybe lupu I be do a spinal tap too because he be alter and be amnestic about his fall early I do want to win this contest but I also want to

yours in no no sir well I need you to the hospital be still liable even though Dr Burke be not here there my sexual relationship Preston Burke on paper Satisfied I know this be difficult for you no it be not difficult sir it be simple Burke be not here he be go and he be the well for it he be win the harper avery award and be celebrate all over the world that be not difficult he be out there and I be here where everything be the same I still live in his apartment I walk the same hall of this hospital I wear the same scrub and even that be not difficult this be where I be this be where I choose to be but sir when his hand be shake I perform his surgery I keep his secret I nurse his pride you know it and I know it and he know it he know it and yet nowhere in the newspaper article do my name appear I be the unseen hand to his brilliance excuse I and yet while everything be the same it be very very different now I be lucky if I get to hold a clamp Hahn treat I like I be his hand and now I be a ghost that be not difficult it be unbearable I know everybody be proud of he but I be not and I do not wish he well this boycott have go on long enough now okay I have no authority here but I would like to offer my thought on Dr Sloan you be do great this man be a whore have always be a whore will probably always be a whore but I mean that be not a secret he be not keep it hide you all know who he be before you got involve with he now you want to be all woe be I he do not call I back he be date other woman he be nasty but he be a doctor here and a pretty good one so let we all close

do I block out the fear and I do it it be a really good day look I be just go to say this because your insurance only cover 20 session and I feel we should get right to the point that be a load of crap it be not a good day your patient die alone unable to tell the love of his life how he feel but he do it for his boyfriend I mean I actually think it be kind of heroic it be a load of crap stop say that look let I draw the parallel for you the tragic patient die alone while the love of his life be literally in the next room that be you what be you talk about I be not die alone oh but I think you be and you be you be tell yourself you be a hero when in reality all you be be alone Thatis a load of crap he be with Rose you know what I be not go to do this he be with Rose why do you keep say that because if you can not see what be wrong with that sentence he be with Rose we be never go to get anywhere he be with Rose okay so he be with Rose so what and if he be with Rose that mean he be not with you and do you know why he be not with you you be scare be you call I a coward I think you be very frightened be you call I a coward what do you think the problem with be a resident be you

output and give antianxiety med all night it be not a good job for I running lab for meredith grey that be not a good job for I it be not a good job for I because I be well than that and you know I be well than that maybe if I be not good at my job or maybe if I have struggle and be lag behind my personality I be not karev I be not yang I be not meredith I be not harden I get that I get it I do not have the personality of a surgeon maybe that be why you make the mistake of not think that I deserve a second chance when everyone else around here have get one but sir it be a mistake because I be excellent I be excellent at my job and I do fail my test but I deserve a second chance okay ok okay you can retake the test okay she have not wake up yet sometimes it take long with brain surgery for the body to recover but she could not wake up could she die that be a possibility but I would rather not worry about that until we have to when when what when will we have to start worry about that you be still here what do you sleep in the waiting room look I like he all right I do but he do not need to know that nobody need to know that he need you and you be too worried about what your friend think what do you know about it do you know what it would be like for I for he if they know you think it be easy I think it be well to be honest he be alive barely but he be alive I uh call your husband he say he take the baby and leave you two month ago he say you have something call underlying borderline personality disorder which mean you be fragile to start with so this this have probably

burn so I do not think you have it cover Karev be you a doctor uh yes sir be you capable of assess a patient 's injury Yep like I say we get it cover you know what we be here why do not you let we just dive in appreciate the offer shepherd but I want my resident to learn how to deal with trauma they be not go to learn as much or as fast if they stand back and watch attending do it uns that attend be I three other hospital have already send they away and if we be smart we would do the same thing what be the matter with you we can try and cut around the stomach no the only way to do that be to actually take it out they 've do ex vivo autotransplant yeah with liver an so why do not we take out the stomach and the kidney oh yeah that would be great if you want to kill she we be talk about two completely different blood supply here so no not a good idea grey who be those people uh that be tori 's dad randy and his brother patand pat 's wife jean and tori 's brother david and why be they stare at we Dr Bailey I do not think they be stare at us chief I think they be just wait see if we have any news look try and come up with something before I get back close the blind grey you page I Rambo be completely out of control excuse I Hunt he kick I out of my own e r do he kill somebody not yet then call I when he do Richard I do not have time for it shep I have a die 10 ye old and a team of doctor who can not stop bicker long engh to solve a problem except for your girlfriend who be moesnterte play with a doll Anatomy jane she drag that thing all around the hospital when she be 5 year old and let I tell you it be cut in a child any luck what do you think look I know you want to be number one richard but we can not take in every charity case that come along it be a huge waste of resource it be your call Dr Bailey Grey put that away this be not playtime I be not play I be think what if we just take out each of the organ where the tumor interfere with the blood supply by the time you clamp off the aorta you run the risk of damage the other organ even if you take they out one by one you do not have the time grey what about if we make the time Dr Bailey let us throw some stuff up on the board C T show a subdural hematoma should I book an o r first thing first his scalp be bleed like stink what do you do next normally I would page shepherd Shepherd 's not here what do you do to stop the bleed suture the laceration tie off the bleeder that will take two hour what would you use in this room to take care of this staple it be his forehead you you want this guy to look like frankenstein for the rest of his life skin glue Excellent karev clean it close it and stick a pressure dress over it how be you feel mister uh hiott not too good how be we go to make Mr Hiott feel well the ultrasound show free fluid we will get he to a c t to confirm but he be pretty much o r Bound Excellent be that tetanus you know who you have to thank for the invention of the tetanus shot steven Horses the first experiment do on horse you want to take out all of her abdominal organ intestine stomach everything all at once that be right we will put the organ on ice while we dissect out the tumor then reconnect the vessel use synthetic graft and put the organ back in why di't graham or fleisher over at lake washington suggest this they be a couple of smartie probably because it be never be do before it be extremely risky there be any number of thing that could go wrong I I do not know randy maybe we should try more chemo uh with all due respect Mrs Begler I do not think there be time for that be it go to save her life it be your good shot your only shot then do it okay Dr Bailey um I be not a vet and while I can appreciate the value of practice technique on live tissue there be a multiple M v c in the pit and my education would be far well serve practice on human well w who be babysitte the pig right now my intern do major hunt order the intern to babysit the pig or you that be not the point well make it the point I do not have time for this I be about to take six organ out of a person well see that that that be not fair I be not Dr Doolittle the zebra and the elephant be thank their lucky star for that I have a question why be not we take out the kidney since the left renal artery be involve because we can remove the tumor without do that so why bother I have another question yes why can not you look at I what you can not look at I you have not be able to look at I all day I think you be imagine thing I do not think I be but hey if you say so I do I say so so instead of worry about whether or not I be look at you maybe you should concentrate on save the 10 year old girl that we be about to eviscerate uh grey why do we dissect down in quadrant Uhso we can get a good luck at the vessel to make sure we have enough for reconstruction very good a little suction right in here please Mr Begler be on the phone o r Desk want to know if they can put he through no he be pretty insistent and I be pretty busy if you could hold this up a little bit high Dr Grey I want to make sure to avoid that okay let us get some clamp another clamp plea right there let us hang another bag of blood you betterope the aorta be not that friable otherwise all the blood in the world will not save this girl ryan what be reggie 's pulse 69 really 'cause wilbur 's at 102 and I be pretty sure that be bad Babe 's like an ox Hers be 52 hey no cute name they be not pet they be subject it be not our job to get all affectionate it be our job to keep they alive so the attend who somehow think we be incapable can choke on his word at the end of the day so I do not want to hear wilbur or babe you want to call they something call they sausage or prosciutto wilbur 's crash what what do you do I do not I do not I get to reopen that thoracotomy uh pull that chest tray back over here yeah Dr Bailey remove the organ on three one two three very good all right let I have it I will need medium and large vessel loop to dissect out the tumor Mr Begler again he want to talk to you about his daughter well I be pretty busy right now I already tell he that well tell he again I 've tell he 18 time Chief you need to go talk to they hey you do put I in charge I will be back what the hell look at this crap be that glue you use skin glue Dr Hunt want to get he outta there pretty quick yeah well because Dr Hunt do not have u revise the wound he could lose half his face you can not rotate a flap you call someone who can well he say the e r be like be in the field you use what be available what uh qualify we as a war zone karev our undermanned gift shop the lukewarm drink from the coffee cart he be a meatballer what do you expect Meatballer Trauma guy they just slap it together any available I V Nurse Dr Webber how be tori she be stable we be remove the tumor right now actually I should be in there to help but I be out here instead I just need an update it be not important that you get an update right now sir what be important be the good doctor we have in this hospital be focus on your daughter call do not help we focus interruption do not help we focus I be sorry I know we have be underfoot sometimes but we have be to a lot of hospital and hospital be not easy place to get information in fact a lot of time it be impossible to even get a doctor to talk to you or to get the doctor to talk to each other and I do not know if it be neglect or their ego get in the way and I do not care we be just try to take care of our little girl she be 10 she be scared and she be sick we be do whatever we can do not ever stop take care of she like that Steven have you ever use a g I a stapler no but I be ready I can handle it answer I three question and I will let you okay Question one polio vaccine which animal do you have to thank for that be this reallysaecesry only if you want to use that stapler flipper baby what Flipper baby 10 000 baby be bear with birth defect in the 1950 because their pregnant mother take thalidomide first develop on guinea pig the guinea pig do not have any side effect your point my point be that human and animal have different physiology they have different reaction they can have different reaction do not mean that they will tell that to those 10 000 baby and their mother so the polio vaccine develop use mouse and monkey you can keep your stapler it be not worth it give I the status on reggie and paddy Reggie 's fine Paddy 's pulse ox be low but stable and babe hold steady I think we be not suppose to give they name I could give they number but then I would probably tell you three need antibiotic and find you shove a needle in grey 's ass his vital be get bad damn it uh do you check his lung again I already take out an entire lobe what about his descend aorta you know what just can it lexopedia I 've try everything pulseles uh that be it we need to get more exposure you be open he up more I need everyone 's help Stem to stern what what if he can not take it you could you could kill he do not get emotional just get ready to start massage his heart Scalpel Dr Bailey can you dissect down anymore there be nothing to dissect there be barely any artery leave what about if we extend the gore tex graft no what be lefti too friable so we can not reconnect the organ to the vessel not at this moment no but if we can not reconnect the organ they will not reperfuse and they will just die yes they will be it too late for a transplant well we would have to find six good o ans in about eight hour it be too late for a transplant and a gold star for grey we could try to put in more gore tex oh put even more synthetic material in her what about a saphenous vein graft no she be already get acidotic that sort of thing have to be preplanne yeah so what be your idea excuse I I mean you be good at shoot down every idea we come up with what be yours it be my idea not to do this in the first place Dr Bailey yeah you make that very clear every chance you got Shut up I do not care who have what idea when get over yourselves shut up and talk to each other what about use human umbilical vein I mean ready to go already heparinize okay I like it Erica what do you think it could work it be Dr Bailey 's call if she want to do it I do in that case let us do it nice work on the valve first develop in pig but more recently cow Aryou do beat I up for the day because I would like to go home I be just try to teach you you want to teach we take we to the simulab with the plastic guy who have heart rate anblood pressure and croak when you nick an artery until you apply scalpel to skin steven you be just go through the motion that attitude that be from before we have the technology now we do not have to torture live creature no you do not get to accuse I of torture those animal feel no pain you do not know that you do not know that you do not know what they feel you do not know how scared they re Als animare sensitive and intelligent creature and that be not I be emotional that be simply the truth you want I to learn from your method you want I to learn anything from you then do not stab pig in front of I and tell I that the sky be not blue you be torture god 's creature in an age where we have the technology that no long require we to if you want to do that go ahead but do not tell I I be

come on come on Reperfusion complete Heart 's beating on its own all right all right everyone hell of a job I 've know woman to be upset because they could not make it to the big finish never have anything to do with I usually something to do with their anatomy the point be I 've never know a woman to be upset because she could take a curtain call you be a conundrum torre Erica cry this morning in bed after sex that be a compliment for you the crying be a compliment it be not a compliment for I she be it be she be have a revelation she be have the sex be awesome with erica we 've reach awesome which be awesome yes but it be also awesome with you so what be the problem I guess I think there should be a difference between you and erica I mean if I'M there should be a difference the difference between I and erica be that I know you have sex with her 12 hour ago she do not know you have sex with I and that make you a cheater do you want to be a cheater 'cause I be fine with it the question be be you I be go to yell at the major general you want to come hell yeah be right there hey torre Hey Hunt can I talk to you Sure Karev no no he can stay you want karev to hear how you screw up the flap on my head trauma that be fine with I my job be to keep he alive that be what I do no what you do be almost maim a guy for the rest of his life you be lucky I save the blood supply so what would you have do well you get a man with a deep scalp wound and two of the good surgeon in the country stand 10 foot away from he I would 've ask those two surgeon to step in that be what I would 've do I mean medically what would you have do medically so I can do well listen I recognize there be different way of do thing even the basic over here if someone appear dead you go to they first in iraq if someone appear dead you do not go to they this be day one for I so if you think there be a well way then tell I and I will listen Ain both of you great job thank you be there a problem Dr Bailey I just find it hard to believe you be accept congratulation consider you do not want to do this operation in the first place and when you finly do do it you fight I every step of the way and yet you still have a world class heart surgeon by your side you may be a fine surgeon god know I know that but not today today you be a pain in the ass a nay say llye consistently negativ pain in the ass at

much about it I 've see a lot of maturity in the two of you through this whole mess you handle the crisis you handle the surgery you save that girl 's life and you call for help right away there be a time not so long ago that you would 've reach a different conclusion you could 've stick to the code and save your own try to hide the whole mess you know sometimes protect your colleague be solidarity and sometimes it be just hubris I be glad to see you know the difference Chief you do not I I can not let you two get in trouble for this Lexie no it be not right People try to stop I Dr Yang tell I yesterday to shut it down but I do not listen you know about this yesterday Sir I do you know no you know you know no they be go to cut her open no Lexie just say you know Sutures I know they be do suture on themselves and I do not think I need to say anything because I have shut it down I have handle it apparently you do not because it almost cost lexie her job not to mention that sadie almost die in there okay you know what Sadie do that to herself and let us not pretend that you have some sort of relationship with lexie let us not pretend that you care about her I care about my job and I care about do the right thing who be you to lecture I on do the right thing be you kid I you be not an attend meredith you may be sleep with one but you be not one yet be that what this be about derek it be always go to be about derek okay fine it be not about derek it be about you and I and the fact that you do not have my back in that room what would you have want I to say I do not know anything you should 've say anything you have a relationship with the chief you have his ear but you do not say anything to defend I because this be not just on I I mean you just stand there and you watch he take I out of the running for solo surgery you let I take all the blame but the fact be that we all have intern in that room we all fail to supervise they and if your friend have die in there if you and I have not save her life that would 've be on all of we too you should 've say that why be you look at I we be just wonder the intern what you be go to say to they D unh unh no no I be tired I be not say anything to the intern I raise my baby you be my baby now you all grow folk it be on you you raise your own baby so we have to talk to them your baby what do we say do you really need a speech from I at this point after all this time because I mean if you do you should not even be here if you do then I have not raise you right and I know I raise you right no you do not get a speech from I it be time for you to make your own speech Dr Grey present Sadie harris 30 three hour status post appendectomy complicate by severe hemorrhaging Death what be this Dr Spalding vital stable triple antibiotic coverage she should fully recover within two week and and we your surgeon make mistake that compromise your care mistake that reflect poorly on this hospital and that will not happen again effective immediately every intern here be on probation so much as sneeze and you be do none of you will see the inside of an o r until further notice you 've lose the chief 's respect which believe I be not an easy thing to get back and speak for myself you 've lose my respect and you probably will not ever get that back but he still respect izzie steven what do you say you seem to still respect izzie steven and she kill a patient she be try to save a man 's life and you almost kill a friend for fun it be different how you do oh they give good drug here do I look bad oh you look beautiful just badge of honor all over your face I be sorry do I hear correctly that the um intern go scalpel crazy yes you do oh crazy I do not know that they be crazy I can remember what it be like

since I 've have you in my o r Chief I seem to remember an incident with a clamp be drop into an open body cavity you be never go to let I live that one down huh a good teacher never let up on her student although I 've often wonder how the upcoming class learn anything with the way we teach these day attending seem more concerned with inspire their student use encouragement and validation and so forth instead of instill they with the fear and shame that actually cause one to remember anything in the first place Dr Hunt you come from the military would not you say the more rigid aspect of your training help you become the doctor you be today yes ma'am very much so Dr Yang on the other hand well something tell I fear be not something you 've often face in the o r I would appreciate any opportunity to learn Wonderful let we begin then tell I how you do a pulmonary emboleomy I would insert a steerable catheter into the femoral vein then position the fluoroscope adjacent to the embolus what would you do if the power should suddenly go out or if you have to operate in a hospital that could not afford a fluoroscope look it be like a calculator do you think just because there be a machine to do it for they child should not have to learn simple arithmetic I mean if it will help they avoid mistake like this one out of my o r I say get out out this be still my o r she be bleed into the frontal lobe now if I can just stop the bleed save the rest of the brain she would have a chance decel be get long Derek I have to deliver the baby no she just she be lose too much blood if you cut she now she will bleed out I can save she how I have to cut out the frontal lobe what D Derek no stop Derek you 've do enough her frontal lobe can she live without her frontal lobe and her temporal lobe yes no Derek she can not listen to I this baby be not get any oxygen now I know that you want to save Jen I know you feel like you have to but not this way I can do this I can save they both she will live not as the person that her husband and child need she to be she will lose everything about she that make her human Meredith be you sure you can do this I have no choice bipolar the baby 's heart rate be bottom out Damn it Derek okay damn it we 've go this have go too far take the frontal lobe out even if she do live you be create a monster you do not get to play god here Derek Jen be go but this baby have a chance to live you need to let she go let it go please let I be take the baby out put down the scalpel Addison you put down the scalpel Addison put the scalpel down you

the baby be still in distress I need to take it out wait just wait the bleeding could stop the baby could stabilize if you do a c section now she will lose too much blood and she will die she be dead Derek please just wait Most of her brain be go for all intent and purpose she be dead Karev page Dr Freedman 's team tell they we have a preemie on the way stop cut why be you cue Meredith get some more blood she need more blood get some more blood we need more blood no more blood derek no more blood you be smart to get it look at but it do not look too suspicious to I even combine with high L D H Levels oh that could be cause by anything mono exercise even couple with neurological episode hallucination there we go all do you and I both see patient do this every day they find something suspicious and convince themselves they be sick but as doctor you and I both know that it be our job to remain worry free until we have actual medical proof that say otherwise so that be what you should do relax by this time tomorrow you will be laugh at the fact you think there be anything wrong in the first place okay Ready he look strong okay he definitely have a chance all right let us get he intubate let us get the placenta the steroid we give your wife allow your baby 's lung to mature that combine with the three extra day that Dr Shephard take to do the surgery make we very hopeful that he will survive I do not understand she just die I be sorry yeah I know you say that um I be ask how she die we believe your wife 's high blood pressure be what cause the bypass to fail that cause the bleeding and the swelling in the brain Dr Shephard do everything he could to save she there be too much damage to her brain that be when Dr Montgomery step in to deliver the baby you say it be a routine procedure but that she would be fine then there be a complication and you say you fix that but then the baby get sick and that make jen sick but then you say that you fix that too and now

the moment I do not panic I know what I see be you suggest that I tell that girl and her parent that she be be wrongly treat for epilepsy for six year and then I think we should do a cardiac workup with an e p Study you want I to deliberately shock a perfectly healthy child 's heart absolutely not Dr Hunt if he be right it would explain the code if he be wrong it will kill she look I be not wrong then it be your call karev maybe cristina 's right maybe try to teach the intern be pointless please do not listen to cristina she think just because you would rather teach than take out a gall

from it or they can face it you say they need to be around the people who love they because it be go to be the tough fight of their life and no one should have to do it alone and then you give they the odd and even though a 5 survival rate be bad it be really bad you say you say Screw the odd People die of the hiccup my mother die of the hiccup and survival rate for that be what 100 the odd be that she should be alive right now the odd be that the the odd mean crap so people should face it and they should fight maybe not those word no exactly those word thank you dr Grey How be she do uh she be uh she be stable you do a hell of a job today and the chief be go to hear about it pretty impressive for a resident you fix that attitude of yours you could be the future of this hospital the

her hippocampus could compromise her memory her speech she would not be able to practice medicine anymore I have perform this surgery hundred of time on cancer patient no but it be if you do the surgery I could lose my memory it be unlikely but it be possible and if you do not do the surgery we could shrink the tumor with I l 2 if the tumor do not kill I first why take the chance have you even do a wada test to see how her memory would be affect put her brain to sleep and ask she to remember a bunch of flash card be not an accurate assessment of the post surgical outcome but it would

operate on he maybe she will let we operate on her that way we can keep they together through the surgery through the recovery they will be together and maybe you think this be a bad idea that I be propose unnecessary surgery and maybe you will tell the Chief and the Chief will think that it make I a bad doctor but I think it make I a good doctor and I think stop talk be my word hurt you again you be right it be a good idea how do this happen be Chen just not pay attention she make a mistake wrong time to make a mistake with the merger you people need to stop with the doom and gloom merger

a patient man everyone say you would find the great white of tumor but just have to see it for myself and now that you have you want my flow attend answer or my fellow surgeon answer Fellow surgeon this tumor idangerous Complicated and smart Beautiful this tumor be the reason I get into medicine to successfully take out this tumor would be an achievement you could hang your hat on for the rest of your career you could retire on this tumor I would not go near it it be a beast it be a malpractice suit wait to happen even if we could get his insurance to cover it do I mention he be an employee our pro bono budget can not cover high risk surgery for every employee in this hospital we be not a charity what happen to you excuse I there be a time you would 've convince I to do this surgery but now your first instinct be no happen to you you come to I as the chief of surgery and I say no as for my medical opinion it be still no there be such a thing as an inoperable tumor what if it be not what if I get in there I open it up I look around there be no way anything other than cut the cord would kill this man I do not know how many time you want I to say it you be not operate on an inoperable tumor it be a tough job derek you sure you still want it so what do you do I schedule the surgery I be take out the tumor Microsurgery be about precision the microscope change your perspective radically the hand eye coordination require can be learn but now I need natural each one of you will get a chance to guide this pen through the hole in the cup the person who make a mark close to the president 's nose and do not hit the side of the cup get to scrub in who want to go first take your time do over no do over way to go two really concentrate take your time Next take your time we 've get nothing but time Next somebody please well off the mark get out how do you get into this program M Confident Next Next Next Next next Disappointed I be so disappointed here we go nicely do if somebody improve on that I will be out of a job I guess you might need to retire then you will be scrub in word on the o R Floor be that you 've go rogue I be do a surgery I fully believe in to piss off the chief since when do richard become your b F F he be not my b F F he be the chief for now have you go rogue I be do a surgery I believe in against the chief 's order he will freak when he find out there be a computer schedule say that I be do craniotomy all day he be not go to find out do not say anymore 'cause I the chief secret bad idea I think it be badass come on let us go should I be offend because I be try to come up with a good reason why you page every resident to the skill lab but I I your sister your sister I think you be on my service little grey I do not page you because I have another job for you you give I the idea actually I need somebody in the o r who be go to remind I to take break to bend my leg to drink water I will be your patient essentially you want I to be your doctor if dr Sloan 's okay with you give up his service of course you love I and this be a once in a lifetime tumor go get your rogue on you be nervous right about be in there that long I too what do you have to be nervous about Shepherd do not even let you compete no that be that be because he need I to maintain his care while we be in there I be his doctor basically wow so you fall for that 'cause I mean it sound it sound more like you be his bitch what no I be not you be go to need to take a break eventually and and and you be go to need to stretch you be go to need to pee and when you do I will be there to take over yeah I do not I do not take break you seriously think you be go to last all day in there I 've do it before but that be because I know how to stop take fluid before a long surgery have fun playing nurse I mean it sound Neat I do not know I think izzie have it right get fire run away die I get to call you back be that what I think it be what no no no Gimmie a diaper it be for the surgery please do not tell anybody about this that be genius you never have to leave the o r you can hydrate all you want you be mock I Fine whatever it be not like I be go to use it anyway of course you be this be the definition of hard core you be like an astronaut this be surgery nasa style you know what you put it on right now I will guard the door anybody open their mouth and they be fire you too Dr Shepherd I be just describe our new schedule to some of our board member this must be Mrs Taylor and she be undergo a craniotomy it be mr Taylor we be still work out a few kink clearly we should go keep the train run on time nice meeting you all Isaac if I get in there and it look too dangerous to remove the responsible thing be to close you back up do not close I up if you get in and if it be too complicated cut the cord paralyze I if you must I survive a war do you know that no I survive a war where they put body into mass grave where there be once a playground I survive the death of my family my parent my brother and sister then I survive the death of my we and child when they starve to death in the refugee camp I survive the loss of my country of hear my mother tongue speak of know what it feel like to have a place to call home I survive and I will survive the loss of my leg if I have to I will survive it but yes there be always a way when thing look like there be no way there be a way to do the impossible to survive the unsurvivable there be always a way and you you and I have this in common we be inspire in the face of the impossible we be inspire so if I can offer one piece of advice to the world 's foremost neurosurgeon today if you become frightened instead become inspire I be ready now put I to sleep the dura 's open let us get our first look at the tumor that be the vessel be more intricate than the m R I show there be no way I can get the tumor out without rupture one and kill the cord what do we do if I start t 2 I could avoid hit the feeding vessel so maybe I should go low there be less vascularity around t 7 so that do seem well no it do seem well and you would only get function loss below the chest but I risk rupture the anterior spinal artery there probably the tumor taper off there Higher be well maybe either way I risk send he into hemodynamic collapse he be not talk to we be he not at all t 2 show less potential for bleed at t 3 the vessel have increase I be sorry about the contest who tell you about that no one I just I overhear people talk in the pit it sound hard it be not hard it be a moment of you know what we we do not have to discuss it watch lexie in a diaper be punishment enough what Lexie be wear what that be a reason you should be glad that you be not down there that be the reason I want to be down there what Lexie get to pee in a diaper and I do not you want to pee in the diaper oh god no no I want to have to pee in a diaper to be in a surgery so difficult and so long that my only option be to put on a diaper and pee in it be they just go to let he stare at the thing all day he have not make a single cut if I clip the drain vein without get the feeder they will burst I really think it be time for you to take a break it be be er 8 hour I could go under the tumor here but I might cut the radicular artery if you need a break just take a break I do not need one I be hard core be you wear a diaper Shut up at least bend your leg you can not bring yourself to use it can you shut up shut the hell up I do not need a break if you do take one either of you open your mouth again you be out of the o R Bathroom break what okay I be sure this be a completely authorize surgery but I think you might like to know that the chief be schedule to do a surgery across the hall in o r Three shortly so if you be plan on do something anything you might want to do it soon thank you I know she be not at home you have to try her cell Fine just no tomorrow at 10 00 do not cancel it she will be there what you miss the contest this morning the one you tank whatever Shepherd have assign we to round on his cancel craniotomy and as much as I would rather watch his ser secret surgery from the gallery I can handle it myself if you want to you know Deal with your izzie stuff I respect you more when you call her cancer wife at least it be honest I be try to be human here you think if I be not there you might get to do some big bad neuro and tell shepherd you do isolo which by the way make you the douche you know what I try go ahead throw away your marriage I will be round I will be round this be why you do not go rogue look at he he be crack I could tell you this be go to happen do not be smug this be one of our people 's life at stake this be so depress ten hour stare into his spine and he can not figure out what to do what do you just say what no I do not do I I do not am I to understand that you cancel your surgery today to operate on a spinal cord tumor the rate of infection for this patient be increase every second you keep he open not to mention the thousand of dollar you be waste Standing here do nothing so I be demand that you close this man up close he up and relinquish the o r right now that be it Let us close he up there be no way of take it out without risk your life and to cut the cord at this point I just I will not do it you be still walk let us reassess this in a few month I understand you work hard today you be tired I be sorry you will try again tomorrow tomorrow no I can not try again the tumor be inoperable I can not fix this go home Sleep on it we will talk more tomorrow I do not understand there be nothing to understand I stand there for ten hour stare in the o r you stand for ten hour and do nothing let us talk about you now how be your day my day my day be you know I sleep and I eat an entire box of cereal I leave three voice mail for izzie I be sure she will not return any of they I start and give up on anna karenina for the fifteenth time you want to talk about the tumor I do please just admit it I be a surgery junkie it be more vascular than the m R I show you be able to do the decompression yes you be not able to find a plane to dissect no plane nothing it be just there be no path nothing distinct why because it be just you know what I have an idea what be you do just watch and learn the tumor be here you 've completely lose your mind from T 7 it go all the way up to t 2 you be draw on the wall I open up the posterior column it be chaos I do not know what vessel be connect to the tumor or to the cord so what I do be Start here the anterior spinal artery could rupture the cord could die here you risk catch the radicular artery under the tumor the cord die but why not just cut the drain vein at the top expose the artery the draining vein be very thin you slip up they burst he leave my o r a quadriplegic I might as well cut the cord which you do not do even though isaac say you could even though you know it would save his life he still have function in his leg no but what I mean be you do not cut the cord you stand in the r for ten hour you know the chief would stop you Anybody else would 've and you do not so there must be a reason why this patient understand what cut the cord mean the loss of function in both leg and possibly more we have to cut the cord to kill the tumor there be no other way that will only take an hour or two you can have o r one Hunt need it after so he will have enough time thank you good luck we be not cut the cord we be not the mistake I make yesterday be that I want a plan there can be no plan I just have to pick a point and cut but what you say yesterday if you cut an artery or hit the cord Isaac want we to take the risk he want a cure and it be our job to try see you in the o r this be bad this be really really bad be you kid no one at mercy west be this badass this be not badass this be you see he yesterday he be spin himself in in circle mumbling like some crazy psych patient and he be mean well he be your psych patient now deal with it diaper genie I wear a diaper yesterday yes and I will wear one today if it help get dr Shepherd through this surgery I will wear a diaper 'cause my diaper be awesome my diaper be hard core you wish you have the ball to wear my diaper I be go to wear it and I be go to wear it with pride and if I have to pee in it I will pee because I be a surgeon this be america and I will do what need to be do so you can kiss my hard core diaper wearin ' ass you wake I from a nap this well be good Napping during the day actually that be good you be go to need the rest a redo retroperitoneal sarcoma that be like a 12 hour surgery yeah 15 if thing get ugly go gear up Shepherd need the o r I put on a diaper I 've get the plane ready to make our first cut I hear you need some support you need people to talk to experience surgeon and you can not say no because I be in charge and this be what I be prescribe thank you Let us start make the first cut do you you paralyze he no one vessel down settle in we have many more to go I still hear some wheezing let us start you on another breathing treatment can I see you for a minute I be a little busy it be important you need to go it be past 10 00 you be check your watch every five second you be distract just go I will finish up here shut the hell up come here you do not even know I so why be you all up in my face about this because there be a girl sit down there on the third floor wait for her guy she do not want to see I okay she bail she do not even tell I to my face she leave a note stop act like and let I get back to my job if you be sure about that then fine do not go but you well be 100 sure she be not hope that you show up because right now you be make a choice you not her so you well be at peace with that I 've clear a path at t 5 and if I continue along this plane M E P Tracing 's lose amplitude what just happen a vessel burst it might have be connect to the cord if there be not enough blood reach the cord I could 've just paralyze our patient suction please suction what cristina what be it easy careful More suction there be too much blood we be lose he I should 've just cut the cord this be too risky wait it be back Amplitude be up so the cord do not stroke out you do not paralyze he the vessel be connect to the tumor we be okay nice work thank take off my mask what take off my mask take off my mask get in there take a breath and get back in there you can do this you really should drink something I be fine you be not you be dehydrate and stress you should drink something I say I be fine drink the water I say drink it should not you be in o r one yes but I swap with torre she have an emergency laparotomy Dr Torres be do a laparotomy what be I do what I just hear my name he do not cut the cord Bailey will stop he she be at the door Bailey 's in the o r with Shepherd then who be at the door oh god Whoa move Dr Robbins I say no Dr Shepherd be operate on the inside of man 's spinal cord right now even the most minor disturbance could cause he to make a mistake on that patient a patient who happen to work here and whose life I personally would like to see dr Shepherd save so no you do not get to go in there and be a bully not today chief not on my watch okay I totally think that be go to end different yeah more like that care to fill we in no I would not because anything outside of this o r be not your concern your only concern be this patient now keep go Damn it what be it I can not tell which one of these vessel feed the cord and which one feed the tumor I have to do a blind cut like a trip wire if I cut the wrong one the entire cord stroke out we will come back to this later later so you could finish the entire surgery only to cut the wrong one this will all have be for nothing exactly but thank for point that out how many inch leave Less than 2 so if I do my math we get four or five more hour ahead Crap oh crap what be it it be my hand it be cramp Damn it do not move do not ve B p 's dropping we be touch the cord if we disturb it any more we run pulse be

question of if I can it be whether or not I should in my opinion Wallace be not strong enough to handle another operation but with surgery how long would he have then I I be not confident that he will even make it ofthe table but if he do how long I strongly advise against how long maybe two month I I be s I be sorry but the moment that we 've be fight for two year it be here so you need to prepare yourself and you need to prepare Wallace you think I 've be pour all this money into research so that you could find a cure for some other kid Mr Anderson no you have to do this surgery Mr Anderson I be you buy our son two more month you buy he more time so that we can buy he a cure I be sorry robbin these be not people who hear the word no if they want surgery for their son they will get surgery for their son whether or not you be the one to do it you 've be with this boy since day one I believe you can do this successfully do not walk away now unless you know beyond a shadow of a doubt that

not go to fire I because the last time that I do an open thoracotomy for an embolus be with he in his o r only he be give I word of encouragement not scream in my ear for the record you rock that in there Hunt 's just jealous he do not do it himself Shut up okay you will not believe what just happen in surgery with you okay tell I I be great what I need for you to tell I that I be great you be

do you mean no I mean no I will not be speak to Wallace 's parent Mr Jennings and the chief will take care of that formality because as far as they be concerned and as far as the Andersons will be concern I just kill their son I be a liability because if they be to ask I the truth be I would tell they that I do just kill their son and they should sue and I be responsible but that be not in the good interest of the hospital be I close yeah I think we be on the same page my luck will run out it have nothing to do with luck he be be an ass you know what I rock that embolus what he care about

chole patient ok so you tell I and I will tell the chief what be wrong with he he be yellow oh this be the yellow man that I have ever see right he be like lemon yellow like mustard yellow hey hey we get it he be yellow I be try to find out why Ultrasound show dilate duct which mean obstructive jaundice but the chief only take out the gallbladder and we never see any sign of liver disease or cancer but could that mean that the chief accidentally clip the common bile duct oh my God okay okay stop right now both of you now do you actually see the chief clip the common bile duct no of course not but but nothing that be one of the most serious mistake a general surgeon can make so let us not make this accusation lightly it be not an accusation uh stop talk just get an e r p to find the exact cause of this man 's discoloration and doctor if I find out that either of you have say a word about this to anyone I will make sure that you be the one who require emergency surgery you have a condition call N p h normal pressure hydrocephalus it be a buildup of cerebrospinal fluid in your brain very hard to uh diagnose but tnk to Dr Percy here the spinal tap remove some of the fluid relieve the pressure in your brain resolve your symptom which be how we come to your diagnosis hmm Hmm Dr Shepherd want to put in a permanent shunt it will drain the excess fluid to your abdoman so oh

a chemical of some kind it be chaff can you see my rash as the leg continue to grow the band will cut off his circulation if we wait we risk severe damage to the left leg possible loss of the right entirely but if we operate 22 week it be it be still risky if you do not operate you be not go to kill the baby we can rehabilitate the remain part of his leg after he be bear we can fit he with a prosthesis it be entirely possible that he will walk we 've get option here if we operate Dr Montgomery can remove the band he will be just fine or we can wait a few week till he be big and strong and

nothing else matter this be what you guy talk about during lunch I be with they Love come and go Surgery do not result be back you choose love just do a perfect dissection without lacerate the portal vein you go to do that little fist pump in surgery too the test show a malignancy on your left lung it be call pleural mesothelioma and it be a cancer that surround the lining of your lung so what you you cut out his lung good case scenario we will not have to remove any lung tissue except for the tumor do you hear that that be good I be not deaf what be the bad case scenario we get in there and the damage be too extensive and we have to remove more my whole lung that be the bad case scenario but yes it be a possibility but it be also possible they will not have to remove any so let us stay positive will you please shut up I can not take your cheerful little voice shove positive thinking down my throat when my life be basically over People do recover from thing like this and then they go on to what go on to what live I will not have a lung I be a singer so you see my problem you can direct you can teach like you I would rather die than spend two hour every day listen to mediocre music major do their scale I know that this be a lot to take in and if you need time to talk or get a second opinion I want my lung Dr Altman I be big too big I do not fit in airplane seat and as Jeff be tell I my feeling do not always fit the situation if my food be overcook in a restaurant I get enrage I want to kill the waiter but I do not I politely ask he to take my meal back and bring it to I the way I ask for it I spend my day make myself small more acceptable and that be okay because at night when I go on stage I get to experience the world the way I feel it with indescribable rage and unbearable sadness and huge passion at night on stage I get to kill the waiter and dance on his grave and if I can not do that if I all I have leave be a life of make myself small then I do not want to live I do not and believe I honey you do not nt I to live be you steal sterile supply I need sterile instrument I be not go to get catch with my pant down cause this hospital can not get I get it I

you do the right thing and sometimes that get you a medal and sometimes it get you kill how do you know it be the right thing when it be the good thing for the most people the thing that keep the most people alive how you do a little claustrophobic Focus on your breathing that always help Alex I have to know when Mer call she say you be move on have you move on I sleep with someone Damn it we will

I think that be an intussusception I 've never see one before in an adult well I suppose we would handle it the same way as with a kid right Dr Gracie what would you do in this situation quite frankly nothing I would not operate this patient a lose cause he be grot GRID it be call AIDS now AIDS no one know what be cause it or how it spread you want I to potentially risk the health of my staff my own life for a guy with a death sentence no I be not do it and I recommend you do not do it either we take an oath we be suppose to be healer ten year ago you would not even have be allow in this program do not you dare tell I what kind of oath we take we would hit a wall and um we plan a number of procedure but um uh but then then I give you that rouse pep talk you know what you totally do what if I have quit in the elevator what if I have freeze I mean I have every reason to freeze I be an intern I never have my hand on a heart before no reason for I to think I be not go to do anything

rest and have more to prove your c t show that your bowel have twist in on itself probably because of kaposi 's lesion in your abdoman it be a pretty rare problem but we can take care of it with surgery will Dr gracie be do the surgery I be afraid you be stuck with we he be scared be not he just like they outside I can see they point mumbling stare Screw they I do not blame they for be scare

not do not mean you can not get it together and take the scalpel okay uh make a 6 centimeter long incision over the sci phisternal junction Good we know what we be do be risky these day we know that AIDS transmission require exchange of bodily fluid but back then we have no idea can you get it from casual contact from the air from surgery no idea poor guy live a lie for so long yeah Shame we be live a lie too what we should not be do what we be do we have to stop no we be not the lie our marriage be the lie this Us this be what be right we should leave they Richard you leave Adele and I will leave Thatcher I can not you have a daughter I can not and neither can you you do not have to go in there I can do this alone you have Meredith to think about you be just like the rest of they you have a different skin color but turn out you be just like they Ellis I give birth to a child Richard that make I a mother it do not make I inept it do not make I less of a woman it do not make I less of a surgeon no matter how much everyone want it to all my research do not help Dr Baylow send the patient home so I think she would win I think you know maybe I be not cut out for this game but a couple of month later Alicia oh thank God a familiar face what happen the pain get really bad they say maybe I have some sort of obstruction or something from the other surgery they want to go back in and take another look Mandy I do not think I can take it anymore please tell I this surgery 's go to help they be go to find something right uh ju d do not touch she uh I know you be you be here to take she to the o r but uh do not touch she so you cancel your resident 's surgery be not that a little bold well she be worry out adhesion right give I candy no adhesion no candy and it be not bold Grey it be stupid but in this case it be also necessary where do you get off cancel my surgery when I page you you work for I get that you listen to what I have to say be you at all familiar with what surgeon do Dr Bailey we cut yeah rebook Ms Tatum for surgery no D Dr Baylow you want to go in and explore her obstruction she do not have any sign of adhesion look just because she be have previous surgery do not mean that you should not actually look for another cause she have a pseudo obstruction that could be resolve with an N g tube and if you have look far and I I do not know talk to your patient you would 've discover that along with abdominal pain she also have uh weakness palpitation numbness uh skin change and her urine be intermittently dark ring any bell yet your patient who be be slice nine way to Sunday have porphyria if you have diagnose it early she could 've avoid get her ovary take out and her gallbladder and yes yes I take out her appendix and I too be at fault for not look at the whole person but you know the difference between you and I I learn something from it I learn when not to cut I learn to listen to my patient how could you have not learn in three year what take I three month to learn Dr Bailey and the reason I have her chart be because you ignore my page and she need to get start on hemin right away be because you put it in she I V you give it to her daily for four day Dr Bailey the patient get well the patient do not get prod probe scope or cut open like a Thanksgiving Turkey you supercilious fool Dr Bailey my office now we do a series of short surgery so his lung and heart could withstand the anesthesia it be gruele for the patient but worth it in the end show them the x ray oh yeah so cool okay um these be the before and these be the after wow yeah um yeah it be it be amazing I mean after the final surgery we be just and uh we celebrate that night Man do we ever celebrate Mm wait Cone of silence yeah yeah yeah whatever I know I be in big trouble now it be my job to make sure that my resident be support and treat with respect of course and I be so sorry you have say enough for one day sorry it be my job so we be go to sit here with you wear that terrify look on your face for a respectable amount of time so that Dr Baylow and her friend can assume you be have your behind hand to you on a platter you be go to make a hell of a surgeon Dr Bailey lose the smile well the patient survive the surgery but eight month later he come back with PCP pneumonia he die a week later Dr Grey and I well um I will not speak for her but I lose the sense that I be a superhero and I really start to think of how dangerous it all be it change you this work your patient your colleague you change each other you do not ever think you will lose your way but what happen in this hospital just remember why you come here you say it the day you graduate from med school you take the physician 's oath remember it tape it to your locker to your

I 've get Evans what no you you can not I and I and Teddy w oh God see this be my point exactly I can not staff this hospital base on the fact that she be Hunt 's friend and your flavor of the month you know what I be just sick of worry about this this job be exhaust I be sorry that be what you be complain about Screw you I be lose everything today everything go ahead how be I suppose to call a couple of stranger and tell them to come take my kid Sloan 's your kid Mark you be not lose she they be not take she hey do you see I in the o r you be an idiot what you really think that Evans be go to take you under his award win wing he will not he do not need you he do not care about student he be a rock star not a teacher he be a rock star Teddy he be totally a rock star I mean do you see he in there he be like an octopus do a million thing like cut retract suction all at once you think that I need you to hold my instrument when I operate you think that help I save the patient I do it so that you can learn Cristina I would be a lot fast in the o r without you your glove be totally clean at the end of surgery do you learn a lot Teddy it be one surgery he be here for my job Cristina do you really not get that if Evans be in I be out so you know good luck with your new attending I get it you watch parent go through horrible unimaginable pain every day and you go through horrible

yourself on the back for having diagnose I like my life I like it the way that it be I do not want it to change I think I like it with you in it I hope I be not wrong wait I call your mother what why she kick I out she be on her way she miss you she be worried about you right I be worried about you too okay if this be the part where you tell I that you talk to she and she convince you that I keep my baby be a bad idea because I be young and irresponsible that be not what the conversation be about okay well so you think it over and you decide that you do not have time for a kid that be fine I get it you have a life you be busy but you know what I can handle this kid on my own no you can not have a kid be hard and you be young and irresponsible but if that be your decision if that be what you want then I be in I be all in I be not too busy for my family but do not keep the baby for I you will always have I and I will always want you and that be true no matter what you decide you be my kid and I be so happy I get to know you Sloan I be so happy about that hey what be you do right now uh can we walk and talk at the same time where be we go you need to talk to Derek Shepherd about

the right move Loyalty it be a powerful thing it make for a great Chief I offer it to Evans he pass but just the physical threat for every other kind you be on your own correct by chamallow Transcript by addic7ed com the skin be the large organ in the body it protect we hold we together literally let we know what we be feel huh reaction observation communication any question so far we be do this because chief Shepherd suggest we brush up on our patient sensitivity skill that be why and it just so happen this morning be a very good time besides half of you be raise by wolf reaction keep your face impassive whether prompt by a patient 's appearance or lab result facial expression of surprise concern disgust etcetera can be counterproductive uh la la la la la joke do not make joke about patient not in front of they not even in private well Yang what if the joke be really funny it be not neither be that one move on we assess quickly in the e r and go to radiology what if he have to be admit can we get to the surgical elevator what about the freight elevator Richard be we set up for this I mean our table do we have enough I do not know be our equipment go to be strong enough well they be five minute out we will have to figure it out as we go the skin can be soft and vulnerable highly sensitive easy to break be that Gary Clark he be file a wrongful death suit in his wife 's case I be be depose today Chief Shepherd hi yeah hi whatever you be sell just leave the sample in my office thank you I be not a drug rep I be your lawyer Lauren Turner go do not worry I get this okay thank you Dr Shepherd Lauren Let us follow I please Observation yeah ah okay use reflective listening repeat the patient 's feeling back to they um I hear that you be concerned about the surgery let I explain the risk I can see you like vegetable after surgery you might become one Communication uh do not use jargon Use language that the patient can understand be creative in use metaphor oh I be terrible with metaphor I can never come up with them why 'cause you be dumb as a box of hammer you see that be a good one you be an ass but that be a good one be clear and comprehensive explain all risk and all probable outcome leave nothing out question Adamson why be you go so fast it just so happen that we have an emergent patient arrive who will need a little extra sensitivity so remember to

hmm thank you my contract come in and Cristina tell I that you put in a good word so thank of course what nothing what be we look at Patient 's get a severe deep tissue infection under his belly there be a pretty significant abscess Hunt and I need to get in there and debride clear out the infected fat that much sudden fat loss be dangerous it be preferable to he die of an infection but it be a risky surgery yes but we will have Bailey and Webber on standby in case he go south what be the surgical risk calculation on a patient like this almost too high to calculate five time the risk of heart attack respiratory failure airway complication he be diabetic so there be a risk of ketoacidotic coma high risk of pulmonary embolism and believe it or not he be malnourished which lead to slow healing renal failure nerve damage Post op infection I be say no the risk be too high that be all thank you very much but that be it so you be say we be go to send he away to die I be say we send he to a bariatric center that be prepare for a type of patient like this instead of we spend our time and resource care for someone who obviously do not care for himself Derek he be I just swap out the booze for the food you do not think I care about myself he have an illness that he can not control he need help I be sorry I that be not you in there and that be not about Bobby Corso it be about Gary Clark you be see potential lawsuit where you use to see patient it be the job Derek the job can change your priority excuse I Shepherd Derek do not let it tell Sloan to go ahead open he up yes Hunt that conversation we have about Altman do you share that with anyone I do you share that with your wife do Meredith say something when I make a professional recommendation about a fell attend I expect it to be keep in confidence I do not expect to hear about it from one of my resident I think I could assume that much how be your day go Dr Grey uh yeah uh Jamie we be go to open up your knee and we be go to wire all the piece of your patella back together be you go to do the operation Yep you will hold my hand through the whole thing I think it be well if I be hold the scalpel but I can hold

yeah sure she be kinda flirty and I be flirt back because I be try to put she at ease talk to the patient the way the patient talk to you make them feel understand and safe and you be moron oh and a little pervy Jeez Put I down for 715 got it what happen at 7 15 715 be her bet I be make a pool on Bobby Corso 's actual weight 20 buck close without go over the pot you want in how be you still on

involve you want I to tell you but fit how about you tell I how you like to do it with your husband or your girlfriend any favorite position or kink let us talk about that because I know you all must have a freak show of your own go on who want to go first no nobody okay well it be probably none of my damn business anyway the fat under your skin have become necrotic have have die and the infection be eat through your skin well I suppose it have to come to that I 've eat everything else the operation be extremely risky you have a high than normal chance that a surgical complication can kill you if I do not have the surgery I die how long will I have do you think Mr Corso you want the surgery you want to try I 've try everything high protein the low carb drug pill hypnosis I have try everything you have a baby on the way think about that who do you think I be think about you you dream of have a kid you picture yourself play ball with he you picture she stand on your foot while you

disgusted to even smile or joke with he make he feel like a person I bring he here because I think you would help he but you be only make he feel bad so unless you want to tell I the next step to get he outta here and home I do not need to hear anything from you be you bring my forklift around we think we would just open up the loading dock and uh roll you out that be good right into Puget sound you will float I home like a barge I get a good one yeah what do they call the guy who be so fat that he could not get out of the house what dead and selfish yeah 'cause uh you leave a a 700 pound mess for your wife to clean up that be a good one look I be sorry that we 've be tiptoe around you all day try not to make joke but you be the one who be get to stop stop call yourself the fat guy you get a wife who love you you know who stick by you through all this I mean you do something right to deserve that look I know what it be like to have life hand you so much crap you just want to sit on the couch and die but you got to look at what be in front of you you can not just walk out on she now she deserve well chance be you be go to die on that table then you get what you want but at least your wife will think you try she will tell your kid you try give them that at least how have you get back on the surgery they say they need big guy Karev Percy retract the abdoman Adamson stay there Kepner over there where do you want I I think we be good that be all we need do you irrigate the ear to induce an ocular response no that be not necessary why the patient have a pupillary response so you see life in her eye there be a pupillary response yet you declare she dead no you misunderstand what I be say absence of a pupillary response be one of the sign of brain death yet you declare her brain dead I never declare her brain dead she have minimal brain activity now I be sorry I try to explain to you that there be absolutely no so she be alive until you withdraw care until you pull the plug I be sorry I be not be clear um accord to the letter of her advanced directive there be a level of brain activity that I judge to be you judge it you decide it be my opinion to should we stop now yes I be go to suggest that we take a break get ourselves together resume later on do that sound all right fine do you remember when I tell you they do not have a case yes with respect Dr Shepherd please stop try to give they one do not apologize okay the infection 's really deep underneath all this fat be just more fat Yep I be down to the abdominal wall how be the fascia not too good want to take a look inside it be probably a can of worm but yeah let us have a little peek ah damn it go to have to go in Bailey Webber scrub in fast okay so there be a hole in the wall right and the blood be suppose to go from one room to another except it be just rush outside through the hole and it can not get to her brain get it yes or to her lung so they be go to sew up the hole they will try to but the heart have to be strong like um like nylon like your shoe your mom 's heart be weak like paper what happen if she die we will talk about that if that happen Gotcha Mine if your mom die you will feel a lot of thing first you will feel like uh you coulda do more to help she but that be not true you do everything you could it will not feel that way but remember I tell you this you do everything you could and it will hurt every time you think of her but over time it will hurt less and less and eventually you will remember she and it will only hurt a little okay so I be not go to be here in the morning when they let you go so if it hurt before your follow up give I a call okay and and if it be ooze green stuff call I can I call you if it be late at night and I be kinda drunk and I run
