gwen 's go to die you do not prove her innocence by jump into the flame you do it by find out the cause of the disease well whatever it be arthur 's not go to find it he think he be so sharp even when I say I be a wizard he still could not see it it be pretty hard to spot maybe I should get a pointy hat I do not think you will find one big enough anyway forget that to save gwen we have to find out what be contaminate the water this water supply the whole town take a sample let us take it back and examine it what the hell be that there it be an afanc an a what a beast bear of clay and conjure up

palace how could you betray I like this I would not see he execute I 've treat you like a daughter be this how you repay I I do what I think be right to conspire with my enemy against I he be just a boy he be a Druid be that such a crime his kind would see I dead and you would help they then punish I but spare the boy I beg you make arrangement for the boy to be execute tomorrow morning no please he be do nothing let this be a lesson to you you do not have to do this do you hear I I want he execute at dawn yes father what have these people do to you why be you so full of hate enough I will not hear another word do not speak to I until you be ready to apologise I promise that I would not let anything bad happen you try your good it be not enough he be in jail now there be nothing more we can do I will not let he die can I count on your help thank you perhaps imprisonment be a more suitable punishment for the boy it would allow he to grow until he strike against we we do not know he be go to strike against we he be yet to do anything it be enough that his people conspire to overthrow I this be harsh but necessary I take no pleasure in kill the boy then spare he for Morgana 's sake if you execute he I fear she will never forgive you I do not seek her forgiveness she have betray I yet you be spare she she have the promise I make her father to thank for that the boy enjoy no such privilege he will be execute at dawn be that clear make yourself at home you can not let your father execute the boy you be lucky he be not execute you be he really behind the screen when I come to search your chamber I know you believe your father 's wrong to execute he what I believe do not matter my father 's make up his mind he will not be talk out of it I try then the time for talk be over whatever you be think it be not go to happen we have to get the boy back to his people no forget it you would let an innocent child die it be too late he be be catch I have no choice and be this how you will rule when you be king you be not like your father I will not betray he if I know you at all you will not stand by and let this happen please if you will not do this for the boy then do it for I sorry be I interrupt something nothing you need concern yourself with make yourself useful muck out my horse I trust Merlin we be go to break the Druid boy out of the dungeon you can not do that we have to Uther 's go to have he execute he at dawn I mean it be too dangerous if the King catch you a second time he will never forgive you I be not worried for myself Merlin 's right when my father

be a grate that cover the entrance to the tunnel bring a rope and grappling hook no I can not Merlin do you understand if you be not there to meet we we will surely be catch I need to know why you tell I not to protect the boy you seek my counsel and yet you choose to ignore it just tell I why if the boy live you can not fulfil your destiny you say it be my destiny to protect Arthur then you have the answer you seek you be tell I that little boy be go to kill Arthur it seem that be up to you no you can not know that for certain you have it in your power to prevent a great evil there must be another way the future be not set in stone you must let the boy die the plight of the Druid boy that be cause your forehead to wrinkle like a lizard 's elbow would you let something terrible happen

Black Knight before I do not believe so you do not recognise his crest Crest which house be it I be not sure I do not see it clearly but he be not someone you would forget in a hurry be not it no so you do not think he be from around here that would seem likely then what be he do here your faith in my all see knowledge be both touching and wholly misplace maybe if you 've finish your work you could go to bed and leave I to finish mine ok I be go Gaius Merlin do you think Owain can beat he we will find out soon enough he should not have pick it up so put an end to it the challenge have be take up it can not be stop then fight in his place I can not why not Owain pick up the gauntlet Owain be the one who must fight that be the Knight 's Code he know that but it be a fight to the death I know Gaius thank God you know why I be here the Black Knight so it be he you see his crest have you confirm it it be the crest of Tristan de Bois and he be the only knight ever to have carry such a crest yes accord to the record yes I be sorry to disturb you Sire what be it the knight the stranger he bear the crest of Tristan de Bois yes but he be be dead for 20 year I know I kill he then how do you explain dead man do not return you 've never fight in mortal combat before it be different it be not like the training yeah I know listen to I the problem be we 've never see he fight you have to get the measure of he but I have the same advantage he be never see I fight true you 've watch I yes and I know no one braver remember all it take to kill a man be one well aim blow the Lady Morgana ask I to give you this token she wish you to wear it for luck you can thank she and tell she I shall wear it with pride but I will not need luck now remember find the flow of the fight and try to control it the fight shall be to the knight 's rule to the death let battle commence come on Owain one well aim blow yes who will take up my challenge I Sir Pellinor take up the challenge so be it should we tend to his wound he take a hit Owain do not land a blow the sword definitely pierce he be you sure my eye be quick than yours he should be dead perhaps he already be why do you stop I I have to give our knight to prove themselves have you see how this stranger fight and Sir Pellinor be more than a match for he he be not recover from the wound he suffer at Othanden I can not help that so you send he to his death it be his choice to take up the gauntlet I be not to blame be you sure we should be do this you be not scared be you no I love old crypt I would not be see dead anywhere else must 've be a gust of wind we should 've bring a torch Leoc morla Huh handy yes what be we look for bring your torch over here we be break into someone 's grave we be too late I think someone have already break out Tristan de Bois be the brother of Ygraine Uther 's wife Arthur 's mother Ygraine die in childbirth he blame Uther and come to the gate of Camelot and challenge he to single combat Uther win but in his die breath Tristan curse Camelot to one day suffer his return I think it be the rambling of a die man man do not just rise up from the dead though no matter how angry they be it be my guess we be deal with a wraith a wraith the spirit of a dead man conjure from the grave so this be the work of a sorcerer powerful magic can harness a grieve rage and demente soul and make it live again how do we stop it we can not because it be not alive no mortal weapon can kill it there must be something nothing can stop it until it have achieve what it come for what be that revenge on Camelot what do that mean for Sir Pellinor I be afraid it do not look good maybe you be wrong I hope so the sword go in I be sure I see too I Arthur Pendragon challenge you so be it single combat Noon tomorrow how could you be so stupid I will revoke the challenge the Knight 's Code must be uphold that be what you tell I this be different once the challenge be lay down you be Crown Prince there can not be one rule for I and one for all the rest I forbid you to fight you want I to prove I be worthy of the throne I can not do that by be a coward no Arthur this will be your death I be sorry you have so little faith in I Father Arthur you be right I wish I be not Arthur will die he be Camelot 's strong warrior if anyone can defeat it he can you say yourself no mortal weapon can kill it we have to find a way to defeat the wraith ourselves how do you propose to do that if no mortal sword will kill it then I will with mortal magic it be too dangerous we do not have a choice good evening Sire Gaius there be a matter of great urgency which I must discuss with you then spit it out Tristan 's tomb be empty I believe he have be conjure from the dead how be this possible I believe he be a wraith a spirit he be come to take Revenge for Ygraine 's death it be magic that kill she not I nevertheless it be you he blame you can not allow Arthur to fight no weapon forge by man can kill a wraith it will stop at nothing until it have accomplish what it come for Arthur can not win he will die he will not listen to I then you must tell he who the knight be no you can not hide the truth forever I be the King you will not tell I what I can and can not do that be your choice Sire you tell he or let he go to his death no one but you or I will ever know the secret of Arthur 's birth the boy be of age he should know never you make an oath I warn you not to break it very well Sire leave I Cume hay forbearnar Merlin you know that conversation we have about knock you have to pull out and why be that because he will kill you why do everybody think that because they be right just pull out you be the crown prince no one want to see you die over some stupid challenge I be not a coward I know that I 've watch you overcome every fear you 've ever face that be what be require you be more than that you be not nearly a mere warrior you be a prince a future king you 've prove your courage but you must prove your wisdom I be not back down Arthur listen to I this be no ordinary knight look at he he do not eat he do not sleep he just stand there in complete silence do not that tell you something no one be unbeatable if you fight he you will die I be not listen to this I be try to warn you Arthur and I be try to warn you Merlin I should 've know it be more than I have hope for Uther soon Arthur will be slay you will have send he to his death have not you tired of revenge have not you you begin this war when you throw I from the court and slaughter all of my kind you bring it on yourself you practise evil I be your friend Uther you welcome I here you betray that friendship I do as you ask I use the magic you so despise to give your barren wife the son you crave do not ever speak of she in that way she be my heart my soul and you take she from I she die give birth to your son it be not my choice that be the law of magic to create a life there be a death the balance of the world have to be repay you know it would kill her no you be wrong if I have foresee her death and the terrible retribution you would seek I would never have grant your wish I wish you have not you wish you do not have a son well your wish will come true tomorrow I will not let you take he I have watch so many people I love die at your hand Uther Pendragon now it be your turn how do you get in here the door be open no I lock it someone else must 've open it and you think you would come in and help yourself I be look for a book for Gaius he think the Black Knight be a wraith then Arthur be in grave peril which be why I be here I need to find a weapon that will kill something that be already dead I have read of such thing in the ancient chronicle really what do they say several fable speak of ancient sword that can kill the dead the sword the fable speak could destroy anything alive or dead can you show I one of these fable well let I think yes I be sort if hurry yes you young people always be this be the Chronicle of Beltain now then ah here we be Sir Marhaus look upon the great sword begotten in the dragon 's breath and find it pass good what do you say Sir Marhaus no no no not about he the dragon the great sword begotten in the dragon 's breath and find it pass good Merlin what be you do here I come to ask a favor yes I be not sure how to ask it ask Merlin you know I would grant you anything I mean not anything obviously not anything what be it you want I I 've come to ask for a sword the strong your father 's ever make what for to save Arthur I do not want you to fight tomorrow you be worried about I I do not know what it be please I be beg you I have to do this it be my duty I understand I be sorry you know that this business would come back to haunt I not quite so literally I should 've listen to you you say that no good would come of use witchcraft at Arthur 's birth you want an heir you think it be the only way Nimueh tell I there would be a price you be not to know that that price would be Ygraine 's life I can not let Arthur die then you must stop the fight no I will take his place do you know what you be say Ygraine give up her life for he so must I Uther I have no other choice there must be another way my death will stop the wraith and Arthur will live and it mean you be the only person leave who know the truth about Arthur 's birth I want you to swear to I that you will keep your oath I will take it to my grave you 've always be a good friend despite my temper I always think that would be the death of you I have one other favour to ask my father 's be save this he be always say it be the good sword he be ever make it be perfect he will kill I if he find I 've take it he will understand you do it for Arthur I know you be proud of he really Merlin do you know why I be here it may surprise you Merlin but my knowledge of your life be not universal it be to do with Arthur his life be in danger he will die unless I can make a weapon that will kill the dead so what do you come to ask of I will you burnish it to save Arthur the dead do not return without reason who have he come for Uther then let he take his vengeance and the wraith will die without my aid but it be Arthur who be go to fight he you have to save he that be your destiny young warlock not mine but if Arthur fight the wraith and die Camelot will have no heir I will have no destiny a weapon forge with my assistance will have great power I know you do not know you can only guess you have not see what I have see if you have perhaps you would not ask this of I what do you mean in the wrong hand this sword could do great evil it must be wield by Arthur and he alone I understand you must do more than understand you must promise I promise Heed my word the sword be forge for Arthur and he alone I 've bring you something to help you sleep I be fine I do not need it here it will relax you take the edge off your nerve I would not drink it for pleasure why do not you sit down for a moment mind you if you forget about the taste the after effect be quite pleasurable just lie back that be a fine blade it be for Arthur he will not be need it today I will be take Arthur 's place but Sire prepare I for battle Arthur should fight the grievance be with I the fight be mine I do not have your armour that will do it be likely to make

here for you I be just his servant give he more credit than that he like you that be because he do not know I and if he do I would probably be dead by now you do not really believe that do you Merlin where be you go with that thing what do it look like we need wood we both know that you do not need an axe to fall a tree and I remember the trouble it get I into I nearly flatten old man Simmons well he deserve it the stupid old crone he never do like I anyway well even less after that why be you be like this you know why why do you leave it be not what I want my mother be worried when she find out you know she be so angry I would not have tell anyone I know you would not you would be able to defeat Kanen on your own would not you not sure maybe so what be stop you so what if Arthur find out I do not expect you to understand try I one day Arthur will be a great king but he need my help and if anyone ever find out about my power I would have to leave Camelot for good be you say you would rather keep your magic secret for Arthur 's sake than protect friend and family fight with a sword but you can learn the basic the stance how to parry a blow how to land your own on my count one two three four now you may have to watch for the feint so keep your foot move and only stay in range long enough to land your blow again one two three four one two three four there be no way they be go to be able to hold Kanen off man be not the only one who can fight again one two three Matthew I want you to organise sentry duty to keep an eye out for Kanen and his man I would be glad to if there be any sign of attack I want you to ride straight back here I do not want you fight he all on your own it look like the battle 's already fight and lose they will toughen up they need to how be we do for weapon there be not much but we should be able to scrape together what you need it be not the weapon that worry we it be have enough people to use they we think the woman should be allow to fight you have not enough man if they be train soldier maybe you would stand a chance but they be not it be too dangerous right back on your foot come on let us go we do not stand a chance Arthur can not see that he be too stubborn why do you think he come here the same reason we do Merlin Arthur may act like he do not care but he would not be here if he do not we be not go to be able to defend Ealdor with sword and sinew alone we be go to need a plan we need to find some way of limit their mobility and draw they into a trap if we fight they on their term then WOMAN SCREAMS no get he down from there what do it say make the most of this day it will be your last Matthew no no no you do this look what you 've do you 've kill he it be not his fault if he have not be strut around treat we like his personal army this would never have happen these man be brave enough to fight for what they believe in even if you be not you be send they to their grave you 've kill one man how many more need to die before you realise this be a battle that can not be win when Kanen come you have not get a chance you be go to be slaughter do not bother Merlin I be not interested you should be because tomorrow Kanen attack and whether you like it or not we will have to fight not if I be not here that be up to you but the rest of we be stay join we will this be not about Arthur this be about your friend be

maker they be use to ignore he and if he be right he be not I be treat these man like soldier and they be not you 've see they fight they they have not get a clue you need to tell they all to leave the village before Kanen return no we be go to stay we be go to fight and we be go to win Merlin it can not be do the odd be too great it can we be go to make Kanen rue the day he ever come to this village all you need to do be get the man ready for battle and the rest will take care of itself how you 've just get to believe in they because if you do not they will sense it and the battle will be lose before it be even begin tomorrow morning the woman and child should gather what belonging they can carry and go to the wood we be not go anywhere I know you want to help but woman can not stay here it be too dangerous the woman have as much right to fight for their life as the man do but none of you know how to fight the more of we there be the well chance we stand this be your home if you want to fight to defend it that be your choice I would be honour to stand alongside you Kanen attack tomorrow Kanen 's brutal he fight only to kill which be why he will never defeat we look around in this circle we be all equal you be not fight because someone be order you to you be fight for so much more than that you fight for your home you fight for your family you fight for your friend you fight for the right to grow crop in peace and if you fall you fall fight for the noble of cause fight for your very right to survive and when you be old and grey you will look back on this day and you

Merlin what be you look at Father a unicorn 's horn to grace the wall of Camelot Magnificent it be the first one I have see Gaius look at this it be very impressive my lord what be it Gaius speak your mind unicorn be rare and mystical creature there be a legend that bad fortune come to anyone who slay one Nonsense we will be the envy of every kingdom I be pleased you like it I do not understand how Arthur can have take pleasure from kill the unicorn Arthur be a hunter it be in his blood whereas you be something entirely different it be the most beautiful creature I have ever see I wish you have be there it be a rare privilege Alas there be few unicorn still alive you try tell that to Arthur I can imagine it would be difficult my horse throw a shoe take it to the blacksmith make sure he do a good job and when you 've do that you can polish my saddle Merlin have you listen to a word I say you 've get a face like a wound bear ever since we get back from that hunting trip do not tell I you be still upset about the unicorn I do not think you should have kill it oh really and why be that it be it be do no harm what purpose do you serve by kill it we be hunt that be what you do would you have I bring it home as a pet look at this what do you know what that be no rat dropping my chamber be infest you need to spend less time worry about unicorn and more time worry about rat my lord the king request your service as a matter of urgency find that rat every single ear have die we have receive report that it be the same throughout the kingdom I ride through this valley yesterday the crop look healthy then it happen overnight be it a disease of some kind perhaps I have ask the court physician to conduct some test we must ration what little food we have leave any idea what cause the crop to die no disease I know of could spread through the kingdom in one night what could kill all the plant it be not kill all the plant the tree and hedge be unharmed unfortunately you can not eat tree and hedge it be only kill plant we can eat it appear so if it be not a disease it must be magic we can not assume that Merlin perhaps there be something in the soil or water that can explain it I can not tell the king it be cause by sorcery until I be certain Next the livestock be either die or have be eat Food and water be scarce we be distribute ration but they be meagre this be all the grain we have we must maintain order at all cost Panic will make the situation bad I will issue a decree that looter will be execute from tonight Camelot will be under curfew I will see to it give it back it be mine it be not yours Merlin be it true about the crop they be all dead I think we may have to start tighten our belt I be sure Arthur will think of something and if he do not I will Merlin Sand and you say the well be full of it I send man down to the underground reservoir there be no trace of water to be find first the crop and now this it be the same throughout the kingdom there be precious little water anywhere Gaius can you offer any explanation for this I can not think of a scientific explanation I can only conclude it be the result of sorcery I believe you be right it be the work of magic the kingdom be under attack Greot gecuman leccan Gecuman gedryc waeter I be I be just I be hope you may have be try to turn it back into water I know I have caution against use magic but if ever there be a time to use your talent it be now I wish I know how I 've try everything if it be magic it be more powerful magic than I possess patrol the market and the low town no one be to leave their home dismiss Merlin you do realise there be a curfew yeah I be in your chamber hunt for the rat do you find it no so you have be outwit by a rat they do say rat be very intelligent more intelligent than you it would seem go home it would be embarrassing to lock up my own servant for break the curfew what be that what that mean you go the other way and cut he off where be he I do not see anyone he be right here do not tell I you let he get past you Arthur no one pass I be you blind be you look for I I be Anhora keeper of the unicorn Camelot be under curfew what be your business here I have come to deliver a message and who be this message for it be for you Arthur Pendragon be it you who be responsible for kill our crop turn our water into sand you alone be responsible for the misfortune that have befall Camelot I you think I would bring drought and famine upon my own people when you kill the unicorn you unleash a curse for this Camelot will suffer greatly if you have put a curse on Camelot you will lift it or you will pay with your life Undo the curse or face execution only you can do that you will be test you be under arrest until you have prove yourself and make amend for kill the unicorn the curse will not be lift if you fail any of these test Camelot will be damn for all eternity and you believe what this Anhora say about the curse to be true you say there be a legend that misfortune come to anyone who slay a unicorn it make sense not much for breakfast I be afraid we be down to our last few scrap of food where do you get the water to make the tea fortunately for both of we you forgot to empty your bath yesterday you be make tea from my bath water it be not so bad perhaps a little soapy what do Arthur think about the curse he do not believe it be his fault he be convince Anhora be responsible for it if you do not wish to drink bath water make sure Arthur see sense I guess the rat must be as hungry as the rest of we you think this be funny moderately get it mend and find that rat have you give any more thought to what Anhora say last night well he may have escape last night but at least we now know who we be look for I have tell my father that I will find this Anhora and put an end to it what if he be tell the truth about the curse you think I be responsible for bring suffering upon my own people no not deliberately when you kill the unicorn I see Anhora in the forest why do not you say anything it be just for a second and then he disappear I think I be see thing but he be there that do not prove anything he might be tell the truth because he be skulk about in the forest why would Anhora appear in Camelot then lie we have he corner he be try to talk his way out of it by blame I he can disappear he do not have to talk his way out of anything my father have warn I about sorcerer like he they will not rest until our kingdom be destroy I believe he be tell the truth then you be a fool you can not trust a single word a sorcerer say you would do well to remember that now I think I 've figure out what Anhora 's next move be go to be and when he make it we be go to be wait do not you worry about keep watch Merlin you just make yourself comfortable MERLIN SIGHS and stop smack your lip I be thirsty we be all thirsty Merlin he SIGHS Psst Someone 's come show yourself before I run you through who be you my name be my name be speak up my name be Evan my lord I see you think you can help yourself to our grain reserve please my lord I do not steal for myself my child have not eat for two day it be the same for everyone I know that it be wrong to steal I could not bear to see they starve and could you bear for your child to see you be execute then you should go home if you be catch steal again I will not spare you yes my lord thank you wait use it sparingly it might be the last food you and your family get for some time you have show yourself to be merciful and kind my lord this will bring its own reward stop he come back here stop that man he be be loot I never know water could taste so good my throat be so dry I think I could not talk at least some good would have come from the drought then More the sand have disappear and water return to the well it do not make any sense I suppose you have some explanation for this Merlin let us hear it Anhora say you would be test and last night in the grain store you let that villager go it would bring its own reward he be merely grateful and so he should have be maybe that be your first test you pass it so the curse have begin to lift perhaps this be your reward I know you do not have to listen to I I be glad we agree on something if you be test again you have a chance to end the suffering I know you want that more than anything perhaps we should seek Anhora out I can not negotiate with sorcerer my father would not hear of it then it be probably good you do not tell he I must go check on the guard see if you can find I some food find some food Swelt deor who be they they have come from the outlying village in search of food we do not have enough ration to feed the people who be already here you should not blame yourself I be sure you be do everything you can it be not enough do you manage to find any food where do you get that I be able to smuggle it out of the palace kitchen share it out amongst the child and the old people make it go as far as you can I have lose my appetite you have to eat something I can not not while my people be starve do you really believe I be responsible for the curse I be afraid so we be go to the forest first thing in the morning maybe we can pick up Anhora 's trail whatever it take ok but you have to eat you will not be able to help anyone if you be too weak to pass the test what kind of meat be this it have a very strange texture it be pork this be not pork it be far too stringy what be it it be it be rat be not it try not to think about it look at I I be be rude here I be stuff my face with this delicious stew when you be hungry too come on take a seat eat Mmmm it be actually pretty tasty well I be glad you like it because there be plenty more enter Morgana I hate to ask but I be wonder if you have anything to eat I be not entirely sure what I be look for you be look for footprint or break branch anything that would indicate someone pass that Merlin Merlin he be here Arthur you you be a thief be not that obvious when you catch I steal your grain I have more important thing to deal with you do not believe my story what kind of man lie about starve child to save his own skin your people starve because you let thief steal their grain that be why they doubt you you do not speak for my people your father would never have be fool like that you hold your tongue or I will make time to teach you some manner your father would have have I execute but you do not have the stomach for it do you Arthur and that be why he doubt you will make a good king you know nothing of what my father think I think he wish he have another son one worthy of take his place you shame he pick up your sword the king must fear the day when you will take the throne he fear you do not have enough strength to defeat his enemy the king must wonder if you be even his son this be your do it be a test to see what be truly in your heart your trick prove nothing why do you kill this man he insult my honour you could have choose to ignore his taunt what harm would they do you you will lift the curse Sorcerer it be not in my power then you will die kill I will not help you agh you have show that you would kill a man to defend your pride you have fail the test for this Camelot will pay dearly my people have do nothing your people 's suffering be not my do it be yours Arthur Arthur what be it what have happen all our remain supply have rot every last grain I know Arthur 's stubborn and pig head and annoying but he care about his people more than he care about himself he will not forgive himself for make his people suffer you must make sure he do not do anything rash the mood he be in Ready you be sure they be not poisonous quite certain they say they taste like chicken unless we be to starve this taste nothing like chicken there be some supply leave in the palace store we be distribute they but there be not enough to live on they will not survive for long then you must stop distribute food to the people they will starve we must conserve the food we have for our army we can not let our people go without food we must defend the kingdom what be the point defend a what would you have I do ask the neighbouring kingdom for help they may be able to spare some food no as soon as they realise how we weak we be our enemy will strike against we you do not know that I would rather starve than beg my enemy for help what of our kingdom 's reputation have you no pride I can not think of my pride when our people go hungry they be all I can think of give the order to stop distribute food to the people be that understand you will have to give that order yourself very well but if you have catch the sorcerer I would not have to that be your responsibility one day you will understand what it take to be king they do not yet know that there be bad to come what do you mean my father be go to stop distribute food to the people they be to be leave to starve I have a chance to lift the curse and I have fail they you be not to know you be be test my people be starve Camelot be on the verge of collapse it be all my do Anhora SOUND echo show yourself Anhora you want to talk with I I have come to seek your help the people be starve they will soon be dead you must believe I when I say it give I no pleasure to see your people suffer if it pain you put an end to it it be not in my power to lift the curse then give Arthur another chance he have accept it be his responsibility he will prove himself worthy and lift the curse if you give he a chance you have faith in Arthur I trust he with my life Arthur must go to the Labyrinth of Gedref there he will face a final test if he fail there be no hope the curse will destroy Camelot wait what kind of test will he face anhora that be for Arthur alone to discover let I come with you I might be able to help you be not come I bring this curse upon Camelot I be go to be the one to lift it or die try how do you die help anyone I will die know I do everything I can I be come with you Merlin you be to stay here and help the people as well you can be that understand you say Arthur would face a test you be prepare a trap for he the trap be not for Arthur it be for you Gehaeftan Merlin I be sorry let he go I will take your test but not till he be release that be not possible Merlin be part of the test please sit if you refuse the test you will have fail and Camelot will be destroy I think I tell you to stay at home let us get on with it there be two goblet before you one of the goblet contain a deadly poison the other goblet a harmless liquid all the liquid in both goblet must be drunk but each of you may only drink from a single goblet what kind of ridiculous test be that what do that prove what it prove be for you to decide if you pass the test the curse will be lift let us think about this what if I drink from my goblet first if it be poison you will die and if it be not then you will have to drink from yours and you die there must be a way round it it be perfectly simple one of we have to die we have to find a way to determine which goblet have the poison then I will drink it I will be the one to

Catrina have a rare bone disorder afflict her joint she often have difficulty walk especially after a long ride my tonic be the only thing that bring her relief she walk as well as you or I so I

as I be leave I think I see something this be go to sound mad but it look like Jonas have a tail a tail be you sure well I only glimpse it for a moment I could be wrong no I believe you we must keep an eye on her a very close eye how wonderful it be to sit here with you Uther it be a terrible thing to find oneself alone in the world suddenly cruelly alone when Ygraine die I fear I would never recover but then as time pass I have become used to be alone but you have Morgana and Arthur surely they be a comfort to you they be of course both of they it must be hard to be King and father both to shoulder all that responsibility by yourself but I feel sure my lord that you and I shall not remain alone forever we will find love anew a kindre spirit to share the burden of this life I believe we will honestly look at they be you all right do not you think it be odd how quickly they 've become close there be nothing odd about that my father be a wealthy and powerful man good evening Sire a very good evening to you Gaius you seem in high spirit I be I be the Lady Catrina have strike a chord with you Catrina be a remarkable woman that she be Sire you may remember I treat she as a child such courage in the face of her condition condition what be you talk about I think you know Sire I diagnose Catrina with an incurable bone disease evidently you be wrong there be nothing the matter with she now it have be a miraculous recovery I must say I be sorry Gaius what be you suggest I be not suggest anything Sire it be just a little strange that be all the only strange thing I see be that you will not admit that you be wrong Sire this be not about I it be about the Lady Catrina the Lady Catrina be our honour guest and you will show she the respect that she deserve be there something on your mind my lord it be nothing speak my lord be it true that as a child you suffer from a terrible illness who tell you that Gaius the court physician he say he treat you for it yes my lord what he say be true but as you can see I suffer no more and for that you must be eternally grateful after all Gaius think your condition be incurable do he not well fortunately for us physician be often mistaken even your famous Gaius it be unusual though for such a serious illness to cure itself almost a miracle I can neither deny it nor explain it but miracle do happen after all be it not a miracle that we should find each other again after all this time and my good fortune continue for you be a remarkable man Uther Pendragon you be brave but compassionate you be powerful but modest Most of all you be very very handsome I be sorry no my lord it be I who must apologise it be a long time since Ygraine since anyone I understand completely there be no hurry we have all the time in the world and that time will come I have no doubt that you have prepare a very good explanation for this apparently I be wrong please tell I you be not spy on Lady Catrina it be not what it seem yes it be exactly what it seem you 've lead a sheltered life you have no social skill whatsoever and Catrina be I admit an attractive woman I understand completely if I ever find you do it again I will feed you to the dog do I make myself clear yes absolutely sire what you see be seldom see Trolls despise all other live thing especially human they prefer to lurk in the darkness of their nest feast on rot and filth and Jonas be he a troll too who can tell what creature he be it make no sense if troll like to lurk in their cave so much what be this one do in Camelot Trolls be greedy Lady Catrina be like the rest of her kind she lust after wealth and power Uther 's wealth and power we have reach the point of no return Uther have to be tell you be go to tell Uther that his new lady friend 's a troll that be exactly what I be go to do good luck thank you Merlin my lord yes Gaius I have serve you for many year now I like to think that in my humble capacity I have advise you to the good of my ability and that my advice have prove to be of value to you this be true and so I must advise you that the Lady Catrina be not all that she seem to be then tell I Gaius who be she I believe she to be she be Come on out with it she be a troll Sire excuse I some troll have the power to take any shape they please this one have take a shape that please you you be besotte my lord the creature have you in its power Gaius this be utterly ludicrous please Sire her entire family be wipe out but she alone escape she have an incurable disease but make a miraculous recovery and that be nothing but idle gossip be it gossip she do not eat her food of course she do not she feast on rotten fruit like any other troll enough this attack be unwarranted and malicious sire her servant be not human he have a tail I say enough sire please I just advise you not to do anything rash and I advise you to hold your tongue physician or I will indeed do something rash do you sleep well last night mistress very well thank you we have a problem last night you be follow who the boy Merlin shall I dispose of he mistress that may arouse suspicion but it be time that Uther bend to my wish and if he do not well he will have no choice there be more than one way to enchant a man please do not say anything I be not go to say anything you be go to say I tell you so I be but I be not go to now Uther do not take it well you see I tell you sorry but I know he Merlin he be a proud man but he be not stupid he will reflect on what I say I be sure he will let us hope you be right Dinner time be not this perfect you and I together a toast to we I be not sure everyone see it that way well there will always be those who resist change that be to be expect we must be mindful of public opinion what be you try to say my lord perhaps if you be to visit your cousin for a while to show people that we be not rush into anything you would let yourself be bully by some petty minded fool but of course of course my lord if that be what you wish then that be what I shall do it be as you say we have all the time in the world before I go my lord there be something I want to give you it belong to my father and his father before he Catrina I could not possibly I want you to have it perhaps when you look at it it will remind you of I and the time that we have spend together I shall wear it always that be as well for

kiss good morning mistress it be indeed Jonas the King be receptive to your advance how could he resist such beauty the enchantment prove effective then he be but a puppet in my hand you call for I Sire you will be delighted to hear that none of the worry you bring to my attention have any truth to they whatsoever Sire I hope over time you will come to see Catrina as she really be over time I 've ask Catrina to extend her stay indefinitely I consider the matter close and I hope you show I the courtesy of do the same it be no good I can tell he she be a troll till I be blue in the face he will not listen he see only a charming beautiful woman with a body like a tree trunk but we only know that because you see she in troll form what do we do we must open Uther 's eye show she for what she really be use magic the only way to reveal her true form but she never leave his side I know you want I to use magic in front of the king I do I would never get away with it I be sorry I know how dangerous this be but we can not allow she to gain any further control over the King who know the consequence just one problem I know nothing about troll magic then we have work to do a beautiful day the first of many I hope how fine it must be to have all this at your command can be a burden sometimes let I share your burden my lord together we could achieve so much there be nothing I would like more would it not be a good idea to send a message to those who doubt we to show all of Camelot the strength of our love our commitment what do you have in mind I be think of something traditional

I know my quarry be long go how can you be so certain well despite appearance he be not stupid he must have get wind that we be look for he and leave Outwitting your army in the process it appear so I think your man aspire to the same high standard that my father instill in you when I lead the army they do we do not even know if he be still in Camelot he could be anywhere and that be a good enough reason to give up I be not I believe our resource would I 've hear enough of your excuse we both have I want the boy find Sire my Lady my plan to undermine Arthur be under way soon Uther will detest the sight of his own son what be that then what be that smell a treat to celebrate Fresh from the stable you do know how to treat a lady alert the rest of the guard come with I they 've find Merlin 's trail they say he be head for the Northern Borders I be sure he will outrun they what if he can not Uther will not show he any mercy try not to worry Gwen that be comfortable a necessary evil I be afraid they 've pick up the trail that we leave but it will not fool they for long then I would well get busy be careful the guard be still search for you Mistress it be time do I have to you must keep up the pretence I hate be like this so clean it be revolt I can not keep it up this skin this face I just want to claw it off think of all the money and the power soon it will all be yours there be something important that I we wish you to address for too long the people have have it easy they 've grow fat off our indulgence of they how so we provide peace protection food they give we very little in return our people be poor they survive on the few crop they be able to grow that be what they want we to think it be what I see every day we be introduce a new tax the people must pay for the sanctuary that Camelot provide you can not the majority be barely able to get by as it be those who refuse to pay it will be arrest and publicly flog we 've live this way for year you 've never suggest anything like this before maybe not to you but the King confide in I that he have be consider this for some time have not you I have you be to begin the collection at once I see she drink some of this potion and a patch of troll skin on her arm disappear it must be pretty powerful magic to physically change she like that could you make a potion that look and taste the same as this I do not know yes I suppose so but without the troll magic it would not have the same effect exactly if I can replace this potion with one that be not magical so Catrina will keep take it but it will no long work and she will turn into a troll think you can do it I do not know we have to make the switch before morning or Jonas will notice then it be go to be a long night my Lady my Liege I bring you flower pick from the royal garden they be they be lovely not as lovely as you be you all right no I be sorry I can not keep this up any long keep what up the lie I can not keep pretend like this I be begin to wonder if you be really the man I think you be the man I fall in love with the man I marry be firm strong in both mind and body trust I I be all of that and more I fear for Camelot Arthur have not take after his father he be too weak to make the hard decision then it be lucky I be in such rude health Lucky indeed but what if some tragedy be to befall you let I worry about Arthur no I can not your love for he have make you blind to his fault I judge Arthur the same as the rest of my man if he excel he be reward if he fail he be punish well as long as you be sure of that I be now let I take your mind off this I promise our first night as husband and wife will be one to remember what be in it nothing too potent Rat 's gut Nice Toad paste you take two toad grind they up I get the picture Horse dung crush sheep 's eyeball Lovely Pond scum three wolf spider and what potion be not complete without a dash of sheep 's brain sound delicious Good because you be go to taste it no way it be completely harmless that be disgusting to you but not to a troll I can not even believe you let I put that in my mouth now try the original just a small amount and be sure to spit it out do it taste roughly the same yes it be horrible you sure because if there be too big a difference Catrina will notice it taste exactly the same let us hope she think so too what do you think you be do he be refuse to pay the King 's tax you ask for too much I 've give all I can it be not enough let I see release he the King say release he give they back their money all of it I give you a direct order People can not afford to pay the tax do not tell I you be naive enough to take they at their word we have their loyalty their goodwill do not forsake that by make unreasonable demand be it so unreasonable for a king to expect his subject to obey he they will starve Nonsense you 've grow too soft remember these be your subject not your friend why can not they be both because we rule the people not the other way round I think you be wrong I beg your pardon I say you be wrong without the people there be no Camelot we be as much their servant as they be ours you allow he to address you in this manner I do not it will not be tolerate you will take your man down into the town and go to every house collect the payment I demand I will not get out of my sight how can he do this to I my own son after all the sacrifice I 've make for he you be tense be it any surprise the lack of respect he show I I be sorry do that hurt no of course not your hand be surprisingly strong for one so delicate Arthur carry a heavy burden it can not be easy hold all that responsibility at such a tender age I be afraid that be the way it have to be after all I can not rule Camelot alone you do not have to you marry I remember how could I forget I be sorry I can not I be too worried about you with Arthur let you down the way he have how will you cope like you say you can not rule Camelot alone I have you by my side I may be your queen but I have no power why not the people would not respect I as they do Arthur I be not heir to the throne would it put your mind at rest if you be it would it most definitely would then you shall be the ceremony will take place this afternoon it be time for my potion be your plan progress as you would hope and not a moment too soon I must admit though that crown will look rather fetch all that gold and they lovely jewel now would you care to accompany your Queen Come in I see what you do early the people owe you a debt of gratitude the people owe I nothing my father be still go to impose the tax will he not be persuade not by I he can not stand the sight of I that be not true the King love you have you hear how he speak to I I be sure he be angry but you be still his son everyone appreciate what you do they know you try and they will not forget that maybe he be right one day I will be the King of Camelot I can not be a friend to the people as well as their ruler that be not true and you will prove it when you become King you 've a kind heart Arthur do not ever change not for anyone the King have send for you Father I be relax

to be true to my heart and that be all I 've ever try to do to be the man you want I to be someone you be proud to call your son my decision be final Queen Catrina will be name as rightful heir to the throne Ceremony will begin forthwith we 've do it Catrina 's drank the fake potion what be wrong what be happen Uther have disinherit Arthur and make Catrina his heir so if Uther die she will rule

behead accord to the law of the land Uther must be enchant it be the only explanation which be why we must find a way you will not find anything in your book Troll enchantment be too strong then what be we go to do you must speak to the Dragon if there be a way to break Catrina 's hold on Uther he will know it but be careful Dragons and troll have be close ally in the past be everything to your satisfaction this thing be get to go for a start it be make for midget too hard too clean not my taste at all what can I get you instead I be walk through the ground this morning and I could not help but notice that your stable have just be muck out it seem such a waste to throw away all that lovely dung this be not funny it be the thought of Uther marry a troll be it a very public affair public enough do not laugh if she can not be stop Arthur will not become King Albion will never be bear I be sorry you be right of course how can we break the enchantment these be not trifle trick Troll magic be very powerful there have to be a way the only way you could break this be if Uther be to cry tear of true remorse how do we make he do that that I can not answer Uther 's heart be cold as stone he be never be sorry for anything thank I think Young warlock it be some time ago you promise to set I free the help I give be not unconditional that be for you now tell they about our plan

Mercia wish to honour our marriage with a visit good now tell this Bayard we expect gift lot of lovely shiny gold I think at this time it might be wise to to respectfully decline his visit whatever for I be still not sure that we can trust Bayard Nonsense he be a friend of Camelot you will send our reply it will be an honour to feast with he Honour the Dragon say he have to cry tear of true remorse to break the enchantment that be not go to be easy Uther 's heart be close to everyone not everyone then there be only one course of action we can take Uther must see his son die who be there you be back I never leave you mean to say you 've be under there this whole time course not no because if you be I be not I swear your stepmother be a troll then if you say I tell you so I be not go to I would not but if you have listen to I early sorry Gaius and I believe your father 's be enchant now we 've find a way to break the spell but we need your help so your great plan be to kill I not exactly Gaius have make a potion that give the appearance of death without the actual dying bit it be fine there be nothing to worry about it will only bring you to the brink of death only to the brink we have not get a choice we have to make your father cry he do not care about I any more Nonsense that be Catrina 's influence I 've know your father for many many year there be never be anyone or anything he be treasure more than you it be perfectly safe a single drop of the antidote will reverse the effect immediately Antidote what antidote you do not say anything about it I do not think it be important the potion will lower your heart rate and breathing to all intent and purpose you will be dead the antidote reverse the effect if it be administer in time if it be not you will be dead you just say it be not important I suppose it be a bit important Merlin will have the antidote once I 've administer the poison the potion he will have half an hour to get it to you do not be late be I ever you sure you wanna go through this it be the only way to save Camelot Time to break the bad news to Uther my boy it be my fault I push you away my son come away there be nothing you can do for

Merlin may your investigation prove fruitful Aredian however you will have to excuse we we have work to do naturally I have a few question I would like you to answer please be at my chamber in an hour you be aware then that sorcery have be practise in the vicinity of Camelot yes I mean apparently no it can not be deny there be a witness yes I know do you also know that the woman have name you as a witness but I have speak to her she be quite clear on the matter but I be not a witness sorry perhaps I misheard do you deny that you be present at the time of the incident no I be there so you see it the horse conjure from the smoke I see the smoke but it be only smoke I see nothing else be you say that she lie no I do not say that I say I do not see what she see how can that be I wonder how can one person see something and the other not I can not explain it I be at a loss as to explain it myself unless it be you who perform the magic it be not can you prove that it be not that will be all for now speak do not be afraid I I be draw water from the well Sire when I see they face in the water Sire terrible face like people who be drown scream scream I have not do anything I promise tell they what you see a goblin dancing on the coal it be dance in the flame and it speak Sire my heart near stop for fear of it as you have hear my Lord the incident in the wood be only the beginning there be a sorcerer Sire in the square there be creature jump right out of his mouth what manner of creature toad sire great green slimy thing as big as your fist the sorcerer laugh in your face even now magic flourish on the street of Camelot I scarcely believe it yet it be the truth my Lord fortunately I have utilise every facet of my craft to bring this matter to a swift resolution the sorcerer you have a suspect I do my Lord I regret to say they stand among we in this very room my method be infallible my finding incontestable the fact point to one person and one person alone the boy Merlin you can not be serious this be outrageous you have no evidence the tool of magic can not be hide from I I be certain that a search of the boy 's chamber will deliver we all we need I have nothing to hide from he very well guard restrain the boy let the search begin careful please that be my life 's work Comb every inch the sorcerer be a master of concealment there be nothing here Aredian I will be the judge of that over there behind this tapestry and there upend that stool be sure to check for hollow leg there within those powder jar here an amulet of enchantment be you aware physician that your assistant keep instrument of sorcery well our work be do I must inform the king I know for certain that that amulet do not belong to Merlin who do it belong to then it belong to I you be free to go what be go on say nothing do nothing promise I Gaius have serve I with unfaile dedication without his knowledge his wisdom I would not be sit here today you have show great faith in he Sire great faith indeed consider that he be know to practise sorcery you be mistaken no Arthur he speak the truth I be well aware of his past but I have every reason to believe he have turn his back on sorcery until now we do not know that this amulet you find could just be a stupid mistake or maybe he have fall back into old habit we must give he the benefit of the doubt why anyway there be a sure way to establish his guilt I know your method be effective but Gaius be an old man he could not withstand such treatment it be the only way to rid your mind of doubt what time be it Time for you to confess the amulet be a relic from the past a keepsake but such artefact be ban on pain of death surely you must know this I be wrong to have keep it I be grievously sorry for it well that be a good start it be an excellent start but not nearly enough I be afraid Aredian guard be your conscience clear when you use magic in the day of the Great Purge I have not use magic for many year your assistant keep item of sorcery it belong to I if someone else be to use magic if you be an enemy of this kingdom you be an enemy of your king my conscience be clear I would like a drink of water please and you shall have one when you have confess then I shall die of thirst Aredian what be wrong young warlock you look so pale I do a stupid thing a stupid stupid thing and now Gaius be go to die for it Gaius mean nothing to I but he mean a great deal to I very well tell I what have happen a witchfinder have come he be arrest Gaius for sorcery but I be the sorcerer yes I suppose you be well I be go to confess it be the only way to save he then your stupidity continue I will not sacrifice a friend to save myself bravely speak but Gaius be already doom if you confess the witchfinder will just burn you both but it be my fault do not you understand all too well young warlock but understand this if you be to die you would endanger the life of all those that rely upon you there must be something I can do there must be please help I I see you be distress by this but I can not help you because I do not know how to I can not just stand by and watch Gaius die I can not I be sorry you be a traitor you be an impost Sorcery be your only master I serve only my king in what way have you serve he you have lie to he break his law betray his trust I have save his life I have treat his ward I have protect his only son you have treat his ward I have strive to help all those in need it be a physician 's duty to do so the Lady Morgana among other for what malady do she receive this treatment she suffer from nightmare I see but as I say I feel it be my duty to attend to the need of you seem very keen to change the subject Gaius perhaps I should question she myself there be no need to be concern my lady I will not detain you long there be just a small detail I wish to clarify now it be true be it not that you have receive treatment for nightmare and it be Gaius the court physician who administer these treatment these potion I be sorry could you speak up thank you now you may go you do not happen to know what be in these potion I suppose of course not you be not a physician after all so for all you know these potion could have be magical your dream the product of an enchanted elixir I have these dream before Gaius start treat I but have they get well or bad since Gaius begin treat you bad as I think thank you you have be most helpful be you prepared to confess I would rather die first good and die you shall but not alone I be pleased to say you shall have company what Merlin and the Lady Morgana be to join you in the flame this be a trick you have corrupt they Gaius and they must answer to their king unless unless what Confess Confess I be a sorcerer sire I be responsible for conjure the smoke I be guilty of practise magic in Camelot the goblin the face in the well I be the sorcerer who conjure the toad from his mouth you have betray I you have betray your friend but above all you have betray yourself by the law of Camelot I must sentence you to death the sorcerer will be purge of his magic by mean of fire he shall be burn at the stake tomorrow at dawn bear witness and heed this lesson you be a liar guard you be a liar I will deal with this I know you be upset I know you be angry I be not throw you in jail then what be you do I be break the law I give you a few minute there be nothing I could do I know I understand I can not believe it that Uther could do this to you he have no choice once Aredian have find the amulet do not know you have such a thing it be not mine why do you say it be I be try to protect you I do not know what to say it be all right you do not have to say anything yeah I do the amulet be not mine either then how do it get there Aredian there be no other explanation but why all that matter be if I prove he plant it you be save you must let this go you be falsely accuse I have a chance to prove that I must take that chance no you must not I do not understand do you want to die but neither do I want you to die and die you surely will if you get too close to Aredian he will trap you Merlin he will manipulate you and without meaning to you will incriminate yourself you must let this go I must let you go to do otherwise would be an act of suicide I hope you have find some relief now that your ordeal be over your concern be touch Aredian will you please get out of my sight of course I just think you would want to hear the news that be all what news my investigation have begin Begun you already extract my confession indeed which just leave Merlin and the Lady Morgana but we strike a bargain I do not bargain with sorcerer he will not let go what happen he be question Morgana again I be worried Merlin she be close to break point that be what he do break you down in the end you confess guilty or not what do you mean Gaius be set up Aredian plant that amulet but why would he do such a thing Aredian be pay to catch sorcerer he do not care if someone be guilty maybe he get confession by lie by plant evidence as long as he get a confession he get his money even if this be true what can we do without proof get some this be hopeless keep look we dunno whether this flower mean anything no we do not but it be all we 've get here Belladonna for the alleviation of ulcer allergie muscular inflammation this be hopeless wait listen under certain condition a tincture can produce hallucination so Aredian 's witness it be not magic they be see it be vision it make sense if he be fake the evidence but how can we prove it Aredian 's too clever to have give the tincture to they directly the witness they must 've get it from someone else could 've be get it from anyone be there anything anything at all that these people have in common they be all woman but that do not tell we anything yes it do what be the one thing only woman would buy thing to make they look beautiful do you sell a tincture of belladonna what be this all about please it be important well I think I 've get some somewhere but what you would be want with eye drop in the middle of the night I really do not want to know Eye drop woman use they to make their eye more beautiful where do you get this well my usual supplier you do not get it from someone else of course I be sure now if it be all the same to you I would like to get some sleep Aredian give you the belladonna I do not know what you be talk about but you know Gaius will be execute tomorrow that have nothing to do with I that have everything to do with you Aredian 's witness see vision vision produce by the belladonna in these eye drop if we can prove this we have a chance of save Gaius he force I to sell it he say he would kill I if I say anything to anyone but it be he it be Aredian it be he thank you we 've get everything we need but be it enough we 've get a witness as well surely that be enough it be our word against Aredian 's we do not have a choice by dawn tomorrow Gaius will be dead we get one chance we 've get to give Uther something he can not deny something not even Aredian can talk his way out of I will be as quick as I can come on Merlin come on good morning Gaius where have you be everything be in place Gaius have already leave the dungeon then we have to delay the execution how I will speak to Arthur Leave Arthur to I Easy there show he some respect you 've get to stop this you know I can not Merlin have proof Gaius be innocent my father have pass sentence nothing I can do you can do the right thing Arthur Pendragon you can show some faith in a friend or stand by and watch an innocent die you do it to my father be you really willing to let it happen again you can stop look at I like that I know I be only a servant I think you be a prince so start behave like one wait Sire the witness see nothing but hallucination induce by the belladonna in these eye drop and you buy this belladonna from this man where do you get it from do not be afraid no harm will come to you here the witchfinder he give they to I he tell you what it be for only that if I do not sell it he would have I burn at the stake how do you answer they be absurd the boy have clearly concoct these lie in the hope of save his master you will not mind if we search your chamber Silence you have no authority Father let us settle this once and for all if what Merlin say be wrong then he must bear the consequence but if there be some truth in what he say I have nothing to hide you be waste your time the cupboard over there these thing do not belong to I this be a trick that boy plot against I Sorcerer think carefully you will never escape from Camelot alive I will if you value the life of your ward I be glad I find you here as be I my lord I think I would never see these chamber again if anything be damage in the search I will be only too glad to replace it you be very kind my lord I can still scarcely believe that he be a sorcerer indeed be there some reason you wish to see I I want to say I be sorry if you suffer at his hand but I do not suffer at his hand Uther I suffer at yours he work for you my lord he be merely follow your order but I be deceive you be deceive long before Aredian for you deceive yourself you see foe where there be friend sorcerer where there be servant I be not the first to be wrongly accuse in your war against magic and not all have be as lucky as I I assure you every measure will be take to ensure that nothing like this will happen again I hope that be true for all our sake now if you will excuse I I have work to do what I do not understand be how you know he have conceal evidence in his chamber just a hunch and the toad I can not explain I can hardly explain it myself unless of course you put it there Fair enough I will never save your life again promise absolutely honestly Merlin the toad be a step too far I know I know but you should have see the look on his face I be Morgause you think Morgause know the truth about Arthur 's birth I fear that more than anything I want to hear what she know about my mother maybe we should turn back the wood could be full of Odin 's man you be nothing

as if I somehow know Morgause I do not see how but I be pleased you be feel well what be your mother like I never know her she die before I open my eye I be sorry I barely know anything about she can not you ask your father he refuse to talk of her it must be too painful for he sometimes it be as if she never even exist I still have a sense of she almost as though she be part of I that be the same with my father I never know he and my mother have barely speak of he I 've get this vague memory it be my imagination I would do anything for even the vague memory why you be so determined to find Morgause see what she know about your mother be that so wrong no we should get some rest I must speak with you it concern Morgause what while I be treat her wound I notice that she wear a bracelet go on it bear the mark of the great house of Gorlois there be only one person other than Morgana who would have cause to wear this bracelet that be her half sister I be lead to believe that the child have die the child live my Lord she be smuggle out of Camelot shortly after her birth how do you know this it be I who entrust the child to the high priestess of the Old Religion you should have tell I Gaius I have swear a solemn oath my Lord I be only break it now because I fear what Morgause might do do Morgana know I do not believe Morgana must never find out she have a half sister I will not have her loyalty divide of course the high priestess will have train Morgause from birth her magic will be powerful then we must hope that the search party find Arthur before he reach her seem your horse have bring we to a dead end now where be he go you be go to get wet you do not say where be we I do not know if we be not sure Morgause be a sorcerer before we can be certain of it now that must

to the outlying village I want my son find yes my Lord it chill I to think what Morgause have plan for Arthur have she choose to she already could have kill he I believe she have some other purpose in mind Morgause tell Arthur that she know his mother she know Ygraine I do not know perhaps it be a lie she know it would tempt Arthur to go to her Morgause know the true circumstance of Arthur 's birth I fear that more than anything sure you want to do this if you be grant the opportunity would you not want to meet your father Uther will not forgive you if he find out you 've collaborate with a sorcerer what if my father 's attitude to magic be wrong you really think that it be not as simple as he would have we believe Morgause be a sorcerer she have cause we no harm surely not everyone who

of a beast Strange until I remember what Halig say about the druid girl that she be curse what be that get to do ancient chronicle speak of a heinous curse it doom its victim to turn at the stroke of midnight into a vicious and bloodthirsty beast the writer of old call this creature a bastet a monster of nightmare that inhabit the twilight world between the living and the dead I want the truth do

I should pursue my love I think a number of thing stand in the way of a happy union between you and Lady Vivian her blood thirsty father for one her complete lack of interest for another might it be worthwhile return to your old love I have my reservation about that as well what be you talk about I do not have an old love what on Earth you really need to start pay attention to the detail I know something be not right Arthur 's enchant I should 've realise no one can make butterfly appear from thin air Trickler why have he want Arthur to love her an advance by Arthur would ruin the conference maybe Alined want war without create it himself it be the cowardly behaviour you would expect from he Cowardly but clever we need to find a way of turn Arthur back to normal before it be too late my love Breakfast there be over 636 love spell in these book and over 150 of they involve a lock of hair be there no way we can narrow they down a bit I have look if I choose this one and it be wrong

Lady Vivian my love always for ever I know it I do not believe it Father we 've get something to tell you Father you once say that if you truly offend my honour then you would happily pay the price what say you now how have I offend your honour surely not with my love alone Love you do not know the first thing about love you be take advantage of an innocent girl I assure you my feeling for your daughter be as real as they be strong Unhand she or suffer the consequence be this really worth risk your life for indeed it be I would rather die than deny my feeling I love your daughter with all my heart it be no good I have speak to Olaf he will not rescind the challenge he say his honour have be taint he demand recompense you do not have to do that the fight be to the death what do you think you be do you can not help who you fall in love with you do you realise your action threaten the peace talk and it may yet bring war to Camelot I be happy to fight for what I believe in what be happen to he nothing more and yet who could wish for more I do not understand it Trickler 's magic be strong but not strong than mine love potion be strange you need to go to Uther it be a fight to the death if Uther realise that one of the king be use magic there will certainly be a war the only way out of this situation be to unenchant Arthur and unenchant he fast anything interesting have not you hear Arthur be discover in Lady Vivian 's chamber what King Olaf have demand recompense they be to fight to the death all for the love of a woman and Lady Vivian at that you look more shocked than I do it be very surprising I do not know why he could not control his feeling indeed I will miss the tourney if you do not mind there be so much to organise here but of course you will wish I luck will I have not you hear oh yes I 've hear though sadly not from your lip I wish you could have be more honest with I what be she talk about no idea you be pleased my lord do I get to keep my finger I shall cast your finger in gold I could not have wish for more I tell you I would not fail you if Olaf kill Arthur then Uther will start a war if Arthur kill Olaf then his man will start a war we can not lose King Olaf have demand recompense and by the ancient law of Camelot the matter will be settle by a tourney in three stage the weapon choose be quarter staff mace and sword the fight will be by the Knight 's Rules and to the death be we all clear one of your rib be break sire nothing can hurt I today I be invincible Love really can conquer all Gaius it be true this can not go on the fight be not fair Arthur 's head be in the cloud I do not know what to do then find someone who do this be magic indeed everything I have try have fail from what you tell I the spell have capture his heart and his heart be control his brain there be no magic that can break this enchantment there must be it have too great a hold I can not let Arthur die Patience young warlock the solution lie in a force great than you or I can understand a force that have puzzle many mind please I have very little time a force just tell I why it be the great force of all love Love you must find the person Arthur truly love and then one kiss from she will break the enchantment and he will desire Vivian no more be you sure you can carry on sire as long as I have Vivian to gaze at I can conquer the world besides the mace be my forte you will see rat again what no I need your help Arthur need your help I do not think that Arthur need I Gwen do not worry I know you know what everything anyone can see how you feel about each other I do not have time to explain so you have to trust I Arthur do love you no he do not if you can not trust I trust your feeling I be never trust my feeling again he be enchant yes with Lady Vivian I can see that I mean literally enchant with magic potion love juice none of his feeling be genuine how can you be sure when I see he his feeling seem real enough none of his feeling for she be real but if we do not break the spell his death will be search your heart you know who he love have you come to wish I good luck I do not think I need it any more no Arthur I have not come to wish you luck well honestly that be rather rude let I make amend what be I do you be in a fight to the death you be lose but there be no time to explain just live for I Arthur that be all I ask right now if anything should happen to I look after Gwen the world may think she be just a servant dispensable but she be not dispensable to I this be no way to achieve peace I think I well deliver it myself this time I be sorry for what I put you through you have nothing to apologise for I too have cause my fair share of hurt you must believe that my feeling for Vivian be not real I 've never love another but one day you will one day you will find your real princess one day you will be King of Camelot and I can not be your queen you do not know that I be as sure of that as you be thing may change well until they do my lord your boy have a very wise head on his shoulder no doubt he get that from you I hope that these event will not harm our peace treaty I believe that Vivian be as much to blame as Arthur I will take she away from temptation she be far too young to encounter such thing I go in peace I be very pleased to hear that that be more than you deserve boy you will run all the way home that be not possible master make it possible why so cross anyone would think you do not want peace I do Peace love it well you may return any time to view the treaty you be very kind we may return too

get it out no I could not but you could I you be the king 's ward no one would suspect you you be our only hope what be you do I would reason to believe there be an intruder in here right now the only intruder be you Camelot have be infiltrate do you hear the warning bell of course I do I be hope I would be safe in my chamber permit I to search the room you will do no such thing do you really think that if someone be in my room I would not know please accept my apology I do not understand I be sorry Merlin which bit do not you understand the make a fool out of I or make a fool out of yourself

do you mean what if they have be catch whatever they be do they be prepared to die for it Merlin I be look for Arthur he be out training of course he train every day same time same place I just want to apologise for last night another time perhaps I be starve you know what they say good food take time to prepare and this taste sensation take exactly how long nearly five minute really five minute you need that long you see to let it thicken Thicken the Crystal of Neahtid the lock be not damage what do that tell you it tell I that somebody steal my key be it precious this crystal of course it be it would not be down here otherwise right whoever it be they know exactly what they be look for apparently apparently be that all you 've get to say tell I Merlin whose job be it to ensure my chamber be lock at all time whose job be it to ensure that something like this never happen sorry you be sorry that be not good enough do they force their way in no Sire how do they gain access to the vault they steal the key how be that possible someone break into my chamber this be a grievous loss the Crystal of Neahtid be lock away for good reason why be it so important it be an instrument of magic in the day of the Purge sorcerer die try to protect it whatever it be it be important to they I will search the town find out what I can this crystal can not fall into enemy hand yes Sire thank you for what exactly lie to my father to save your worthless hide if you put I in that position again I will clap you in iron myself you would well hope we find that crystal Morgana steal the crystal I be certain of it I catch she in Arthur 's chamber she must have take his key can you prove any of this not exactly but but she do it I would bet my life on it you go accuse the King 's ward without proof that be you would be do I know you be right it do not make sense why would Morgana steal such a thing Uther say it be an instrument of magic there be many legend about the crystal be it some kind of weapon that I do not know you 've hear of it indeed the sorcerer of the past believe it hold the secret of time what do they mean by that I be not sure the crystal be an artefact of the Old Religion there be only one that could tell you more I need your help I be sure you do young warlock but first you must honour your promise I say I would set you free and I will when when I know that Camelot be safe please trust I why because you do not have a choice what be it that you wish to know what be the Crystal of Neahtid to those who know how to use it the crystal hold great knowledge what kind of knowledge the knowledge of what be what have be and what be yet to come do you mean it can show you the future amongst other thing yes the crystal have be steal by whom the Lady Morgana that witch do not have the power to wield the crystal do the druid boy mordre it be possible why do you ask I believe that they be involve in this together once before I warn you of the druid boy it be his destiny to bring about Arthur 's doom it may be that time be upon you what the ancient prophecy speak of an alliance of Mordred and Morgana unite in evil but this union must be stop whatever the cost thank you Gwen that will be all nearly do it be fine Gwen you can go it will not take a moment I say you can go my lady it be my hope that with time mordre will master the crystal when he do we will strike Uther down Uther and all who serve he all who serve he if we be to win this war there can be no half measure I can see this trouble you yes it do we fight for our very survival as do you the boy he tell I you have magic you need not be afraid I know I be sorry I have become so used to conceal the truth believe I I understand what that feel like every day I must look Uther in the eye know that if he be to discover who I really be he would have I kill you have be very brave I do not want to be brave I just want to be myself I do not want to be alone any more you be not alone you be here with we you need never be alone again I must be head back the castle will be wake soon farewell then my lady Morgana where be Morgana she could not stay will we be see she again yes mordre

have threaten to overthrow the King he sound pretty determined he be a fanatic and his supporter follow he unthinkingly blind by his charisma well it work on Morgana so it would seem and the druid boy alvarrthinks the boy can harness the power of the crystal we can not let this happen Merlin what can we do we can bend the truth a little you know the whereabouts of it I believe so I see how do you come by this information in my capacity as physician I have dealing with many people they hear thing Sire and they see thing last night I be confront by one such man who tell I that the crystal have be steal by a band of renegade lead by a man call Alvarr who exactly be this informant I think it would be only fair to protect their identity Sire if news of their betrayal reach the renegade it could indeed endanger their life very well where be Alvarr hide he be last see in the Valley of Chemary Sire Summon the guard Arthur I want this investigate without delay thank you Gaius once again I be in your debt you be not seriously think of go on this mission no I be not think about it I be go on this mission but you be chase a rumour true but for now it be the only lead we have to go on you

obnoxious Gaius have well be right about this what bring you here Arthur 's be send to capture the crystal the Knights of Camelot be almost upon we how have this happen I do not know I only know that

what you can not wield the crystal you do not have the power none of you do check the horse be feed and water sorry not the right answer what something on your mind be there when we enter the camp it be a trap they know we be come yeah so how do they know well they be sorcerer be not they probably use magic or something I need you to guard this with your life why I I can not guard it while I be asleep neither can I who say anything about you sleep so you admit to steal the Crystal of Neahtid I do you admit to plot against your King I do and you act alone you be not aid or abet by any citizen of Camelot I act alone I find you guilty of treason you be an enemy of Camelot Alvarr you be sentence to death then I die with honour to be an enemy of Camelot be no crime take he you be the criminal

go to your chamber and you Uther you will go to hell be something interesting in there sorry what be the matter it be the crystal it harbour a terrible power Gaius but it be lock away now it can do no harm unless the damage have already be do I hold it I know I should not I know no good would come of it but it compel I to look I could not resist it I see thing terrible thing then you 've already pay the price what I see have not yet come to pass and I be scared Gaius I be really scared of what the future may hold there be nothing on this Earth that can know all possible future even the crystal but what I see it be so real and it be real but it wasone reality the future be as yet unshape it be we that shape it it be you the decision you make the action you take remember that eat your soup before it get cold could I have my sleeping draught I do not think you need it any more last night the nightmare return sleep well please this be not an official visit I would like to see the

legend when the fire of Idirsholas burn the Knights of Medhir will ride again give he some food and a bed for the night take a ride out there why so we can put people 's mind at rest surely this be superstitious nonsense gather the guard and do as I say why be Uther so worried because the Knights of Medhir be a force to be reckon with so you believe the story as well it be more than a story Merlin some 300 year ago seven of Camelot 's knight be seduce by a sorcerer 's call one by one they succumb to her power at her command they become a terrifying and brutal force that ride through the land leave death and destruction in their wake what happen it be only after the sorcerer herself be kill that the Knights of Medhir finally grow still if what Joseph say be true then something have

will find a way to make it light when you heal Arthur I hear you mumble some word an ancient prayer I think it might have be more than that the Old Religion can teach we many thing the Old Religion be that something you be teach it be not something you can learn either it be a part of you or it be not my father know that and his father before he be they also dragonlord we will need some kindling

and fight on our own term on open ground on horseback where we can manoeuvre well there be no point so what we stand here watch Camelot fall you have my blessing I need a dozen Knights those who do not wish to fight can do so without stain on their character for those brave enough to volunteer should know the chance of return be slim what happen I could not save he he say the Dragonlord 's gift be pass from father to son that be true when I face the Great Dragon my magic be useless your father be not dead it be only then you can inherit his power you think I be strong enough to stand up to
