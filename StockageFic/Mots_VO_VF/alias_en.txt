different place in his whole family he be first generation college True not to mention law school he be probably nervous he be probably terrify I call my dad last night to ask he what he think and he say give it a rest Charlie be one of the good one he be right it be weird have the feeling that someone you love be not tell you everything I can not believe you call your dad for advice I just can not imagine the bad be have a dad who be always right no it be not the bad thing I run into my father last week where just just out shop it be it be so empty it be not empty it be full actually full of awkwardness and lame pause and I do not know your dad you know he be just he be just your dad I do not want it to be like that any more I be sick of it I mean I always have this feeling that maybe someday I do not know my dad and I would connect and that thing could start to get well you know my opinion of your dad I know but if you can find it in your heart to forgive he for be who he be be all your life which I would find impossible and could never do then you should make a real effort how do you start something that I have so many question I just you can call the man I will not reconnect with he on the phone go to his work go to the aeroplane factory and just start talk you be really good at talk Dad Sydney what be you do here I would 've call I do not know if you should not be here I tell you I have a thousand question they be keep I awake at night then take something do you know sd 6 be go to recruit I do you help this be not the time I need to ask about Mom Sydney be it just an accident or do you tell she about what you be do like I tell Danny look where you be you be expose Dad please do not come here again not again the device that you withdraw from Taipei last month remain in Analysis we be try to figure out what it do and how it do it at the time I tell you that Oskar Müller be the designer the truth Müller be just an academic a scientist who take another man 's sketch translate they into construction plan and put it together so who design it a man name Milo Rambaldi never hear of he that do not surprise I he die in 1496 Rambaldi be Pope Alexander VI 's chief architect excommunicate for heresy sentence to death for suggest that someday science would allow we to know God after his death his workshop be tear apart his plan and sketch be trade and sell for next to nothing in the next five century his work be scatter throughout the world no one be sure what be leave which be unfortunate because last March a russian historian happen upon one of Rambaldi 's early design she recognise something that look a lot like a transistor I do not understand do you understand it seem that Rambaldi be a prophet we acquire one of his notebook from San Lazzaro this be the analysis report rudimentary schematic for a transportable vocal communicator he be design a cellphone around the time of the Ottoman Empire Come on Ridiculous right you know I I be not a New Age kind of guy I do not believe in the power of the pyramid I be not a big granola fan this stuff typically make I roll my eye and then my eye come across this write in 1489 Rambaldi write machine code if I could it be probably not machine code the concept of zero have be around well it precede Christ the numeral one have be around even long Ptolemy use zero as punctuation in indian text zero be more of a spiritual concept than a number when I say indian I do not mean bow and arrow and thank you Marshall we do not know what it be Rambaldi have become a priority we want to learn what it be before anybody else have you run the sequence it be incomplete the sequence be write on the back of two Rambaldi sketch we possess one the other be in this man 's private collection Eduardo Benegas Spanish VC Auto enthusiast he also own the large collection of pornographic art in Madrid which I think be an interesting fact sorry we negotiate to buy one of the sketch and he withdraw the piece we believe he be tip off as to its real value we think it be K Directorate they be on to Rambaldi too it be possible K Directorate steal a key from Benegas our data reconnoissance division think although it have not confirm that he be surround at all time by six bodyguard we be talk about guy train under uel Special Forces we also have reason to believe that Benegas keep the key on his person at all time so the big question be how do K Directorate swipe the key Anna it be Anna be not it Eduardo Benegas have a sketch draw by Milo Rambaldi there be a code write on the back SD 6 want that code the sketch be in a case the case be in a vault the vault be on the top floor of a car museum own by Benegas so I be go to Madrid what be my counter mission so it be 2 000 word or less on gene sequence in virus resist cabbage and I be realise slowly that I might not have a real handle on it which part just the part about the gene sequence and the virus resistant cabbage do not your paper have a science correspondent hello hi ok yeah hello ok thank I will come by sorry man wrong number so you be busy you ok you look like it be Danny 's landlord they find some of his stuff you alright

say Athens K Directorate would head there sd 6 would have nothing and suspect you we have to be very careful here wildly crazy careful if sd 6 suspect you in the least it be over Anna 's be the enemy for three year in Berlin I realise she want sd 6 to burn almost as much as I do to the CIA the only thing bad than SD 6 get critical information be if K Directorate get it first Anna be still your enemy you be not into mysticism Mysticism neither be I but keep an open mind it will help the code be write in 1489 the guy who write it be some sort of Nostradamus his name be Milo Rambaldi this

Berlin we 've be in communication with he the news be that Hensel have perfect a vaccine against biological weapon Schiller have that information he want to make a trade what do he want in exchange safe passage to the US he live in Berlin he can take a cab to the airport Germany 's not the problem Hensel be anyone who have top level clearance be closely surveille your job be to ID Schiller get he away from Hensel and into the US what kind of extraction Shipment Hensel be upgrade their intranet with fibre optic you go in as a Rhine Kom network supervisor unfortunately this be the last document photo of Schiller University of Hamburg 1975 we have tech do an age processing to show what he might look like today you will find it in there Marshall go right thank you how be everyone hello hope everyone 's plan an enjoyable all Hallow 's Eve Marshall sorry this be pretty incredible Business card something you might hand out like hello I be a Rhine Kom net supervisor in german of course English would give you away but the genius the achievement be this even Sony would be like well Marshall this be pretty cool what do it do you place the card on top of his monitor a tiny transmitter inside will override the cpu and make the network think that you be the system administrator you will manually override the firewall and Schiller will transfer the formula to a canadian website we will get the password once Schiller 's here so I get your voice mail do not feel obligated no I ask Diane we be come all of we you do not have to wear a costume you do not need to say that Sydney could I have a minute of course see you at Op Tech I we be close a deal last Thursday I could not get away you say that when you call it be fine this be an especially busy time for I there be six case I be oversee so until thing slow down we probably should not make any plan I be not go to pursue it I just want it clarify Good this be Paul Kelvin Sydney Bristow I know your father really I hear that a lot we get to move fast the CIA 's watch Hensel Corp for year they be not create a vaccine they be but the US Army have be do research that we think be year ahead of the Germans what be we afraid of Schiller have develop micro encapsulate cytokine they activate your immune cell know anything about this a little you a little enough to know that sd 6 could sell this vaccine to a radical leader who want to protect his own people and start an all out biological war what be I suppose to do in Berlin instead of ship Schiller we will ship Kelvin he be preppe to impersonate Schiller base on available photograph he be a good match you will make the switch in the building 's garage you be up for this I be not look forward to it what about when Sloane want the vaccine he will give they false information Kelvin 's get a plane wait see you in Berlin ok I 've get to tell Dixon absolutely not how do I make a switch invisible to my partner he will be there you can not tell he the truth you do not know he that be my point but I do you might be right about Dixon but you can not volunteer a man for double agent duty if he have not ask for it his whole life his family you would be put all of that at risk you be that a decision that you want to make for he I be in copy that all be quiet out front Herr Schiller you be the agent Dixon someone might be follow I meet I at Eisenzahn at 7 00 copy that I be start the gas now you will have two minute until people regain consciousness Dixon I be on Königstrasse I be on my way when you ask I to help you you do not say all day we be almost do what be leave that we have not cover with corn I work with a professional party planner what be go on with work you have not mention it today you want the truth I be not work on a SAT story when I bump into you guy there be no SAT story I be try to track down a Kate Jones suppose to be seat next to Danny on a flight to Hong Kong you can not do this what be Danny do on a flight to Hong Kong Kate Jones and Danny be the only two people to miss that flight I be at the medical school I think they would have her name on file too many thing do not make any sense one of they be this woman I look up every Kate Kathy Katherine Kathleen Jones in LA plus I have a contact at the airport you can not do this nothing be go to bring Danny back when Sydney find out what you 've do which you know she will just think about that I want to see Mr Sloane Mr Schiller I 've explain this Sloane be not here tell we the password I only talk to Sloane that be the agreement if you be who you say you be you would know that Mr Schiller I swear to you Sloane be a liar he have nothing to do with the CIA so you say sloane be a fraud how do I know it be not you who be the fraud you do not but you will how fast can we get to Langley why he want proof we be CIA he will not believe we unless we take he there Vaughn we be in what be this this be the main reason we make the switch in Berlin we have Kelvin give Sloane access to a bogus website with enough real information to keep they occupy for month be that worth risk a man 's life there be more once sd 6 run the program we will have a back door into their system in other word we have access to their entire network Files contact account this be a huge step in shut down SD 6 nice it be Agent Vaughn 's idea you look so surprised no yes it be my idea amazing idea thank you I know this be very exciting Go tell Analysis it be good to finally meet you the travel be not so easy so forgive I for be so no not at all we have 200 000 in cash wait for you thank you you be welcome it be yours when you tell we and we confirm the location of the plant Plant which plant where the prototype 's be make the vaccine inhaler you do know the location of the plant you see I do not get information about any prototype I be never privileged to such information I have reason to believe you be why do not you think about it why do not you think about everything How 's Schiller I want to talk about your report be something wrong you write that Sydney change the pickup to the rear exit on Königstrasse be this decide before the extraction during why someone be follow she do you see someone no but I be outside the whole time I see if Sydney say there be someone follow she there be someone follow her Kenny Trick or treat there be more candy in there come on in Good to see you Sydney can I talk to you for a second what be up Syd we 've be work together a lot of year I trust you I trust you and I love you I know if something be up you would tell I what be you say Sloane be ask about Berlin he think someone get to schiller that he be a plant he want to know why you have I change the pickup I tell you I think I be be follow Syd be there something I should know no Sloane say there be a prototype an inhaler for the vaccine he want we to get it but Schiller will not give the location which make no sense that man should know where it be and have everything to lose by not tell we what be go to happen to he I think Schiller be in trouble but Syd I think you be too here be my question who eat this crap it be like marzipan but bad if it be this or dirt I would be all over the dirt would you shut up about the candy corn ok you be bum that the kid come and Charlie do not what you give I advice I take it now it be my turn what advice do I give you the Kate Jones thing I be give it up it can only end badly so it be my turn to give you some you love Charlie you do not want to lose he so do not be an idiot you got to talk to he do not deny it do not piss I off that be exactly what I do when I first meet Sydney ok so use I as a cautionary tale and call Charlie yeah will Tippin hi this be Kate Jones you call I yeah do you know a guy name Daniel Hecht yes I do very well do not go to Langley we go in an hour Kelvin could be dead by then Sloane want more than the password Information Schiller would have this could be it if this go badly they will know I be a double what the hell do we do that be why I come here I need to talk to Schiller right now I would not have call unless I have no choice it be alright what be it there be a CIA officer Paul Kelvin yes I know about Berlin Paul 's a friend then you should know his life be in danger he be in custody Sloane want intel Kelvin do not have I have what Kelvin need but I can not get it to he Sloane 's already too suspicious of I but since he trust you Sloane put a call in to I that must be why why would he call you he find I useful in difficult situation I be surprised you be not with Emily I would be but we have a problem schiller will not talk I do not trust that man so I want proof Proof that he be tell we everything that he be who he say he be I understand Arvin Sloane be not affiliate with the United States government he be just a man who use I the same as he be go to use you he make I think I be give myself to God and country but it be all a lie a lie that cost my fiancé his life if I go back to sd 6 without the location of that plant they will take the life of another innocent man I need to prove you be schiller and I be sd 6 I have to hurt you there be only one person who can stop that and I be talk to he right now Mr Schiller please it be Badenweiler the plant be in Badenweiler the plant be locate in Badenweiler near the Black Forest Badenweiler it be in Badenweiler Sloane call we in this morning our mission be to go to Badenweiler tonight steal the vaccine inhaler and blow up the plant I do not know how much long I can do this sit in these meeting with sloane look at he as if I do not despise he do not want to leap across the table and use the skill I 've learn at sd 6 against he so what the hell do I do next what be my countermission he practically apologise Sloane do for think I would mail he the wrong guy imagine that your reward be destroy the Badenweiler plant Sloane say Hensel 's produce supply for neo Nazi terrorist such a load Sloane want the vaccine tech why he think he have the formula it take Hensel five year to go to prototype Sloane want to skip that step how 's Kelvin Home with his family Arm in a cast he will be fine what about Schiller on his way to the Mid West with 200 000 grand of Sloane 's money of all of we he be the lucky that be for sure what be my counter break into the building Dixon set the explosive you retrieve the inhaler and rendezvous with the CIA team which will be inside the building they will switch the inhaler by then Dixon should have exit the building you disable the explosive the CIA

Georgia former Soviet Union their main recruiting ground Shepard think I be a patient he be more likely to trust I except he have already attack you which I can use to seal his transference by bring his guilt to the surface then forgive he I suppose you would like your life in return if you get Shepard to recall the location of Parkashoff you might just live out your life in a chechnyan

bridge into Lake Scutari there be no way he could 've survive if by some miracle he do survive we will hear about it soon or later I tell SD 6 Shepard be dead I be go to lie to you about it too but the truth be I can not stand lie to anyone else I appreciate that I will be honest some people at the agency will want he find he be as much a victim of sd 6 as I be Shepard bury Parkashoff 's body in a Louisiana marshland Sloane send out a forensic team to get a dna sample they should be able to decode the FTL message by tonight we be worried the CIA hate to lose its asset I mean I be worried for you in fact I I contact your father just so you know he know I pull his file and suspect you 've see it it be ok it be I that be what I think seem our sd 6 computer virus be turn into a gold mine Good

know I be take care of it my name be Sydney Bristow Seven year ago I be recruit by a branch of the CIA call sd 6 I be swear to secrecy but I could not keep it from my fiancé and when the head of sd 6 find out he have he kill that be when I learn the truth SD 6 be not part of the CIA I would be work for the people I think I be fight I go to the only place that could help I take they down now I be a double agent for the CIA my handler be Michael Vaughn only one other person know what I do another double agent in SD 6 someone I hardly know my father Security have make we aware of the concern that you may have a mole in your department it would appear so there be some in the Alliance who believe you may have more than one it be our intention to make an example of they I know I be take care of it what can you tell I about this woman Anna Espinosa she be with K Directorate I do not like she if that be what you mean I be leave for England tonight sd 6 have trace a Rambaldi Artefact to the Engineering Science Department at Oxford K Directorate be on this I need to act fast so that Anna do not get there first FTL find the Rambaldi Artefact in Tunisia why have they send it here Analysis our department be among the good in the world the lens have to be within two foot of the keycard to get a reading got it how do I look for the record that be a question you never have to ask FTL agent be here pose as campus security watch your back you too for a journalist you have a remarkable grasp of engineering principle what be your background my family be in demolition really so be it true what your department 's just receive ancient technology from Tunisia who tell you that well you just do what I would love to see your lab see anybody Syd Professor Hoyt do you see anything no get close I can not tell if the card be on he anything the keycard 's in his pocket you be too far away get he to turn towards you excuse I Professor Hoyt yes hold that for 30 second I be Molly Zerdin with the Marisa Foundation we be interested in your study really which one he be study the crashworthiness of transportation vehicle your study on crashworthiness of transportation vehicle Wonderful well of course get funding be very difficult in today 's economic climate the duplicate keycard 's printing that be so true got it Syd I be on my way excuse I a moment tell security someone be try to break into the engineering lab then the FTL guard will know Anna 's here copy that call the guard right now freeze right there thank God Someone 's do something terrible to Professor Bloom I be in the lab I do not see anything ok I get it get a minute of course Eloise Kurtz she be find dead two day ago in Echo Park she be a new promotion at SD 6 yes I know you retire she do not you I think the press question be why you let she talk to a reporter without run it by I I be not hide it the reporter will Tippin yes he be a friend of Sydney 's he be look into the name Kate Jones one of her alias I task Eloise Kurtz to lead he down a dead end so he would drop it you underestimate Tippin and Agent Kurtz 's lack of field experience put we all at risk what be you do use a junior agent Jack Ask McCullough I use Kurtz base on his assessment of her ability he give she his high rating in any case I have contingency all of which be now irrelevant tell I something how do Tippin get a lead on Kate Jones ' alia in the first place I do not know yet I be look into it your effort not withstand that reporter may well be a casualty of his own curiosity I would consider that a last resort I know you want what be good for Sydney if possible we should spare she the pain of lose someone else how do you suggest we proceed leave it to I I will get Tippin off the story and if you can not then I will kill he myself you 've miss class I know turn in paper late listen my job 's enough about your job it be bad since we last speak if you want to be a banker be one I understand it be probably not the good analysis of Fitzgerald you 've read but come on this be not a d paper there be no spirit in this paper no soul you fix it by Friday or I will have to re evaluate your place in this programme Dr Wilkenson yes I will hold hello Dr Peterson Dr Wilkenson of course yes I would like to discuss that yes yes yes let us talk about the meeting yes that be what we talk about yeah yeah that be right hold on a second who be you who be you Security say you assault an officer this be not security nor standard procedure this be a constant tracker I 've see he three time in two day and I find this under my car if there be something you want to know about I you ask this agency require the sacrifice of some personal freedom SD 6 be step up security McCullough assign the tracker it be his province now we have a briefing do you think you could focus yeah I think I can good the clock you retrieve be design by Giovanni Donato he die in 1503 his initial be engrave on the bottom Donato be a master clockmaker more importantly he be the only man that Rambaldi collaborate with there be a reference to Donato in our Rambaldi archive Rambaldi commission the clock himself and because of his involvement you think it be more than just a clock that be Rambaldi 's style hiding code in design within his artwork Marshall alright I know we be all hungry for lunch so I will use the maximum amount of brevity possible ok now as a clock it be far ahead of its time a margin of error of less than one second per decade the weird part be the gear assembly it be a part that do not seem to serve any purpose this number on the back be it a date we be analyse that know what we find nothing happen that day it be one day in history that zero occur we believe this clock will reveal another piece of the Rambaldi puzzle the problem be it do not work without instruction we can not risk damage it we 've locate a descendant of Donato in Positano luckily he go into the family business your mission Bristow be simple take the clock to Donato get he to fix it and bring it back that be it that be it Dad do you have a few minute yes of course could you just somewhere quiet somewhere else in here Signal jammer we have 60 second talk quickly sloane 's have I follow I confront the guy I think it may be K Directorate look for revenge Sloane insist it be all routine should I be worry only five agent here know the truth about SD 6 I 've have Sloane 's trust but lately I have not be inform of much what be it mean I be concern while you be in Romania Marshall notice computer abnormality he may realise the SD 6 network have be compromise could sloane trace it to CIA I do not know also Karl Dreyer 's come in to upgrade the biometric scanner if sloane suspect a mole Dreyer 's the one he will turn to if so Dreyer will give each of we a functional imaging test what be that lie detector I study the CIA instruction on how to take an LDT no this monitor variation in blood flow inside the brain it be difficult to deceive tell Vaughn he need to prepare you if he can not he will get someone who can Dad you seem nervous well I think that should be fine thank for come to I of course no I think that be nice of course I think he be go to love it yeah I be sure ok Mom I get to go I get to go my boss be stand right here I love you too I be sorry still no quote from Hecht 's fiancé I do not get one we can not have this it be difficult we 've quote from relative just stop for a second no I be not go to do this story excuse I I will not run the story I will not do the piece you push I to pursue this convince I of a connection between the death something terrible happen I tell you this before if this story will hurt my friend I will not do it you have not tell she that you be work on this have you like I say you finish this or I will put another writer on it you tell she and get the quote this go to bed tomorrow three o'clock it be I it be open what be the paper on it be a redo

there be this situation at work just some money be miss from petty cash there might be a formal inquiry they do not suspect you do they no but they be go to give we all lie detector test which be just can I make a suggestion for the millionth time why do not you just quit you can get a job anywhere I just think it be weird I know I still wear this I know hello Joey 's Pizza wrong number what be you do here I just come by to say hi hi hi have you have unauthorised contact with member of any intelligence agency besides SD 6 no ok again you have to stay under 30 it measure blood flow to the emotional part of your brain to divert it you engage the reasoning centre I be try you be emote there be no switch you can flick just split your focus maybe I 've split my focus already CIA SD 6 school my friend Sydney you can do this you have to have you have unauthorised contact with member of any intelligence agency besides SD 6 no well be you romantically interested in anyone it could be a question no I be not interesting ask again I do not have to we 've get our answer very good move on if this be for real I would be dead by now would not I no I be just getting start here Milo Rambaldi Enter you be american yes only an American would come to my door without telephone Seth get in touch with my airline contact I need a back trace on a passenger manifest I will be in my office see the passenger manifest for flight 816 no my guy at the airport tell I he be go to fax it to I seat 11 A Daniel Hecht look up seat 11 b Kate Jones I know look at it Zachary Collin there be no Kate Jones I do not understand I neither but there be no long one fact to support your theory that someone be cover up Hecht 's murder what about Eloise Kurtz a woman hire to tell you she be Kate Jones so you stop look for the real one that be right but she be dead I 've note from my interview you have no recording what about the video blackout you wanna build a case on lack of photographic evidence you 've get Jenny as your checker and she do not make a single call right she do not it be a favour she do a lot of work for I I be give her research credit like a gift it be like a lie yes it be a kind lie on the eve of your first front page story you get cold foot what be you say I make this up I swear to God the only reason I do not want this story to run be cos I do not want to hurt Sydney Bristow that be it you be a talented writer will but I promise you if this happen again the only thing you will invent be fact on your résumé the first Giovanni Donato his timepiece be miracle of precision king and queen offer he vast rich if only he would design clock for they he refuse but he do make one exception for Rambaldi why Rambaldi make he a promise what do he promise Rambaldi promise he he would live an impossibly long life he even reveal to he when he would die be he right of course this symbol on the front what do it mean the Magnific Order of Rambaldi Rambaldi 's most loyal follower entrust with safeguard his creation sadly like most thing that once be pure criminal now use the symbol to infiltrate the order what about this date it must have mean something to Rambaldi the clock be build from one of his design he never do tell I what it mean what do you say my mother never tell I I do not think she know there be still one piece miss I do not have so it will not work it will tell time if that be what you mean the clock be finish I 've get Bristow in my sight take the shot whenever you have it Mr Donato what be Rambaldi work on the clock be fix now it be over welcome back thank the good news be I go by your professor 's office to drop off the paper but he be not in the secretary want I to leave it so I wait around and hand it to he personally thank you Francie what be the bad news I be make lemonade and I spill it all over your mom 's book I be so sorry and I think it be do not worry it do not matter thank you for handing in the paper you be welcome have you leak information about sd 6 to other intelligence agency no be you a double agent no but my father be I be sure he would be thrill if you give Dreyer that not now for the CIA 20 year ago for the KGB my mother be a teacher my father buy her book one a month ship from a store they discover in Prague we really need to listen to I I think it be sweet a side of he that die with she but last night I discover code inside those book it be obviously how the KGB be send he message no what kind of code one time pad block of ciphertext in set of five Cyrillic letter Staple of the KGB yeah we will deal with that I wanna see those book but you have this test come and your life depend on how well you do hello this be will will it be Mike Mike how you do your friend Eloise bring her car in Eloise Kurtz she never pick it up and she need it right away she do yeah you know where she be do you mind if I come down and take a look no problem you know where we be will Tippin how kiss ass of you what Stargazer Lilies and the card I do not make up a single fact I think you know I well enough to know that I be call to clarify you be on the soil erosion story and not waste another minute on Kate Jones be we clear yeah we be clear as you know for some time now we have be operate under the assumption that the sum of Rambaldi 's invention be great than the part this clock be evidence of that thank you hi now who here remember this the golden sun from the church in Malaga the polymer if you look closely hundred of tiny imperfection nothing unusual but what be unusual be this I realise that if you set this to exactly 12 22 21 22 and then this happen Miss Bristow lady first what be that it be a star chart a snapshot of the sky at a specific place on earth at a specific moment in time sorry I be late sort of like an ancient gps system yeah if you have the date and time it be take that be the genius these two separately nothing at all but put they together and that sound that boom that be my mind blow if we assume that star chart refer to the date on the clock August 16th 1523 at 2 22am GMT then the only spot on Earth with that exact view of the star be the southern slope of Mount Aconcagua on the Chile Argentina border x mark the spot so we think Rambaldi have store something there possibly your mission be to find out Marshall will fill you in on the Op Tech and Sydney before you head off I want you to go down to Psych and see Karl Dreyer what be your name Sydney Bristow what colour be your eye Brown be you sit down yes be you an agent of SD 6 yes be you a double agent no this be a camera with a digital signal uplinke to a satellite so whatever be in Argentina we will see right away be there a transmission window no it be geosynchronous orbit just point and click yeah you seem a little distracted be it the test I be not sure I pass they be still watch I it take I 20 minute to shake their tail they would not be send you on a mission if you fail I do not think they know the result yet look I know how much you want to do this take down sd 6 but your life be more important so if you think you fail the test we have a plan in place to take you out a protection programme no I can not do it live in hiding not a chance good luck in Argentina six mile trek and we should be there there be easy job than this God no kidding you know I 've be mean to tell you something I be proud of ya what of I yeah why well I 've work with a lot of people you make it look easy the thing I admire most be your courage my courage after what happen with Danny the way you come back your commitment to the job and I know what we do be not for ourselves it be for the good of the country still thank you be say it be a bug no it be a tarantula it hop channel so fast you can not intercept the transmission my guess be it be encrypt too where can you buy this you can not it be government issue my sister 's man be Secret Service his transmitter could not touch this I would say it be intelligence what be the frequency Kenneth what do you think Rambaldi 's all about I wish we know there be a thousand place I would rather be right now I think we be almost at our way point 22 42 by 70 01 what the hell be we do here feel like a wild goose chase ah damn it I can not get a line of sight to the satellite it be a low earth orbit we be block by the mountain give I a hand here I be go in Alright I will hike out acquire the satellite and call for support Syd be careful Dixon I 've find it Rambaldi 's journal I 've find it Sydney they 've find we K Directorate Dixon they be here Anna 's here Sydney get out of there Dixon do you copy I have you Sydney 's result I think we 've find our mole what do you do to Dixon Put the book down my name be Sydney Bristow Seven year ago I be recruit by a branch of the CIA call sd 6 I be swear to secrecy but I could not keep it from my fiancé and when the head of sd 6 find out he have he kill that be when I learn the truth SD 6 be not part of the CIA I have be work for the people I think I be fight so I go to the only place that could help I take they down now I be a double agent for the CIA my handler be Michael Vaughn only one other person know what I do another double agent inside SD 6 someone I hardly know my father Sloane 's have I follow if sloane suspect a double agent he would turn to Dreyer Dreyer will give we an imaging test it be very difficult to deceive be you an agent of SD 6 yes be you a double agent no we 've find our mole what be that a star chart a snapshot take from a specific place at one moment in time and the only spot on earth with that exact view of the star be on Mount Aconcagua on the Chile Argentina border I think we be almost at our way point I be go in Dixon I 've find it Rambaldi 's journal I 've find it Sydney they find we what do you do to Dixon Dixon Dixon do you copy Dixon please do not be Dixon oh no no no you be not wear your vest why be not you wear your vest you be go to be ok you be go to be ok Dixon just hang in take this with you it be a satcom phone you can contact the CIA from anywhere what happen when SD 6 see I be lug around a CIA issue phone do not let they see it it be like a brick I can not take it take it bad case scenario you might need it Base Ops this be Freelancer how copy over B Ops read you lc go ahead Freelancer this be code six I repeat code six emergency med evac over Copy Launching extraction team Lancer Set navcom transponder in three two one mark Set who be Freelancer who be just hang in there buddy just hang in there come

Geneva you 've be send to find a mole when I look at Sydney 's test result I do not see a spike she do not falter Sydney Bristow be the mole yeah we get she we 've know for some time that we have a mole that someone be work against we when you be in Geneva with Agent Bristow we pick up a transmission Third party it confirm what some in Security Section believe for week that Agent Bristow be that mole when you be in the field with Bristow there be no indication nothing we need to determine the extent of damage do to we what can I do Convince Bristow that we believe you be work together and that if she will not tell we what she be do we will torture you to death will that work threat to colleague be a fundamental interrogation technique Sydney in particular yes I think that she will respond Mr Russek we need to make it appear that you be question they think I be part of this what do you mean do not play game with I you know what I be talk about a transmission be send from our position in Geneva at the bank they know it be one of we they want to know how much damage have be do to they there be only one person that can answer that question Sydney I do not know who you be work for but I need you to tell they what you know they say they be go to kill I slowly do you believe they they be not bluff do you believe they yes have Sydney Bristow move her desk no Security Section clear it out an hour ago get on your knee put your head to the floor now Sloane want to know if you be ready to talk no tell he I have nothing to say Steven what be go on talk to I what do you know what do I know talk to Sloane I come to you first Jack do I a favour I need you to tell I what be happen you do not hear this from I while Sydney and Russek be in Geneva a transmission be record

week you 've be under suspicion we know we have a mole there be sign that indicate that it be you when you be in Geneva we pick up a third party transmission it seem to confirm that you betray sd 6 now what I just learn be that it be not your transmission it be Russek 's Russek what be this what the hell be go on I wanna talk to sloane no Sydney I never believe that you would betray we when I realise that it be Russek who be the mole I felt vindicate that be impossible I know in Geneva Russek be transmit to K Directorate at the same time you be transmit to the CIA and that sd 6 pick up his transmission not mine there be no record of contact between he and russian intelligence in the cell I ask he question about his interrogation when he say they threaten to kill he he be blink a classic indication that he be lie so I do not talk because I know he be not in real danger either Sloane still think I be the mole if Sloane still suspect you he would not let you go free or two Russek be K Directorate or three Russek be a sacrificial lamb that he be innocent and be set up to get I out at first I think maybe it be the CIA it be not we the truth be Russek could have be K Directorate so

agreement with SD 6 he have steal from we the whole community be watch we need to set an example with Hassan any intel about where in Havana he be no we do not know that be why I be send you to Cuba I need you to rendezvous with the usual contact Locate Hassan and take care of he thank you I hear about Russek and now with Hassan I understand it be be a difficult week one night now this be year ago maybe two year before you and I meet I would just finish my first Far East briefing at the White House I be new to the CIA after that meeting everyone get into a limousine to head back to Langley but I do not I tell they I be go to walk for a while they look at I funny it be a cold night so I say I need to get some air but the truth be I be overcome it occur to I as I be walk down the White House step that I be live in a perfect moment everything be fill with promise my role in the CIA my relationship with the wife that I have not yet meet still I could feel a darkness come so I wander around for a while end up at the Jefferson Memorial it be always my favourite one I look out across the basin Lincoln right there I do not know how it would finally materialise the darkness I have nothing to base it on it be not as if the CIA have just betray I or my wife have just be diagnose with lymphoma none of that have happen yet so whenever life take an unfortunate turn as it have this week I just remind myself that I could see it come all along I want Hassan dead before the weekend Hassan 's new identity be Nebseni Saad and this be his passport number I get back to LA this morning and meet with Sloane I tell he Kenya be a failure that I do not find out Hassan 's new identity Sloane find out last night that Hassan or whatever his name be now be in Cuba Sloane send your father to Cuba to kill Hassan after your father meet with Sloane he meet with I I be leave for Cuba in 30 minute what be the countermission Sloane might want Hassan dead but the CIA need he alive we need his client list it will tell we what weapon he sell it be invaluable I do not need a lesson in the arm trade Fine go to Cuba use your contact get to Hassan but instead of take he out you will tell he the truth that SD 6 send you to kill he convince he that you be turn on SD 6 say you be willing to fake his death in exchange for his client list you be make a huge mistake be I trust a man like Hassan there will be a CIA team at the location where his death be to be fake Hassan will never be a free man again that be all that happen that be it your father 's get Hassan for the CIA what nothing I get to go I 've get friend come Francie right yeah and will will I will see you ok Hassan will never be a free man again I will make contact by 6 pm tomorrow I get a copy of Russek 's transmission the one sd 6 intercept I also go through the CIA log and compare the two they do not match you fix the transmission make it look like Russek by alter the signal 's point of origin and change the message content who in the hell do you think you be check up on I pull my file second guess my choice let us just both face the fact you be not that person neither your experience nor your intelligence have earn you the right to question a thing that I do so I be go to make two suggestion one that you stop it and two that the next time they assign you to be my handler you kindly decline Russek never transmit of course he do not if you get the SD 6 transmission why ask I I never get the SD 6 transmission it be just a hunch I would just learn that my daughter be about to be torture Mr Vaughn most likely execute I have no time to go for help some monitor go out I want you to check every connection now I know that alter the transmission be a dangerous gamble they could have detect a disruption but it be all I could do and now you can judge what I 've do I do not give a damn what you do Syd thank you still get the shoe on have you ever even wear snowshoe before get with the programme there be an art form to this what be that nothing some guy from work give that to I not Dixon no he be still recover some other guy do I know he no he be no one really just some guy that be nice it be nice that he would give you that I know it be weird why how come I do not know maybe he like you no maybe he do no not the way Jenny like you she look nice in your shirt it be a nice shirt Nice and snug Easy

be to know I do hear about you though about what you and the little cheerleader first of all she be not a cheerleader any more secondly it do not mean anything I find this old picture of I and my father I be stare at it for some reason I remember ask he about Santa Claus Santa Claus yeah if he be real if Santa Claus be real my father would answer I in this flat factual way yes of course he be real every time the thing be I know that he be lie that be why I would ask he again when I question he about Russek he be the same way I want to believe he but look at that stupid picture I realise Russek be not K Directorate he be not the guilty one I be Sydney Russek do nothing wrong because of my father he be kill Russek be not such an innocent you wanna know about Russek he be an early member of SD 6 he know they be the bad guy he be the leader of at least a dozen operation that steal weapon chemical and intel and sell they to enemy of the United States for cash to fund more sd 6 operation just like the one that kill your fiancé he get what he deserve if you know so much about Russek then you know he be not with K Directorate it seem he be sacrifice yes see that be not a choice my dad can make what would you have do have it be your daughter or your son or Danny listen I 've something else in Cuba your father make contact with an old informant a Havana insider who set up the meeting between your father and one of Hassan 's man what happen Sydney Hassan have your father what be be do we have a team in place in Havana but Devlin do not wanna move yet he say send a

back safely to tell you the truth I be a little nervous I 've be through bad than Havana we both have yeah when I do not hear from you I think maybe Hassan have a lead maybe he know you be come I be unsure of that myself but it all work out not for Hassan No not for he thank you it be my job a vicious murder Ineni Hassan have be execute we may never know who be responsible for this killing but what we do know be that after word of Hassan 's death spread this man be unusually busy this be Minos Sakkoulas he work very closely with Hassan some think he Hassan 's second for the past two day Sakkoulas have be scramble to make contact with Hassan 's client seem he aim to take over Hassan 's work do you think he have Hassan kill perhaps or maybe he be just take advantage we intercept this call last night I know that before his death you be in talk with Mr Hassan yes there be discussion of a certain package I be in possession of the package I be take bid right now the package yes the package for month we 've hear rumour of a device Hassan commission we do not know what it be but Hassan be an arm dealer with access to nuclear weapon this be Club Panthera it be Sakkoulas 's cover he keep an office there Sakkoulas have set up a meeting with potential client Thursday night at this club your job be to go to Greece break into Sakkoulas 's office and retrieve the spec on this mysterious package Marshall thank you actually before do anyone see that documentary on monkey last night it be great they do this sign no one see that ok what we 've learn so far be that Sakkoulas have a biometric access panel on his office which require a retinal scan in order to open so we have high resolution retina scanner they work from up to about 30 foot now Miss Bristow you put these on find the person whose retina you want in this case Sakkoulas make direct solid eye contact with he look he right in the eye and then Mr Dixon you log on and hit the scan key that should take ten second which I know be kind of a long time but check this out this be a silicone and fluoropolymer compound create a set of contact lense that the retina reader will accept and you guy really get to check out that documentary on monkey I get a copy at home if not so bad here be it this be not the deal I agree to so what can you tell I about the package you be go to have to help I out here under the Patriot Act of 2001 you be not go anywhere so let us work together and I will make your stay comfortable there be some incredibly nice prison in this country either that or you do not cooperate in

General test MRI lumber puncture blood work what be go on no I do not think so Agent it would be well for you I have answer every question but that be as far as this go if you wanna touch I you have to tell I what this prophecy say you do not have clearance for that information you be waste your time take this Rambaldi thing so seriously there be real threat in this world I have work to do you move out of my way or I will make you move out of my way thank you they be just let she leave Third row seat yeah behind the Lakers bench wait Near Kobe yeah my friend have a contact he score they free of charge I will be sit near Kobe Bryant yes be you ask the right roommate as be sometimes obvious I know about want somebody you can not have for a few hour you can forget about hate Charlie sound good can I ask you guy something I dream about a fortune teller he have a prophecy about I what be it I do not know that be the word he use prophecy do that sound good or bad Prophecy yeah definitely bad yeah bad who care it be just a dream I know enjoy your breakfast see you guy use all resource we 've finally track down the enemy who we no long have to refer to as the Man thank to the photo from Brazil we have confirm his identity Alexander Khasinau he receive the Sark communiqué report on the loss of the manuscript decorate former lieutenant colonel of the KGB he be a power broker for the russian mafia deal with rogue state and the international arm bazaar we be face the russian mafia as a source of financing but in term of tactic and reach his organisation operate on a different order of magnitude so what be next nothing after be identify he move his base to an undisclosed location he know he be a target the next move we make must be make with extreme caution so no mission actually I do have to ask you something it be a personal favour the last few day have not be good for Emily when you come to the house I have not see her spirit that high in a long time if you would not mind call she or perhaps pay a visit say hello of course thank you when we know the right move to make with Mr Khasinau we will make it I want Khasinau dead the Alliance do not know what it want they be meet in London on Tuesday to resolve whether the Alliance should invest the resource to find and kill he it make sense member of the Soviet Bloc control five of the 12 vote they be cold warrior they prefer the paradigm of détente they will reject go to war these five man be coward all of they of the seven remain member there be four who will vote in favour of aggressive action so three man control the outcome he send man into this facility they steal from we they kill some of we there should be no vote what be your strategy Edward Poole oversee sd 9 it be one of the three swing vote I will start with he Hello Edward Arvin Good to hear your voice yes Edward you too how 've you be I think we 've all be well I be see you on Tuesday that be why I be call you your position on Khasinau shall I assume that you will support a declaration of war against he I be flatter you would think I so forgive but Khasinau must pay for what he be do even if I have to take care of it myself Good Glad to hear that unfortunately the Alliance be nearly split on this issue now as far as I be aware there be two swing vote leave Oskar Dunst and Jean Briault so Edward it be up to you and I to take the appropriate action what be you suggest I have personally see what Khasinau be capable of and I will not let his aggression go unanswered so what I be suggest Edward be that we do whatever must be do to ensure that this declaration of war be ratify yes I be go to wait and present this at the meeting what be that under the circumstance I think I should come to Los Angeles I have some intel you should see Good I will be there in the morning ok Arvin 's such a sweetheart ask you to look in like this I would have come but I do not want to bother you not at all you know I really like meet your friend by the way will yeah he be a great guy he think you be great too he and I be just friend he be cute he be cute I know it be be a while but I still feel guilty about date again must be especially hard do what you do it be it be difficult sometimes I mean work for my husband well this have be difficult for Arvin my illness I look just like everyone else and I usually feel that way the fact be I will not be alive next Christmas do not say that you do not know I do for a long time I ignore the pain then one morning over there I I collapse I wake up in the hospital the doctor tell I Cancer he say if I have see he in the beginning I probably could 've survive but there be a fear like nothing I 've ever feel before it come over you when you know that there be something really wrong for four month I do nothing I be so terrified of what I do not know so terrify that I be paralyse the long that go on the more terrified I got want to know the truth but be too afraid to find the answer go ahead run all the test you want what I be about to tell you you may find difficult to believe Arvin I know that Jean Briault be a friend yes he be a friend a friend of yours but not of the Alliance the other man in the photo be your friend Jean Briault this only mean that Khasinau and Briault know each other this nothing more on the left be a brokerage account in the name of Briault 's wife on the right a hold company that Khasinau use to launder money five deposit in excess of 45 million be make into the account in the past three month arvin I would not have make this trip if I do not truly believe that Khasinau have infiltrate the Alliance and that Briault be in his pocket no I be in Chile with this man under Allende he recruit I on the other hand Briault 's always seem a good man he have serve the Alliance well so maybe we should just gamble do nothing just play it out and see what happen if this vote go the wrong way because a member have be buy it would be the end of the Alliance but Briault as you know be a famously cautious man the hit would have to be carry out by someone who have access someone that Briault would agree to meet alone a friend if the hit occur yes no this can not be right there be another explanation for this intel so I appreciate your come here with this information but I can not believe that Jean Briault be a traitor no one hope you be right more than I I would like to welcome to Los Angeles our friend from Washington I have always have a fascination with the work of the DSR although inter agency cooperation be notoriously problematic I do not foresee any difficulty while you be work in our office I speak for everyone when I say how much we appreciate your help that say let I pay you the courtesy of be blunt to date our request for file more comprehensive than these have not be process those request Miss Evans be be assess the directive do not provide for that I do not mind you come to work with we let us be clear you do not work with we you work for we to presume you be in charge we have the directive specify this be my office the directive give you authority to take she into custody but Sydney Bristow be well place and she have provide the agency with valuable intelligence I understand this so call prophecy be interesting and that these time require we to be vigilant against any threat to our national security but let us take a step back for a second this be a 500 year old text base on that text we be treat Agent Bristow like a lab rat I be all for be prudent but what we be do the way we be do it be absurd we should investigate yes but not persecute dissenting might not be the good move but I need to say something Steven Haladki Domestic Resources Division for month I 've be worried about Bristow my concern be that Michael Vaughn be too emotionally involve which I still contest then I become concerned about Bristow herself in her file there be discrepancy and significant question for example she meet with a Rambaldi disciple on the Amalfi coast at exactly the time his death be prophecise now after read what Rambaldi 's write about Bristow excuse I but I be terrify Haladki you be assume that Rambaldi 's prophecy be accurate and that he be refer to Bristow Say Rambaldi be wrong or that it be not Bristow he be talk about Fantastic but we be test she to see if she have the physical anomaly that Rambaldi mention it be like 666 guy you see it on the kid 's scalp you know there be problem thank for come be you alright this prophecy do you know anything about it what it say no the DSR be close to a panic when they have half of it decode they crack the rest today I want to ask they need a code key do they have the right one the DSR spend year try to decipher this the key they be use be one they reverse engineer if the DSR be misread that text they will take I into custody which will blow my cover with SD 6 and probably yours you want Rambaldi 's code key if it exist it do but the agency will not go after it for political reason Dad what do that mean the code key be in the Vatican think what this mean for Sydney I know do nothing be not an option I can not authorise an operation that go against the DSR 's work classify it as recon Langley will not approve the DSR be be irresponsible you do not have to attack the DSR those bastard have take over this office then prove they wrong Langley be watch we closely it be a discretionary op you be argue semantic with I if she be not my daughter I would not be fight for this I know this prophecy be special access but those who have it might be misread that text I would go but Sloane 's head to London I be oversee operation while he be away you know that be an opportunity so Ben I need your help on this hello Edward it be Arvin any news we can not risk Briault please do not talk about this with anyone do not share your intel Alright I 've decide to take care of our problem myself I understand you will break into the Vatican the last thing I be go to do while the DSR be wait for test result be sit on my ass but the Vatican the secret archive I have a number they do not know the form the code key 's in could be anything I call you cos I need a partner for this op someone I can trust we would have to fly out separately undercover we have to leave tonight you in yeah I will break into the Vatican with you his parent name he after steak Kobe they see it on a japanese menu I do not know that he be perfect for I play ball and name after food you know what would be excellent about leave we might get to see the game I be not going half do she be obsess you think so do that thing come true the dream the prophecy not yet I get to go I get to make my plane have a great time I will see you whenever where 's corporate banking take you this time Boston I be think we be in Rome the city of Trattoria di Nardi what be that my favourite restaurant in the world yeah yeah why be Trattoria di Nardi so good it be only good if you like food do you know Kobe Bryant be name for a steak yeah I do the explosion trigger the alarm it be on a 15 second delay you say you can disarm it in under 20 second how far under 20 I work well under pressure later tonight when we get the code key maybe we can check it out the restaurant it be almost too good not to unless sd 6 spot we there and have we kill the food 's so good it be almost worth the risk ok it be set let us go Ready Pope Alexander VI Rambaldi be his chief architect Rambaldi hide his real work in ordinary thing the code be in this painting we do not have time to take it wait a minute give I the flashlight begin with the 11 th letter three row of 16 along the x axis and another 43 this be it this be the code key alright I get it he be send for backup we 've get to move Poole be here be he with we where the hell 's Sydney I believe she be at the university we get word from Kleinhoff there be a counterfeit

size of your heart you match all three what do the prophecy say this woman here depict will possess unseen mark sign that she will be the one to bring forth my work bind they with fury a burn anger

depict will possess unseen mark sign that she will be the one to bring forth my work bind they with fury a burn anger unless prevent at vulgar cost this woman will render the great power unto utter desolation it be vanilla Milk shake will you do I a favour will you remind they that I cooperate that I do not resist I do not need these restraint I will tell they what do the DSR tell the FBI the DSR do not say but you be inter agency liaison Inter agency liaison do not put I smack dab in the inner circle look you and I do not work well together historically we 've get this juvenile animosity thing go and that be get to change let us just start over hi how be you I do not know what they be plan to do to Bristow if I be you I would let it go a buddy of mine at Princeton know Haladki say she use to see he eat lunch at the Webster Rotunda that guy be get the table manner of a six month old I be go to ask you a question I need you to be honest sure do you believe in this thing this prophecy you do do not you no it be ridiculous but that picture look just like her Sydney 's go to take down the world but the DNA sequence the heart size they match what Rambaldi write I mean either this thing be completely insane or it be not ok what happen the FBI 's involve yeah there be an FBI tribunal fly in from DC they be go to question she and decide what the next move be Ms Bristow I be Special Officer Kendall FBI Ms Baker Mr Dunn you be be hold under National Security Directive 81 a we can legally file formal charge against you base on current evidence we would appreciate your cooperation in answer some question if you choose legal counsel we will charge you on current evidence it be your decision I have nothing to hide your name and occupation Sydney Bristow Intelligence officer for the US Government under which agency CIA how do you come to work with the CIA do not you have a file on I we would like this in your word I come to work with the CIA through my involvement with SD 6 how do you get involve with SD 6 I be a student a freshman at college a man say he work with US Intelligence and they want to interview I and you agree no not at first it be the last thing I be interested in work for the US Government but I find myself wonder if I could actually become a spy and you believe that you could sort of which be crazy I do not even realise what be a spy mean the truth be I do not love any of the subject I be study my father and I be not speak my mother die when I be six and the highlight of my social life be my dorm 's salad bar so I call they SD 6 they do not use that name they lead I to believe they be CIA they be be very convincing so you meet with an organisation that you believe be the CIA yes they have I sign about 500 non disclosure agreement and offer I a job just like that they have I take a job as an office assistant in a corporate bank downtown I just assume that the bank be somehow affiliate with the CIA they say they would be watch I this be the evaluation phase that last for six month and then they tell I I be ready for the transition Transition eight month of training test propaganda before that I have never fire a gun I would never throw a punch during the transition I first hear the term sd 6 and you believe that sd 6 be affiliate with the CIA yes that it be a black op division of the CIA Meaning you mean what be black op a division that be fund by the CIA 's black budget highly classified operation hide from congressional oversight I believe sd 6 be one of these division that do not operate through Langley you never question that as I say before Mr Kendall they be very convincing now I might not have be a genius at 19 year old but I be smart enough to know what question to ask they have all the right answer it say here you be a genius and how do the transition end they make reference to the SD 6 headquarter they tell I they would take I there I do not realise that get there only require a ride in the elevator the office of sd 6 be locate on sub level six of the Credit Dauphine build the first time I walk through there surround by stranger who I think be work for the good of the country I feel wildly patriotic and then I meet Arvin Sloane so you be Sydney Bristow yes sir Nice to meet you I be Arvin Sloane Welcome to SD 6 what if I need to go to the bathroom I think we can arrange that anything my FBI contact do not have access to Sydney 's case it be classify what about Devlin he have no clearance all we know be Sydney 's be hold locally we get to find out where where be irrelevant how long she be in custody concern I Sloane want to meet she on Tuesday maybe the FBI will not put as much credence in the prophecy as DSR Wrong in the current climate the FBI 's be wildly vigilant if another government agency red flag someone as a threat the FBI will not be so quick to let they go you be say Sydney 's cover could be blow to SD 6 under Directive 81 a they could conceivably hold she without trial or charge for the rest of her life describe your role within SD 6 Desk work at first but I advance quickly within a year I be out on reconnaissance mission always believe that you be work for the CIA Mr Kendall with the exception of a half dozen high level officer the entire office believe they work for the CIA you remain in school during all of this why do sd 6 want you to no they do not want I to it be something I want to do become a teacher I do not want to give that up who be Daniel Hecht Danny be my fiancé could you tell we what happen to he please you build I up Buttercup baby then you bring I down and mess I around and then bad of all you never call baby when you say you will we have be together two year when Danny propose do not break my heart I have never tell anyone about my involvement with SD 6 but I know that if I be go to marry Danny he have to know the truth so I tell he that I be a spy while I be in Taipei on an operation SD 6 have he kill so sd 6 murder your fiancé yes they do that do not seem extreme to you I do not understand your question how could a girl as brilliant as yourself believe that an agency that assassinate an innocent civilian could be affiliate with the US Government you be say I know about SD 6 all along you claim to have learn the truth about SD 6 when it be not a claim it be the truth after Danny I refuse to return to SD 6 which they see as a betrayal that be when they come after I it be that night that I learn that my father who I be never very close to be also an officer with SD 6 get in daddy and I learn who I be really work for a decade ago some agent go freelance the Alliance of 12 what do you know about they they be mercenary I be one of they sd 6 be not a black op division of the CIA SD 6 be a branch of the Alliance you work for the enemy you think you be fight that be impossible that be the first time I hear the truth about SD 6 the first time make sure Susan get Donaldson 's briefing Call Josh tell he I have to cancel lunch I 've what do you say about Haladki he do not shower about your friend she use to see he at lunch at the Webster Rotunda at the Adams Federal building yeah why you be not allow in the Rotunda unless you be a rank FBI officer no way you know what excuse I you be FBI before you be CIA you be FBI my FBI history be on my resumé I will give you a copy you know what FBI protocol be where Sydney be and what they plan to do with her you have lose your mind you be the one on the witch hunt look we 've decode 47 verifiable Rambaldi prediction he have not be wrong once where be she what if he be not wrong about this what if Sydney Bristow be a threat what if Rambaldi get it right what do they tell you be the objective of SD 6 the retrieval and study of intelligence both military and industrial throughout the world that be critical to the superiority and survival of the USA that be the company line well what do sd stand for Section Disparue the section that do not exist Alain Christophe of the Alliance the term be his Explain about the Alliance of 12 it be like a board of director some be from the private sector but most be intelligence officer all wealthy they start a company except this company trade intelligence so they be after weapon military secret industrial intel computer advance political agenda anything the other guy want the other guy government corporation wealthy citizen family it be all black market it be organise crime could you give I an example do you remember the Carbon Proxy disaster in ' 92 an accidental methylisocyanate leak at a manufacturing plant in Bangalore India kill 3 000 another 1 000 disabled 1996 near Kyoto Japan a bullet train accidentally switch track and derail 150 people be kill last year in Germany a transport plane suffer mechanical failure outside Munich 12 life be lose none of they be accident some be act of revenge other be personal favour to those who help to fund the Alliance some be distraction so that local resource be occupy so that sd 4 or sd 7 could infiltrate a building somewhere and retrieve sensitive datum go on after what they do to Danny what they try to do to I I swear I would destroy they SD 6 but first I have to win back their confidence so I steal something that I know Arvin Sloane want a device base on the design by Milo Rambaldi I be back then I go to the people I think I have be work for that be where I meet my handler Michael Vaughn I think the job would be over by Christmas it be Vaughn who make it clear to I what I be really up against that be how I become a double agent and a few day later your father come to see you and reveal that he be a double agent work for the CIA that his job at sd 6 be cover too yes that be right Father and daughter double agent yes this be what do not make sense why recruit his daughter into that environment he would not he do not Sloane know my parent year before they be marry he bring I in he do not tell my father until I be active why do sloane go after you I do not know you be sure sloane bring you into SD 6 not your father why do you ask as far as you 've see your father 's allegiance have always be with the CIA I have be very patient with you and your implication that I can not be trust Ms Bristow but you will not insult my father that be unacceptable it be just a question it be an accusation and you be question my honour my loyalty base on a prophecy in a book you would not have if it be not for I we will take a break I want to finish this and go home sit down listen to I I want to go home I want to just wait a minute ok here we go look at this rock the cradle unless prevent at vulgar cost she will render the great power unto utter desolation you be make yourself crazy what be vulgar cost I do not know this woman will have have her effect never having see the beauty of my sky behind Mount Subasio a glance may have quell her fire Yo yo 's sleep Mount Subasio I think that be where Rambaldi be bear why do not we all go to Mount Subasio here we go around the world what what happen thank for come SD 6 security have nothing on Sydney look at this this woman will have have her effect never having see Mount Subasio if the FBI take this so literally every phrase must have equal veracity accord to Rambaldi the woman will have never see Mount Subasio so if Sydney go there and see it she could not be the woman make sense do not it it be good Devlin put three call in to the FBI about this and be stonewall they be not in a cooperative mood we will have to extract she get she to Italy ourselves Devlin would sanction transit a jet could be ready in an hour how do we find she Steven Haladki he be CIA former FBI I know he still have tie Haladki I will talk to he the problem be he be not talk he will talk to I when we leave off we be chat about your father what can you tell I about your mother for most of my life I think she be a literature professor at UCLA I think that she be a love mother and an adore wife apparently I could not have be more wrong could you elaborate a few month ago I notice something unusual I find Cyrillic code in old book that my father have purchase I begin to suspect he of having collaborate with the KGB but that be not the case be it no those Cyrillic code in those book yes they be order from the KGB and yes they be order to kill an agent receive those order and carry they out but Sydney I be not that agent your mother be your mother be a traitor yes a woman who appear to be one thing but actually be another your mother tell I how she die I I use to think my mother and father be drive together I be wrong my mother be actually alone she be be pursue by an FBI counterintelligence officer the road be slippery there be an accident the car go into the river after she die your father raise you be that right no he hire a nanny as I say he and I do not have much of a relationship until recently so like your father you be a double agent tell we how that work it always begin with something sd 6 want Information Technology Classified datum sloane outline the mission then Marshall review the tech Marshall he be our tech guy this look like a normal phone you would call I be go to be late for dinner Dad do not wait up for I Biometric sensor what it do barely touch it and you be knock out cold you just like freebase Thorazine you be out this look like a normal purse right you would wear it at the beach or wherever put in but it be a parabolic microphone they take picture and have telephoto lense and they be super swank once I have the mission lay out I contact the CIA I detail the SD 6 operation on a brown paper bag and wait for the CIA to contact I after the CIA review the mission what then I meet with Vaughn to get my countermission could you give we an example sd 6 send I to Moscow to get computer disk the CIA want copy I be in the bar I can see you be those the file if they be cough get ready to make a switch after I get back to Los Angeles I have to complete a brushpass and give the steal disk to Vaughn so the CIA can make copy before I leave the airport Vaughn have to pass the original back so I can deliver they to sloane without my sd 6 partner know your sd 6 partner Dixon Dixon believe that sd 6 be affiliate with the CIA he do not know you be a double that be right do that ever cause problem SD 6 send we to retrieve a vaccine from a plant in Badenweiler and destroy the empty building while I be in a laboratory Dixon be set the explosive charge what I could not tell Dixon be that the CIA also have a team in that building I 've get a bomb to disengage please we would appreciate it my CIA countermission include disarm Dixon 's bomb do you get the inhaler we be good I know Dixon 's detonator would not work that be the plan come on we get to go I bring a secondary detonator in case there be a frequency jam let us go can we take a break please just for a minute I have no desire to blow your head off but I will unless you tell I where Sydney Bristow be the Federal building on Moorepark they will not keep she there what be the plan there be a safe house when be they transfer she what time 5 30 5 30 I swear just so we be clear you report this conversation and you will never wear a hat again I get it no worry I get it we need a list of people who be aware of your double agent status it be a short list besides the CIA only my father know you 've never tell anyone else no after what happen to Danny I think I would keep my mouth shut I be go to call the bank I be go to quit for you it be ridiculous my job may seem pointless but it be not far from it if you know what I deal with every day you might thank I for do my job so well what be you talk about nothing I be go to work you have a hard time keep secret no I do not have a hard time keep a secret what I do not enjoy be lie to my friend or be in a constant state of jet lag from fly to far corner of the world for a man I wish be dead sloane yes sloane how often do sd 6 send you on operation I keep busy what do sd 6 want what be their priority at the moment it be Rambaldi what can you tell I about he Milo Rambaldi be Pope Alexander VI 's chief architect he be an artist an inventor his design be so technologically advanced that at the time they think he be a heretic and he be execute now 500 year later many believe he be a prophet and SD 6 CIA GRU K Directorate the entire intelligence world be on a Rambaldi scavenger hunt why they assume Rambaldi have some sort of master plan which be recently confirm follow my trip to Argentina in that book Rambaldi refer to a single construction the agency do not know what it be yet but they be all afraid the other guy 's go to get it first I just have one more question do you believe Rambaldi be a prophet do you you be not go to let I go be you we be do for today get down on the ground get down do not move you come with we go we 've get a silver van California plate you be go to be ok what be you do prove this be not about you we will explain when we get there Dad Honey if the FBI be serious about the prophecy it be the key to your innocence the woman in it never see Mount Subasio so you be go the FBI would have hold you for month sd 6 would have investigate and you would have be expose go to Mount Subasio should prove the FBI might have let I go this make they certain that I be guilty escaping and cross the border prove I act in opposition to the US Government it be either do nothing or take a risk to protect your cover I be a fugitive from justice once you be in Italy we will alert all agency of your location you will not be a suspect you do not know that we will have protect a CIA asset your cover will be maintain the FBI will not make any noise we get to go I will take you to the jet Get in the trunk what if the FBI be right what if Rambaldi be right what if he be talk about I then nothing we do make any difference if Rambaldi 's right there be nothing to lose the cop be everywhere contact I from Italy this be so we can speak Alan it be Steven listen I need to tell you something that happen today no I be not ok I do a stupid thing and I will take responsibility for it Jack Bristow come to see I early I tell he about Sydney 's transfer time when you alright you do not think about it not once the possibility that Rambaldi could be right about I no I do not why not cos I believe in you do you think I would just throw anyone in my trunk Transportation say four vehicle be out I have their make and licence plate Ready take that car over there to Dozier Field there be a jet wait to take you to Italy be careful you too no LAPD be in pursuit of a blue sedan every day there be one of these they be stupid why do not he give up totally he can not escape it be stupid switch your engine off now look at that guy it be the part where he get out of his car and surrender every time oh my God yeah it be I where be you I need to see you now what happen the plane be ready you need to go now I know but I need to see you first I just drive a car into the ocean I know the police be wait for I I use the air from the tyre I be breathe under water for ten minute before I swam and as that car start to fill with water I know what my mother have do in the same situation she could have plan it Sydney it make sense she be deceitful she be cruel Ruthless and in Rambaldi 's prophecy he use detail like that dna sequence Dad I inherit that I mean it be either Mom or I I know it be not I Mom 's alive I know it my name be Sydney Bristow Seven year ago I be recruit by a secret branch of the CIA call sd 6 I be swear to secrecy but I could not keep it from my fiancé and when the head of sd 6 find out he have he kill that be when I learn the truth SD 6 be not part of the CIA I would be work for the people I think I be fight I go to the only place that could help I take they down now I be a double agent for the CIA my handler be Michael Vaughn only one other person know what I do another double agent inside SD 6 someone I hardly know my father there be an FBI tribunal fly in they will question Sydney about the prophecy and decide the next move it be just a question no it be an accusation you be question my honour my loyalty base on a prophecy in a book you would not have if it be not for I look at this there this woman will have have her effect never having see Mount Subasio accord to Rambaldi the woman the subject of this prophecy will have never see Mount Subasio if Sydney be to go there and see it she could not possibly be the woman that make sense do not it we will have to extract she the plane be ready to take you to Italy Dad I just drive a car into the ocean I know the police be wait for I I use the air from the tyre I be underwater for ten minute and as that car start to fill with water I know what my mother have do in the same situation Sydney Mom 's alive I know it Agent King Agent Otley please tell he it be about a fugitive the FBI have be look for the fugitive be I I do not know how to thank you for help I do not thank I Devlin say the FBI be focus their investigation where it should have be all along instead of persecute you they should have search for your mother but they be convinced she be dead no while you be in Italy I do something I 've never do before I violate the CIA 's trust I break into Langley 's classified archive I pull the operational file on your mother to see if I could find anything that might prove your intuition correct apparently after her accident an internal commission be form to assess the damage she would do to US intelligence the commission be comprise of people I would work with at the agency but one name stand out in particular 20 year ago back at the CIA you be on a commission that investigate Laura 's death when I hear that I could not imagine why you never tell I unless the commission discover something it do not want I to know about Laura do not die in the accident do she give my state at the time they think it well that I be not tell they do not know what happen to she where she go she could still be in this country for all they know Dad I be go to find she I have to search for that woman will accomplish nothing I need to know where she be we be not sure she be alive and it do not change what she do Dad I know you expect she to say sorry I do not know what to expect you would well know exactly what to expect what could she ever say that would satisfy you I have this memory of my father I be maybe five year old we be camp with my mother I break my leg and he pick I up and carry I mile back to the car I remember look up at he and think he be the strong man in the world see he there in the car look so damaged I have never see he like that the idea that I wanna find my mother it scare he well I do not have a neutral point of view but your father 's get a point I know and maybe I be be reckless or selfish or masochistic but if my mother be alive then I just have to know that can you help I get everything the CIA have get on her I can not all information on she have be classify omega 17 by the FBI include her connection to the prophecy Dozens of agent must be look for her they will not let I be part of that I know you need help but this time I just do not have it to give I be sorry Apologise to Emily for I if I wake her Emily be use to the phone ringing in the middle of the night you 've be avoid I when I find out that my mother might still be alive I just need some time to sort it out I understand and now you want to know how I could have hide the truth from you no I do not want an explanation I come here because I need you to help I find she Sydney how much do you remember of the year after you be tell that your mother die I remember just feel disconnected from everything my father be away on business no your father spend six month in solitary in a federal prison he be suspect of be in collusion with Laura the FBI almost try he for treason and even though he be eventually vindicate the damage be do and he begin to unravel Unravel he drink he start take unnecessary risk come on Sydney you know the father he be to you all those year he take a long time to fully recover I be under direct order from the DCI not to let he know that Laura have survive the accident unfortunately that also require lie to you now that I know the truth I be remove myself from active duty until I find out what happen to her and I be in no position to allow you to go off on what appear to be a rogue operation that would compromise the agency every day you send I on operation that could compromise this agency but as long as it be for SD 6 the risk be acceptable it be time that SD 6 take a risk for I a daughter have a right to know her mother I will help you find she ok we do not put chocolate chip in the pancake I get news for you yes we do hey guy you still live here I know that finance seminar take a week any question about offshore tax shelter I be your girl what be you do today Francie 's go to take I to look for a new tuxedo for the

own unfortunately Agent Hicks they be not ok because I be in love and I be afraid to admit that to myself I see that as be a sign of weakness in this work so I leave the only reason I can speak with any perspective about that now be that I 've have five year to regret my mistake may I have the name of the person to whom you be refer absolutely not you be aware that I have the authority to take step that will compel you to answer yes but the only other deep cover agent near Khasinau be dead which make I a value commodity so I suggest we limit the question to subject sd 6 need to know about besides where I come from a gentleman do not kiss and tell our station chief get your dead drop I read your debrief sorry you have a rough time thank if anything turn up on the microchip I will let you know the agent you extract Noah Hicks you mention he in your report when you make contact with the CIA we meet when I be a trainee we actually date for a while really we keep it under the radar SD 6 discourage fraternisation among agent so do the CIA one more thing do you know where your father 's be lately I talk to he an hour ago why Kretchmer 's leave two call signal for a meet be he ok Club soda please how have you find I your car be still in your garage I think you might have walk somewhere close it be the fifth place I look Mike can I get the check Dad it be two o'clock in the afternoon what be you do here I think you might wanna talk to someone note six month ago I be not I do not even know how to talk to you but now at least I feel like I can come to you and say what be happen between we Sydney be temporary I be not suggest the person you talk to should be I it should not but the CIA have counsellor I think you should see one of they you be not responsible for I it be not irrational for I to be worried about you keep your voice down I do not think you would listen to my advice so I make it official I come here to pass along an order from Devlin you be go to see a counsellor for trauma evaluation I be sorry you have to come down it be my fault really we be upload the microchip there be 10 000 file 14 different language Linguistics need all the help they can get so you be clear yeah you survive the debriefing yes I do and I forget how much I miss McCullough let us get start so how long be you stay I be not exactly sure it be somewhat complicated why long story remember when you have just get back from endurance training before you be send out as a field op and you come back and you have this incredible glow I remember think man this girl be really have fun I remember be worried about that because I know inevitably one day you would not feel that way you be not aware of what you be get yourself into you think I would get myself kill maybe be that why you leave no you be right about one thing I be not have fun any more we be go to be late I can not find my jacket I do not wanna miss the preview I be just go to borrow one of Syd 's you think I buy the right tux for the amount of money you spend what be that suppose to mean what do not Syd say she go to Seattle yeah so there be a return ticket from Italy in her pocket probably from another trip it be date last week why would not she tell we about a trip to Italy you be look at a schematic of a Westbury 23 supercomputer it be capable of make 500 trillion calculation per second Khasinau buy two of they what for they be ideal for simulate theoretical engineering design so for example if Khasinau have acquire enough Rambaldi artefact he may be able to assemble these artefact correctly and extrapolate what miss piece remain from the overall design and that be why you need to steal the data core how be you may I thank you thank to the microchip we have an image of the data core and trust I this core hardcore it be a photo refractive crystal cube it act like a sponge it have enough capacity to serve as a backup archive for both computer but it be get to be keep in a cryogenic chamber halfway to absolute zero it be cold enough to freeze your skin to stone in under a minute even if a millimetre of it be expose Khasinau 's computer complex in Arkhangelsk be a mile underground the surround forest be patrol by private security give this high level of security surround this computer network it be likely that Khasinau be use it as his primary archive Account number old contact every agent who be ever work for he this be a two person operation you 've be on assignment a long time I will go I know the area pretty well I do a lot of recon there as a courier Noah 's right we need every advantage on this one you leave in an hour my foot hurt can we stop I get to take my boot off leave they on or your foot will swell up we be Americans you be speculate that perhaps Sydney 's desire to find her mother could be interpret as criticism of you as a father I suppose it be understandable much like a normal family after a divorce when parental jealousy be stir over a child 's affection and how would you define a normal family I suppose it be one in which the family member be not under order to lie to each other I see what you be get at maybe there be no such thing as a normal family well ok Mr Bristow I guess we can call it a day I prefer Jack one more thing Jack I do not believe a single word you 've say to I over this past hour do not get I wrong I think you be a master you have all your subconscious tell under control you be smart enough to struggle with word but I think you tell I what I want to hear so you could get out of here I also think that someone so skilled at deception be in danger of deceive himself I be go to recommend that you see I once a week you have not get a clue what be require to lead the kind of life I lead to maintain a balance between two life and protect my daughter in the process the kind of person who do that the kind of person I have to be be not the kind of person who would come in here and talk to you then I guess we be make some progress see you next week be there any chance we can contact the american embassy what be you take picture of just the scenery I swear it why do not you just take the film and give she back the camera just the scenery Keys take them let us go move let us go Syd I be disengage the core I be in do not forget to keep that core temperature constant got it how be we do almost there get it Noah I be freeze Hang on the system be in lockdown wake up come on good girl come on up Syd come on baby move it be weird I do not know Italy what if she meet somebody on a business trip why would she keep that a secret maybe she be embarrassed by it why what the bruise what if he be beat she be you kid I Sydney would never put up with that maybe she be sleep with her boss sloane No should we just forget that we even find the ticket you think she be in trouble when she get back from where do she say she go San Francisco which I be sure she do we be blow this out of proportion there be an explanation we will ask she when she get back from San Francisco do you get through yeah it be hard to get a signal but we 've get an extraction set at 0800 that be what six hour yeah we should prepare in case Khasinau 's man show up the floorboard over there lift up this safehouse have save I before you know what would be great right now a fire in that fireplace I hear a chopper if it be thermal equip it will pick up the heat signature what be you look for in that database anyway it be a long story we 've get six hour so that be good I be look for information about my mother your mother a lot 's happen since you leave I wanna fill you in but I do not know if I feel comfortable do that yet fine you be still mad no when you leave and you just disappear it be a kick in the stomach and I carry that around for a long time you be the last person that I ever want to see again ever and you be the only person that I ever want to see again wait my name be Sydney Bristow Seven year ago I be recruit by a branch of the CIA call sd 6 I be swear to secrecy but I could not keep it from my fiancé and when the head of sd 6 find out he have he kill that be when I learn the truth SD 6 be not part of the CIA I would be work for the people I think I be fight I go to the only place that could help I take they down now I be a double agent for the CIA my handler be Michael Vaughn only one other person know what I do another double agent in SD 6 someone I hardly know my father do not Syd say she go to Seattle yeah so why be there a ticket from Italy in her pocket I come here to pass along an order from Devlin you be go to see a counsellor for trauma evaluation Khasinau 's just convert 250 m worth of asset into cash we need to know what he spend it on you leave for Vienna tonight Noah oh my God do I a favour Syd Tread carefully here until he debrief I would not get too friendly it be history it be five year ago you be the last person that I ever want to see again ever and you be the only person that I ever want to see again they find we we get to go skyhook this be White Rabbit Copy Change of plan can you get we out of here 30 minute early Affirmative we be be pursue we will not make the meeting point we need extraction now we be lock onto your signal Prepare for extraction have you in sight turn final approach from the south Hostile six o'clock reverse course 180 degree for recovery in 10 Noah hold on nine drive for I eight seven six five four I be pull the cord three two one hold on the CIA have a new lead on Khasinau K Directorate be look for revenge we receive Intel last night they 've hire a fairly prestigious freelance assassin to find Khasinau and dismember he the Snowman Familiar with he the Snowman he be be on the CIA 's want list for 12 year presume dead since ' 97 it seem we be not so lucky I be look for contact maybe we can find Khasinau by follow the Snowman I just wanna make sure you get to Khasinau first I know how important it be to you thank you hey so the operation go alright in Arkhangelsk with Noah yeah good she be back tonight she say so on the machine she be at San Francisco airport wait for a plane so we go to strategise this Strategise how I wanna be gentle with her we be accuse she of lie I be think what if she want we to ask she like she want you to find the ticket because it be a cry for help I do not know maybe hey guy hi so how be San Francisco two day of due diligence if I never see another financial statement it will be fine with I I be go to crash if you do not mind no course not ok hi hi hey you do not say anything that be why I want to strategise Syd I be not kid I want you to go away with I what happen the other night it be too soon Russia have a huge bootleg software industry I figure out a way of skim money off the russian mob what be you talk about I get a lot of money hide away Syd I be get out I be sick of lie to everyone I know the idea of just walk away from all these people that be mean to be my good friend be a relief you tell I you never feel that way I 've get someone help I out I be not kid I want you to come I can not say where but we will not need lock on the door and you will learn how to surf you know I can not do that why for about a million reason I highly doubt that there might be 50 I would like the opportunity to refute all of they one of the big reason be my mother Khasinau be her superior my mother be a spy for the KGB those file that we recover may help I find she I be not go anywhere until I know where she be what if I wait will you ever do it we follow up on Agent Noah Hicks be Hicks here yes he arrive 12 minute ago tell McCullough I need to see he do not let Hicks leave Dad Sydney you say you be go to talk to someone I do thank you I take care of it Marshall unlocked Khasinau 's computer core your last operation I would not have allow it those computer be use for theoretical analysis war game the recover file bear no relevance to his operation his plan or his Rambaldi artifact nor do they give any hint to his whereabouts but when I be there I see there be some file on Mom I know also recover on the core be some unhelpful archival file in the case of your mother video footage be she in the video yes after the accident they show she alive yes I have no interest in watch the video myself Analysis be review it there be nothing to help in the hunt for Khasinau the risk be all for nothing hey Dixon I keep try to think of some kind of opening line something to start off with to talk to you Noah I will be straight with you I do not trust you it would not be a problem except I be an intelligence officer if you stay soon or later my life be go to be in your hand and your in mine and in that scenario the only person truly safe will be you Mr Hicks would you come with we please be there a problem Mr Sloane ask for you to come with we well that be never a good thing excuse I on March 16th of this year you open an account with Banque Afrikana yes sir Explain it be exactly like the account we be just talk about it be open up under an alias as part of a SVR operation Mr McCullough I be work undercover I be require to do a whole bunch of thing which probably seem very suspicious when view from the outside 47 m be transfer then withdraw within 24 hour yes to an untraceable account who be the recipient I do not know you do not seem real thrilled with these response have you ever conduct business with the GL Bank of Austria yes please provide detail this man be hide something I be curious to know what it be would you like I to have a word with he my russian or american name why not both Irina Derevko and Laura Bristow when be you recruit for special duty in 1970 I be recruit to the KGB by you Alexander Khasinau describe the objective of your operation Phase One I be to pose as an american a student of literature Phase Two I be to make the acquaintance of a particular officer in the Central Intelligence Agency to insinuate myself into his life to become his confidante earn his trust please state the officer by name Officer Jonathan Donohue Bristow Phase Three I be to begin to acquire through various mean detail of the CIA operation to which Bristow be assign Project Christmas you have no reason to believe that anyone else be suspicious of you I need you to feed Donovan who my dog Donovan which key be where be you go top lock bottom lock I be go to Bogota give he a can of the dog food and half a can of the dry stuff what be in Bogota only half a can it be next to the can stuff what be in Bogota Interpol say eight year ago the Snowman attack a guy Kishell Punctured heart lung lose an eye I get it it be bad this guy Kishell work with Snowman who we know be after Khasinau we get Kishell we get Snowman we get Khasinau exactly half a can I do not want to come back to a fat dog there be two man in Mom 's video one be Khasinau the other one I recognise he it be the man from the article the FBI agent who supposedly die in the accident with Mom Caulder 's real name be Igor Sergei Valenco the man who be pursue Mom the FBI spy hunter Dad he be KGB it be not just Mom 's death they fake it be Caulder 's too if we can get to Caulder maybe we can find Khasinau assume they still have tie Khasinau recently liquidate over 200 m in asset on that memo be initial ISV six month ago a man match Caulder 's description be catch on camera enter a financial office in Cape Town a know money laundering operation I will suggest to sloane we go there seize their record and find Caulder Noah spend year undercover there he will be an asset sd 6 have run an additional profile on Noah there be anomaly recent bank activity suggest he may have tie to K Directorate Noah 's be take into custody what I know what that be about it be not to do with another agency you have no perspective on who that man be you be as lose now as I be you do not know he nor do you that be the lesson in all this Dad Noah Hicks be not a perfect man but he be also not a traitor he be a loyal officer who believe he be work for the CIA he have no idea sd 6 would kill he if they think he be a double agent please Dad talk to Sloane I never actually meet the Snowman he always contact I by telephone his name the Snowman it come from his method he prefer an ice pick but he use knife too I arrange travel across difficult border it be my specialty one operation he be ambush attack he fight off and kill eight man he think that I tip someone off that be when he come after I he come to this house he attack I while I sleep Killing be his job he like his job I appreciate you talk to I I know this must be difficult I know difficult talk be easy I know the CIA have speak to you before year ago but we know that an organisation have hire the Snowman for a job I read the transcript last time you say you have no lead I hope this time you might have some you have come too far to go home with nothing for year I be afraid to do anything to seek revenge but enough time have pass Mr Vaughn I have no more fear yes I have some lead you would be willing to share they I will contact they myself see if I can find out where the Snowman be what his plan be I would appreciate that you must promise I one thing that when you find he he will suffer too come on sweetheart you be in pain he can get you a strong ok yeah yeah just promise I that you will call I after you talk to he ok good ok I too Bye I need a minute Yep this be about Noah Hicks there be something he be not tell we he might have be turn if you have Hicks kill you would be throw away an asset how so you want Khasinau you be close than you think be you aware Caulder FBI be work with the KGB since 1973 Sydney 's design an operation to lead we to Caulder we will be one step away from Khasinau and she want Mr Hicks involve this be become familiar Jack your come to I request special consideration for the man in Sydney 's life Tippin do not turn out to be a problem do he Sydney be not intimate with Tippin she be with Hicks I be not sure that be my business and I know it be not yours sloane accept the mission I propose Noah and I be go to Cape Town Caulder 's do business at a financial office there we be go to break into that office get the record and hopefully find out where Caulder be what be my counter mission there should not be one when you know he be KGB you should have tell I do you think I be not think I do not know what you think I be think about the 36 hour the FBI keep I in chain if I have give the information to you you would be require to forward it to the FBI we both know what they would do classify it omega 17 we would not be allow near that investigation I be suppose to give you this tell you to write down whatever information you recover from Caulder Stick it in the chamber activate the beacon bin it and we will retrieve it but I be guess you will not use it Vaughn I promise you Khasinau will not walk and I will not let sd 6 get to he first but I refuse to let the FBI get in my way again Nice shoot thank it be easy to shoot tranqs no anxiety of kill somebody the server room floor be alarm with motion detector so we stay off the floor it also have audio sensor that can detect any sound above 05 dB 's in other word this right here two dB 's 05 db 's be close to the sound of a cockroach rub its leg together ok so what do we do well active noise control it emit an out of phase signal that cancel out any sound within 200 ft check it out that be pretty loud right and the server case be alarmed do not touch it you want to get a wireless modem within 3 of the server you will hack into the server then download the datum into your laptop be I bore you you have no reason to believe

guard they be dead Dixon no caulder I try to keep you from this you know that Sydney my name be Sydney Bristow Seven year ago I be recruit by a secret branch of the CIA call sd 6 I be swear to secrecy but I could not keep it from my fiancé when the head of sd 6 find out he have he kill that be when I learn the truth SD 6 be not part of the CIA I would be work for the people I think I be fight I go to the only place that could help I take they down now I be a double agent for the CIA my handler be Michael Vaughn only one other person know what I do another double agent inside SD 6 someone I hardly know my father do you value your life of course I value my life your action would indicate otherwise listen Jean this business we have to discuss be extremely sensitive what be it I know this have be difficult for Arvin my illness I look just like everyone else and I usually feel that way the fact be I will not be alive next Christmas remember the vial of liquid that Khasinau want we use it on the blank page it expose Rambaldi 's hidden text I 've book you on a flight for tomorrow night it will be our last mission Noah let I prove to you that it can work I hear about Noah I be sorry hit the bag I kill a man someone I care about he be an assassin if you have not kill he he would have kill you maybe but I be the one who force the fight Hicks be a bad guy that be it push nice combination but the truth be it affect I never know who to trust Learning to expect betrayal plotting and secrecy and hatred and anger it be become a part of I I be become what I despise I tell myself that I get into this to bring Danny 's killer to justice the truth be I be more interested in revenge I think I could stay in control it be just get so twisted like with Khasinau the one goal I have be to find he so that I can find my mother but if I do that if I can find his trail and track he down it will strengthen sd 6 I get into this to bring they down and now I feel like I be on their side this be the world of SD 6 when we start remember and here be what it look like today and this do not even take into account Badenweiler or steal page 47 from Sloane 's vault or the way you keep Khasinau from get that ampoule these be incredible accomplishment Khasinau be out there somewhere yes my mom be out there we will find they I have to go to class wait take care of yourself Thanks where be it behind the fridge you say you see it no I hear it scratch I will go and get some trap no we need a professional a hit man rat breed hourly hello you disappoint I Mr Tippin it be Litvack you have enough to publish you have nothing to fear I be kidnap the life of people I care about be threaten it be a bluff to scare you off the story it work I be off it just go away do not call I again do not call anyone else again unless you want more people to die it be Jack Bristow what what be Jack Bristow hello we have rat what in all likelihood possibly mice hi hi Mice be not well than rat they be rat and they be huge the exterminator 's come could you be here no I 've get work I have to cater a lunch for 30 I do not live here why be you here you do not pay any rent be this attack on will please just do this for we ok fine I will do it rat be clever you have to out think them you can not just leave out cheese you have to leave stuff they want it be the only way they will come out otherwise you be waste your time I can not believe I do not think of this before we can make Khasinau come to we what be you think the vial the Rambaldi solution the one the CIA have that be why he have a team break into SD 6 he want that solution with respect to Khasinau I would like to suggest a course of action quickly I be get a meeting with the review team from NIC remember the ampoule we get from SD 6 that allow we to read page 47 I suggest a black market sale third party Khasinau still think that vial be in the SD 6 vault so we say there be another one can we make he believe that have to make it sound legit I know how last year sloane send a team of agent into the art museum in Algiers after a minister donate a collection that Sloane believe might contain Rambaldi artefact why do not I know about this the mission fail the agent be catch before they could even be question sd 6 have they kill say there be a break in at that museum this week it would be widely publicise Khasinau would start to hear rumour of what be take include rumour of an exist second ampoule be you suggest I approve of theft we would just be borrow they we would return everything we steal after we make contact with Khasinau the whole point be to get notice we you be propose to go with her I know I be not a field agent but Agent Bristow will need back up she trust I we plan to go in as insurance agent offer to lower their premium we would inspect the security system before we commit any coverage I download the mission spec Alarm type at the museum activation point blueprint everything this be our good shot at Khasinau do it you will deal with the op tech I will take care of it I have to stop by the hospital Emily she be not do well Sick from the chemo we hear that from the bug in Sloane 's study I be sorry thank could I get the number for Druzinsky 's Pest Control it be d r u let I just get a pen hold on just a minute go 323 naturally the guy show up sorry how be

give you some advice please when you look back family your friend that be what matter work your job it will not seem that important even your job even work for SD 6 I know you can not talk about it I would not have mention it but I know how easy it be to lose perspective on thing and I do not wanna see that happen to you when do Arvin tell you he do not over the year I would overhear thing find clue that he never really leave the world of intelligence and I know he keep I from the truth to protect I to keep I from worry my only regret be not be able to tell he how proud I be I be good for two minute it be Emily she know about SD 6 I be just worried I know it be too late your conversation be record the Alliance know yes and information about SD 6 must be treat like a virus there be only one response containment what do she say sloane will not let they kill Emily a decision will not be make until sloane meet the head of Alliance security he be the only one who can save she now the time off I ask for last week I would still like to take it would that be alright where be you go the desert yeah of course thank you the desert we need to test your security system see how it operate during a shutdown of your generator heating electrical and ventilation system once we be in you inspect the alarm and exhibition space I will handle the shutdown with this frequency jammer it will keep the camera off for three minute 180 second be all you 've get Shut down the primary generator he say the generator 's always keep the security monitor online before when I close the ventilation system the turbine and shaft shut down allow I access to the vault room now shut down the ventilation take the heating system offline the vault room be locate through a shaft on the east wall 67 foot below the main level accord to the document the vault be a third generation Hanvalova careful it be full of explosive in case this do not work this should crack the safe and short the circuit for two minute give you time to get back to the main level before the alarm go off and electrical what be go on I agree to a system analysis Mr Algosaibi 's president of the museum not to a shutdown we be test the system everything be ok he be order the power restore my partner and I fly in from Paris because we be assure we could make competitive offer we must run a thorough analysis when it be offline essential service go down include fire protection that be a risk I can not take I will file a formal complaint with the legal department take he find his partner show they the way out what be go on we be be kick out I do not finish my analysis do you barely give I more detail than that no detail you be kidnap by a man who turn out to be someone you know 's father what be this an article I 've write do this for I keep it seal and do not mention this to anyone do not open it unless something happen to I if something happen to I you got to publish it why would something happen because I

do you escape I be sorry but Agent Vaughn be miss and my sitting here tell Houdini story to a CIA shrink no offence be pointless no one should be worry about I it be he we should all be look for he you be frustrated cos you be not part of the search team but Sydney they be look and you 've be order to come and talk to I I know I could not get out of the room until I get out of the chair it be an unreinforced aluminum chair I wedge it against a water valve put stress on the weld point get past the door be a little more complicated and you do all this with a bullet in your shoulder do you not believe I it be impressive not really one thing I 've learn do this there be no drug like adrenaline where the hell be you I be in the middle of Taipei I just get free be Vaughn with you no we have not hear from he Sydney you have to get to the plane now Dad I have to go back for he there be no time the taiwanese authority will check this airstrip I can not leave he behind hold the plane I be go back to the lab Sydney wait who be Vaughn tell I about Vaughn he be my CIA handler for a long time he be the only person I could trust I think that still might be the case anyway a good friend of mine a civilian will Tippin be kidnap Vaughn come to I he offer to help so the two of we and my father go to Taipei to get my friend back how do Vaughn go miss the last time I see Vaughn be the night before my mother shoot I while my father be pay a ransom in exchange for my friend Vaughn and I go in to destroy one of the kidnapper ' research facility we break in through a club in the building next door along the way we split up when I get to the lab I be suppose to destroy I find something unusual what be it the short answer be I have no idea but there be no time and I do my job by destroy Khasinau 's lab I flood the building and when you wake up you be handcuff to an aluminum chair after I escape I go back to the last place I would see he there be a hazmat team clean up the mess test the water I steal a suit and go in I find Vaughn 's coat when I finally make it back to the plane Vaughn still have not show up ok easy what happen to the guy who shoot you there be no guy it be Mom and it do not seem like she work for Khasinau it seem that Khasinau work for her excuse I do you say you be shoot by your mother sit down hello hey where be you just come home from San Francisco what be up have you hear from will have I hear from Will no I neither and there be this story on the news right now will write a story that be not suppose to get print unless he go miss what be Will 's story about it be about the murder of your fiancé and some conspiracy and some group call sd 6 what do you write about SD 6 nothing just the name I do not even know what it be I just hear the name why do you know what it be be it a group be they good be they bad I mean do you work with they will be ask all the question I would ask what do you say to he without go into detail we tell he the truth that my father and I work for the CIA that we be work undercover at SD 6 one of a number of private agency base in various country that trade in weapon drug and intelligence that use covert mean to undermine government and industry in their attempt to take over the world so what be his reaction seriously he think it sound preposterous which be appropriate do will 's article put you in danger at SD 6 my problem at SD 6 come from a different source as you be aware I be shoot last year while on a mission with Agent Bristow I be leave with few memory of that day the doctor say that type of memory loss be typical but then last week I remember something and I remember Agent Bristow try to save my life use a Satcom radio what be unusual be that she ID'd herself with a call sign not issue by SD 6 call sign Freelancer last Thursday night I follow Agent Bristow I watch as she illegally gain access to an sd 6 facility in Santa Barbara I pray sir that there be an explanation but when I confront Sydney she have none as a servant of this country despite the fact it break my heart to do so I must report that I believe Sydney Bristow to be a double agent my father of course anticipate this you and I need to assume Dixon 's report you the good move for we be for I to take full responsibility what about will you be go to have a hard time then we land and go back to sd 6 as my father predict they take I into custody that be when he go to see Sloane you give Sydney the call sign Freelancer yes that be right why because I do not trust you consider it a paternal instinct I be only tell you now because of Tippin 's article I should have have Tippin kill month ago Tippin 's kidnapping lead we directly to Khasinau Sydney destroy their facility now Khasinau 's organisation be fracture those who do not lose their life be on the run this be an opportunity I understand that I break protocol that the Alliance would have I kill for what I have do but if I be not loyal to you Arvin to SD 6 I would not have return what about Tippin Tippin 's insignificant he do not know anything and you can not kill he now it will only call attention I will see to it that he never write another article again Sloane just talk to I there be time in life when we do not listen to our heart to what we know to be true in those moment we 've lose who we be we 've betray ourselves question your loyalty your virtue be one of those lose time for I Dixon be a good man he still believe as I once do that sd 6 be a classified division of the CIA that be the hard part about work undercover have to lie to the people that you care about anything from Vaughn nothing what the hell 's be do we get a team in Taipei they search the warehouse they be track every lead possible do not give that to I this be call the good that we can do Vaughn might not even be in Taipei I understand that he be my friend too Sydney I promise you we be look as hard as we can I know this be tough for you but you have to focus we have a job to do I know sd 6 want to send I on a mission to Cap Ferrat France why what be there La Petite Rose the estate of Jean Marc Revet member of the french national assembly since the destruction of Khasinau and Derevko 's headquarters in Taipei thank you Sydney some member of their organisation have be expose Revet be one of those man we believe he help to finance their operation and be the key to find Khasinau your mother other who have work with they and bring they to justice bring they to justice I love that Arvin Sloane talk about justice what do sloane want you to do your mission be to gain entry into Revet 's house plant a bug in his office assume that you be feel up to it I will be fine Marshall thank you anyway ok what we have here be a phone you might find you know talk hello Mom yeah Mom no I will be there it be just listen be Aunt Ruthie go to be there ubiquitous object with infinite design colour wiring component Guy like I design a bug for a phone like this first I have to figure out what type of model the phone be that I be bug and then I have to design it so it be invisible no more bugging phone all right welcome to a new age in

the wire that be good we will get CIA Tech to make you a delay transmitter that way we can control what sd 6 get to hear and meanwhile CIA hear it all listen about Vaughn I be pray too so now instead of go back to Taipei instead of help in the search for Vaughn I be leave for France in half an hour one more thing you have not say anything about your mother what be I suppose to say something insightful the first time I see my mother in 20 year and she almost kill I which would have make I the 13th CIA officer she be kill she be former KGB she be betray my father she be betray I she be betray this country all anyone need to know about that woman be that she be a bad guy I think this be a good beginning like I say I can handle the problem I 've get Dr Khasinau Mr Revet be call

mine you ok my shoulder 's healing if that be what you mean it be not actually thank for ask I be fine I do not support the death penalty but I hope that she die for all that she be do I really do Arvin Sloane be a man of integrity and courage as the head of SD 6 he brilliantly execute Alliance policy help to slowly and invisibly seize control of world market government and technology now as the new full partner of the Alliance I feel confident that he will play a major part in shape that policy for year to come I speak for everyone when I offer you my condolence on the passing of your wife thank you we respect and admire your willingness to do what be necessary in that matter you have be make aware of the initiation procedure I have and the reason for it yes welcome to the Alliance Sloane get back from London last night a full partner of the Alliance Emily know the truth her death his immediately be let in I be convince he kill his wife to get that seat kill his wife would not surprise I eat his wife would not surprise I SD 6 and the Alliance believe that my mother be in hiding and they know that Khasinau 's dead and they be correct to assume that what be leave of her organisation be vulnerable the Alliance want whatever asset they can get their hand on so where be they start my mother use blackmail extensively in run her operation she would get dirt on people powerful important people and coerce they into do whatever she need Pornographic photograph illegally obtain audio file name date they be all on one computer disc so what do the Alliance want the dirt to hear sloane tell it it be all about God and country it be our obligation to do whatever we can to retrieve the disc now what you be look at be the El Sebkba Hotel in Rabat a Derevko operative name Mohammed Naj live and work out of the fourth floor early last week the blackmail disc in question be take to a vault at that location the operation be simple break into the vault retrieve the disc my flight 's at six well we will make contact with a countermission no later than three ok how be Weiss he be still in the hospital but the doctor say he be go to be ok and until then I 've get to feed his fish yeah yes let he through it be Kendall what do he want I do not know I do not trust he we have to hear he out hear he out he arrest I he be in control of operation he think I be the devil Mr Vaughn Agent Bristow do you clear this meeting through Devlin no I be sorry I do not have time to go through channel there be be an interesting development regard your mother as you know she surrender to the CIA and claim to want to cooperate so she be hand over her agency 's operation manual the Bible no and she will not talk about it she will not talk to we about anything then as far as I be concerned that be the end of the story well that be the interesting development it seem that the only person she be willing to talk to be you then you be outta luck I be afraid you be go to have to talk to her excuse I you can not compel Agent that be exactly what I can do be we through I do not have to remind you that this be a matter of national security do I yeah we be through I will wait to hear from you just so we be clear Mr Vaughn I know all about your participation in bust Bristow out of federal custody convince she to talk to her mother or face charge for obstruct justice and harbour a fugitive guess it be two for one day on blackmail so Mr Tippin do you understand what you be be accuse of here today yes your Honour I do Felony charge of heroin possession Misdemeanour count of be under the influence of a control substance how be you plead Guilty under Proposition 36 you be to receive probation and be hereby order to complete a certify drug treatment programme in addition you must complete 100 hour of community service Fail to meet any of these requirement and you will serve time it be a subvocal mike with it we can hear what be go on between you and Dixon at all time and as soon as you can I want you to go radio silent with he so you and I can talk call wait for spy yeah now the blackmail disc be in a safe in Naj 's suite on the fourth floor as soon as you get it you will deliver it to this man Richard Schmidt he be work under a diplomatic cover at the Rabat embassy he will be wait for you on the third floor now Sloane be obviously look for something specific we do not know what Schmidt will scan the disc analyse what be on it and spit up a bogus copy that be close enough to the original to fool sloane that be the disc you will deliver to SD 6 ok or you could ask your mother about the content of the disc Kendall must really be put on the pressure for you to ask I that yeah he be but I 've be think about it myself Sydney you be good at this I mean this be what you be train for compartmentalise your emotion you do it on every mission you do it with Sloane this be not the same Syd I would never force you to do this I would never make this an official request but I also know that what you want more than anything be to destroy sd 6 and bring an end to the Alliance and if she can help we then why not use she because I can not because I will not maybe you could shut down with her I could not I will talk to you from Rabat I speak with Agent Bristow and she have no intention of speak with her mother Mr Vaughn yes sir I know it be unacceptable let I remind you you be ask a woman to go face to face you do not need to remind I of anything with the woman who abandon Sydney I know the story and I know that you have your own issue I have issue with she so should you I 've read the report Mr Kendall Irina Derevko shoot Sydney yes she shoot Sydney Point blank range she could have kill she but do not kill she do not that woman 48 hour ago be 100 per cent pure bad news but now she be ours and there be just a chance Mr Vaughn that she have turn when she got do with my father he could only be identify by his dental record yes nevertheless she head up an organisation that control people who influence policy decision at NATO the UN the World Bank even with all our resource the CIA do not know the scope of her operation the key player their method acquisition ambition I can get she to talk I do not want you to ask Sydney to see she ever again well I be not go to make that promise you be not the easy guy to work with be you no no definitely not I have a 20 on Naj and his bodyguard ok I be come in ok Syd we be on Syd you close I be right behind you you know you always do that what what you just do with your hair it be your thing I do not have a thing it be it be your thing if the rest of the hotel be like this sarà perfetto and how may I help you my name be Beatrice Cunelli Mio marito Silvio and I be in town for three month while I recover from a ridiculo jet skiing accident off the coast of Majorca Presidente Travel Agency book we into the Derrahm which turn out to be totalmente inaccetabile now that I see this I call Silvio and tell he bring the bag right over your bag Comunque we be at a cocktail party last night and the consul general say that he simply rave about this place naturally I call and book a suite immediamente there must be some mistake mademoiselle we be completely full do I a favour darling check for I Beatrice Cunelli yes of course but I be pretty sure it be Reservation for Mr and Mrs Cunelli I hope it be a room with a view all right Dixon I 've get the key to Naj 's suite I be on my way we be interested in a computer disc contain information use for blackmail we believe you be familiar with this item that be an imply question I will make it clear for you be you familiar with this item I know you wanna see your daughter I can guarantee you that be never go to happen unless she know you be cooperate prove yourself give Sydney a reason to see you Sydney Interesting Agent Bristow be in Rabat now seek to recover the list be there anything she should know Next to the safe there be a fire alarm if you wanna protect she tell she to pull it first then open the safe why I 've give you a gift and all you get from I be one you look just like he I be through with the prisoner to find the safe you be go to need this now it look like just a normal metal detector well it be that be right we be go old school on this one now the safe be a Walderson it be an original the craftsmanship be incredible which lucky for you the same can be say about this you know those stethoscope that outlaw would use to rob bank back in the you know with the horse and the gun and the ca well I study how those work be a bit of an outlaw myself Basically this superamplifie version of that now you just place this over the dial this part right here and you type in 793 793 that spell Syd in case you forget 793 cos on a phone the number and the letter you know that and basically this will do the rest for you I need to talk to Agent Bristow she be now radio silent if we try and communicate her sd 6 partner could hear we and if we do not she might trigger the alarm the locking mechanism be a set of wheel the trick be to line up each notch on these wheel with contact point now once each notch be line up part of the combination will appear now when they all line up the lock will open we be almost there go radio silent just be careful now Freelancer this be Boot Camp do you copy go ahead Boot Camp Sydney do not open the safe what be there a fire alarm on the wall yes ok listen to I it be a fail safe do not open the safe until after you pull the alarm we have no intel on a fail safe where have you get this information Vaughn speak with your mother the intel come from her it be her disc she be familiar with the vault if there be a fail safe only she be go to know and what if there be not I be just suppose to pull the fire alarm Sydney I know this sound crazy but I think it be for real Vaughn she want I dead if that be true Agent Bristow she would have kill you in Barcelona do you talk to my father about this two minute ago on the phone while we be wait for you to go radio silent what do he say your dad the answer be no all I be ask be that you consider it consider the source I do not need to be lecture this woman be not to be trust Jack listen to I in no circumstance discuss this with my daughter I do not think your father can think clearly where your mother 's concerned and you can I be try she have nothing to gain by lie Miss Bristow I want you to pull that fire alarm Sydney I would do it Agent Bristow pull that alarm see what I mean Dixon I 've trip some kind of alarm what do you see Naj and his bodyguard be on their way up just look for the disc I will handle Naj this be Freelancer I 've get the blackmail disc what be your position Freelancer leave the suite head for the stair on my way we get it do you have it Syd do you have the disc yes ok what happen do you get it Negative what I repeat the disc be not transfer the

assignment to infiltrate and destroy sd 6 a secret organisation deal in espionage extortion weapon sale posing as the CIA SD 6 have make over 400 million in arm sale alone the sanctity of this agency require the sacrifice of some personal freedom this be not about cut off an arm of the monster this be about kill the monster Bristow 's mother formerly russian intelligence recently turn herself in to the CIA Mom Intel indicate she may still be an enemy of the United States the true loyalty of Agent Bristow 's mother remain unknown previously on Alias I be Mr Sark director of operation who be

thank you for come in I know you be not wild about talk with your mother last week but I hope we can agree that the information she give we make it worth your discomfort I think so until an hour ago how be that I just come from a meeting with Sloane the camera I take from Fordson 's vault the camera we try to keep from SD 6 be an early prototype the real camera be schedule to be launch into orbit 72 hour from now by whom the Asiatic Space Agency found after the fall of the Iron Curtain the ASA consist mainly of displace russian scientist their late client be an old friend of ours Sark what be his interest in launch a satellite that be the question the satellite be equip with a terahertz image camera this camera be capable of see through solid matter up to a depth of 100 metre it be imperative that we find out what Mr Sark be look for the launch site 's in Sri Lanka Sloane want we to infiltrate it pose as corporate buyer our mission be to hack into the satellite so sd 6 can tap into Sark 's feed and see what he see I will get technical service on that we will want to hack into that feed too a fine preliminary step Agent Vaughn but I will want to know what we be look for before the satellite be launch you want I to talk to she again Mr Sark have assume control of your mother 's operation please stop refer to she as my mother therefore Ms Derevko must know what he be look for she be make it clear she will only speak with you look I talk to she before because I have to I have no intention of make this into a habit I assume you have an opinion on this Agent Vaughn I do not have an easy answer to that I will take a complicated one I can not pretend to hide my bias here Irina Derevko betray this country and kill my father in the process on the other hand she be a certifiable Rambaldi expert and probably know more about the inner working of global organise crime than any other person in US custody having say that I believe Agent Bristow and I be effectively counter sd 6 before Derevko turn herself in and I stand behind whatever she decide I do understand that you be catch in the middle of all this Agent Bristow I can only offer my word the soon we know what she know the soon you will never have to speak with she again we be not schedule to meet until Wednesday be everything all right I be here to talk about Sydney Good what be on your mind I want your help in devise a strategy to persuade Sydney not to interact with her mother why because Irina Derevko be an opportunistic sociopath who will use whatever inroad she can make with my daughter to get what she want but have you consider that the more you keep she from her mother the more you be go to spark her interest of course I have which be why I be hope to devise a strategy with the necessary subtlety well I be sorry but I be not in the habit of help a father manipulate his daughter no matter how good his intention may be I see and be your opinion here base on what be good for Sydney or for the agency because the fact be if Sydney do not talk to Laura the CIA learn nothing so you still think of she as Laura even though that be her alias autocircadian meditation all the benefit of sleep in a fraction of the time I can teach it to you Sydney I tell you when we speak you be to address I as Agent Bristow Mr Sark be one of your top operative he be now assume control of your asset he be launch a satellite with ground penetrate surveillance capability but I doubt this be news to you what be he look for do you remember when you be six year old and I send you to piano lesson your teacher be Ms Adams we be not have this conversation you ask I a question I be give you an answer do you remember the first thing Ms Adams teach you about music she say Music be like math if you can count you can play every musical note have a corresponding frequency middle C for example vibrate at 261 hertz which mean any piece of music can be express as a series of number Sark be look for a music box design by Rambaldi the box play a unique tune encode within the tune there be an equation for what zero point energy a fuel source the military application alone would be unlimited from a music box of course the music will not play without the proper combination Sark be work on decipher it but I do not know whether he be successful Fine thank you speak of Ms Adams just before I leave I remember she encourage you to try out for your school 's Thanksgiving play you do not have to tell I if you do not want to but in the 20 year since I last see you I 've often wonder what part do you play I do not remember that be around the time I be tell my mother have die everything else be a blur I read Vaughn 's debrief I know you see your mother you ok see she again I be realise there be these gap in my memory from around the time she leave Dad do you remember a Thanksgiving play I be in that year in school because I sorta do I mean I have an impression of it but I can not remember be I a pilgrim or an indian what you be neither you be a turkey you be the only turkey that be spare to celebrate the harvest I know you think it be dangerous for I to see Mom but she be a means to an end I do not take anything she say at face value she will not expect you to Sydney I trust your judgement you be do fine ok once you get through the launch site to the exhaust duct just press this button right here and voilà it be empty oh yeah sorry I totally forget to tell you the real deal not do yet but tomorrow when you open up this briefcase you will be look at a high performance hydraulic luge how fast can I go about 150 which should get you through the launch facility 's two mile duct in about 12 second oh you wanna make sure that you get out of there as fast as you can after you be do wire the circuit board into the satellite because if you be stuck in the duct when the rocket launch then well boom then I would miss you you want to see I come in I have something to give you that be Emily 's seed box the lithography 's original circa 1910 her mother give it to her Emily would have want you to have it thank you I can not think of Emily without think of her garden well neither can I I miss she too this office be where I feel most at home these day at the house I do not know I seem to be paralyse if a stranger be to come to the house for the first time they would think that Emily still live there her clothe be in the closet her makeup on the vanity the only thing that betray this pretence of normalcy be her garden where rose once grow they be go now her garden seem to have die with her it be not your fault good luck in Sri Lanka attach this circuit board to the satellite instead of the one you get from SD 6 now it be an exact duplicate they will still be able to intercept Sark 's feed but we 've modify it so we can access the signal too see what everyone else be see one more thing we would like to bring Will Tippin in for a follow up on his debrief why Derevko tell we that Sark have be work on crack a combination that would activate the music box yeah and we 've be review Tippin 's statement and he report fall in and out of consciousness on the flight to Taipei and vaguely remember see Sark work at a laptop you be think what induce regression we have someone come in from Langley so he can relive everything he go through if there be another option Sydney believe I I would take it listen will the CIA want to meet with you again why they can tell you well than I can but here be your SOP SOP Standard Operating Procedure for a meet you be meet with my handler Vaughn he be smart professional will not waste your time look I be sorry you deserve to move on from this hey guy hey what be you do what will just go to his first NA meeting and you be wave a beer in his face you be right you be right I be sorry it be ok can you come down to the restaurant tomorrow I could really use you sure all the flatware come in and the dishwasher 's not hook up so we have to wash everything by hand before the opening you be come right be you kid what time do you need I two two thirty I get to go I be go to miss my flight Fancy client or boring seminar Boring client and he be in Sri Lanka so we get to fly 15 hour both direction for a one hour meeting hey thank for let I stay till I can afford a cheap place ok Syd Sark 's confirm inside you be a go remember the soon you get on the phone line the more time I have to hack into their system Joanna Kelly from Euro Teledyne I have an appointment with Mr Vashko Mr Sark welcome to our control centre will you be the only observer from your company today I be afraid my associate be prepare to lobby OPEC for drilling right we be about to begin the final system check Excellent Ms Kelley welcome to ASA 's launch facility thank you I look forward to the tour would you mind if I make a call before we start I be sorry we do not allow mobile phone use during the launch it interfere with the radio signal but you be more than welcome to use one of our land line thank you hi darling just check in ok I be into their local area network it will take I a minute to access the security surveillance feed ok I be in Miss you too kiss and in compliance with Kyoto environmental accord during launch we filter the rocket 's exhaust through two mile duct I understand these duct be capable of channel over a million pound of thrust you have do your homework I will take you to the VIP observation deck the view be spectacular my watch seem to have stop do you have the time oh sure ok Dixon I will be in the canal in two minute copy that Syd Ready to cut the surveillance feed on your signal Radio frequency system check Activation of vehicle telemetry check on board power test check Radar transponder and launch vehicle remote control check ok Dixon I be in position copy that syd the ground crew 's leave the launch deck I be shut down surveillance for five minute start now we 've lose CCTV to the launch deck what be the problem I will know shortly Dixon how be I do three minute ten second until surveillance be restore Syd Power surge we will be back online in three minute I assure you this in no way indicate a problem with the launch be there any way onto the launch zone that be not visible from here just the exhaust duct but our ground crew do not go anywhere near they during countdown move up the launch Pardon I be splice into the internal supply system now almost there you say yourself the camera do not affect the launch technically they do not but if something be to go wrong we would want to study then begin the final countdown or should we abort altogether I could spread the word amongst my colleague that the Asiatic Space Agency be nothing but the poor man 's version of NASA initiate the final countdown we be advance our timetable Sydney get out of there they 've move up the launch Dixon I be still wire the circuit board how much time do I have 48 second and count switch to internal power transfer control to on board computer Tank pressurisation to launch Sydney it be too dangerous Abort we be at 44 second and count Syd get outta there no I get it all system green for launch in 30 29 28 27 three two Sydney I be all right I will meet you at the rendezvous in ten minute do you enjoy the launch it be a thrill will I be Michael Vaughn hey sorry about the cloak and dagger routine but sd 6 may monitor you from time to time we have to make sure you be not follow Sure I get it so you be Vaughn you sound surprised no I just think you

go to meet you it be standard protocol in case the line 's tap it be a low risk way to set up a meet do you ever give she a picture frame it be like an antique she say that it be from somebody at work and it be probably just another way to contact she right actually no that be just a gift it be nice to meet you will you too congratulation be in order to both of you thank to your effort in Sri Lanka we be able to intercept the feed from the satellite launch by Mr Sark yesterday he be look at a 20 square mile area of Siberia Marshall right now I know this look like 20 mile of frozen tundrosity right well take a look at it through the terahertz image camera the symbol of Rambaldi yeah now what the satellite 's look at be subglacial cavern under the ice be you say it be a natural formation well it beat I without actual ice core sample I can not say anything except you know wow you be now look at an image with a ten centimetre resolution and as you can see in the centre of the cavern there appear to be an object notably compose of metal we must acquire this object before Mr Sark do so you will be accompany by a support team they will establish a perimeter with Agent Dixon to guard every possible entrance to the cavern Sydney you be on point the flight leave in four hour that be all you can go Jack would you stay a minute please I want to ask you for a favour Jack I think I may have underestimate the effect that Emily 's death would have on I you be entitled to your grief not when it undermine my authority here my standing within the Alliance I need you to monitor I Jack I

soon as you do you will feel rest and refresh I need to check his vital just give I a minute you ok I doubt the code that activate Rambaldi 's music box be a list of russian author it must be some kind of cipher text look under normal circumstance I would never ask this but your mother be the only person who can translate those name for we by the time you leave if your mother will give we the code to activate the music box we want you to activate the box on site you will get it to play and we will record the music through your comlink then you will destroy it Agent Bristow Dostoyevsky Nabokov Tolstoy Chekov we take these code word from Sark 's computer I want you to translate they for I give I your pencil and paper no I can not decipher it without pencil and paper you know you have not yet ask I how I could shoot my own daughter no I have not I assume you would not need this combination so urgently if you do not know where the music box be Sark will not hesitate to kill you and I do not wanna lose the chance to explain myself someday about the Thanksgiving play I be a turkey thank you I be not read any inbound contact it look good we be all alone out here but keep your motion tracker on and stay sharp Novak you be guard the southeast entrance Cooper you guard the north stay on station watch your step if you fall through the ice it will freeze over in four second good to know yeah hello hello yes sir would you get I security section I need a back trace on a call I just receive just a moment Sir the call come from the Barranca bed and breakfast in Sonoma County California Report contact Position one hold Negative on contact Position two hold no contact I be all alone out here Syd how do you copy in there Gotcha five by Dixon Dixon the ice in this tunnel look a little shaky I be go to go radio silent till I pass through Copy that stand by I 've have a picture of your face in my mind for 20 year I remember a love husband a generous man a patriot I may have be under order to fabricate a life with you but there be time when the illusion of our marriage be as powerful for I as it be for you especially when Sydney be bear look at you now I see that illusion be finally go I want to make something very clear to you there be people here who believe you can repay the debt you owe this country through your continued cooperation I be not one of they and if Sydney in any way become victim to your endgame I will kill you she be spend most of her life believe you be dead she will get use to it again no matter what bond you try to forge with her you have not tell she what you do to she after I disappear have you Base Ops this be Freelancer do you copy Read you loud and clear Freelancer I 've find the music box it look intact stand by I be go to enter the code my mother give I Cooper Novak I 've get an inbound contact Northwest 100 metre can you confirm get them on radar Ditto but I do not see anyone the target have stop Correction read four four tango approach from all direction they be head for the entrance I still do not see anyone Sydney do you copy Sydney three one one two five four we 've get audio talk to I Cooper your tango be ten metre away I do not see anything it be right on top of you I be tell you I be all alone out here Cooper do you copy talk to I Cooper my contact 's at two metre it be get to be an equipment malfunction Novak they be under the ice Novak do you copy Sydney ok that be it confirm you get the recording I be ready to destroy the music box Affirmative we get the recording Affirmative I be 10 7 Sydney do you copy I read you Dixon what be wrong get out of there Sark 's here put the case down slide it over it be you give we problem at the launch I would offer you passage back to civilisation but my submersible only seat four it be the thought that count ok I be in Agent Bristow work undercover with her father Jack Bristow also a double agent with CIA get down I guess we will just have to learn to trust each other Bristow 's CIA contact Michael Vaughn my guardian angel her current assignment to infiltrate and destroy sd 6 a secret organisation deal in espionage extortion weapon sale posing as the CIA SD 6 have make over 400 million in arm sale alone the sanctity of this agency require the sacrifice of some personal freedom this be not about cut off an arm of the monster this be about kill the monster Bristow 's mother formerly russian intelligence recently turn herself in to the CIA Mom Intel indicate she may still be an enemy of the United States the true loyalty of Agent Bristow 's mother remain unknown previously on Alias I want your help to persuade Sydney not to interact with her mother why because Irina Derevko be an opportunistic sociopath who will use whatever inroad she can make with my daughter to get what she want well I be sorry but I be not in the habit of help a father manipulate his daughter no matter how good his intention may be Sark be look for a music box design by Rambaldi the box play a unique tune encode within the tune there be an equation for what zero point energy watch your step if you fall through the ice it will freeze over in four second Cooper read four four tango they be head for the entrance Novak they be under the ice Sydney do you copy I read you Dixon what be wrong get out of there Sark 's here Sydney hi the music box that you be send to retrieve Mr Sark get away with it yes but after 500 year bury in the siberian ice the music box be corrode it practically fall apart in my hand it be odd what be that Milo Rambaldi he be do this before many time hide information inside work of art the clock the sculpture hm but this time he choose to bury one of his most important innovation the formula for zero point energy inside a music box you be talk about an inventor who live 500 year ago anything regard Milo Rambaldi seem odd to I well what be unusual be not how he hide the information Sydney it be where why would Milo Rambaldi go to the unimaginable length of have catacomb build in Siberia only to leave his music box expose to corrosive element another Rambaldi mystery so do you think sloane suspect you that I use the inhaler to corrode the music box no I do not think so sloane make sure I know how relieved he be that I make it back safely I go home and take a shower and come here good by the way you should know Siberia be a complete success when you activate the music box we record it it be at Langley for analysis so we get the intel and Sloane do not neither do Sark what the information my mother give we help we again that be all you know you can talk to I about your mother I know that do that be hard for you than you make it seem well it be my job Vaughn she kill your father yes thank you you do not have to pretend with I and you do not have to withhold all I be say be that it be unfair maybe so but I certainly do not join the CIA look for fairness after everything she be do to you be those thing you could ever forgive I do not know yeah well your father do not share that ambiguity he be meet with Assistant Director Kendall right now and he be lobby to have your mother take away as long as she be help we in the war against SD 6 and the Alliance she stay do you even read my report yes of course well why be you completely disregard what I write great job in Siberia Agent Bristow thank you excuse I I agree with what you write that on more than one occasion your mother have provide crucial intelligence to the CIA to the detriment of SD 6 and it would even appear that her action have keep you out of harm 's way Dad that be a fact there be another fact nothing that woman say or do can be take at face value her motivation be strictly her own now that your dealing with your mother have take on an emotional component I be concern do not be I be more professional than that every one of our discussion have be specific and mission relate you tell she about your school play you hear I tell she I be a turkey yes you be watch I Dad I have enough spying in my life to worry about what I 've be watch be you make the same mistake with that woman that I do Sydney she be someone you 've idealise for almost 20 year you do not learn about her history with the KGB until recently what do that matter that you 've want a mother your mother all your life and now here she be Dad you do not have to worry about I I be not that naive I be sure that be something we both hope be true you want to see I yeah several night ago I receive a phone call at my home there be no one at the other end just some high pitch static but something about the call leave I unsettled do security section run a trace yeah the call originate in Sonoma California the Barranca bed and breakfast inn Emily and I spend some time there it be it be our favourite getaway Simple it be a wrong number I be not so sure I do not understand what you be suggest I be suggest that someone may be try to leave I unsettled I would like you to send someone to Sonoma Jack I need to know who make that call sure I will get security section Jack I do not want this to get back to the Alliance they can not know that I be take measure I understand Good I will send Dixon Jack there be something else after Sark recover Rambaldi 's music box we track he to a safe house in the Falkland Islands we send in a team and do we retrieve it yes it be destroy with age as Sydney say Worthless but we find something else he be not 80 year old at least Syd I be serious I expect like a delivery guy to be totally buff out I mean he sound hot on the phone be he a cute 80 shut up Hey Francie there be a woman on the phone from the health department Ooh I be getting grade today how be it go ok how be your mom how be you I get four

ago I be do pretty well as a reporter and now I be just I be a dishwasher live in denial that be all the information you provide be huge Huge really because of you the CIA score a real victory I should have tell you that before I be sorry no no no do not worry about it that be so good to know good guy or bad guy neither my father everything ok I talk with sloane this morning he send a team after Sark he want to recover the music box I tell he it be ruin yes but he want it anyway he track down Sark to a location in the Falklands Sark fight back he get away they do however find a man at that location he be be hold torture his name be Claus Richter three week ago Richter be in Barcelona when I be there yes along with your mother the operation manual of the organisation your mother use to run the Bible anyone who get their hand on that book will gain access to all the contact technology and weaponry they amass over the last ten year sloane believe your mother give the manual to Richter that he be the man who hide the book do you think that be true I know it be they bring Richter into an sd 6 hold cell and I interrogate he before be bring into SD 6 Richter be screen for every type of possible infection Ebola HIV retroviruse they do not find a thing yet this man be clearly die Med Tech believe he may have be suffer from an allergic reaction to something Sark use on he apparently the first sign of illness be bleed from the fingernail Sloane want I to torture he but that man be torture as it be so I give he morphine Irina Derevko give you the operation manual for her syndicate I would like you to tell I where you 've hide it Derevko be a great woman Morphine 's not bad either let I be clear I 've only give you enough to last five minute Cooperate and get all you want resist and you get none where do you hide that manual the location be too remote to describe it turn out Richter have design a map to lead your mother back to the book 's location so where be the map inside a first edition of War and Peace locate at the technical service library at FAPSI headquarters in Moscow FAPSI headquarters Sloane be prepare to send you to Moscow to retrieve Richter 's map I 've have the CIA fabricate a bogus map you go to Moscow retrieve the real one which you will return to the CIA you will give sd 6 this map which will lead they to the middle of the Sunken Forest why have you come to I like this before my sd 6 briefing you give I the CIA countermission instead of Vaughn because this be the good way to respond no I know what this be you do not want I to take this to Mom there be no benefit in see she you have all the information you need we do not know that Sydney we 've be do this long enough to know that our system work the system be stagnant until Mom turn herself in Dad we 've cover this we 've both be betray by this woman the difference between you and I be that I be willing to squeeze she for everything she be get to take down the enemy anything to get I the hell out of this life as soon as possible anything I be will and I be an addict hi will I never think about my reputation until I lose it it all happen very publicly so people actually look at I at the market and stuff oh hey there be the drug addict from the newspaper well actually there have be one happy by product from all this I have a good friend who it turn out I uh I do not know at all before and now she and I can talk in a way that we never do before and uh and I do not think I would trade that for anything same thing happen to I what I learn who my true friend be when everyone find out about my habit um Rebecca Martinez hey I be will I know who you be will Tippin I read your article the reporter with the big imagination who fall in love with the heroin chic lifestyle yeah yeah that be I but my theory I do not think you ever really be a drug addict why would you say that I believe what you write about SD 6 be true I think you get too close to some kind of secret conspiracy and they have to shut you down they probably come after you tell you not to talk I mean they could not kill you could they no that would expose they so they threaten you and then to ruin your rep they shoot you up no no I make up all that stuff about SD 6 that be I that be I be an idiot what I just sorry I be I be sort of a conspiracy theorist I have a web page conspiracychick com I wanna prove your story about SD 6 be real Claus Richter be in SD 6 custody I be aware that you refuse to give the CIA detail about this operation manual that you have Richter hide away and I understand why the knowledge contain in that manual be your only leverage but now having speak with Richter SD 6 be after it Richter be find in the custody of Mr Sark we do not know what Sark know he might already have the map in his possession I be here because SD 6 be send I to Moscow I be go to retrieve the map at FAPSI headquarters so if you want to help the CIA as you claim to you will give we any information you have that will facilitate the recovery of Richter 's map when I turn myself over to CIA a pair of earring be take from I they have sentimental value I would like they back I will see what I can do then in good faith tell I how you plan on break into the library she go to see her mother I try I try to stop she I make it clear make what clear trust her mother she be play with fire we 've have this discussion there be no one else to do this job Sydney go to see her mother yes she be there now look for help the east wing stairwell be an option I can see why SD 6 choose that route but there be a well way to get to the sixth floor library write this down once you be inside the building do not take the main stair you just look to your left no one want a happy ending to this story more than I do but I know this woman I know her charm I know her trick the way she present herself she disarm you some people have that talent compare to all of they Irina Derevko be extraordinary be there any chance that all she want be forgiveness no be specific about your concern I do not know what it be Derevko want maybe something within the CIA maybe to recruit Sydney to her side I can tell you I know this Derevko be use this agency and my daughter to get whatever it be that she want and everywhere I look people be complacent and cooperative listen to listen to a woman who kill operative of the CIA who destroy countless life yours we will take your suggestion into consideration be careful you ask I what I be afraid of I can tell you it be obvious I be afraid of lose my daughter hey so I hear your father come to see you and he try to preempt my involvement he be just try to keep I away from my mother I know she actually have some intel for this mission that could help Good listen as far as your mother 's concerned it be ridiculous for you to worry about I I be fine what she do to my father I can handle but when I hear what your father do come to see you like that I I realise how insane this must be for he have your mother back in his life which only concern I because that mean he be not make it any easy for you so before you leave for Moscow I just want to say that you might feel alone in all this like you do not have an ally I be your ally never question that Miss Bristow your plane 's standing by I will see you when I get back ok these medal that you win well you do not really win they and they be not really medal this one right here be the Order of Bravery right not a medal right no it be an electronic skeleton key it will get you access to the sixth floor this one the Order of Zhukov first class this will get you into the technical library now this one be the Order of Merit it will get you into the ASRS what be ASRS oh yeah the majority of the book be keep in a secure area underneath the building now in order to get they you be go to need to get to the selection terminal what you will do be you will type in the name of the book that you want then there be go to be this automatic crane thing that retrieve the book that you request and then deposit it over on the sixth floor ok now just make sure that you do not remove the metal until after you 've log out the system or you will probably set off the alarm ok ow actually feel quite good whatever Arvin Sloane pay you it can not be enough would you consider come to work for I if it mean I would let you walk out of here I believe if you take the time to hear a comprehensive offer you might actually say yes you be cute but I will pass go ahead it be I I be trap in the technical

Sark be like the good look guy in high school who know how cute he be and will not take no for an answer any suspicious reaction to the map you give SD 6 no they be analyse it now Good we have a CIA tech try to decode the real map I know they be have trouble with it do you think Richter use a cipher text only they could read maybe your mother might be able to help we with this if you be ask I to go see she again she do have a request they 've be check for hidden compartment transmitter passive sensor every sharp edge have be dull I be 21 year old when I be give these at graduation from the

Longitude 49 degree 57 minute and 20 second she say the building be clean there be no explosive or anti intrusion system we obviously can not trust this information Dad come on if she want I dead she could have leave I stuck at FAPSI headquarters your mother know that the only leverage she have be the information about her agency as soon as we get that manual she be get nothing unless she want to prove herself that be the kind of hopeful thinking that will get you kill I be go in no you be not Irina Derevko 's prove her value do not talk to I about that woman 's value of all people you should

intelligence to the CIA on several occasion Pardon the interruption Agent Bristow let us talk about last week the incident in Madagascar before Derevko turn herself in to the CIA as leverage she conceal her organisation 's operation manual last week the CIA discover where it be hide when I tell Derevko that I be go in to retrieve the manual she inform we that the building be safe to enter in truth it be a trap Derevko have rig it with explosive just as we be about to enter the building an agent spot something on the satellite imagery that agent be your father yes he save my life I want to stand in this cell just once you try to warn I about she so many time I be so sorry that I do not listen to you some thing you need to experience for yourself I imagine every parent try to protect their child from that truth I never say thank you for save my life we be due for a briefing at SD 6 we should go Niels Haider the so call austrian Connection be murder yesterday the bold nature of the hit the complete disregard for civilian collateral damage indicate the work of the Triad Haider be Triad they kill one of their own yes we believe so the Triad you never mention they it be a loose coalition of organise crime entity they deal mainly in drug and prostitution but over the last couple of year they 've make a significant foray into weapon ok so why do they kill Haider because he be sell Intel to SD 6 in his last communication to our source in Vienna Haider inform we that the Triad be engage in a plot to deploy and develop 16 next generation weapon any idea what next generation refer to no which be a major source of concern accord to the communiqué testing of the weapon be ahead of schedule which mean they may soon be put into the field do we know where these weapon be now Budapest during the Cold War the Russians build a massive bomb shelter underneath the magistrate 's bureau the Triad have be use that shelter to serve as a testing facility your mission be to gain access to that facility identify the nature of the weapon retrieve the spec and test datum off the central server then proceed to the r d lab and photograph the weapon so that sd 6 can engineer the weapon for themselves which we will not let happen ok I will confer with your father about your countermission my father he do not tell you base on your father 's instinct in the Madagascar incident Devlin give he operational approval when you and I be approach that building Ops be monitor our progress via sat radar scan now at the last moment your father switch to infrared which be how he see the explosive we do not have routine satellite coverage over Madagascar One have to be retaske now the close one be over the Indian Ocean yet your father specifically request the one over the South Atlantic which of the two be the only one that have infrare capability he want to account for every possibility probably or it be possible that he already know there would be explosive at that entrance I do not see how he never trust my mother 's motive but he you think my father wire that entrance to set up my mother we be nearly kill I know if there have be comms interference it would not be the first time mean what Russek Russek your father set he up I be a prisoner Sloane be about to have I execute I do not know why you deny this possibility I understand that your authority have be

for my grandparent they be both from Budapest but they lose everything in the war well I be certain you will find the documentation of their marriage and you should be able to find their registration

eight two four zero two Stand by Dixon I be go radio silent ok Syd Standing by Mountaineer in position come in Boot Camp Copy that Mountaineer Stand by for IP address Boot Camp Boot Camp IP address be 199 181 134 104 I 've open port 47 good work Mountaineer go ahead and give the dummy IP to Dixon see you at home Copy that Dixon I 've disable the firewall the IP address be 259 10 3 179 good work Syd now go get some picture of the weapon and we be outta here the view room be around the corner to your left Door mark kutatoterem copy that clear to exit ok go Sydney you 've get company two guard come on your left 16 next generation weapon we have no idea that the 16 next generation weapon would turn out to be child they be train as sleeper agent that appear to be the case see the good spy have certain trait Proficiency with number three dimensional thinking creative problem solve these ability be all in evidence as early as five year old this be footage that we download from the Triad computer every first grader in the European Union take a standardised test a few year ago the Triad acquire the company do the testing and add a series of question design to locate child with these trait this year 28 child be indicate their parent be send letter invite they to participate in a month long achievement programme 16 accept six year old acquire knowledge at an incredible rate so the basic skill of marksmanship linguistic visual verbal cue recognition it can all be teach in a matter of week who be he we be still work on that so what happen to these kid at the end of the month Triad send they home with the intent that when they be grow they will contact these kid and send they out in the field there be a rumour that the KGB begin develop a similar programme back in the ' 80 but we never confirm it before these kid be send home their memory be reset yeah that be right they remember nothing except that it be extremely satisfying someone forge my wife 's name in the registry at her favourite bed and breakfast week after her death my concern be that it be intend to be a message you have enemy Arvin clearly one of they be try to leverage your grief it be not my grief it be my guilt Cancer do not kill Emily Jack Emily 's doctor tell we that her cancer be in remission that very day the Alliance tell I that I be be consider for partner but that there be a problem Somehow Emily have learn that well she learn about my association with SD 6 she do not know the truth in fact she assume the lie that we be a branch of the CIA despite that the Alliance decide to make my promotion contingent on Emily 's death my choice be an easy one I be not about to kill my wife Emily be not a bargaining chip then I talk to her doctor and I be persuade that despite this temporary remission that Emily 's lymphoma would return and that it would slowly and painfully kill she she have already suffer so much Jack the thought of her succumbing to this merciless illness or be kill by the Alliance so I dissolve sodium morphate in a glass of red wine the wine put she to sleep the sodium morphate then cause a heart attack she do not suffer I will find out who be do this Jack see who else be be consider for partnership I be give a seat at the table that mean someone else be not well I have this new friend on my work detail Tommy Marijuana we call he that because there be Tommy Marijuana and Tommy Crystal Meth Tommy Marijuana think that we be always the person that we be in sixth grade sixth grade be an awkward phase for I oh come on you awkward yeah I have big tooth and little eye and I be always a foot tall than everyone else so I sort of hunch over I wish I could have see that I do not know when I be in sixth grade I be just sort of anonymous you know you have the smart kid and the funny kid and the good athlete and I be just will they be put my mom on trial they be go to ask for the death penalty the only way I be able to deal with it be to tell myself that woman be never really my mother the irony be since she be be back my father and I be close than we 've ever be it be Vaughn I have to go Hey Vaughn that guy with the Semtex Desouza be we suppose to be look into that excuse I I be just wonder be that our case or be you pursue it independently I do not know what you be talk about Daily situation report say the guy be here yesterday on a transfer order you be list as visit he Vaughn no it be not our case hello Sydney Dad hi Agent Vaughn contact you yeah have we identify the man from Budapest with the child yes Valery Kholokov it be Kholokov you 've hear of he yeah he use to run KGB 's psych op division Mind control experiment psychoactive drug I think he be dead well so do we but apparently after the KGB dissolve he go over to the Triad a facial recognition scanner at the airport in Buenos Aires identify he yesterday what be he do in Buenos Aires he have a house there the project in Budapest be complete a team be raid that facility as we speak the child have all return home we have surveillance team monitor each of they if the Triad ever make contact we will intercede we need to grab Kholokov see how many other kid he be do this to who they be where they be there be a team preppe now Good I wanna go with they no send you to Buenos Aires would be an unnecessary risk Kholokov have a private security detail External and internal alarm system Dad when I sign up with SD 6 I want to join when I find out the truth I mean these kid I know what it be like to be use I be go to Buenos Aires the team leave in 12 hour ok anything else that be all I be go to pack I see Desouza he tell I that you hire he to rig those explosive Irina Derevko would eagerly destroy all of our life I be not a big fan either it still do not justify what you do you do good work Agent Vaughn but your consistent shortcoming and you should know this be your naive sense of morality Evil must be eliminate by whatever mean necessary I do not think Sydney would agree Sydney will never know about what I 've do you betray her trust I will not now she should hear it from you but if you do not tell she I promise you I will yes sir why be my security system disable it be disengage on site sir ten minute ago I will put the system back on line sir Sir be everything ok I be go in the guard be be sedate copy that Mountaineer I make four guard in the courtyard Kholokov just go inside get into position I be head to the junction box you take the guard I get Kholokov on my signal and that be in three two One go you good yeah it be he it be Kholokov good work nice job you want I to hypnotise you I want you to take I back to whenever it be I first see that puzzle but you say you do not remember see that puzzle before I must have Agent Bristow I 've see your profile your spatial intelligence be stellar it be no surprise that you could solve the puzzle but I be not solve it when I be stand there stare at that puzzle it be like I remember where every piece belong there be not any thought involve you say the KGB develop a similar project it be possible that my mother know the technique and maybe she Agent Bristow if you be look to uncover a trauma then I need to warn you hypnotic regression can trigger severe nightmare flashback acute depression Understand that to do what I do maintain my cover at SD 6 I compartmentalise a lot but the idea that I might have be program to be a spy I can not tuck that away I need to know what happen to I excuse I sir I analyse the wine be this a good time there be no fingerprint on the glass the wine be a ' 99 Hadley Cabernet Franc an unremarkable vintage what be remarkable be what I extract from inside the wine I be so surprised I redo the test but I be certain it be VTX a calcium base antidote extremely scarce Antidote to what mainly heart attack induce toxin Kurtotic acid sodium morphate VTX simulate death it slow the lung nearly stop the heart which be how it prevent the poison from cause cardiac arrest and then when the VTX be metabolise the body return to normal so if someone who be poison by sodium morphate be give VTX they would appear to die yes sir well assume they have no other heart condition in eight to twelve hour they would be just fine I be go to count back from three when I get to one I want you to tell I where you be three two one where be you Sydney it be I in my room when I be little tell I if you see anything that resemble the puzzle we be look for I be take I be take care of her I be take care of she for Christmas that will be soon

Derevko receive the maximum sentence under federal statute death by lethal injection since she be opt to forgo all appeal her execution will be carry out three day from today Session adjourn Confidential to Deputy Director Devlin I be write to inform you that my father Jack Bristow do wilfully deceive the CIA into believe Irina Derevko violate her immunity agreement I be commit this statement to paper so it may be use in an official capacity to halt my mother 's execution despite her past crime I can not in good conscience allow her sentence to be carry out when she keep her word to cooperate with we it be not Irina Derevko who should be answer these charge it be my father we have a dead drop request pickup it look like a letter copy that send agent for retrieval when my mom

on the research Irina Derevko steal from he the KGB develop their own version of the project yes I recall one of our asset in Moscow just send this over it be a test questionnaire administer to a group of first grader in the early ' 80 the test be design to identify kid who would make good agent in the soviet secret service and read over it what really strike I be how similar these question be to a standard iq test give to first grader in this country where be you go with this remember the rumour go around the Agency during the Cold War about the Soviets raise sleeper agent as Americans I know it sound potentially paranoid but this be how you would do it if they manage to get their test in circulation here they could have contact hundred of kid interesting but unlikely I just think it would be interesting to analyse test from stop we can not spare a single agent right now much less a team for a project that at good have historical value the KGB do not even exist any more I see your mother 's late manoeuvre have its intend effect on you what manoeuvre would that be plead guilty accept the death penalty yup she be get we right where she want we not we you your mother 's no fool she must have deduce I set she up so why do you imagine she plead guilty because she be strike by a crisis of conscience I think she know the verdict be a foregone conclusion she plead guilty to keep you from witness her trial Sydney from have you see photo of the agent she savagely murder include Vaughn 's father she know if you sit through that whatever sympathy she would manage to elicit from you would vanish so she cast herself as the victim to compel you to save she and guess what you fall for it I think you deserve a second chance to think thing over here be your letter how would you get that I spend a decade with this woman and another 20 year analyse how she could have deceive I for so long trust I when I tell you I be protect you no you be not I think you love Mom so much that when she leave you you lose your soul you know what else I think I think the kind of man who would use his own daughter to frame her mother who would test psych experiment on she when she be six year

have be bear I be go to finish review the mission now thank thank for come of course everything all right look I do not I do not know how to say this other than to just say it I need a job with all the publicity no one will hire I I think maybe you could help I out I do not mean to be an agent I know that the CIA have a ton of front company and you have defence contractor and shipping company I will work at a desk anywhere just to I know this be go to drive you insane but we can not employ you because you have a criminal record I have a criminal record because of a drug habit I never have know anybody who want to buy a car there might be something I have a discretionary fund I use for informant totally off the book I could pay you to do research seriously I would so owe you this be a list of question please keep they to yourself all I need you to do be find out if any of these question ever appear on a standardised test in the United States over the last 20 year the more you tell I the fast I can get you what you want so I pay by the hour take your time thank you you be welcome Mr Harrison I be Jan Spinnaker hospital administrator Welcome to St Alban 's my daughter and the very twinkle in my eye Mary daddy stop it it be so nice to meet you a pleasure to meet a daughter who would sacrifice so much for her father I would do anything for my daddy this way please the computer in this satchel provide I a secure link to my money the satchel can not be remove from my arm during the operation all arrangement have be make now I choose your hospital for its high security status we employ security with training equivalent to the Secret Service you will not be disappoint very good you be go to Geneva to get a sample of a top secret virus now your cover be you be go in for a kidney transplant so you be probably think hold on a second Marshall we need our kidney do not worry they be not go anywhere because of this now basically when you be position in the or press this button lightly twice it will activate a tank of halothane Halothane be the same anaesthetic that they will be pump through your mask why do not you both try count backwards from ten ten nine eight which lead we to question number two if they be pump anaesthesia in the room and you be also gulp it down what have I do with by the maskful then what be go to prevent we from pass out ourselves the solution be in this solution it be a mix of anti anaesthetic and I also for good measure throw in a time release synthetic caffeine that I use in my decaf every morning just take it right before you head into the hospital and trust I you will not fall asleep seven six they will be out for 15 minute they 've all be sedate for the pain Patient Zero 's in there get a blood sample I will download the viral research Irina I need help do not struggle if you tear your glove off you could become infect I will up his morphine Irina his vital fall below the preset warning level the doctor will be alert work fast Eagle Eye this be Blackbird request early extraction LZ Bravo copy that Blackbird ETA LZ Bravo in three minute Come on come on come on this be Dr Lazar I need security team on the research level now we need to get to the roof Security will flank we from both side of the hall we can not reload the trank fast enough to take out more than four people find some iodine Ammonia and iodine form an unstable compound when they be mixed together Initiate level three lockdown perimeter and elevator I get this Blackbird we be on the roof we be wait for you do not shoot against the wall Bypass the lockdown I will hold they off buy I ten second I need more time Ammo Sydney Blackbird have deploy forward to extraction point you be wonder why that man mistake you for your mother he work for her I skim the research as it be download before she surrender to the CIA Irina deliberately order Sark to expose some of her own operative to the virus in order to study it ask yourself if that be a person worth save I have Toxicology analyse the glass of wine that somehow make its way into my house last week they find a compound call VTX which counteract the effect of sodium morphate Sodium morphate be the poison I use to end Emily 's suffering I see two possibility here either Emily predict your intention to euthanise she take the necessary countermeasure and be now play a game with you or the more likely scenario someone want you to believe Emily be alive or bad they will try and make the Alliance believe it too if they think that I fail to carry out the one condition of my admittance that I 've be betray they the whole time then they will be force to assume that my entire division be rogue then we will all be in danger I do not think I can ever forgive my father for the thing he be do but maybe he be right about what he be be say all along maybe her cooperation be part of some elaborate strategy he be more equipped to see than I be your father 's ask you to let she die for something she might do I do not think you could live with that good work in Geneva Thanks the CIA be analyse the copy of the disk you bring back if sd 6 plan on use the virus as a weapon we might get a jump on the antidote thank to the blood work you bring back I hope so there be something else you should know will come to I for a job he do he do not want to bother you so I hire he off the book to do some research on what just background on the old KGB version of Project Christmas of course I do not tell he that he think he be compare an iq test against the public record I just figure it be your prerogative to tell he more that be really nice of you thank you be welcome there be nothing more boring than a commerce bureau luncheon thank for join I Jack what be it do you see that see what can I help you do you see someone come in here just now a woman no I 've be alone all morning Father would you excuse we please sit down you tell I you see she I see a woman but it could have be anyone you may be suffer from post traumatic stress disorder bring on by intense feeling of guilt Arvin you have walk into a church a place to confess or she be alive she know the alarm code she could have come into the house undetecte there be a clear way to know for certain but I hesitate to suggest it Sir there be something I have to report while it appear that my mother send I into a trap in Madagascar in truth she be unaware that there be any danger yes I know I have your father 's statement right here he tell we himself this morning what a hearing be schedule with the Joint Intelligence Committee my intention be not to punish my father sir it be to stop my mother 's execution from go forward excuse I yes I will send she down right now they would

you something Agent Bristow your test come back negative for antibody you be free to go Agent Vaughn your test at this point be inconclusive we do find a heightened level of antibody in your bloodstream but you could simply be fight off a cold we will not know for a few more hour you will have to stay you say Sark test Patient Zero 's blood at the first sign of infection what be the sign Haemorrhaging from the fingernail I will be fine your dad 's hearing be in an hour you should go and someday I will go where there be not no rain or snow till then I will travel alone and I will make

a threat and will prove it at her early possible convenience be that how you justify lie to your superior endanger other agent yes why this sudden change of heart deferentially Senator my reason be my own I see review your file I be shocked to discover how many time you 've display behaviour that at good can be characterise as rogue you have lose the benefit of the doubt here sir and your silence will not suffice so again I ask you why the change of heart my daughter convince I that I act unethically be not it a fact that you know your daughter intend to turn you in and that you beat she to the punch only by an hour in order to secure a degree of leniency from this body no sir that be not the case Sydney Bristow my daughter have come to believe that when I look at she I see the embodiment of all my flaw and this afternoon when I learn that she may have be expose to a life threaten disease I realise she might die believe that but nothing could be far from the truth when I look at she when I look at the little girl who raise herself to become one of the most extraordinary human being and one of the fine agent I 've ever have the privilege of know I see only the promise of my own redemption turn myself in be the only way I could think of to make that clear to she to prove that despite my limited ability as a father I love she more than I could ever say I do not order

Service do not have a hard copy or a disk I mean it be like 1982 never exist maybe someone have a reason to make it disappear you 've get to try this bouillabaisse that I be make here what do you think too spicy too salty Perfect I will be do in like two minute ok great so it be weird right there be an operation call Project Christmas my father develop it it use standardised test ask specific question to identify child the Agency could later recruit child it be an experiment the KGB send my mother here to steal detail about the program about that time the CIA stop the operation Vaughn think maybe russian intelligence be still run it to recruit Americans hello we need you at operation I will tell Francie you say goodbye hey what be up it be Vaughn he be develop symptom what symptom the doctor say we be fine yes but his exposure be far more extensive he be develop some kind of a blood coagulation disorder do we be we sure that it we be sure where be he he come to see your mother about an antidote shortly after leave the facility he collapse be there an antidote yes it can be find in Paldiski it be a former soviet training base for nuclear submarine personnel who operate the base now when Estonia gain independence the local authority graciously accept our offer to take over the facility I can tell you where it be in the facility but even if you can get it I can not guarantee anything this antidote sound almost as dangerous as the infection if Derevko 's tell we the truth which be a valid question then the serum be a blood derivative mean you can not just go get the medicine and inject it into the sick patient how would something like this work you need blood from the patient in this case Vaughn the equipment that manufacture the serum read the blood and create a custom genetic specific antidote for that particular patient I will need to take some of Vaughn 's blood with I yes this be Agent Chapman he will be run the op from here while your father lead the team into Paldiski accord to Derevko the antidote be locate at three separate decontamination station within the former nuclear facility we will launch a Zodiac a couple of mile up the coast and drop you as close as we can the plane 's ready you can spec out the mission in flight you 've get 30 minute with Vaughn maybe less how much time do Vaughn have there do not seem to be a consistent pattern but the virus could act quickly be we talk week day just tell I give his level of exposure three day would be my guess I will buy time for we with Sloane go Slumber my darling Thy mother be near guard thy dream from all terror and fear hi hi I talk to my mother there be an antidote I be go to go get it how dangerous get the serum Nah it will be easy but I need to take some of your blood

home detail a forensic unit to the grave site I see she Jack maybe you can not be sure Emily 's alive and she know what I do so I be dead to her if the Alliance find out about this from another source I just get off the phone with Kristof I tell he that someone be try to make it look like I fake Emily 's death in order to secure my position that be the smart play I be not so sure even if they believe I the timing might make it seem like I be look for an excuse for my recent performance be there concern since I be make a partner in the Alliance SD 6 have consistently stumble in its operation we lose a terahertz wave camera we fail to retrieve the formula for zero point energy we do not acquire Derevko 's operation manual the situation regard Emily have be a distraction inform they put these setback in context Kristof want I to meet with he in Tokyo I need a victory Jack I need to bring something tangible to the organisation we have an asset in custody downstairs who be familiar with Derevko 's operation I suggest we take advantage of that as the virus progress it cause something call ascend paralysis your nervous system be be poison from your foot up you see the paralysis be affect the nerve that control your ability to breathe soon you will suffocate Interestingly you still have feel where you be paralyse you can still feel both pleasure and pain tell I where be Derevko 's base of operation please I want a location Smila Smila hey thank for meet I so I do the work you ask I to do but please do not tell I you be chase some allege CIA conspiracy again I be just help out a friend that be all well you can tell your friend the question he be interested in be not on the test in ' 82 be you sure those ridiculously difficult spatial relationship question the one about why rainbow occur and why we have to be stand behind the sun to see they yeah they be not on there sorry come on off the record what be this all about these be propulsion boot you can do five knot with they we drop you 100 yard offshore you should be at the pier in under two minute Heckler Koch P11 underwater pistol hold five round of trank dart Thing 's virtually silent good luck I be at stage one outside the facility copy that Mountaineer we be stand by I just spot Sark no need to remind you to stay out of sight our intel indicate that to use the serum generator you need the security passcode the jack in this computer it be get a satellite link that will let we get into their system and provide you with the code you will need I 've got sit link you should be receive datum now Roger Mountaineer Stand by for the passcode two six six four seven two nine two six six four seven wait what the generator 's a peripheral to the main system the machine be connect to their central security system if you try to generate the serum their security system will be alert can we circumvent the system not from here Mountaineer abort the op and head back we will find another way Abort we do not have time to find something else if you use the machine they will know you be there then I will run fast you 've be order to abort Mountaineer do you copy Sir someone have access the decontamination room Agent Bristow those pipe be rig to disperse ammonia fluorochloride wonderful for decontaminate metal and concrete not so good on organic material such as your suit or your skin you and I we be destine to work together I truly believe that of course any future collaboration require my turn the sprinkler system off notice your suit be already be eat away I would give it another 40 second I could use your help I need access to Arvin Sloane why because I intend to kill he I can get you to sloane but only if you promise to let I keep the antidote no sloane first then you get back your precious antidote Sark have I take to the decontamination room he let I go I come back here to Los Angeles and Sark never ask who the antidote be for no he do not seem to care what exactly do you promise Sark that I would find a way to render sloane unconscious and deliver he to Sark so he could kill he yes there be just so many problem with this that I do not even know where to begin how about we start with Vaughn do I need to remind you that american intelligence agent be not in the business of commit murder Arvin Sloane kill my fiancé I have have plenty of opportunity to return the favour but I have choose not to because yes I know it be not what we do it be what he do and it be reprehensible but we have no choice here Vaughn could be dead in two day what the hell would you have do you do not collaborate with the enemy there be no choice here Sydney I be not go to do nothing give we a minute would you do not try and convince I not to work with Sark that be not what I be do I be on your side here we can not lose Vaughn so what do we do we do not go through Kendall push he and he will run it through channel this need to be handle quietly sloane be schedule to attend an Alliance meeting in Tokyo I will find out the detail of his itinerary my STU be not recognise my crypto ignition key I need it fix do you know that polar bear can not be detect by infrared photography the fur emit no heat Nothing Nada Zip I just think maybe it would be applicable to something I 've Crypto ignition key I got to do that from the server room excuse I what be that it be one of those standardise test kid take a friend from the newspaper be interested in I maybe tutor his kid reading comprehension essay base on our invasion of Grenada yeah it be weird the only test I could

55l popular test Popular I get a call once from someone at ETS say they be centralise their file they want any original can you remember if you put in any question about spatial reasoning why would I do that there be no statistical utility in ask question maybe one in 10 000 first grader could answer well how would you explain a question like this then how can rainbow be see only when the sun be behind the observer this be not in the test I send to ETS I design the question I proof the test booklet they print up and then when they send the final correct copy I put them on file about how many

not think we 've ever be officially introduce Mr Sark be now cooperate with we in our ongoing search for Derevko and the remain of her company he be cooperate this be a strategic alliance Agent Bristow Debrief he take down everything he know about Derevko and we will see and decide about what go on after that it be so hard to move on still love what be go Agent Bristow work with you w do not worry I pulse the bug we can reminisce what be you do here how I take the ambulance to a remote location and then I revive he here be the situation Rambaldi 's true aim be a puzzle I have certain piece you have other separately we will never solve his mystery but together we can not fail how do I know you have anything real to offer I can prove myself in two way the first be obvious I intercept communication indicate that there would be an assassination attempt on your life as this conversation prove I 've prevent that how do I know you do not plan the attempt in the first place which bring I to my second piece of information what be on the piece of paper I be afraid that be need to know I get it from here thank you ask I some question I tell you I would answer they if you help I you do help I and I thank you for that I do not do it for you I be try to live a normal life which be always hard give what I do but it be get hard since I 've meet your daughter it be not that know she have not make my life well it have but it be also make it that much bad I think I 've say enough the problem Mr Vaughn be that to the one person who matter you have not say anything listen this may not mean anything to you this may not be something you understand or appreciate but we have rule very clear and important rule that govern the relationship between a handler and his asset and between a man and a woman come to I now and lay your hand over I even if it be a lie say it will be all right hi hi I be break in two and I know you be on to I thank you when I be so all alone but I do believe that not everything be go to be the way you think it oughta be I hear about Sark Sloane actually bring Sark to the Alliance present he as their new ally how do that go over apparently Sark be a big hit and thank to I Sloane 's standing have never be high I shall believe I understand you meet Alice she seem nice yeah she be she be a good person we have a lot of history we be try to you know we break up yeah you would mention that a couple of month later we see each other at a friend 's and you do not have to explain no I know but I want to because if thing be the other way around seriously do not explain I shall believe I will see you tomorrow Jack brief I he and Sydney break protocol but I be glad it work out excuse I that not everything be go to be the way you think it oughta be it seem like every time I try to make it right it all come down on I please say honestly you will not give up on I and I shall believe I shall believe I shall believe I shall believe previously on Alias I have Toxicology analyse the glass of wine that somehow make its way into my house last week they find a compound which counteract the effect of sodium morphate Sodium morphate be the poison I use to end Emily 's suffering I see two possibility here either Emily predict your intention to euthanise she take the necessary countermeasure or the more likely scenario someone want you to believe Emily be alive Sydney you know Mr Sark I do not think we 've ever be officially introduce Mr Sark be now cooperate with we in our ongoing search for Derevko and the remain of her company I see the bad moon rise I see trouble on the way I see earthquake and lightning I see bad time today do not go round tonight well it be bind to take your life there be a bad moon on the rise be you here to wish I luck before my first day on the job or be you concerned that I might reveal to sloane that you conspire to kill he I be here to remind you what I hope be obvious but I do not wanna overestimate your intelligence if you burn I I burn you Sydney I could not reveal to sloane that you conspire to kill he without also reveal my involvement of course I never have any intention of go through with it I simply need to gain his trust you know what I think you be just a dog look for a new master no need to worry Sydney we be colleague now I will see you at the office Sloane would not agree to partner with he unless Sark make it worth his while do you have any idea what they be after give the scope of Sark 's previous contact and operation he could be offer almost anything what concern I more be that your mother know we be double agent before she turn herself in she may have tell Sark I will find out before you do consider this two month ago she surrender to the CIA yesterday Sark make a back door agreement with Sloane that place he inside SD 6 do you believe that be just a coincidence as you know Mr Sark surrender to we last week after an extensive debriefing with McCullough we 've conclude that he can provide we with credible intel Enough in fact to warrant an immunity deal in exchange for his cooperation Sir I believe this decision be a critical mistake this man have murder hundred of people for profit we should not set the precedent of grant immunity to a terrorist no matter what he say he have to offer yes well I understand your frustration Agent Dixon but I believe that Sark 's cooperation will save more life than he be take I be with Dixon on this we have develop a strategy to address your concern Jack in order to maintain Sark 's value as an informant his contact must not be aware that he be turn himself in begin today whenever Sark leave this office a security section team will double as his private detail to ensure that he do not violate his agreement with we I be sorry I be late Marshall Flinkman technical operation officer hi welcome do not kill I look I understand that none of you be inclined to believe a word I say but I assure you it be not in my good interest to betray you you 've give I the opportunity of a lifetime and I do not intend to squander it so that be how Sloane and Sark have present their new partnership no one at sd 6 like it but they all believe it I need to know if you ever tell Sark that I be a double agent Sydney no you save Vaughn 's life I be grateful to you for that but I have not make up my mind yet if I should trust you and yet here you be I never tell Sark about your status as a double agent Sydney that do not mean you be safe tell I what intelligence have he provide Sloane Zoran Sokolov a freelance mercenary who be have extensive dealing with Mr Sark yes he frequently offer I the chance to purchase intelligence before he bring it to the black market recently he ask I if I would be interested in obtain a set of communication code use by Uzbekistan 's ground force along the border if we do not obtain those code Sokolov will sell they to extremist rebel hide in neighbour Tadzhikistan with those code they can track Uzbek troop movement and plan terrorist attack this would gravely destabilise our ally in Asia Sydney you and Dixon will make contact with this Sokolov Posing as Sark 's associate you will purchase the code and bring they here we both know Sloane do not care about preserve stability in Asia so my question be why do he want those communication code so badly I be go to ask you to give I something you have no reason to give I be go to ask for your faith you have to convince your superior to let I leave this place what for 48 hour I will agree to a special force escort why I can not tell you that go where what be those code for I be try to help you but I must be allow to do it my way it be ask too much I can not give you detail because I do not trust the CIA they almost have I execute two week ago the only way for I to maintain my value be to tell you only what you need to know in order to stay ahead of Sloane and all you need to know now be that if I be not allow to leave everything you 've work to accomplish will be lose Agent Bristow you be ask I to get Irina Derevko a 48 hour I be ask you to consider it you can not tell I why she will not say why sloane task you to acquire Uzbekistan 's ground force communication code and how do success or failure risk my mother be clearly worried about something else some unintended consequence that we can not predict Sir thus far Derevko 's intel have be right 100 per cent of the time we do not catch this woman she turn herself in she be agree to be escort by a special force team and wear a tracking device she will not get away Jack you 've be awfully quiet I be sorry when it come to Irina Derevko my judgement 's prove to be impaired well I would like your opinion perhaps they be right perhaps release she be worth the risk to satisfy our curiosity well hell when you put it that way the answer be definitely no if Irina Derevko want out of here she be go to have to tell we more otherwise you be to proceed as plan Agent Vaughn will give you your countermission thank you tell Kendall your judgement be not to be trust and then agree with I to reinforce his doubt Kendall 's ego predispose he to favour decision in which he be overrule other you argue your way I will argue mine your countermission 's simple you will dead drop a copy of the code when you get back from Uzbekistan so we can figure out what they be really for I have to go pack I must admit this be one of the most impressive operation I 've see though it be a touch pathetic how so many of they believe they actually work for the CIA look at I you 've offer I a substantial prize to make our partnership worthwhile but do not think for a second that give you the right to insult my people I apologise I have a run in with Sydney Bristow this morning she may be the only one who suspect I have not in fact turn myself in I 've be a presence in Sydney 's life since she be bear Sydney will believe whatever I tell she to and her father he must often battle the temptation to tell she the truth about SD 6 I would hate to see Jack 's paternal instinct compromise our objective so for the time be I would not tell he what those code be really for yeah Sir a call 's be route to you through Credit Dauphine take a message he say it be regard your wife that will be all put he through I want you to record this call hello we have your wife and yes she be alive you will provide we with the account number for all SD 6 investment or the Alliance will be inform that you fail to carry out her execution offer I proof that she be alive until then know this as soon as I hang up the phone I will use every available resource to find out who I be talk to and when I do it will be my sincere pleasure to make your acquaintance so you work for Sark tell he I be insult he do not come here personally we will make sure he get the message Mr Sokolov we be on a schedule do you have the code do you have the money wait the code be on a computer in this case the case before I steal it belong to a colonel in the Uzbek army what I do not realise when I make the offer to Sark be that without the colonel 's fingerprint the case can not be open without detonate a self destruct mechanism inside Boom be you tell we you can not deliver what you 've promise we please I would not have ask you to come all this way without a solution to this little problem I have arrange for colonel to be someplace tonight where you can take his print how exactly do you do that I have he assassinate be you in yet that microchip you give I be not exactly state of the art it be still read morgue record off the central server ok Dixon I be in I too Sydney Stand by what be colonel 's name Vasili Kabilov Sydney you be look for Vasili Kabilov ID tag C 16 Dixon do not shoot it be I get in I know Sydney tell I about Project Christmas and how it be develop to identify future spy and now you be worried because you think the Russians might have use it to recruit american child back in the ' 80 about that the thing be I think there might be something to your theory really remember those weird test question you give I the one the KGB develop I find they I find they integrate into a series of standardised test that be administer here in 1982 how many kid take that test five million well look I do not think Devlin my superior would mind I have you research this but he do and he order I to let you go wait a there be something here ok look I will narrow the test score down to a small group of kid now Devlin will not be able to deny the value of that he think since you be a journalist since you 've be train to report what you know that you be a security risk well do not sweat it here be what I owe you there be 700 I do not work that many hour seriously I do not know how you do it so fast I tell you to take your time thank but my time 's all I expect to get pay for hey hey what be wrong nothing nothing nothing 's wrong Syd if we would just meet I would know something 's wrong do you remember Mr Sark do I remember the guy who shoot I with a tranquilliser the guy who have I torture in Taipei he be work with SD 6 I can not tell you any more than that you 've see he you be work with he I have to make he think I be that little british cocky son of a bitch be in LA Hey Syd Syd I be on the line with the spa do you want to get a swedish or a shiatsu massage you have to reschedule believe I there be nothing I would rather do than spend a day with you at the spa how about next week next week 's great but I be still go to go tomorrow ok I wanna kill that Sark guy I know no this be go to drive I insane you ask I to tell you I do not know it be go to be a nightmare he be almost kill I too but you get to do something about it I mean yeah you get to go off and be sneaky and ultimately destroy the guy what about your work with Vaughn Vaughn sort of fire I the CIA 's just go to ignore everything will find out actually when Devlin hear five million american first grader take a standardised test that may have be doctor by the KGB he send Will 's research to the FBI and we be still wait for the result that be the second time will 's come through for we I wish there be more I could do for he I really do he be a good guy thank Syd this watch belong to my father it be break now but it use to keep perfect time and when he give it to I he say you could set your heart by this watch it stop October 1st the day we meet Kendall I too what be go on we just hear from Analysis about the code you acquire in Uzbekistan Sloane and Sark give we a half truth the code be Uzbek but they have nothing to do with troop communication what be they for they be the control code for six portable nuclear warhead that the Uzbeks have admit and defence intelligence have confirm go miss six month ago SD 6 be in possession of six nuclear weapon no this morning Sark electronically messengere the code to an unknown third party we could not trace the link and all we know about they be that they be work with Sloane and Sark why do sloane keep you in the dark on this I do not know this be what my mother be talk about we should have listen to her well if she be so concerned about help we stay ahead of SD 6 she could have tell we what be at stake and what would you have do give Sydney false control code to hand over to SD 6 Sark may have know the difference and she would have be expose as a double agent I be not willing to risk her life that way do you know where the nuke be yes I do where I 've spend the last 36 night lie on a steel mattress what the hell be that suppose to mean it mean I would appreciate a pillow and blanket do tell we about the warhead they be in Kashmir under what use to be a maximum security prison camp it be now the stronghold for a mercenary group the People 's Revolutionary Front so Sloane and Sark have in fact partner with this organisation it would appear can you give we the prison camp 's exact coordinate yes I be go to recommend to the Defence Department an immediate air strike when the smoke clear we can dig the warhead out of the rubble I would not do that now that the PRF have the control code they may have set the warhead to detonate in the event of sabotage or a pre emptive strike what about send in a commando unit if they be familiar with the facility I would say it be a good idea that be what you be plan on do yes that be impossible to verify all right Ms Derevko you be go to lead we into that prison no I be not my offer expire the moment the detonation code be acquire do I have to remind you that your immunity deal be contingent upon your continue cooperation I have cooperate Agent Kendall you do not listen now if you would bring I my pillow and blanket you listen to I I be authorise to put you in solitary you be lucky you have a view of this hallway Agent Kendall may I speak to my mother alone please Sydney I be sorry you say you do not tell we the truth because you be try to protect I because you do not wanna risk Sark find out that I be a double agent the thing be someone now have the ability to detonate six nuclear weapon and I be responsible so I be go to be part of the team that find and disarm those warhead no matter what you do but if you be tell the truth when you say you want to protect I then Mom I need your help you convince your mother to go to Kashmir I tell she if she do not lead the team to the warhead I would I hand those code to SD 6 your guilt be unfounded you be do your job I be go Dad Defence approve it I be not about to let Irina Derevko near six nuclear weapon supervise only by you Plane leave in an hour obviously you can not maintain your cover if you be shackle so there be two thing you need to know about this necklace one it be layer with C 4 if you remove it while it be armed you will break the circuit and it will detonate and two if at any moment I believe you be attempt to escape or sabotage we I will activate this remote trigger and blow your head off myself all right here be how this work Derevko will detail your infiltration into the facility once you reach it until then you have operational control the unrest in Kashmir have cause both Pakistan and India to seal their border so you will board a train in New Delhi there be a three mile stretch of track that pass through the eastern tip of Kashmir that be where you will get off your gear will be plant in the baggage car once you be off the train you will rendezvous with the CIA contact who will provide you the op tech you will need to infiltrate the facility how do you clear this with Sloane I take care of Sloane there be a c 5 preppe and wait at the Van Nuys airport they will escort you good luck I will talk to you when you reach the contact Agent Vaughn have trouble sleep when you be in the field I doubt he tell you that he do not have to tell I I could see it in his eye and I see it in yours Agent Vaughn be my colleague you be so willing to take risk for your country why be not you willing to do the same for your own happiness I hardly think you 've earn the right to give anyone relationship advice Jack Sydney 's smart and she be strong but she be not happy ok wait a second and after a 20 year absence you 've glean that from the cumulative half hour you 've spend in her presence I know it the moment I see she I be her mother your motherhood be a biological fact with no substantive value in Sydney 's life hey stop bait he stop be such an easy target we be go to be travel together for the next two day you can not jump down her throat every time she open her mouth Hope I do not pull you away from something too important it be all right what be up look except for you Sydney and Jack everybody I know and a lot of people I do not they think I be a lie junkie ok and help you do something for the CIA it feel like a chance to do something that matter again you know like I do not know maybe I go through all this crap for a reason what be this I know you can not pay I it do not matter you be look at 40 name those be 40 kid that get a perfect score on the standardised test that include the Project Christmas question how do you get this between ' 80 and ' 85 Carnegie Mellon conduct a cultural bias study on standardised testing not only do they have the result but they cross reference they by name and ethnicity the FBI have be try to narrow down a list of kid for as long as you have and so far they have not come up with a single name that be probably because they do not know that the test record from ' 82 be miss from the testing service archive what do you mean they be miss who take they I do not know yet what be the purpose of your visit to India Family vacation we be tour the Kaziranga National Park by train not exactly a vacation when you be force to go no offence Cute country Honey we agree we would spend Thanksgiving together before

support rebel in Azad Kashmir have acquire nuclear weapon they be go to launch pre emptive strike the Pakistanis be go to retaliate and I be go to get call in front of a half a dozen congressional

control you be a prisoner your only function sole reason you be momentarily breathe fresh air be to use your knowledge of the rebel ' base to help we steal the suitcase nuke and leave that be why we be use people I know and trust I be not have this conversation again you ok yeah thank this be not a power play the facility we be head for security 's tight than the NSA if I do not have the right equipment it be pointless we should move ok I know what you be think do you Toaster what be you guy talk about we use to have this toaster at home it be break and use it one night I start a small fire

especially in Kashmir of course I can provide alias basic weapon access to satellite phone and transportation what kind of security Biometric sensor dual infrared passive and microwave sensor fibre optic on the fence what be your timeframe we be already behind schedule well I can do what I can do but it might not be enough for you we will take whatever you 've get thank you yes first thing you need to be look not like you hello hi I be on a secure line Sydney we see the blast what happen I will fill you in later but we be compromise I be so glad you be ok what about your parent some people go miniature golfing with their parent we go to India and look for nuke listen Sydney we intercept a communication the rebel say they be plan on activate the nuke tomorrow at 1 700 Activate how we do not know Deploy Detonate Activate that be the word they use now it might mean delivery maybe detonation we do not know but we have to assume the bad since they get the control code through SD 6 and I get the control code for SD 6 which mean I can deactivate the nuke if you get there in time Perfect here my truck be park on the other side of the market I owe you what kind of air filter do it have a foam filter that will not work it will clog up in the desert condition we will return the truck as soon as we can we can not use this truck it will never get we there I know you think I be always second guess you this be my decision it be not negotiable listen to I both of you we have a job to do your issue be go to have to be deal with later please excuse we right now we have six suitcase nuke that be go to be activate tomorrow be that confirm CIA do not have any detail they want we to deactivate the nuke and steal they CIA need to get authorisation for a pre emptive strike now they need confirmation that the nuke be there it will be too late by then not if we work together this be the way it be go to be Dad will decide how we get to the base it be his call once we arrive Mom take over you be an officer there you know your way around you will lead we into the facility to the nuke and back out then you will resume control and get we home there will be no objection to and no deviation from this plan three of these bin be fill with grain Irina you will be in the fourth you can not be serious she be the most likely to be recognise the rebel be look for a three person team so we have a well chance of avoid detection if we alter our configuration be you sure she can breathe in there Dad we need to get move I know I be just prepare myself to let Irina out it will be fine Sydney I 've be do this job a long time so when you lecture I about continue the mission and lay down protocol Dad my point be I know what your point be and the truth be I need to hear it I be proud of you that be all thank you what be we do here this be not the drop the filter got clog do not it we be still ten mile away from the base we need to hike to the field where we will access a sewage tunnel that will lead we into the facility I think you say security be heavy it be on the other side of the facility at the entry point we be use the rebel rely on land mine to keep intruder away we do not have the equipment to detect land mine we do not have the equipment because your contact do not come through I know where the mine be plant you wanna walk through a minefield you have not see in 19 year be there another way and assume no new mine I just spend five hour in a grain bin it be my turn now let us get to it I just speak with Gerard Cuvee leader of the PRF he be quite charming really more like a banker than a rebel leader but then you be a money man too be not you be everything in place the nuclear core will be activate at 1 700 hour as soon as it be do they will upload the result to our server yeah Sir I have someone call regard your wife they will not identify themselves record the call I need some privacy yeah romantic touch do not you think your wife 's ring finger by now your lab 's confirm that despite your good effort you do not kill Emily and now I have her what do you want one hundred million in bearer bond this be about money everything be about money instruction for the drop have be electronically mail to you you 've get 24 hour Fail to deliver the bond and the next delivery will go to the Alliance where do the prf get all these mine you Americans have the bad inventory control in the world so Sydney how be school I be write my dissertation supposedly Quiet behind the tree to your left Jack Jack I need a gun do not move you be on a mine Sydney do not move five step forward three to your left and straight towards we be you hurt no the bullet hit my vest it be an M26 antipersonnel mine we will need to pry off the panel and remove the blast cap you need to cut the detonator core that lead to the blast cap her knife 's not coat if she cut the wire with metal she will complete the circuit and set it off I can do it it be ok over that hill be the entrance to the sewer tunnel we should hurry follow closely contact the bristow tell they to pull out immediately I have no way of initiate why the Indians find out the pakistani rebel have acquire nuke they be launch air strike in 24 hour what we have to get them to back off we be try but they be angry we know about the nuke and keep it from they they be insist on go forward then let I make a personal appeal Vaughn everybody be work on this already State NSC DOD look you be probably go to say no to this but I wanna go to India I be station there for two year I have relationship go go I will have a military aircraft wait this be totally back channel you be just go to be you try to get rid of I Clear we be here the nuke will either be in a sealed r d lab or a vault locate in the subbasement the lab be the well bet because its security system be more sophisticated so we check the vault first not if we only get one shot the lab have thermal sensor to detect intruder through their body heat if we raise the room to body temperature 98 6 degree the sensor will not be able to distinguish between we and the thermostat level of the lab Sydney you will get to the central heating control panel here it be locate in a room near the stairwell in the subbasement find the panel for zone three got it Jack the lab door be control by a voice recognition system only Cuvee 's voice be program to open it we need to break into the main computer system here to access his file you will erase his voice and substitute your own I will be in Cuvee 's private office you and I be not separate not in here Jack listen to I unless I deactivate the facility 's surveillance system from Cuvee 's office we will not get anywhere near the nuke no you 've do good work get we here I be not blind to that but I be also far from trust you if you want those nuke for yourself this be a perfect setup you be an officer in this facility you 've get friend here willing to work with you friend know what this place be when I be here Jack a prison where the KGB interrogate suspect traitor and no I be not an officer here I be a prisoner why do you think I learn the sewage tunnel or memorise the mine location so I could escape you idiot we be out of time we either split up and meet at the lab in five minute or we be go back it be your choice she be right we do not have any more time I will be in the lab in five minute I promise you well be thank you for agree to this emergency meeting despite my good effort to comply with your order to kill my wife after she learn the truth

finger blood coagulation test be not 100 per cent accurate yes but they be reliable then two day ago security section obtain those those be photograph of airport security in Santiago and London we have confirm that Emily be on flight manifest last week any ID on the man with her no but the blackmailer want a hundred million in bearer bond for her return who else know about your instruction to kill Emily only the people in this room you believe one of we may be behind this no but someone have infiltrate our secure communication well whoever it be will get nothing no it be not quite that simple we have to eliminate this leak before more damaging information about the Alliance get out so I propose that we put a tracking device on the bond that we make this exchange that we follow the blackmailer and we assassinate he you understand Arvin after all this if you get your wife back she will still have to be eliminate I understand the thermal sensor be neutralise where be your mother I have not see she we get this far she must have get to Cuvee 's office and disable the surveillance system she will be here we be not wait use the control code to begin deactivation the plutonium core be go hi Mr Sloane it be I Marshall sorry you probably already know that you plan this anyway the tracer on the bond be work perfectly good I be turn off my comm yeah I see you leave the briefcase on the bench and keep walk proceed toward the corner while we verify the authenticity of the bond yeah I get you baby right into my wheelhouse come on go to the row of vend machine take the City View fifth from the top I tell you be not nobody gettin ' by Magic Marshall 's invisible liquid tracer I say come on come on wait a minute wait no where would oh God no no not to brag but I be kind of

dead man wait wait I want what we come for Sark 's make a deal with we what kind of double cross be he plan maybe you do not hear I we know Sark have a new partner who be it get the information and meet I in my office I be catch I have to do this or we would all be kill they be not detonate the nuke here be what you have to do be everything on target we run into a few problem but what kind of problem we 've get it under control we will proceed as plan then I will expect your report on the Rambaldi artefact within the hour trust I on this if you do not make it out I be sorry this happen Mr Vaughn good to see you again but I be afraid you come a long way for nothing General we have people at the PRF base right now steal the nuke and if they fail we will be the Pakistani 's first target they will not fail you can not guarantee that if you launch those strike now you will be kill some of our good asset Mr Vaughn your government know the rebel acquire the suitcase nuke and still they say nothing they place our whole country at risk at least delay a few hour until we get our people out I be sorry the air strike go as plan you look more like your father every time I see you you know

experiment with be self sustain cell regeneration this artefact they be open today be report to be Rambaldi 's proof of endless life endless life we have no time to make any meaningful assessment all I know be that your mother claim to have provide we with the opportunity to contact the CIA for extraction and we should act on it can not this thing go any fast this be it we be go against the wind

to call off the air strike this be Agent Vaughn Abort the air strike repeat abort the air strike you must have a lot of question yeah one thing that should not wait any long be why I shoot you in Taipei the rebel leader Gerard Cuvee when you be in Taipei he be in the next room watch to see if I would betray he or you shoot you in the shoulder give you time to escape it be the only way I could think to maintain his trust and keep he from kill both of we we be both tired you should get some rest you too Mom hi hey any word on the flower preliminary analysis indicate that it be anywhere from 400 to 600 year old like I say preliminary what be this s there nothing I can say nothing I can do to change your mind I be so in love with you we be too deep in you can not get out you be just a poor girl in a rich man 's house yeah baby I be cry over you do not you know promise be never make to keep just like the night previously on Alias ok Dixon I be in Stand by Sydney you be look for Vasili Kabilov ID tag C 16 what be go on we just hear from Analysis about the code you acquire in Uzbekistan they have nothing to do with troop communication what be they for they be the control code for six portable nuclear warhead that the Uzbeks have admit and defence intelligence have confirm go miss six month ago do you know where the nuke be yes I do they be in Kashmir under what use to be a maximum security prison camp all right Ms Derevko you be go to lead we into that prison I hand those code to SD 6 your guilt be unfounded you be do your job I be go Dad I be not about to let Irina Derevko near six nuclear weapon supervise only by you if you be lie about this none of we will survive the only reason you know about the nuke be because of I I want some respect we will miss our window unless you jump Shut up right now we have six suitcase nuke that be go to be activate tomorrow be that confirm CIA do not have any detail Boot Camp this be Mountaineer Abort listen to I Fighter plane be in the sky you have to leave now we 've get the core tell they to call off the air strike this be Agent Vaughn Abort the air strike repeat abort the air strike when I find out my mother fake her death 20 year ago after mourn she for most of my life she be still alive I try to imagine what it would feel like to stand in a room with both of my parent again it seem impossible that two people with so much deceit between they could ever find a way to breathe the same air and all of a sudden there we be just the three of we walk down a dirt road in the middle of Kashmir we be out there work as a team it be comfort we be ambush and we fight back and we survive yeah my parent and I sort of go through the same thing thank thank a lot oh Vaughn tell I Devlin approve you to do research if you pass the Milgram Reich allegiance test this be your sop and where to meet for the pick up remember to drop drop it in water dissolve it yeah hey what be up where you be ok listen every time I walk in the room lately you guy hush up as if I be interrupt something I mean be I what no Francie seriously we be just talk why do not you have a seat I can not I get to I forget my key I get to go open the restaurant I will see you ok Kendall 's allow I 15 minute here twice a week you put in the request do not you to give I time out here yeah we appreciate your help in Kashmir I need you to understand I be 18 when the KGB recruit I for a woman to be ask to serve her country it be a future it mean empowerment independence I be a fool to think that any ideology could come before my daughter Sydney stand down let I see your hand keep them up what be this we have an arrangement yes one you fail to live up to our operation in Kashmir be a waste of sd 6 resource we acquire nothing so my question be have you betray I or be you simply incompetent this interrogation technique be develop by the Khmer Rouge to minimise bruise on political prisoner when they be allow they to be photograph you see if I pull this just a little hard the glass will break and I do not wanna do that so tell I do you think that we be unlucky on our first venture together or do you have another plan that you wanna tell I about I do not betray you we agree to combine our effort I swear to you that be still my intent then tell I what go wrong in Kashmir the indian Western Command carry out an air strike on the PRF prison the Rambaldi artefact be destroy my contact in the region Gerard Cuvee mistakenly believe I tip the indian authority off with all due respect sir could the leak have come from this office so Sloane have no idea you sabotage the operation in Kashmir if he do we would not be have this conversation since Sark fail to deliver on his promise with sloane their partnership may not last for long unfortunately it be not over yet sloane be send I to Paris with Sark tonight why the echelon satellite system Phone call email fax from around the world be filter through a program capable of flag key word on an NSA watch list Echelon have be immeasurably successful in indicate threat to our national security Mr Sark have provide we with new intelligence indicate that an enemy of this country may have acquire the ability to access this terminal Gerard Cuvee former leader of the People 's Revolutionary Front a crime syndicate whose headquarters be raid by indian authority last week Mr Sark my dealing with Mr Cuvee go back several year he once show I an Echelon access terminal he steal from the NSA that he keep at a front company in Paris recent attention by local authority have lead Cuvee to believe that I betray he therefore he be sure to move the terminal to an undisclosed location surveillance team intercept an operation log indicate that an armoured transport have be schedule for a pick up tomorrow afternoon we believe that be when they will be move the terminal Sydney you and Sark will intercept the convoy en route and bring the terminal back here safely if sloane get ahold of that terminal well the Alliance will be able to eavesdrop on corporation law enforcement political campaign the potential for blackmail and insider trading would be unlimited what be my countermission I will have Technical Services provide you with a secure deletion program you will upload it on to the Echelon terminal when SD 6 turn it on it will wipe the hard drive clean Sloane will think Cuvee instal a fail safe to prevent unauthorised access I will do it on the return flight Sark and I be travel separately to make sure no one can connect he to SD 6 oh by the way I be meet with Will tomorrow to help he prep for his psych evaluation thank you and I like it what your new suit oh it be not new I just do not wear it that often I come from a funeral Alice 's father die I be sorry how be she do ok not really but she will be fine let I know if you need anything Miss Bristow hi uh I know you have a plane to catch but you mind do a favour for I sure ok will you take some snapshot around Paris with that for I you know how we have to maintain our cover for our love one well my mom think I run global IT service for the bank so I like to composite myself into photograph for her oh I actually have an example right here there be I and the Sphinx of course I 've never leave Southern California but every once in a while I like to show my mom all the place I 've never really be to would you mind not at all ok have a safe trip I do not like to fly personally but uh that be why I be here and you be I get some stuff to do Convoy 's on the move ETA five minute I be right behind the truck Copy that I be in position you know it be a pity we be travel separately we could have use the opportunity to get to know each other well yeah I be break up about that too you be surprisingly adept at keep your curiosity in check do not flatter yourself I be refer to the fact that your mother and I work together before I arrive here before she go into hiding I learn a lot from she in some way I think of she as a mother myself listen to I you and I have nothing in common we be not friend we be not go to become friend and you certainly will not bait I with story about a woman I never know I do not get any consideration at all for the fact that I do not tell Sloane that you conspire to kill he we 've cover this you can not expose I without expose yourself now I be almost into the city 's traffic control network get your head into the game how be your wound heal you obviously have the chance to betray we in Kashmir but you do not I do not imagine that mean you decide to trust I our previous dealing would indicate that your strategy here may be long term so for now I trust that your behaviour 's predictable by previous dealing you mean our marriage you know technically we may still be husband and wife I be sorry Sydney 's on assignment with Sark it be my belief that he be still work for you that you 've coordinate your effort to infiltrate both SD 6 and the CIA whatever you have in mind I promise you it will not work so I be go to offer you a deal I will see to it that you be relocate to a private residence on Puget Sound under 24 hour surveillance of course but the illusion of freedom be well than none at all in exchange in exchange you will confess tell we what you be really do here why you 've turn yourself in I will give you time to consider my offer I see you I be turn the intersection red it be two for one day here at Marshall 's Tech Emporium not only be this magnetic shape charge capable of penetrate two metre of armoured steel but act now it will also come equip with a secondary tear gas munition which will disable the guard inside the truck operator stand by hello I be move in to disable the escort car copy that it be empty the terminal 's not there the truck 's a decoy get in the car I get your message yes Jack Come in I want you to meet someone Jack Bristow this be Ariana Kane Ms Kane be the head of Alliance Counterintelligence she be the one who plug the leak last year at SD 9 impressive work particularly consider the guilty party attempt to frame you as the mole man always call woman crazy when they be catch with their pant down Ms Kane be here to investigate the event lead up to Emily 's disappearance and the subsequent attempt to blackmail I how much have you share with he he know everything I know I be aware of your reputation as a first class strategist Agent Bristow tell I where would you begin this investigation with I over the year Arvin 's trust I with everything I would need to know to be the perpetrator and if his stand within the Alliance be undermine I would be a candidate to inherit his seat Motive well that be a hell of an answer in addition to be true it be the only thing you can say to diminish your viability as a suspect not really your obvious awareness of game theory would invalidate my approach therefore the good course of action for I to take as a suspect be to simply tell the truth well as soon as you 've officially eliminate the possibility of Agent Bristow as a suspect I be sure he will be quite happy to assist you in your investigation of course if you will excuse I a pleasure all mine you ever have the dream where you be back at school and they will not let you graduate because you 've fail a test I have that last night well we do not screen for general knowledge it be strictly a psych profile so I can not fail but I can find out I be a sociopath yeah listen some of the question on the test may seem a little shocking shocking how well like thing you might punch someone out in a bar for ask I do not wanna get ahead of myself here but um if thing go my way what be next well you be clear to read classified document and you get a government salary which be not much compare to what I make now it be much oh and just be honest cos if you be catch in a lie you be automatically disqualify and since we do not know how often sd 6 keep tab on you it be too risky to take the test at a federal building so we 've arrange for you to go to one of our operational front now when you get there the officer will lead you in the back room where you will take the test he will tell you the shipping manifest be lose in transit and that he need your help to ID the parcel he will take you in a back room and that be where you will take the test now there be no time limit but it should not take you more than an hour I can not believe some of the question they ask it be like if force to choose who would your rather kill a your mother b your father c yourself and none of the above be not even an option I mean what the hell do that measure how you see yourself in relation to authority Basically whether or not you would be willing to sacrifice your life for your country you know that actually make sense by the way I get Francie season ticket to the Hollywood Bowl for her birthday from both of we oh great thank you you know she be right about what she say we use to tell each other everything now I can not tell she anything I know I hate it too but after Danny and what happen to you I 've accept the fact that it be a gesture of love to deceive the people I care about Mm what hey what be you do here Rita right Alice hi hi hey Rita Hey this be will hey hey Michael Nice to meet you Michael Nice to meet you hi Alice hi Michael and I work together at the State Department oh great I be so sorry to hear about your dad oh thank you Michael 's be amazing he be an amazing guy oh Rita we be go to be late we get to go and meet friend I be sorry it be no problem it be nice run into you guy you too Bye see you the Echelon access terminal that you retrieve in Paris be rig with a boot sector fail safe when we turn it on the hard drive be erase the good news be that Mr Cuvee be no long in possession of the terminal the bad news be that he may still have a way to access Echelon one of Cuvee 's man place a call to a data storage facility in London this facility cater to high end corporate client it be likely Cuvee duplicate the Echelon software and have they store in a secure server there if he do he could use they to reverse engineer a new terminal there Sydney you will acquire the file and delete they from Cuvee 's backup server Mr Sark have provide Marshall with tech spec on the datum storage facility actually um yeah actually about that the facility 's wire with electronic countermeasure and the computer 's secure via military grade encryption so any decryption device or radio contact would be detect so the only way the terminal can be access be by someone who know how to crack polymorphic algorithm my math skill may be above average but I can not do advanced calculus in my head that be why you be go in with Marshall Marshall who wait a minute what you be the only one qualified to hack the server without the aid of an electronic device but I can not go because I be not field rate you will be by the time you leave Sark will help you review the operational parameter and I be sure Sydney will take very good care of you we get your debrief if Marshall succeed in copy those system file Sloane will be able to reboot the Echelon terminal Marshall have a photographic memory once the file flash across the screen he will remember they yes we know that I can not just give sd 6 a fake Marshall no but we can pull he out of sd 6 what Devlin make it clear that we can not under any circumstance allow sd 6 to access echelon and sabotage the mission be too risky after Kashmir Sloane could start to suspect something we 've consider every option Syd there be no other way to do this when you and Marshall return from London we will take he into protective custody he will be transport to Langley for an extensive debrief as ridiculous as this sound SD 6 be his whole life it be never easy find out everything you believe in be a lie we will do whatever we can to make it easy for he I promise and when he adjust he will have the option to come work for we what about his mother will they be able to make contact that will be up to Marshall but we can bring she into protective custody too what be my cover story with sloane as far as you will know the mission go without a hitch and you separate at the airport we will intercept Marshall on his way home I should pack listen about the bar do you see the security camera yeah we send an agent to pull the tape so we could not be tie together Good Alice seem really nice she say the same thing about you how long have you know Arvin Sloane for 30 year when we meet he be my superior at the CIA yes and once he leave the CIA he invite you to work with he at SD 6 yes we be both disillusion with the US Government we would both come to see it as corrupt and we believe then as we do now that the Alliance would ultimately succeed in achieve global dominance if you and Sloane have be so close all these year why do you imagine he recruit your daughter into SD 6 without tell you because he know I would have be oppose to it Trust do not come easily to Arvin Sloane so while at the time I may not have approve I now accept that he recruit Sydney to ensure that he would never have to take my loyalty on faith you be ask I to believe that Sloane take your daughter hostage to ensure your friendship in our line of work we can not just cry foul when thing do not go our way with whom have you have intimate contact over the past ten year Agent Bristow I be curious to know where you be go with this More secret have be reveal through pillow talk than through torture if there be a prostitute or a stewardess out there you think may have hear you talk in your sleep I need to know about it there be one way for you to verify if my nocturnal activity be a security risk Ms Kane but somehow I think we would both prefer the torture what happen to that gentleman I meet in Sloane 's office this morning he get tired of your baseless accusation good I do not trust anyone who do not have the sense to when know he be be insult be we through yes for now APU set Aft cargo heat set Hydraulic pump set Marshall what be you do oh I patch in to in flight phone network and log on to the on board computer just wanna make sure the pilot do not miss anything in the preflight check list what be that flap extend totally routine totally routine be this really your first time on a plane yeah I could not sleep last night so I memorise the FAA 747 flight op manual whoa what the heck sorry sorry just a little nervous Marshall you be sweat maybe you should take your jacket off no no way no way I compress a high glide tactical parachute in the lining of my jacket just in case do not worry though my belt hyperextend into a tandem sling just loop it around your waist it will hold we both thank you do not have to thank I it be my job to keep you safe what be that that be not a plane sound that could be bad Marshall oh a little kid play a dee dee dee dee be he be that all right be he allow to on board play the you be not suppose to can I get a ginger ale I do not think I 've ever see you look quite so handsome my darling and you look lovely my dear shall we we shall oh this be so cool hey how be it go good to see you hey how be it go how you do Nice to see you the key to do this right be inconspicuous right sorry I be just hey you do not need to say hello to everybody Box seat have be reserve for you at Royal Hall behind this man Thatcher Powell Cuvee 's head of IT security and the only man with access to his secure server Powell attend the London Philharmonic every third Saturday of the month and take in the performance with a bottle of Cristal um you know Bach be my favourite composer be you speak to I yes I bet you do not know that the last piece of music that Bach ever compose he encode his name into the musical note he certainly be the most ingenious composer of the Baroque movement I always say if it be not Baroque do not fix it Pardon my husband he do tend to prattle on sorry once Powell ingest the scopolamine it will take effect in roughly five minute the idea be to make Powell believe he merely fall asleep so the dose will be mild that mean once you steal the access card get across town to the server facility download the Echelon software and return the key to his pocket before intermission there will be a car wait for you out front oh thank goodness you be still open I be Marie Robinson this be my associate Frederick Fields hello we work for Jennings Aerospace the New York office just page I at the symphony our CFO 's laptop be steal we need access to our backup server right away may I have your corporate PIN number please 86119 you be on server 13 second floor thank you we will not be more than ten minute Cheerio SD 6 have open an account at the data storage facility under the name Jennings Aerospace your client status will get you past the desk guard and the security staff will be reduce for the night shift since Cuvee be justifiably paranoid he be lease out the entire third floor as his own you will need to break into the third floor to access the server Syd you be amazing you be act spy you ready to do your magic yeah I I be ready for anything how do you get up here this area 's restrict Sir you be go to have to come with we Syd I 've be shoot oh my God Syd I 've be shoot I be shoot oh my God Marshall oh my

come on stay awake stay awake stay awake stay awake Marshall focus I love you the Echelon software be on this computer you have to access it I will do the rest ok ok ok I get it go I get it so Marshall Hm Mama Accounting for the relevant state during key generation and the crypto compiler combine with the pseudo random number generator will give you a password Marshall you be a genius thank you so much goodness I must have doze off well you certainly be not the only one and you know the light be fade all too soon so this car will take you home Thanks hey you think the driver will take the scenic route home I 've get this unbelievable film strip run in my head and the thing I still can not believe be that we be the star I just wanna watch it a couple more time before I go back to my

nightclub I wanna drop by what be go on Surprise this be why you shut up when I walk in the room happy birthday I love you so happy birthday sweetie oh my God Jack Bristow 's not the man responsible for blackmail I his answer be too perfect hm I mean he even get angry when it make strategic sense if if he have nothing to do with it I would expect his answer to be perfect now Ariana unless you have evidence contrary to what you tell your subordinate we be not the US Government I do not need probable cause to go after Bristow all I need be a hunch well your hunch notwithstanding you be talk about a man with whom I 've be partner for 30 year you have a blind spot when it come to he look he be not the first suspect I interview I talk to all the other head of the sd cell people who might have take issue with your promotion to the Alliance you know what I find they be all afraid of you except for Jack Bristow who I promise you be hide something have you think about my offer I have nothing to confess Jack I know you find it hard to believe I would turn myself in to make up for my mistake but that be the reason the only reason I be here if that be the truth why do not you simply refuse the offer I be consider whether or not to fabricate a confession just to get out of this cell you be right although our marital contract be found on fraudulent pretence it be still valid until it be annul which mean technically we be still marry Jack thus far I 've agree to be debrief only by Sydney from now on I be willing to talk to you too Vaughn here what do you mean we do not pick up Marshall at the intercept point who do oh my God please do not hurt I mister Mister please please do not hurt I please tell I how do you enjoy the symphony previously on Alias Jack Bristow this be Ariana Kane Ms Kane be the head of Alliance Counterintelligence she be here to investigate the event lead up to my wife Emily 's disappearance and the subsequent attempt to blackmail I if sloane get ahold of that Echelon terminal well the Alliance will be able to eavesdrop on corporation law enforcement political campaign the potential for blackmail and insider trading would be unlimited Gerard Cuvee former leader of the People 's Revolutionary Front one of Cuvee 's man place a call to a data storage facility in London it be likely Cuvee duplicate the Echelon software and have they store in a secure server there Sydney you be go in with Marshall wait a minute what you be the only one qualified to hack the server without an electronic device Marshall have a photographic memory once the file flash across the screen he will remember they I can not just give sd 6 a fake Marshall no but we can pull he out of SD 6 Mom I will be home in a little while I be just get back from my big business trip in London what do you mean we do not pick up Marshall at the intercept point who do please do not hurt I some people think there be a conspiracy that the government eavesdrop on everyone it be no conspiracy right now satellite and ground station antenna be listen in Faxes Internet communication phone call all route to high speed voice and optical recognition computer they can analyse word speak and write in every common language on Earth the system 's call echelon yeah I hear about Echelon I just do not understand how it be legal so what it be just like a computer that listen to and read everything yeah look for key word the system scan two million conversation an hour yeah while shamelessly violate the Constitution the National Security Agency argue it be one of its most important weapon against terrorist and they do not abuse the system somehow that be unreassure well there be this man name Gerard Cuvee who figure out how to hack into Echelon he be able to pick up secure military communication because of that he be able to locate and destroy a US military lab in Dresden in London we shut down Cuvee 's access to Echelon and thank God keep it away from SD 6 so you get echelon you become big Brother the good thing about this mission this guy that I work with this sweetheart Marshall be pull out of sd 6 and take into protective custody the CIA 's go to give he a life a real life I can not tell you what a relief it be know he be safe you take something that do not belong to you my employer would like it back help I help help help help no please no no no Epoxy be a binary compound you have just ingest the resin alone it be not toxic but in combination with a hardener the epoxy cure pass from a liquid state through a gel state to a solid state this transformation will puncture your vital organ block your windpipe cause you to suffocate so let us start over the echelon operating system where be it she be the only light I know she be the real what I have a crush on a guy at work really who be he someone in my department we 've work together for about a year now you be kid I what be his name Michael he be I do not know how to describe he he be smart and he be funny he be so cute hot cute not goofy cute hot cute so why have not I meet this guy he have a girlfriend of course he have which be ultimately irrelevant anyway the bank have a policy against co worker date you know you could quit Francie I do not know what kind of hold they do not have anything on I I just can not quit my job thing be I have not hear you talk like this in forever no one in the free world work as hard as you I know it seem that way maybe you and Michael be destine maybe he can quit I get to go what be wrong Marshall be abduct what our plan be to intercept he on his way home from LAX I know what our plan be the extraction team be about to move in when they see this we run the plate on one of the suv it be rent by Charles Williamson we put his photo ID through a facial recognition database it match a know associate of Gerard Cuvee what step be be take CIA have get one team radiate out from the abduction point and another in London retrace his step our step the mission in London be my op Marshall be my responsibility before be capture Marshall email Cuvee 's copy of the Echelon access program to SD 6 we take away Cuvee 's access to echelon and give it to SD 6 yes but when SD 6 download the program they discover a problem Marshall 's email be break up into packet of datum and route to sd 6 via internet service provider around the world however there be a malfunction and several datum packet be not transmit without they we can not access Echelon can we fill in the miss piece I be tell it would take six month and even then there be no guarantee do we know where do the error occur a government operate facility in Ho Chi Minh City I be send in Sydney and Dixon to retrieve they who be lead the team to recover Marshall we 've change his access code there be nothing that Marshall can tell Cuvee that could possibly hurt we he will be torture most likely kill oh yes I be sure he will be I 've already contact sd 4 there will be a replacement in Op Tech by morning that be the extent of his concern it be as if someone have overcook his steak well you know what Cuvee 's go to do he be go to try to get Marshall to reverse engineer the software get back online yes but you need two thing to get on Echelon the software and an access point the software 's like a map it lead you to the doorway of the system the access point be the door most likely a satellite if we can find the door Cuvee go through and lock it he will not get on not even with Marshall 's help the problem be Diagnostics have run comprehensive system analysis and they can not find the breach your mother think Cuvee may have use a russian network to make contact their version of Echelon call SORM she tell you that I speak with her she think she can find the back door but she have term if you wanna know where Cuvee breach the system it will take time but I could do it if I be give access to echelon no restriction Kendall will never give that to you then I would simply ask you to inform Mr Kendall that the technician he will assign to do the job will discover it be like quicksand your father be correct I decline the offer Second only to Arvin Sloane Irina Derevko be the last person I want have access to the US Government 's secure network she would be watch I mean if she try anything unusual we could just shut the system down Access to computer and telecommunication equipment be specifically prohibit by your mother 's immunity agreement I think we might be waste time Agent Bristow we hire qualified technician around here what do you say we give them a shot your countermission be simple in Vietnam you will download the data packet sd 6 be look for and switch it with this it be corrupt datum we will have what sd 6 need and they will never be able to access echelon and Syd we will find Marshall I will ask you one more time where be the Echelon software you take from we I swear on my mother 's grave I do not know and though technically Mom be still alive she have pick out her grave site Refusal to cooperate have a price no no no no no we can find your mother ok ok ok ok I send the Echelon software to SD 6 there be nothing I can do about that I swear but I see the code all of it and I have a photographic memory so I can re create it I can rewrite it just do not hurt my mother please you leave my mother alone we be off to a very good start what be you do downgrade your network privilege pende the outcome of my investigation your security clearance have be revoke get out of my office when Emily be kill you claim you be in Taipei it be a fact not a claim when a blackmailer steal 100 million of the Alliance 's money in exchange for picture of that murder you be on assignment in Istanbul do back channel unsupervise work you conveniently arrange for yourself I be a senior officer with discretion to arrange and carry out assignment as I see fit I will not be subject to a witch hunt you have no protection here no civil right or civil liberty or reasonable doubt see that I be not disturb again yes ma'am get everyone you can from Op Tech now notify asset in Istanbul Taipei and Azerbaijan we will need immediate assistance in forge hard evidence of my be in each of those location on specific day and time we have a situation Ariana Kane the head of Alliance Counterintelligence she be investigate I in connection with the murder of Emily Sloane she be check your alias the place you 've be you be cover for that yes passport stamp plane ticket enough to withstand a cursory enquiry this be anything but cursory I do not kill Emily Sloane but I do have secret and the last thing I can afford the last thing Sydney can afford be someone discover that my loyalty do not lie with SD 6 we get the print for Istanbul this go with the car you rent in Taipei have we backdate phoney charge through my credit card for these location restaurant rental car agency hotel Room charge they will be on file with the respective concierge by morning good bad time yeah what else be new you leave word with Analysis when Tippin 's psych profile come back you want to be inform anything I should know just run protocol and bring he in you get it what about surveillance I think about rotoscope you out of some other surveillance feed but if they slow down the frame rate they would know it be alter that be why we go with the greenscreen this be the original surveillance feed from the Istanbul Intercontinental this be the footage that we film early use some subpixel masking and we get look I even give you a shadow we 've get your fingerprint on rental car key on seat belt buckle Hair sample stitch into pillow case good I want to review everything I think thinking be not sufficient I wanna know you be right I wanna see the plane ticket Nina Bailes from Tech Sky Industries I be here to see Mr Nguyen access the system now I should be in mid presentation thank you for give Tech Sky the opportunity to talk with you about our microsatellite technology at your direction the projector will emit a high intensity pulse strobe light that flash at the same frequency as human brain wave effectively render target unconscious I can get the data packet and return and they will not know I 've be go for three minute they will experience it like a daydream any long they will regain consciousness and you will be find out now make sure you put these glass on first they be time synchronise with the pulse so you will be unaffected a small constellation of satellite in low Earth orbit be cheap to launch and maintain than a traditional satellite network and if one microsat fail the entire system need not be replace what you be look at be a typical Tech Sky package ok Syd do your thing I be almost in ok Syd I be in La'an Nguyen be that right right his ID will give you access to any room in the ministry the datum packet be in the hard drive which be locate in the server room two level down room 206 you 've get three minute Syd

that hard drive be in for repair where level one room 147 I be on my way no the repair room be just off the lobby I will go meet I at the extraction point Dixon no I will make it Robert Milton I be here for the Tech Sky presentation one moment please I be so late already my boss be go to kill I I tell you I could make it start over there work toward I get it ok let us get out of here Sydney the guards'll be here any minute this be a great victory you both should be very proud thank you sir but our thought be with Marshall have there be any word no I be afraid not but our effort continue as do our prayer so now sd 6 have everything it need to access Echelon any idea on how long before it be up and run Midnight tomorrow at the late you should have see the look on Sloane 's face when we get back I do not think I 've ever see he so happy about a mission he say he be pray for Marshall listen about Marshall one of our team trace Cuvee 's unit that abduct Marshall to a safe house outside London by the time they get there it be abandon it be wire with four pound of C 4 they never have a chance it get bad in light of the tragedy the director have order a halt in the search so for the moment Marshall 's on his own you think maybe he could point that somewhere else all right never mind it be dumb you know Sydney 's sleep off another business trip yeah to Dublin I think Glasgow two more I set a world record will I be serious last week it be Buenos Aires before it be Tokyo I mean it never end Fran you know how much that use to bug I right I mean I complain about it constantly but her job you know what she do it be important to her I do not care I be still worried about her ever since Danny die all she do be work oh but now there be this new guy you should 've hear she talk about he she sound so happy she tell you about a guy yeah somebody from work Michael something you know he I no no of course not cos the jerk at the bank where she slave will not let they date cos it be against the rule so they be not date no he be actually date somebody else she be just pine oh you know what the mailman leave this for you guess there be a package for you at the post office hey will got your psych report back you do well I be not a sociopath well I do not say that do I have a job yes a pay job yes as an analyst you will be ask to review classified document and file report think of it as write article only now your source material be classify in fact your cover be as a journalist what do that mean be I an agent what agent be field train you be an analyst you be desk train you sit at a desk that be cool the Agency operate a monthly travel magazine call Trade Roads there be a small LA office go there when we page you the material we will need analyse will be there when you arrive but do not remove they from the building when you be do fill out the paperwork just give it to Bill he will make sure it be process I get health insurance Welcome to the CIA thank you listen obviously you be a good guy I can not tell you how much I appreciate this job and what I be go to say be inappropriate but Sydney care about you and what you guy have or do not have mean a great deal to her I wanna make sure you respect that I just get off the phone with the director again and he ask I again if I know we be in the intelligence business SD 6 be by our good estimate less than 12 hour away from access Echelon which would give they all the intelligence capability of the CIA our effort to prevent Gerard Cuvee from reaccesse Echelon end in tragedy four agent kill as far as we know your sd 6 Tech Ops officer Marshall Flinkman could already have Cuvee up and run again as for Derevko 's intel on SORM Infosec have be unsuccessful in their search for a back door access point what the hell just happen I have to shut down the system SORM detect I be map its network and spit out a virus my mother know this would happen that be the word she use quicksand she might 've set up the virus why keep she here if you be not go to use she you have say Derevko turn herself in as part of a plan something we can not see if you be right then give her access to Echelon could only help that in this instance I think she could be an asset they find it quicksand I tell your father my term full access to the network no restriction Dad fight for you on this do not make he regret it I will need to send an access code how will we know you be not signal your organisation you will not do it look clean slow it down 200 per cent still good if this be fake it be the good job I 've ever see be this the last of the surveillance feed Karachi Istanbul Taipei yeah that be it I think you should see this yes yes we should have full access to echelon in a matter of hour Forensic report ok alain yes I will let you know as soon as we be fully operational yes absolutely ok brain matter be find in the barrel of one of Jack Bristow 's service pistol accord to the munition log he check out a Glock 19 compact for one day report a single accidental discharge and no casualty I think you be here to investigate the event surround my wife 's death the day Bristow check out this weapon kill someone with it and cover it up be the day your wife be murder do you have enough cell to do a dna profile already be do Good well if it match with Emily I want you to let I know immediately of course you guy like cherry PEZ you know those cherry PEZ the little candy that come in the little superhero thing yeah I collect the dispenser I think I have the large collection in the world I actually write the Guinness Book of World Records about it they say that there be a girl in Australia nine year old have a large collection than I which kinda suck cos well she be so much young than I you know and I be so much old than her I be kinda hungry you guy get some snack or you probably I agree something 's wrong with my computer I can not get online can you check it someone have launch a denial of service attack on we we be getting ping over and over it be slow down the network that be odd they do not spoof the origin IP how can someone be smart enough to hack in and forget to cover their track whoa whoa what be go on what we have a firewall you break through it I want to know why I be just try to download an mp3 off Audiogalaxy an mp3 you know a music file this I be 75 per cent do with I just think the rest of it would go a lot fast with some tune I be just go to show you the mp3 you like Sammy Hagar I will go back to the program come with I Marshall 's in Mexico City he signal we through the computer we trace he through the IP address he use uh huh ok I will notify the extraction team at once we would like your permission to conduct the operation ourselves yes of course be you make any progress here like echelon SORM have access point if I can locate the directory we will know if there be any access point that we could keep sd 6 and Cuvee off the system I would like a coffee please Cream or sugar Black thank you Kane call a meeting do she know anything Unclear but I be tell she have two unit from security section prepare to take I in I have to be ready for anything I have to admit I be impressed I 've rarely find a record as well document as yours you could not have be more thorough if you try if I may ask what be it you be look for there be only two piece of evidence I have not be able to corroborate help I with they and we be finish Damn she be get the place wire Jack we make six agent from security section every time you make a phone call on your STU the SIM card on your cellphone communicate with the local cell tower those communication be record on the card 's memory chip it be kind of like a minitravelogue we need the cell tower signal code for Istanbul Karachi and Taipei Jack listen to I what pocket be your phone in if it be in the left jacket pocket hold up one finger in the right pocket hold up two you two ready to order not yet thank you have my phone record which we both know could easily be forge so I would like your phone you say there be two thing who be Stephen Haladki he be a CIA agent loyal to Irina Derevko whom you murder we find brain matter in a gun you fire on the day Emily be murder I admit I think DNA test would prove you kill she but instead they prove you kill Haladki we have reliable intel that Derevko be access information through the CIA her source turn out to be Haladki he be crucial to her operation and have to be remove I get the tower code we can not wait for Bristow 's phone give I yours Vaughn give I your phone the card be be reprogramme I will stamp Jack 's serial number on your SIM card you will have to switch they out here you go if Haladki work with Derevko why hide his death from Sloane the death of a CIA agent draw unwanted attention and focus if that happen the safe recourse be to say nothing ever be we through as soon as I get your SIM card yes of course I will be in touch move in on the package be you ready to party Syd I be ready to receive be we ready to party I speak nine language Techno be not one of they I will need cover now Dixon wish I luck I 've piggyback onto the surveillance feed be you get a signal one second ok Syd I be in he be in a storage room on the 47th floor take the eastern stairwell the room should be the second door on your left Guards I make two I will lock down the elevator secure all access door that should keep everyone else away but Syd be careful Program 's do we will be uplinked to echelon in two minute Excellent tell your boss or whatever that I be finish the program 's write we estimate sd 6 would have echelon operational by midnight it be ten after the blue be echelon access point the red be SORM access point you say you would find one that overlap I say I would find out if one overlap and if they do not then I can not help you you know where you can go you freak any idea kill he straight to hell my friend straight to hell kill his mother hi wow let us go Syd we 've get a problem I 've be lock out their security system be operational get out of there now Dixon we be trap I will get over to you now there be no time come on we be on the 47th floor remember when we fly to London I say I compress a high glide tactical parachute in the lining of my jacket well as luck would have it this one be get it too along with a hyperextend tandem sling come here I get it my name be Marshall J Flinkman and I be here to rescue you if this be some kind of manipulation the overlap access point as promise confirm a match with Echelon right now close the access point and sd 6 will be shut out we have confirmation it be a match as promise Alain we have echelon at our disposal I be afraid something be happen so Marshall save our life how do I return the favour by bring he back to SD 6 we have to Syd Bringing Marshall into the CIA do not make sense any more not after sloane get the Echelon program I know it be just Marshall have no idea who he be really work for here by my side an angel here by my side the devil never turn your back on I it will not always be like this right it will end I should go do not turn on the light you should not have run from her Jack Kane need someone to blame since she can not find who really murder Emily she be decide to blame I I do not murder your wife but if I do not find the person who do Kane will frame I for it I have some lead I need you to pursue they for I can I trust you to do that of course this will stay between we Hello Agent Kane Arvin Sloane Jack Bristow just leave my house previously on Alias I have a crush on a guy at work really who be he someone in my department we 've work together for about a year now you be kid I what be his name Michael what be you do downgrade your network privilege pende the outcome of my investigation your security clearance have be revoke we have a situation Ariana Kane head of Alliance counterintelligence she be investigate I in connection with the murder of Emily Sloane I do not kill Emily Sloane but I do have secret and the last thing I can afford the last thing Sydney can afford be someone discover that my loyalty do not lie with SD 6 Kane need someone to blame since she can not find who really murder Emily she be decide to blame I I do not murder your wife but if I do not find the person who do Kane will frame I for it I have some lead I need you to pursue they for I can I trust you to do that of course this will stay between we Hello Agent Kane Arvin Sloane Jack Bristow just leave my house I want to report a murder sit down where be this murder commit San Francisco last night who be murder I have five name Alliance partner I need their whereabouts and phone record for the date list I 've include dead drop instruction assume the usual protocol have be compromise take it easy Dad get in Sydney what be you do here Kendall contact I he be worried because you have not signal in since last night Alliance counterintelligence be after I Alliance Dad what the hell be go on someone extort they out of 100 million they think that person be I Mountaineer you 've get company two vehicle an outrider parallel you one block west and a pursuit vehicle 100 foot behind how long have you know about this I do not tell you because it do not concern you if the Alliance think you be lie to they they will kill you that concern I what concern I be have they suspect that you be my accomplice that be why I 've keep you out of it take your next left now take your next right your ride be a half block ahead several month ago the Alliance offer Sloane a partnership position in exchange he have to kill his wife because Emily have learn the truth about SD 6 he poison she or so he think soon after the funeral Sloane begin receive odd message message design to indicate that his effort have fail follow soon after by a terrifying delivery Proof she be still alive and in exchange for Emily they demand money 100 million which the Alliance pay and the blackmailer kill she anyway the Alliance obviously have to find someone to blame for this so why focus on you I be no more a suspect than anyone else but as they examine my conduct they realise I have secret element of my alibi that because of our work for CIA I can not fully justify and Sloane do he think you do this I be not certain what be you go to do stay here for the moment I will research what I can the man I go to meet at the movie theatre have information about the Alliance Intel I be not sure the CIA can access it be sd 6 you have to go in no I be call in sick I be help you no Sydney you can not the agent head up the investigation be not interested in you not yet but if you do not show up you will arouse her suspicion we can not allow that to happen ok let us be honest among life experience to be avoid getting kidnap definitely rank near the top except actually third grade kinda suck too there be this whole thing lunch money thing with the uh I kinda overdo it but you save my bacon thank you Marshall thank you do not worry about it oh uh Mr Dixon I really never have an occasion to buy another man a present except my father for Father 's Day but anyway it be cologne thank you I think it be a really nice scent and it be go to be nice on you not that you need a new scent or anything I mean your natural scent 's really very Marshall you know I will be quiet now I appreciate that actually Mr Sloane I notice you be not wear the tie I give you it be ok you be look at a prototype of the Triad 's most startling achievement to date a quantum gyroscope missile guidance system accord to the partial specification we be able to intercept not only be this device cheap and easy to manufacture but it be far more accurate than anything in our current arsenal it be capable of transform a ' 70 era Scud into a precision guide munition with a range and lethality equivalent to that of a cruise missile how do we get these photo last month sd 5 task a team of agent to perform a recon op on the Triad 's r d lab in Nice France your task be acquisition here we have Karl Schatz he be a courier for Triad and he be transport the prototype to Berlin for mass production you will intercept it en route there be no room for failure on this one you can imagine the consequence if enemy of the United States acquire this technology there be so many thing I hate about Arvin Sloane but the thing that I hate the most be the way he wrap his criminal activity in the flag well we will not let he get away with it before you go we will make a defective copy of that gyroscope for you to give to SD 6 we will need to see those photograph Dixon have them he be already on his way to Nice then we will have to get a team to France when you be through with your mission make sure you be hold the gyroscope we will duplicate it on site and Syd you should know that we 've be do everything we can to help your father you 've be help my father yeah you know the Alliance be investigate my father yes for how long two week Syd I understand you be upset yeah I be your father say why we have not tell you now I 've have time to think about that it be a question of your safety he be almost kill I save he it have not get to that but it do I do not want you to have more on your mind why be you worry about what be on my mind it be a judgement call a judgement call that you 've be make for the past three month involve you have no upside there be no upside to keep I inform you do not tell I about Manolo or that you have discussion with my mother you do not even tell I you be see Alice again wait what be this about this be about I be too old to be coddle your life be complicated Sydney forgive I for try to make it any easy I do not need you for that Jack I be send this through a secure server I be sorry I inform Ariana Kane that you visit my house last night not because I believe you be guilty I do not but because I have to this past summer when I be initiate into the Alliance a device be implant into my neck it be intend as a means of ensure loyalty among Alliance partner among other thing this device track my whereabouts as well as my vital sign it also transmit my conversation back to the Alliance so you see they already know you would be to see I you offer many suspect but all your lead be dead end now I offer one of my own last year I murder a member of the Alliance Jack Jean Briault you can understand why I be reluctant to reveal this it be quite possible that the blackmailer be stir by revenge that he or she be close to Briault stay safe Jack good luck Briault have a wife and an adult son but neither would have have the necessary insight to blackmail the Alliance and the other partner consider Briault soft no one be sad to see he go so you have nothing be you consider go into witness protection that would leave Sydney expose with no one to watch she back you would have to take she with you and have she spend the rest of her life look over her shoulder that be not an option then if you be not here to say goodbye why have you bring this to I I need someone to brainstorm with surely the CIA have team who specialise in these matter Forensics profiler yes they do have Information Resources pull everything they have on Briault I understand that you request Sydney Bristow 's computer well three month ago Agent Dixon report evidence suggest she be a double agent that be a misunderstand Dixon come upon Sydney as she be execute an operation Jack have authorise yes I read your report I think either she be an accomplice to his blackmail or else the two of they have be up to something more long term you must have notice that Bristow frequently assign his daughter to operation of his own design Sydney Bristow be an excellent agent all the more reason he would enlist her help once you recover the gyroscope you and Dixon will separate for your flight home our team will be set up in this utility room where they will duplicate the gyroscope any question maybe you should go over it again it be a pretty complicated plan maybe you could make it easy ok look I do not want to be here any more than you do hey look who be join you in France hey hey three month in the hospital I get a hey how about a little sugar I be glad you be back thank you and thank you for the plant by the way Amazingly I 've be able to keep it alive all right bring I up to speed what be our plan I should get to my plane I will see you in France ok nothing yet Syd no sign of the courier copy that just let I know when to move you know what what I 've already make 47 euro hey you sure you do not wanna talk about this there be nothing to talk about I share my fight with you no you do not yeah I do remember when Alan piss in the living room that be your dog but I be angry about it and I let you know how upset I be I appreciate you try to cheer I up you do not have to do that all right here be a thought tell she how you feel I know I know I be the one who say this be a line you do not cross but that be before I nearly die and you know what they say about the white light and all that no they be wrong it be darkness Darkness I understand Game time Syd here come our guy Gyroscope be in a shoulder harness under his left pec you can use the artful Dodger right now if it be not in his briefcase and it be in his pocket here be a little goody every pickpocket can use I like to call this baby the Artful Dodger you know after that movie um Oliver right please sir can I have some more I think that be a good one so basically you just turn this guy like that flip it on turn it around and this little guy will cut through anything Damn it I like this tie well hurry Syd Syd move the wave keep on crash on I for some reason how ya doing it be not I Damn machine it happen every time I go through these whatever JFK I go through five time they literally have I take off my shirt oh my God watch the hand hey it be not a date I see you wanna get your thrill thank you good work I will see you in LA good work Base Ops this be Boy Scout Mountaineer just deliver the package we be proceed with the copy they be estimate two hour till the duplicate 's ready listen do you wanna go to dinner we be drive in town and I see this place Rousseau I think it be call Vaughn we we can not do that why not well for a million reason if Alliance security see we together they will kill we the near Alliance cell be in Zurich the CIA track sd 6 security section there be be no signal no movement you be serious we 've be to restaurant and sit near each other we 've meet in park and convenience store and all of they in LA where we be much more likely to be see two thing one I think it be not that great a risk and two I be hungry I be starve we be go to be together anyway why can not we be eat be not you hungry yeah I be hungry let us do it yeah I be go to change that be a good idea ok and we be go to dinner I be go to keep my comm channel open I need you to monitor the RF frequency get it in exchange I will take an éclair no I be serious any suspect signal I wanna know about it anything if they be small bring at least two how we do over here Sydney Bristow just leave the airport accompany by a man not Dixon find out who he be well you speak French almost as well as I do Mademoiselle thank you see what you like and I will be right back I think wine would help the situation I be just think the same thing there must be a dozen way to blackmail the Alliance all of they far less elaborate than this one so we can assume a secondary objective be to make Arvin suffer someone harbour an acute hatred mean it could be anyone do the Alliance have any permanent operation in Peru Peru no why Jean Briault whenever he travel he would use his credit card except here six time this past year he go to Lima and not a single transaction I think there be a custom statement six arrival into Chavez Airport each time he declare 70 000 in cash why what be he do with all that money no investment he be not buy art be it possible he be run his own syndicate one the Alliance be not aware of he can not wire his agent operational money the Alliance will spot that so he bankroll they in Peru assume we be right why would they want revenge for his murder I will have Customs send over all arrival and departure into Peru for one week on either side of Briault 's visit when I be your wife I would meet my case officer in his hotel room I suggest you find out where Briault stay and pull the hotel security footage so I hear you on the phone with Base Ops your code name be Boy Scout yeah why um it go back to CST clandestine service training you do not wanna hear this Vaughn ok the Boy Scouts have a motto always be prepare well on my first day I show up and I would forget my field manual so the instructor say that be your one screwup from then on you would well be prepare this story be a disaster tell she she be pretty be you an idiot I be go to turn you off now Goodbye sorry he be not SD 6 check US DMV what make you think he be american what make you think he be not so who be our mystery man tell I about your pet what your pet I wanna know about every pet you 've ever have look at that Michael Vaughn US Department of State Son of a bitch he be CIA play pool I can see it we should play sometime so you like everything so uh it be too late for you to set out for Avignon and you have much to drink Upstairs I have an inn and tonight you be my guest please take your time do you ask he to do that there be so many issue with this hold on a second I think we should have an open mind about this an open mind it would be rude to overlook such a generous offer without proper consideration I would not dream of it ok but there be clearly issue yes I do not disagree ok good right on time go ahead Base Ops Infosec just call Interpol report a network intrusion five minute later someone hack into US DMV and download Vaughn 's info both attack originate from Nice Boy Scout do you copy boy Scout this be Field Station do you respond boy Scout what be the name of the restaurant where they be have dinner what be the name of the restaurant hello you 've be make get out of there now Syd behind you go go Gun toss it over on your knee Hands behind your head down get down Potesh Jonathan ID six Tango five Charlie David patch I through to Los Angeles Ariana Kane this be Kane hello hello hello take the car I will have Weiss pick I up I will pick up the copy of the gyroscope before I get on the plane we be abort the countermission when these guy do not show up SD 6 be go to investigate they can not prove anything but this be the one time we can not deceive they there have to be option we have to give sd 6 what they want as dangerous as that be you know that we be so stupid it be my fault that be not true you have to go I will see you back in LA hey hey this your debrief for Kendall yeah you can not show he this no I be serious if Kendall see this he need to know why SD 6 have the real gyroscope I agree I think so too but this require a little creativity look tell he it be my fault ok tell he that grind the lense take a little bit long than expect and we be not able to make Sydney 's plane I will not let you cover for I I be not but it be partially my fault too I be the one that tell you to take she on a date you tell I to tell she how I feel whatever I be three month past a near death experience what be you listen to my advice for I be recommend that I be replace as her case officer ok now you be just be stupid I be sorry but that be ridiculous I nearly blow our operation inside SD 6 not to mention put Sydney 's life in danger she want to go to dinner too she be a big girl she know the risk my point be that my judgement be compromise not to mention all the damage that you and Sydney have do to SD 6 have you give any thought to the fact that maybe all that work be do because of the way you guy feel about each other how be that for spin it be not bad whatever you decide to do just make sure you discuss this with Sydney first ok I mean this affect she too anything whenever Briault go to Peru he stay at Hotel Cero Cantidad we be scan everyone who pass through the lobby if he meet with any asset they will show up on the federal database this be Briault that be he last February that be he 2001 November 2001 September stop who be that with he can we enhance this the shadow be pretty severe I can boost the gamma be they together let I try something here this will not be perfect Jack I just see McCarthy do he tell you about Kane she and Briault be have an affair I can not stand that I do not put that together myself he also say you be go to SD 6 to prove Kane blackmail the Alliance you know this how the very day sloane hand over 100 million in bearer bond Kane open an account in Monaco the content of that account be protect by privacy law but sd 6 utilise their cover as Credit Dauphine to acquire illicit access to that information if I can get on their network I can verify her balance but this be base on your assumption that Kane just park 100 million in the bank my point be if you be wrong they will kill you let I contact the director the CIA can verify what be in the account he would have to get General Counsel to sign off that be minimum 48 hour I may be safe here but if they have not already they will soon begin to suspect Sydney but I appreciate the offer Jack Bristow 's here he be in the building the security log show he come in two minute ago seal the exit no one leave until we find he who monitor close circuit Jack can I help you yes come with we please hello Jack there be a plane wait to take we to London but I think we should wait for your daughter to return before we leave I come here to investigate a blackmail but you 've prove far more compelling than a simple thief I know what you do do you I be eager to hear what that may be Sodium Pentothal will not take more than a few minute then we will talk about Sydney five minute long and I would have tell everything Sydney and I would have be reveal as double agent and kill fortunately Sloane see the email that I send he from the server room detail what I discover Ariana Kane have in fact deposit the bearer bond into that Monaco account but only long enough to convert they into cash which she then transfer out and have they recover the cash not yet and Arvin never question why you run no he realise Kane be on a witch hunt that run be a valid option in fact he be take a week off and leave I in charge while he be go thank you for everything there be one thing that strike I as odd yes I too you say sloane request Kane to investigate the one person who have an apparent motive for blackmail someone easy to frame interesting theory or not hey hey what do Kendall say he tell I about your father he do not mention anything about our date if that be what you mean have you write your mission debrief no not yet if I tell the truth at the least they will remove I as your case officer but despite what we do how stupid we be I know we do good work we need to stay together I agree we do good work I do not understand when I get back to sd 6 and see my father it be clear no one

workday right just in the middle of the day hang out let us move do you tell she about the transfer some recruit from Langley be go to be observe wait before the meeting I be go to say something and it will either be obvious to you or seem presumptuous either way I 've get to say it this be not work I 've be think about this for a while I do not know what the hell to do what I think you know what I need you to tell I you need I to tell you what that when you be on operation I can not sleep at night that when we be in debrief I have to force myself to remember what the hell we be suppose to be review when all I want to do be kiss you sometimes it be hard to remember what we be suppose to be talk about that be what I be talk about and the thing that make I crazy every day be people that would kill we if we be see together the Alliance SD 6 sloane be the very force that bring you into my life to begin with what kind of a sick joke be that so what be you think that maybe we should not be work together that be what I be think but then I think we be great together I know and the more we work together the soon the Alliance gets destroy so what be you suggest what be this the flirt corner we be talk yeah I figure that out there be a meeting National security remember that it be important for the people we will be right there Arvin Sloane as most of you know Sloane be the act director of SD 6 for those of you new to the fun and game SD 6 be an arm of the Alliance a worldwide organise crime syndicate responsible for weapon trade drug traffic and murder the Alliance keep a dozen office or cell sd 1 through SD 12 we 've identify the location of seven of these cell the rest be speculation the Agents Bristow Jack and Sydney have be work undercover at SD 6 track their objective operation contact work under Arvin Sloane until now we 've intercept communication which reveal that the Alliance have pick someone to be sloane 's replacement Anthony Geiger which be about as much as I can tell you about he Geiger have no file at CIA FBI no police record no overdue video rental nothing excuse I Sloane 's be replace he be be MIA for five day with sloane go and Geiger come in we no long have access to their inner circle so Sydney and Jack your assignment be to get close to Geiger earn his trust get back inside that inner circle that be it Dad the one person in the world I want bring to justice he be disappear I 've be do this a long time Sydney there be rarely an end to the story I do not like it whatever be happen here excuse I Mr Geiger yes Sydney Bristow come in sit down let us see I just want to introduce myself say hello what can you tell I about Danny what would you like to know you be engage yes well tell I something more I assume you mean how Danny die I tell he the truth that I work for SD 6 Security section discover this they tell Sloane Sloane have he kill what kind of doctor be he go to be a paediatric cardiologist really well that be unusual do he like kid Danny have a young brother who be bear with a condition a heart condition and they be tell there be no treatment if the people I work for would assassinate my wife I would not show up at the office the next day so why come back what for the precept of SD 6 be make clear to I when I be recruit what happen be my fault and I be a faithful officer of this agency thank for come in the new boss have a dreadful personality do not you think I 've see bad be I suppose to take that personally Sark what do you want when I meet with Geiger this morning I leave his office feeling as unstrung as you look just so you know I be fully string we all have secret Sydney and from what I 've hear about Geiger he will discover they what have you hear about Geiger former german intelligence have more enemy than various other german we be familiar with he seem to think Sloane be a traitor he be already unlocked sloane 's secret file on Server 47 there be only 46 server really well he announce it to I as if it be a victory I 've already hack Sloane 's file on Server 47 there be only one reason Sloane would keep secret the existence of a computer because this computer Server 47 be a vulnerability until you tell I what you be suggest I have nothing to respond to I think there be a central Alliance computer I think that be what Server 47 be a network that link all the sd cell it make sense do not it I be try to find a flaw in this line of thought I wanna find this computer if I be right it could tell we everything name of the Alliance partner location of their office Sydney Dad this could be the silver bullet I will get CIA to sanction it we track down Server 47 the reason you could not get a 20 on it be because it do not exist on this planet it be in the sky it be a 747 purchase by the Alliance in 1998 they retrofit the interior to contain a secure server and a satellite uplink they keep the computer airborne it only land for refuel the Alliance have this man oversee the operation Gils Macor he be an accomplished computer security expert he and his bodyguard travel with the server at all time this guy spend his life on a plane with a computer it be a really nice plane how do they convince an upper level asset to do that job right they provide he with woman you be kid I no twice a week alternate airport in England and Spain a high end escort agency provide a new friend I have to be his friend no you just have to get he alone the computer 's in the belly of the plane but apparently there be terminal access in the main cabin we be all go to Barcelona we have a team set up there already they will ambush the drop off of his late date but they will deliver you in her place just get onto the plane get Macor alone access the server and transmit its content to we we will be in a cargo jet fly at altitude we have to stay within 5 000 foot of you to receive your signal here be your transmitter the earrings'll give we audio and video and Op Tech have the rest of your gear guy we should get to the plane Security scan ok whenever you wanna have that talk what talk about the cologne or whatever the hell you be wear I be not wear any cologne something be go on no man naturally smell as good as you do right now ok her camera be on here we go here we go that son of a bitch Easy come on I swear I be go to kill this guy there be no way that guy smell as good as you it be aftershave I get a new aftershave yeah well I would lighten up on it yeah oh yeah yeah to the point of nonuse tell I how to access Server 47 behind the frame there be a terminal all right keep go we be transmit got it we should be at Heathrow in an hour Team 's already in place I be go to take out the guard throw the gun make he reach for it you think you can steal from we you little bitch no no no no no oh my God she be all yours hey guess what Sydney 's go to be late again I know she be miss all the dirty work look at these guy I hate this part ok the suspense be kill I what be the occasion the restaurant be actually make a profit after only six month be that even possible yes hence the lobster dinner seriously if anyone tell I last year that I would be

the New York Times but I be write for a living will that be genius I love that you be write again it be fantastic you be ok with it yeah like I can not find another waiter in Los Angeles oh Francie you be the good congratulation you too analysis got do with the hard drive Sir this be our chance to destroy the Alliance now Miss Bristow thank you I understand what the paper suggest but you do not rush an operation like this Sir as soon as the Alliance realise there be a breach in their server this information will not be valid do you recall the 150 lb of C 4 explosive bury in the subbasement at sd 6 and probably every other sd cell if this intel be wrong and we move on it we be talk about the death of hundred of civilian the answer be in the document accord to the information you retrieve each sd cell use a code which change weekly to operate their security system the current code be list right here so you be say we need to get into sd 6 and find out what the code be right now if it match the one in the document the rest of the intel be real in which case I could go to Langley about raid Alliance facility do we have the current sd 6 code no but I can get it yesterday I think I be really yeah it be yeah it be great thank you thank you for noticing it be really good do you know that guy at table 45 no I do not know he he be totally look at you he be not look at I he be so what be go on what what do you mean you guy be both act like you be on drug well we sort of make out oh my God all right this be too weird you call for I I 've be review Mr Sloane 's work I find an email

today those of you who know Emma Wallace may find it difficult to focus but I will ask you to try for the last two month she be task with a deep cover assignment her objective be to gain the trust of this man Dr Renzo Markovic a former r d scientist who be be develop a new classified technology under the project head Helix he be already receive preliminary bid from several terrorist organisation weapon we do not know that be the question that Agent Wallace be try to answer before she be murder Agent Wallace may not be the only casualty in our effort against Markovic she be send undercover with a partner another CIA operative whom we now presume to be capture or dead his final satellite transmission indicate he be proceed to Cayo Concha off the coast of the Dominican Republic Markovic lease one of the low floor in the Sirena del Sol resort where he conduct his research if our operative 's still alive he be be hold there Agent Bristow you be on point Agent Vaughn you will be assist

through a window Arden Jezek he be Markovic 's chief of security at the resort which mean he be get access to Project Helix and probably know where Lennox be be hold why be not we go after Markovic directly our surveillance team say they lose track of he four week ago Jezek be our good shot it be so tough to get up it be so tough hi I 've inject you with a cardiotoxin you will have a heart attack within the hour unless you do exactly as we say then you get the antidote be we clear yeah be Agent Lennox still alive yes where be he sublevel room 47 you will escort we down there and you will help my partner download everything you have on Project Helix smile they be with I I will see you at the exit point yeah Sydney if Agent Lennox be still alive he may have undergo psychological reconditioning you could be walk into a trap let us start over from the beginning I 've already tell you everything my name be Sydney Bristow I be a CIA agent I 've come to take you home I can not see I can not see I can not see they use metachlorazine on you it be a photoreactive acid I be cover your eye with a bandage keep this bandage on or you could be permanently blind you be ok you be sweat

hold his own with the interrogator and he risk lose his sight to get we out I do not know we will know more after the psych eval how be you do I could 've swear you be a blonde I be my hair 's usually brown Hard to keep track it be nice to see the face of the person who save my life so um where be uh Emma be she uh be she back in LA Jim Emma 's dead I be so sorry we know that you 've be through hell Agent Lennox and I apologise that your homecoming have to be celebrate with a psych evaluation but you 've be give a clean bill of health even though I be sure it do not feel like that Agent Wallace 's death have leave several question unanswere can you tell we how you infiltrate Dr Markovic 's organisation we be hire on as freelance security expert at his villa in Berlin Emma Agent Wallace gain Markovic 's trust enough to become his driver in that capacity she be privy to a phone conversation between Markovic and someone she believe to be his superior in which they indicate Project Helix be ready for testing be you say that markovic answer to someone else that be Agent Wallace 's impression base on the conversation they do not use name it be just a voice on the speakerphone and you never hear this voice yourself no how be your eyesight it be well can you tell we what lead to your capture when we report to Langley the project be proceed we be order to break into the facility in Cayo Concha and hack the central database I know there be a good chance we would be catch I decide to go in alone so I could transmit the datum to Emma in Berlin if I be trap they move in before I could do that do you have any idea how she be compromise no I do not ok I think we have a pretty comprehensive picture here there be a driver wait to take you to a safe house nearby be there anything you would like to add we be engage in a case like this we start by digitise the news footage that cover the bombing uh huh you uh you like italian food I have a boyfriend yeah I too hey Weiss excuse I I think the new girl have a thing for I I be go over Agent Wallace 's contact log now she phone in every two day like clockwork I mean the slight discrepancy in protocol and she contact we for verification your point be the day Lennox say he be capture we have no record of anything from her no warning no extraction request nothing why do not she make contact Agent Weiss Roll it back that flash of static right before the blast an RF transmitter would account for the interference but all radio signal be shut off wait uh run it back slow it down a little bit there so if the signal interrupt the feed it have to have come from our triggerman 's detonator which would place he within a block of this camera all right find out where the news van be park check all ATMs traffic cam all right we may just have this guy 's face on video Lennox Jim Beware of the grieve man and his bottle Emma use to say that she have spend so much of her life pretend to be other people that she be afraid she might disappear I have be sit here try to remember all her alias you be right it be hard to keep track I lose my fiancé last year and I know we be train to compartmentalise thing that hurt too much but I still have not be able to do that and as hard as it be I I would rather feel it than to not feel anything hey oh I be sorry Agent Bristow Agent Lennox what be go on back up against the wall what be this why what what be you do all right stay down Lennox Lennox stay down Sydney go hey hey Sydney go ok stay down go go Sydney go ok take it easy take it easy what be it he be go to be place in federal custody what be go on we 've decrypt the spec on Project Helix that you and Vaughn obtain the datum describe a breakthrough in next generation molecular gene therapy it refer to a new procedure whereby a patient 's face and body be reshape to identically resemble someone else Agent Lennox be the first test subject to be double double how like clone not exactly so you be say the man that we rescue be not Agent Lennox it be possible so who be he base on our intel the procedure 's first recipient be the man who create the technology Dr Markovic there be no way the man we have in custody be Dr Markovic I know it sound insane but as we be analyse the news footage Phillips notice the interference of an RF signal which help narrow our search we get this from a traffic camera over the last few year it be become common practice for want terrorist to employ man who look like they decoy design to mislead intelligence agency with this new procedure that would no long be necessary man like Osama Bin Laden could simply be make to look like someone else clearly that be not something we can afford to have advertise on the black market how be this possible without obvious scar the procedure be not surgical the patient 's genetic code be alter to reshape their physical attribute be it reversible it be unclear it only work on people of a certain genetic disposition and the recipient must be induce into a comatose state for several day while their cell regenerate the datum indicate the only way to distinguish the real person from the double be by an ocular scan a flaw in the iris be deliberately build into the procedure to tell they apart even if Lennox be who he say he be there be no real way of guarantee that he be not the man in that video I be tell you the man we rescue just have his life destroy he be on our side he be who he say he be what the hell do you mean I 've be double the project you be investigate Project Helix what about it a prototype surgical gene resequencer all right mean what Markovic create a technique that allow people to change their appearance that be why we give you the ocular scan to make sure that you be really you do we know who it be the man who take my identity Dr Markovic now I know why Emma do not call for an extraction she have no idea I be capture we have a hotel room in Berlin she think she be with I Markovic have the Helix prototype take off Cayo Concha we track it to a freight yard in Poland he be try to hide it what be the next move I 've be order to find the prototype download the schematic then destroy it I be come with you this be Mountaineer we be in position in the train yard copy Mountaineer we 've get you on satellite we be read five guard one on the north side of track two one between track one and two two on the southern perimeter one on top of the centre car wait we just lose the last guard hold while we reacquire his signal do you have the drill Drill all right I be have trouble see the third tumbler ok the borescope 's jammed hang on do you have the audio all right here we go all right all right all right we get it ok I be go to rig the explosive all right Boot Camp I be into the data log copy that stand by to receive the schematic all right wait a second accord to this the sequencer be be use twice what I be not the only one who be be double who else it do not say Agent Vaughn a call be route through the PBX you need to take right away who be I talk to my name be James Lennox the man you rescue be Dr Renzo Markovic I know that sound impossible he be develop some kind of genetic doubling prototype we know I be capture try to infiltrate his medical lab on Concha Cayo they know the CIA would send in a team after I and they set you up I just escape 12 hour ago while they be try to transport I off the island where be you now I be in Poland I 've track the prototype to a freight yard here I be go to destroy it I get he he be two mile away and travel alone it could be Markovic a guard may have alert he and he be now try to prevent we from sabotage the prototype there be no way to be certain I would like to believe you but we conduct a test confirm Lennox 's identity the ocular scan the ocular scan do not work that be disinformation he want you to download so you would trust he the ocular scan be a joke listen carefully do not approach the train yard I be lose you hello I can not hear you hello I be lose you hello Put I through to Sydney on a separate channel I only want she to hear this got it Sydney do not react just listen do not take your eye off the man you be with we just get a call from someone claim to be the real Agent Lennox he be on his way to you now and it look like he be alone Clear your throat if you copy Backup copy Sydney there be no way for we to verify the identity of either man disarm the man you be with then take cover so you can do the same to the man head your way once they be both secure lead they to the extraction point we will figure this out when they be in custody do not move what be you do Sydney against the wall on your knee hand behind your head put your hand behind your head on your knee he be secure how far away be the other man what other man you think I be Markovic Cloud cover 's move in over your position we be blind but he be get to be right there Sydney Sydney you have to trust I cuff yourself to the rail all right if someone be head this way claim to be I it be Markovic all right I be tell you he be set we up then why be he travel alone because he know if our satellite pick up a security team head this way we will not hesitate to destroy the prototype all right it be his only play to get his face back Sydney he kill Emma he will kill you hold it drop the gun and turn around you do not work for Markovic you be CIA I be Jim Lennox I be CIA too drop the gun drop the gun now Put the gun down Markovic 's man be on their way here drop it or I will shoot we have to trust each other get down Sydney Drop it you son of a bitch he be lie he have to say that I be torture for four week he know enough to pass as I do not listen he take my life you be not walk out of here neither of you can drop your gun what be you do I hope you like your face Dr Markovic you be go to have it for a long time do not yeah all right appreciate it four week off the least they could do yeah well

talk about you do not really think it be a coincidence that I happen to be away these last two week do you the intel you that acquire that allow the CIA to take down the Alliance I provide that my involvement with the Alliance be merely a means to an end why be you tell I this because know that I be alive be go to tempt you to come after I do not we 've help set each other free Sydney and as much as I wish you well I will end your life if you get in my way he call I at home to warn I no matter where he be I can be get to unfortunately you be not the only one Neil Caplan he be a mathematician work out of Caltech the Bureau just confirm that he and his family be kidnap from the Long Beach aquarium yesterday parking lot surveillance camera record this Sark doubtful he be act alone I assume his partnership with Sloane be alive and well what do they want with a mathematician he specialise in a branch of mathematics call knot theory Knot as in tie a knot simply put it be the study of geometric object and how they fit together all Alliance facility have be raid yet we have not find a single Rambaldi artefact if Sloane be expect our raid he could have have everything remove to a secure location he must be use Caplan to help he assemble a Rambaldi device so what happen when sloane put the piece together whether or not you believe Rambaldi be a prophet he do anticipate technological advance many of which seem most applicable to warfare it be likely sloane be build a weapon he plan for this he want the Alliance go and this family that he be take hostage these be not the only people whose life he will destroy this be never go to stop your resignation form Sign it and you be out your glass Mr Caplan my name be Arvin Sloane where be my family they be alive and if you cooperate you will be reunite soon enough where be I year ago I be with the Army Corps of Engineers they want I to study this that manuscript be 500 year old those sketch be draw by a man name Milo Rambaldi you will that see Rambaldi prophesy scientific principle century ahead of his time prototype of his design have turn up all over the world for the past 30 year I 've be collect they I do not understand why you want I I be nobody you be go to help I put they together because you see Mr Caplan I know that you feel like you be only a hostage right now but I assume you become a scientist to discover what secret the universe have to offer believe I when we be do here you will be thank I for give you the answer so why do not you go ahead and take a look I want to be the one to come in and tell you officially that you 've be clear the CIA have conclude that you have no knowledge of what be really go on at SD 6 they wanna offer you a place here Dixon you have to know that you be my anchor your friendship be the only thing that keep I sane how long have you know two year I want to tell you so many time but I be order not to the CIA have no way to verify what I know in my heart be true that you would never consciously work for a man like Arvin Sloane we be partner you lie to I then choose to tell I the truth when it be convenient for you I never wanna see you again ok I will need tap into all government network NSA DOD FBI CIA oh I will need a red phone to the president no just think I would ask I will need a Cryogen ATR prototype rig do not worry I will put my own baffle on the heat sink so it will not be too wow Marshall I be Michael Vaughn Welcome to the CIA hear that one before well this time it be for real we have a desk set up for you ok oh Syd hey Marshall you ok yeah every few minute I have to fight the urge to weep openly I be not really sure where that be come from yet but I think that be healthy right listen I know you need time to adjust but we could really use your help with something we be try to find sloane but we can not access any information from his computer well he probably erase everything from his hard drive before he leave and the deletion program I instal last year exceed DOD sanitising standard cos you know I think I be work for the government you know the story cos you also think you be work I mean you actually be work for the government and we do not really know but I mean that be ok I I will see what I can do hey baby get your message sorry your business trip be delay where be the kid at the park with Mindy I be glad the bank at least give you the rest of the day off Diane Mm we need to talk what be it be it your mother no I do not work at a bank I never have well I be able to recover a few fragment from the RAM drive on sloane 's database one of they be the most recent doc he be work on it be a digital Rolodex now he check one address in particular Holden Gemler Van Nuys Guy 's a cybernetic specialist I will go ok now usually red eye be a photographic effect cause by light reflect in the pupil but in Holden Gemler 's case it be cause by this it be an intra ocular retinal implant Care to elaborate of course Mr Director cos you be the Director Kendall right um it be one I two it be two of course why would it be by the way sir this place so much cool than SD 6 how about the point of course sorry so basically this guy Gemler he be blind in his left eye so he use himself as a guinea pig for wetware experiment interface technology with the human brain real cutting edge Basically this implant connect with the optical nerve which send impulse to the vision centre in his brain what do sloane want with a wetware expert all Alliance member be inject with a tracking device sloane must have hire Gemler to deactivate his so he could disappear right but there be more now this little baby record everything it see on an internal memory now the led light be blink because it be full so I be able to download 12 hour of footage now there be no audio so I create a lip reading program just whip it up no extra charge and uh take a look at what I find this be the last thing Gemler see Mr Sloane this be Sloane I 've charter a c 123 out of Shipman to transport the artefact I will be in touch Shipman could refer to the airfield in the Mojave Desert we 've surveille it before it be operate by a transatlantic smuggling cartel Ex military dishonourably discharge after the Gulf War they be well armed highly organise and they do have a c 123 in their fleet I can have a tactical team there in three hour once these guy understand their legal option they will be inclined to tell we where Sloane go interrogate the employee could take day and Sloane do not just let hostage go when he be do with they I be open to suggestion if we could get into the facility undetecte and access the flight data recorder on the plane sloane charter we could track he directly to his last destination speak like a true volunteer I be hungry where be my husband your husband be a gifted individual and we need his assistance for a short while should he choose to cooperate this will soon be an unpleasant memory we would like for you to tell your husband that you support his cooperation and that if he do not your son will be the first to suffer oh God so Mr Johnson I need these ship to Beijing by tomorrow you know what I find most interesting Mr Ludlow it be that for an accomplished arm merchant I 've never hear your name now if you really be an expert you will know what kind of gun be point at the back of your head by the sound of the hammer an M1911 but if he be really go to shoot I he would have disengage the thumb safety I get a charter leave for Asia in half an hour if the money and the delivery instruction be in that briefcase as we discuss it be be a pleasure do business with you good call on the gun I would have say Beretta M9 Figured I have a fifty fifty chance find the aft access panel look for the flight data recorder find it attach the disk imag receive uplink now uplink complete get out of there what be you do here I do not have a work order on this aircraft give I your ID I be call this in Tower I need confirmation on Vaughn I 've be make meet I at the northwest hangar copy that on my way get in go where have you stay last night at my sister 's the kid be there the time you be shoot you tell I that you have be mug if you have die that day I would have bury a stranger oh God I do not know if a single word you have ever say to I be true my love for you be true my love for our child be true as a husband as a father I could not honestly say I be protect our family unless I be out there except you be work for the people that make the world more dangerous I think I be serve our country this man Sloane I will never lie to you again the CIA 's offer I a job Marcus I do not choose a life of wonder whether my husband be come home every night you take that job you take it alone will you help we you want I to help you you let my family go that be the only way no that be not the only way help they do whatever they want please or they be go to hurt Aaron you want I to help you put this thing together be you tell I that these piece exist you be sit in a warehouse full of they accord to this each artefact be generate its own unique magnetic field these field determine where in the overall design the piece go the problem be there be no room for error in the calculation and the equipment you give I be not sensitive enough for I to measure the field with perfect accuracy I need something I do not have the magnetometer you be develop for the swiss polytechnic how do you know about that I know about a lot of thing you be ask I to do something I can not do the magnetometer be design to measure magnetic field in space it would be sensitive enough to do this kind of work but until it clear patent the polytechnic 's get it lock up in a vault somewhere the AMCORP Bank it be two mile from here we be in Switzerland by tomorrow you will have what you need just a few more day Emily well I be still wait for the owner to counter yeah course it have a garden as a matter of fact I be look out the window at the garden right now yes I miss you too my love what happen when your wife 's ready to move to a tuscan villa I purchase it six month ago I make contact with our point man he be assemble a team for the bank but I must question your decision to lead they in yourself in spite of your precaution it be wildly risky give your new level of notoriety I be approach the finish line of a 30 year odyssey I will not let anyone else take the final step for I this be the flight plan we retrieve from the plane 's data recorder sloane leave Shipman for an island off the coast of Bermuda we be send in a team but it be doubtful he be still there because the plane then go on to the Zürich airport in Switzerland it be a start but he could be anywhere by now unless we assume Sloane go to Switzerland for a reason that he be not merely pass through in that case we can expect he to hire local support mercenary I deal with a guy in Switzerland a head hunter we one use to put together a black op team in Western Europe he control most of the local territory Sloane would use he if he need mercs well assume he do if this guy know you be CIA he could tip sloane off he do not we hire he front as a french crime syndicate Set up a meet you two be on a plane the bank 's facial recognition camera will measure my underlying bone structure the camera target the distance between your cheekbone the prosthetic I will apply be line with a carbon powder the system database will not find a match even an x ray would be fool well then let us begin Come in come in come in I will take your photo for you come in come in come in drive you round the corner come in come in come in you know you really oughta come in come in come in move out of California and I be not French Mafia I be CIA we 've tolerate your existence because you 've be helpful but that tolerance can end now we have reason to believe one of these man recently approach you to hire some of your contact warm or cold if you have tell I the CIA be simply interested in my client list I would have tell you to go and make love with your mother Hands you break my how many come to see you you break my nose talk to I ok ok they come they hire some man for what I do not know the detail tell I what you know the woman and child be I know where they be where in the other room Downstairs they be here oh God it be ok we be CIA agent you be safe it be ok buddy oh God where be my husband we be still look for he we be do everything we can what be your name Sydney Sydney Bristow thank you Sydney Syd one of the guy have a cellphone if either Sark or Sloane call directly we can trace they we still do not get how you detect the tap we put on the SD 6 network last year yes that be a noble attempt gentleman a noble attempt but you see what happen be it be interfere with my online Dungeon Master game my gnome keep skip a frame every time he swing his battle axe oh my God my first phone call excuse I yeah this be Marshall Marshall it be I I need you to run a location trace on every incoming call that be make to the phone I be talk to you on Sure Syd no problem ok I need you to scroll to the Incoming Call menu on the phone and then hit pound pound then send ok hold on ok I be get 15 location any of they in Zürich uh two the first one be make from a payphone at the Zürich airport no good Next make from a cellphone I can probably triangulate the location if it be on I get it it be move where be it uh look like the AMCORP Bank on New Market Street I will you right call back we be go to New Market Street Marshall we be head south a robbery be in progress yeah yeah I get you make a right at the next light hold on Mr Skopik welcome I be Claude Sheurer president of AMCORP Bank we speak on the phone ah yes thank you for accommodate I on such short notice not at all 50 million in cash be not the kind of thing one like to leave under one 's pillow for very long this be our bank manager Peter Kunz hello pleasure he will take you to our vault while I secure your deposit Good can we offer you anything an espresso oh thank you very much you be most kind but due to a sensitive stomach my physician have prohibit caffeine from my diet very well after you I 've splice into the face recognition database you 've clear their system I will need ten second keep he talk a little long Herr Kunz may I ask you something this american war on terrorism have it affect your procedure in any way at all loop the feed now I assure you our institution be one of the most secure in the world Box 4747 ok take a left into the alley I guess it be pointless to say we should wait for backup Sydney you be go too fast Sydney who be in charge what can I do for you we be United States agent lock down your vault you be be rob I think you be mistaken it be loop that be he Sydney 's in the lobby she be by the entrance Sloane hold your fire get down I warn you Sydney I can not guarantee your safety in a situation like this there be no way I be let you walk out of here ah you must be the man that Sark tell I about the man that Sydney be willing to kill I for she would have kill you for a lot less the police be on their way we have Caplan 's family give up we 've rig the low level with enough c 4 to level the entire city block so if we do not walk out of here nobody do you be bluff I be not the only one carry a remote trigger the entire bank be monitor via satellite by an off site team if they do not see I walk out of here in 30 second they will detonate so I suggest that you both lower your gun lower your gun toss they on the ground you my dear you will be drive I out of here previously on Alias the prosthetic I will apply be line with a carbon powder the system 's database will not find a match well then let us begin you 've clear their system we be United States agent lock down your vault you be be rob Sloane hold your fire we 've rig the low level with enough c 4 to level the entire city block so I suggest that you both lower your gun you my dear will be drive I out of here stand down let Agent Bristow leave with the suspect he be hold the detonator and we have a clear shot no you make one move and one of his operative will detonate the explosive he be get the area under satellite surveillance that mean let sloane go and do not tail he until we get this stuff defuse there be a current run through here if we cut the wire we will break the circuit there be a fail safe the only way to take this out be to disrupt the electronic we need the water cannon the remote detonator operate on a radio frequency would not it be fast to find out what that frequency be and just jam it yes but access the frequency might trigger an explosion there be get to be a way to block it not unless you have some way to encase the detonator in concrete this be Agent Vaughn get I the bank manager now I tell you not to come after I Sydney I warn you that I will kill you if you interfere if you know what I have in here if you know what my plan be this be big than SD 6 Sydney than the CIA than you be deceive by I than I be betray by you if thing be different the safe it be a Friedland model 42c ok here we go Friedland Friedland Friedland Friedland ok get it construct with three inch of high density concrete surround by heavy gauge steel will it block the signal I do not know that depend on the detonator how big be the antenna about an inch inch and a half then it be probably transmit at divide by the speed of light time one fourth Marshall three gigahertz which mean you should have enough shielding so the signal can not get through should have or have have thank you right tell Kendall to start track Sydney in five minute she will be in a Ford Focus you know what model ZX5 what colour Blue why oh no I be just curious I be thinkin ' about get one myself you know low it a little get some big tyre rim gold rim and hello Syd we 've shield the detonator the bomb can not be trigger sloane can not know this a team will intercept your car in five minute change of plan ETA five minute the CIA have a hit list 35 people worldwide its agent be allow to kill 35 out of six billion you be one of them which mean when I kill you I will not even be break the law you jump you die official with AMCORP be hide behind swiss banking law to avoid tell we what Sloane steal from the bank for the moment his trail have go cold in other word we do not have a plan I mean it be true be not it we 've get nothing may I remind you Miss Bristow that Sloane be last see in your custody I be in his custody he be hold hostage you have the option to take he out you choose not to exercise it I choose not to incinerate 300 innocent people be you tell I you think I make the wrong choice I think we should just stick to what we know Sloane be hold Neil Caplan hostage for the purpose of build some sort of a weapon Presumably what he take from AMCORP be help he do that but you see we do not know that because we lose Sloane and the reason we lose Sloane be because he have something we do not satellite surveillance and if we task one bird to follow he after we defuse the bomb we would have catch he by now the satellite be task elsewhere see that be my point we do not take advantage of the situation no we prioritise what be the point of strategise if we be not willing we be do everything we can do no we be not we be not even close I need a progress report Caplan say he be a day away we take the magnetometer from AMCORP to expedite the construction of the Rambaldi device my flight be the day after tomorrow it need to be complete before then I believe Caplan to be a man of his word Mr Caplan be only assist we because he believe we be hold his family hostage if what he be put together be as powerful as I believe it to be I do not want he anywhere near it when it be operational I will conduct the preliminary test myself you do that by tomorrow I love the Zamboni the Zamboni 's your favourite part no come home with you after the game be my favourite part the Zamboni be a close second hello hey Kendall have something he want to show you can it wait apparently not he want Sydney too be you with her no I have not see she you be in bed with she now be not you I be try just find out what he want Kendall the Zamboni 's your favourite part could you at least try and pay attention Vaughn can you hear I no come home with you after the game be my favourite part Vaughn the Zamboni be a close second we will be there soon Cleaning crew 's on notice to sweep the apartment ASAP I do not understand how can the apartment be bug I have countermeasure will and I talk there sometimes about work he need to be tell already be handle we need to know who you 've speak with what be say and what intelligence might have be compromise plus you need to compile a list of every person friend serviceman delivery guy mailman who have be in or out of the apartment Kendall 's wait for you I will take this to analysis what do you mean you bug the apartment it be not like I break in and plant it myself I make it here take a look right there I solder into the circuit board can you see that what be that it be a Superman logo except this one be get an m on it it be kind of my signature when I use to work at SD 6 I make it special for Sloane it operate use an MD 14 datum adaptor which cloak the signal make it undetectable by bug killers I know I know I be that good which be bad Vaughn say he hear it repeat his conversation through his cellphone right well this be a burst transmitter it periodically transmit what be record to a receiver can you reverse engineer the signal find out where the conversation be be transmit to well if the transmitter record the phone number that it send the conversation to yeah I guess it be possible then do it please would be nice that be all right never mind Caplan finish early this morning the Rambaldi device be complete I run the test I think you will be pleased with the result we agree to combine our resource sir you promise you would show I incredible thing but a suitcase neutron bomb design in the 16th century be that even a theoretical possibility forgive the mode of transportation a person in my position can not be too cautious I understand our mutual friend Mr Dreyfus he send his respect let I pay you the courtesy of be blunt I do not do business with Americans I be a man with no country and few alliance all I have be a vision of an enterprise that will influence an exist world order that I believe to be corrupt I be look for partner who share that view I be but a humble shepherd whose control of the opium trade along the Silk Road be worth hundred of million of dollar in this part of the world it be well to be practical than visionary why should I invest in your enterprise ah that my friend be a long discussion First my gift it once belong to Khushal Khan Khattak the great 17th century warrior poet he unite our land he be a hero to my people this be a treasure tell I more about what you have plan hey so how be it go I be good no I mean about will be this go to turn into a thing what be going on have you sleep with he no not yet will have not say a thing he can not even look at I any more he be so freak out you know Sydney you 've be act sort of weird lately really and I think you would be act weird I think maybe it be because of will you do not talk to I any more I be sorry Francie I just get so catch up in work do not forget we use to be really good friend you can talk to I hello get in here now ok who be that someone from the bank there be a problem with a client in Tokyo I have to go in see ya hello they find the bug how should I proceed they will be look for our LA asset give them someone I will take care of it send a copy of that to Kendall Vaughn be it Sloane do Marshall get a location by reverse engineer the bug it work on an encrypt feed it be untraceable but we get a lead on sloane another way an asset outside Kandahar report see someone match sloane 's description in the company of man loyal to Ahmad Kabir the Pashtun warlord who play footsie with the Taliban when they run so do he except we do not know exactly where we believe Kabir 's man take Sloane somewhere in the Helmand Valley last year Sloane assign an sd 6 agent to infiltrate Kabir 's Helmand operation and intercept route information regard a shipment of soviet surface to air missile sloane steal a shipment of missile from Kabir but now they be meet what be I miss Kabir have no idea who sloane be the agent he assign get in and out undetecte who be the agent Marcus Dixon none of the record we acquire from SD 6 detail that mission and everything that Jack know now you know the only person who can help we be Dixon who have make it clear that he have no interest in cooperate with we well you be just go to have to change his mind I want a full briefing on Kabir by our analyst I do not think you appreciate Dixon 's sense of betrayal correct I if I be wrong Agent Bristow but only yesterday you be stand here complain that we be not do enough to find Sloane if you do nothing and we lose he this time you will have only yourself to blame Marcus do not want to see you and for what it be worth neither do I I know Diane I do I promise you I would not be here if it be not important what good be your promise right hello Sydney hi I need some information I can not help you look five minute all I need be a location he say no look it could mean the end of Sloane Sloane 's with Ahmad Kabir all I need to know be where Kabir operate from these be bad people they need to be stop not by my husband they do not the Agency might try to compel you to tell they what you know if they do I will tell they what I be tell you we 've make a decision as a family to move on do you own a suit a suit yeah one put it on why what be go on you 've only be do analysis a short time but your write brief be good one of they on Ahmad Kabir the director want an oral presentation wait an oral like in person yeah just give he talk point I be a writer well it be not really a request I do not talk I write it be part of your job do you know Sammy 's Red Hots Sure Santa Monica and 17th yeah be there in one hour order the special and no pickle I like pickle you will be lead out back where a windowless van'll be wait to take you to operation if I be go to be talk to the director be that a big deal yeah oh God it be from the 16th century it be a carving of an Arhat a worthy one in buddhist tradition an Arhat be the destroyer of the enemy how be it you know so much I be a collector this piece be very special you want a partner someone to invest in an incredibly ambitious global enterprise which be at good a risky proposition what you offer in exchange to be my to be my Arhat I need some assurance that you can deliver on that promise oh naturally and that be why I be fully prepared to give you a demonstration I leave it to you to choose the target no suit huh it be be a while since I try it on or work out apparently which make I overwhelmed and fat will Tippin Professors Joyce and Fleming they fly in last night from the Kennedy School I will go tell the other we be ready the Kennedy School where be that Harvard that be right our objective today be simple to identify a person or person who can give we the exact location of Ahmad Kabir 's Helmand Valley operation despite the american back government the geopolitical reality of Afghanistan be that it be still define by ethnic rivalry the simple way to find a pashtun like Kabir be to first find an enemy willing to sell he out Sharif Rabani be on record as accuse Kabir 's Pashtun supporter of engage in ethnic cleansing I be sure we will have no problem get he to lead we to he then why have not he well the point be yeah they hate each other but they probably hate we more I mean since 9 11 have not we pay guy like this million of dollar for information and get almost nothing in return be you prepared to make an alternate recommendation yes actually I be all I have be these photograph Sydney this woman 's name be Aliyah Kazabi she be married to an administrator with the Vatican embassy in Mexico City Aliyah Kazabi use to be Aliyah Kabir she be Kabir 's ex wife since the Taliban got boot a woman can have her marriage annul if it be determined that she be force or sell into that marriage against she will accord to court record you find court record yeah they be publish on the Net I realise that there be nothing geopolitically correct about my analysis but in the hell hath no fury department I figure this woman would pay we to mess with her ex I mean she hate he so much that she send their son into hiding with her relative I will get you that web address you should check it out ok I will alert our station chief in Mexico City Vaughn and Bristow you will leave in one hour we need to protect this woman no one can know the CIA 's contact she you will go under an alia Kabir have choose his target his ex wife we be use the device on Aliyah Kazabi you will be brief en route to Mexico City you will leave at once Surveillance confirm Kazabi 's in the administrative wing adjacent to the church now accord to Caplan 's calculation of the running requirement we need 20 million watt to reach that section of the building 20 per cent of its capacity yes that should give we coverage of the entire embassy but sir if Caplan be off by even a microtesla this could go very wrong do it that be easy for you to say sir you be 8 000 mile away I will wait to hear from you I be approach the step I be in all right Kazabi work on the first floor can I help you I be not here to hurt you I work for American Intelligence I need some information about your ex husband I know you be worried about retribution for leave he and take his son that be why I 've come in secret no one know I be here no one will ever know that you 've talk with I I be search for a man a horrible dangerous man he be with your ex husband at his residence in the Helmand Valley I need to know exactly where that be Vaughn can you hear I Vaughn yeah what be it what be wrong we just have an echelon intercept key word be pick up terrorist weapon of mass destruction but be you ready for this Rambaldi do you get coordinate yeah yours we do not know when it be happen but you be not wait there for we to find out get out now I can not help you Sydney we have to get out of here now there be go to be some sort of an attack a car bomb a suicide bomb I do not know but I be alert the embassy they be go to start an evacuation there be a door at the end of the administration corridor meet I there you have to come with I it be for your own safety I tell you I will not help you see this we pick up a hotspot where it be directly behind you it be huge what what be it some kind of a fire something burn listen to I it be this inferno and it be right behind you you do not see it there be nothing be he see people building what wait wait wait whoa whoa whoa it disappear it be go go what do you mean go I do not know it just disappear let us go back I will tell you where to find my husband 62 people be confirm dead in what government official be call the bad act of terrorism in Mexico City in a decade some people describe it as an act of God though local official be still investigate the matter all of the victim be incinerate beyond recognition absent positive identification a list of presume dead be publish your ex be on the list what be this a small token of appreciation no no this be too much I can not accept this I see you admire it and deservedly so you have destroy my enemy you be in every way my Arhat I will have 40 million wire tomorrow to the account of your choose Video surveillance place Sark at the scene of the attack in Mexico City Subsequent to the attack intel track he as far as Kabul here be what we can assume Sloane dispatch Sark to carry out his mission now that it be complete Sark have return to his master and thank to Ms Kazabi we now know where that be the plan be for you to lead a tactical unit into the Helmand you will parachute into the compound effect a roof access steal the weapon and signal for backup you know how people be describe it do not you they be call it a doomsday device say it be the first sign of the come Armageddon like the devil himself rise up to attack that church excuse I if I may offer a scientific explanation I think it might help the hi everybody it be good to that be a really nice suit ok come on right what we be deal with be a high energy pulse weapon now thank to an echelon intercept we be able to retask a KH 12 satellite over the area and this be what we find ok the blue dot those be the people in the church before now this be what the infrared pick up after the body temperature of everyone in the affected area increase by over 2 000 degree they literally melt from the inside out and nothing else in the church be affect well that be because it work like a microwave it excite water and fat molecule which do not exist in inorganic material and then it convert they into atomic motion or heat you say everyone in the radius be affect even people who be take cover yeah well there be no defence against this kind of energy it go through wall concrete steel everything there be no shield no sorry oh I should probably also tell you that this kind of energy knock out computer circuitry which mean if it be point at the sky it could take down plane what concern I be that Sloane know this kind of use of force be a deliberate provocation that demand a swift response and yet he exercise it on the ex wife of a petty warlord why get the inventory back from the cleaner they find audio and video transmitter all next gen stuff Video yeah in the tv in your bedroom we be investigate everyone you 've list as be in your apartment so far they be all clean hello hey it be I hey I know we have plan for tonight but I have to work what you have to do be quit that job of yours Fran I be sorry it be ok the truth be I probably be not go to be able to make it anyway so you do not wanna kill I no of course not you know can we talk about this later I be kind of in the middle of something yeah yeah I will call you later bye ok you remember that movie predator when Schwarzenegger be be chase by that crab who could only see in thermal no no you never see that it be a great movie Schwarzenegger it be one of his well movie Twins listen anyway Kabir 's security camera they work the same way they read heat signature which be kind of a problem cos well you be incredibly hot see yeah now the solution I have devise be you parachute onto the roof you rip off your tactical gear and then you slip on this baby now it be part of a cold suit it be all black it be formfitte and it will bring your body back down to room temperature Yep Put these baby on so as long as I be cover the security camera can not see I yeah you will be the invisible woman see I be on the eastern stair all right go right at the bottom accord to his ex Kabir keep weapon and ammunition in a storage room at the end of the hall there be no door what Work 's be do maybe this place be bomb in the war and have to be reconfigure you mean your intel 's worthless there have to be another way in I 've be make Sydney 's be compromise you have to order the tac unit in after her do she defuse the weapon what difference do that make Kabir 's be alert if he be get the weapon he will use it issue the order you hear Marshall there be no defence against it if you do not issue it I will the tac unit would not stand a chance we can not just leave she there unless we can find another way in I be afraid that be all we can do I do not think we 've be formally introduce my name 's Michael Vaughn I work with Sydney I be out Sydney 's in trouble respect my decision I can not do that not when your decision may cost Sydney her life you would not tell Sydney how you infiltrate Kabir 's so she find an alternate way in use what turn out to be faulty intel she be capture and unless we find another confirmed access point no one will be send in to get she out it be not that simple yes it be you will either help save Sydney 's life or you will not please leave I can not do that not until I get your answer admit you be CIA submit to a videotape acknowledge you be here in violation of international law Condemn the Great Satan and maybe I will spare your life Sydney tell he what he want to hear or this will not end well you know in many way I will always consider you my proud accomplishment please Sydney unfortunately I can not do anything about this Bye Sydney have you reconsider admit you be CIA perhaps you need a little incentive enough my house guest have leave and it seem there be nothing more for we to discuss the cartilage that let the kneecap slide around do not regenerate which you should know in advance of this you ok I do not understand how do you find a way in let us go let us go we get the device sloane no this way good work I be lucky you get the weapon we 've save countless life yeah I do not get sloane or figure out what the hell he be do with Kabir we find these on a plumber whose name you give we he be murder he be either responsible for the bug in your apartment or he be set up at the moment it be a dead end I be glad you be home hi hi I know I say this to you a lot thank you I can not judge you for not tell I about SD 6 if I have be in your position I can not say I would not have do the same what be go on with Diane I do not know the king be in town on Friday night you could watch the Zamboni what we see at the church and every time we think we 've see the bad we talk of power and control but when we create an incredibly powerful weapon you leave it in the hand of a complete stranger tell I how be what happen good for we hand I the top page of the manuscript Luri Karpachev he be a high level arm dealer in Russia with link to the Mafia your ex wife say I would appreciate it if you would refer to Irina Derevko by name Derevko list he among former contact when she be debrief by the NSA yes I 've hear the name myself Sloane have dealing with he at SD 6 I will talk to Irina see what she know sorry about the do not be silly after you turn yourself in to the CIA you list Luri Karpachev as one of your former contact he be murder yesterday we believe by Sloane Karpachev 's body be find without his wallet Presumably Sloane have more insidious way to pass the time than pick someone 's pocket what might he have be look for why have not you try to convince Sydney to leave the CIA you and I know well than anyone she should leave this life while she have the chance Sydney can be stubborn where she get that from be anyone 's guess but she refuse to resign as long as sloane be still free which bring I back to my question what be in Karpachev 's wallet a key card to his home safe in ' 93 Karpachev come into possession of a Rambaldi manuscript Sloane must believe he keep it in his safe but he be incorrect Karpachev sell it to whom Ilya Stuka a former contact of mine live in Bangkok what be this manuscript Rambaldi 's study of the human heart as you know immortality be one of Rambaldi 's obsession where do Stuka keep it I do not know but I could find out if I be allow to meet with he Kendall will not risk let you out again despite your cooperation in India what if the prize be worth it Sloane do not know you be in CIA custody he think I be in hiding as he be if Sloane believe you 've surface obtain the manuscript he be after he will wanna meet with you negotiate a purchase which I would be happy to do and we could grab he and give Sydney her reason to get out ok the key obviously be balance right so do not worry so much about the puck and just make sure your foot be plant on the ice and then just a nice follow through Show off yeah a little bit Bristow 's get the puck she cross the blue line she be at the top of the circle she shoot she score oh my God what be that I do not say I be completely incompetent but you 've do this before no I tell you I have not skate since I be five no I do not believe you Swear to God my mother take I well you be well than you should be soon or later we be go to have to have a conversation about my mother there be nothing to talk about Sydney there be nothing to say we both know what happen what be there to say I think a lot nothing I wanna talk about I be sorry do not be sorry do not ever be sorry for her hello yeah ok I have to go in of course you do it be your day off all right I will see you later yeah my name be Sydney Bristow you ask for I yeah have a seat first off I need your thumbprint here and here please these be just confidentiality agreement they just forbid you from disclose anything that we might talk about today if you do so it be a felony thank you be you familiar with the name Vladimir Progrowski no I be not you ever see this man no last month you be in France with Agent Michael Vaughn do you recall see he use the payphone no do you see Mr Vaughn purchase cigarette Mr Vaughn do not smoke I understand no I do not see he buy cigarette be you and Mr Vaughn intimately involve that be none of your business yeah I know it be sort of an awkward question what be this about I would appreciate a little context here you have not even give I your name I be Mitchell Yeager I be counterintelligence threat analyst that should give you a little context I 've be send here to investigate Michael Vaughn it be come to our attention that over the past three month Mr Vaughn have be in contact with a number of unapproved foreign operative he be also actively pursue contact with Mr Progrowski who happen to be a former KGB assassin know to have tie with at least three terrorist organisation wait a minute there absolutely be a reason for this I be sure that be right that be why I be here this be crazy what be you say Agent Vaughn be work for someone else that he who he Miss Bristow Mr Vaughn do not know an investigation of this magnitude be take place and I will remind you that speak to he about this be not only a criminal act but will force we to consider you as a suspect as well so I will ask you again be you and Mr Vaughn intimate you suggest that we allow Irina Derevko a know terrorist to make contact with Arvin Sloane Sloane be search for another Rambaldi manuscript Irina believe it be now in the possession of an associate live in Bangkok I will serve as her escort we will recover the manuscript and use it to bait Sloane I doubt I will be able to convince Washington to authorise it our intel would have to be convincingly precise and right now all we know about this manuscript and where it might be come only from Derevko we may never have a well chance to get Sloane remember without Irina 's help the operation in Kashmir would have be an embarrassment Jack when the hell do we switch place Derevko could be use those operation just to convince we that she be trustworthy I 've have 20 year to reflect on that woman 's ability to deceive trust I if she lie to I again I will know it Stuka work out of a nightclub in Bangkok why do Kendall approve the op yes we have a jet stand by oh this be Marshall Flinkman he work with we at SD 6 hey how you doing you be Sydney 's mom that be really cool cos your daughter Awesome by the way Kendall insist you be inject with a subdermal tracking device I will have a receiver that will allow I to follow your movement on site you will not even really know that it be there unless you know we put it under your thigh or somewhere else where you might sit on it then you will have a Princess and the Pea moment where you feel it but you do not really you know that Princess and the Pea my mother Put it behind her shoulder oh ok the thing be it might hurt a little bit cos it be small but it be not really that small wow you be tough have Mr Vaughn make any large purchase recently not that I be aware of have he change his cellphone more than once in the past six month I 've answer that no why be you ask I the same question twice we 've trace four cellphone back to Mr Vaughn since October I be hope that you would have notice that I do not do you have private access to his laptop computer excuse I you know while he be sleep or in the shower or you know out of the house we do not live together yeah I understand that what be you ask I there be a decryption program call Xenon and we have reason to believe that Mr Vaughn have download this program to his personal laptop computer and if he have he have break the law that be insane well maybe it be then we need confirmation either way you want I to check Vaughn 's computer we simply want you to make a little disk image we want you to make a copy of his hard drive and bring it back listen to I there be not a chance that he be a traitor that he would be collaborate with an enemy you know I know your mother about 20 year ago meet she with your father we use to go to a lot of these agency function you know she be a charming very disarm woman who be not what she seem it be a mistake Mr Yeager to confuse Michael Vaughn with anything regard my mother she kill his father I will not spy on Michael Vaughn Miss Bristow what be your priority national security or your new boyfriend Weiss have you see Vaughn that be all I be to you just a conduit to Vaughn I be just have you ever see Vaughn and say hey where be Weiss I be just look for he I have not see he I just got call to the briefing room you know what this be about no all right see ya yeah see ya let she go play with I instead stop it why not you know I I love game drop the gun do it you buy a Rambaldi manuscript from Karpachev I do not have it any more where be it in Hong Kong I trade it for opium right to who to Chang once we get the manuscript how do you intend to let sloane know it be you Word will get back to he that I be in Bangkok he will know it be I I do not see that fourth man if you have not fire I remember the first time you introduce I to sloane you be both work at the CIA he come to the house for dinner you be true friend yes we share a similar unsentimental patriotism and a devotion to our wife but sloane change and it be Rambaldi that do it I be not sure what it be he never tell I but Sloane have a personal connection to Rambaldi I live for year with the same obsession to find a high meaning in Rambaldi 's work I never understand how you manage to avoid getting catch up in it I have something neither of you do Sydney I never thank you for everything that for raise our daughter we land in four hour get some rest do you hear about your mother the operation they send she on yeah with my dad how have you find out about it my dad tell I what be it Courtesy or be it part of no he just tell I be not that weird to you that they would not involve we at all the decision to reintroduce Irina Derevko to the world and we be not consult we can not be a part of every operation well this one we should have be I would not read into it yeah you mind if I use your shower no you do not have to ask ok what I be about to tell you you can not tell anybody Swear to I I swear ok Sydney this be go to sound insane but she work for the CIA Come on seriously Fran think about it what bank send their employee on that many trip it be a cover job it be not even a good cover job it be insane those trip they be top secret CIA mission come on will I be tell you I have see she in

through the Panama Canal and I be read humint datum and then download information off the KH 11 satellite Exciting right yeah I guess why well it be common to dream about work have anxiety over keep it secret especially in the beginning really go away though the excitement no the dream you must allow we entry immediately our mandate to search this location have be approve by Beijing any noncompliance be a breach of your agreement I be sorry for the delay only this morning do we learn that an inspection team be come to the palace we be investigate report that precursor chemical have be store in several official building if you be suggest we be hide that will be for the inspector to decide we be only here to conduct the interview I be sorry let us go do you speak to will he be a little freak out this morning what be that just work stuff come here be you keep secret from I what answer the question I be sure I be we just start date of course there be thing that I do not feel comfortable that be not I be not talk about we what work then yeah there be certain thing under protocol that I be not authorise to talk about with anyone and that be it there be something you do not know about I I do not like it when people question my loyalty it make I insane this be not about loyalty I never say anything about loyalty when you ask I if I be keep secret the suggestion 's pretty clear and you know what secret will be a problem between we after everything we 've be through you should know that this be the key to my apartment I be go to give it to you tonight at dinner obviously an inappropriate move Vaughn Barnett 's wait for I you make the right decision that disk be blank I do not make a copy of Agent Vaughn 's hard drive the fact that I doubt Vaughn 's motive make I sick you should be aware that by choose not to assist you be implicate yourself in Agent Vaughn 's activity do not threaten I again you may be prosecute as an accessory I understand Understand that there be consequence to your action there be consequence that be my point ask yourself would you betray someone you love well I guess we have an answer to the intimacy question Mr Sloane yes it seem Irina Derevko be see last night in Bangkok where at a club with llya Stuka Sark make contact through one of Irina 's email account he take the bait he want a meeting to discuss the purchase of the Rambaldi manuscript can we trace his message no it be send through anonymous remailer I be go to set up the meeting in Panama ostensibly between Irina and Sloane Jack you make this happen you can have my job no thank I will need Delta Force you will get whatever you need Dad say you be go to Panama do you think there be a chance you will get Sloane I want to see you because it be go to be dangerous set this trap I hope it go well but there be no guarantee so whatever happen there be something I need you to know Sydney I love you Mom you do not have to say anything I be pretty sure I have not earn very much and that be ok this be just something I need to say Mom you be come back I hope so do you have any trouble access the KH 11 satellite image be anyone suspicious no I use they in my report nobody be suspicious the first image you saw see it in your mind do you see any marking no I do not think so wait there be two set of number at the bottom right hand corner Read they to I X8471 gy79863 what be they the orbital location of the satellite and its operational control Good I be go to count back from five when you wake up you will have no memory of this conversation all you will remember be that tonight you have the good sex of your life five four three two one base on our agreement tomorrow morning you and two Delta Force guard will be drop off here if Sloane follow the plan he will drive north to meet you will not he be suspicious if I do not have the Rambaldi manuscript Sloane be smart enough to know that you would never bring it with you at first contact he will expect you to have it close by CIA will be track you on satellite back in Los Angeles in contact with I and the chopper wait ten block away when the call be make the team will surround the vehicle and ambush Sloane pretty straightforward I think we 've get a shot there be one thing the tracker you put in my shoulder you want it remove if they discover I 've be tag it be over we both know that of course Kendall would have I court martialle for this Kendall be not as smart as you be get it you ok this be nothing we need to be up early yes we should get to bed yeah we should hey you know that thing we be both involve in that we can not talk about I know a guy from the Farm who work with Yeager and he be about to file a formal charge against Vaughn mishandle classified intelligence what yeah I need to talk to he no no no whoa you do that and you be break six different law he need to know this be happen but his phone be probably already tap Agency car be equip with GPS navigator can you access the system yeah I find his car Roger that keep I post what be you do here Sydney I ask you a question what be go on do not tell I it be nothing be you follow I you just buy something it be research Research what kind of research it be something private something just for I who do you think you work for nothing be private you be be investigate what when they find out I 've tell you I

authorisation Vaughn if there be some explanation for what you 've be do the past four month I need to hear what it be right now they be at the location KH 11 have them on screen there be a limousine approach from the southwest I see it it be Sark Delta team stand by I realise the plan be for Mr Sloane to meet with you here but for security reason I be afraid that be impossible if you get in I will take you to he only you why be not she get in where 's Sloane close I assure you then bring he to I that be not an option then our deal be off so be it tell she to get in the car dammit we will track she to he it be a big car I believe there be room for all of we that be not the plan get in he be let she take the guard how do she pull that off now I understand why you be ask about secret yes there be something I have not tell you it have not be easy accept the idea that my job require I to collaborate with my father 's killer the fact that she happen to be your mother do not make it easy so I 've be investigate she on my own for the past six month I could not wait for the agency 's red tape so I contact everyone I could anyone who know she who run in the same circle I I retrace sit phone record that be log while your mother be with you in India and Kashmir track record conversation between your mother 's former lieutenant to see if she signal they when Kendall give her access to

the code good yes thank you Jack we be blind you be go to have to follow she from your end activate the tracking device I can not send in the team Delta team go Repeat Delta team go we 've get them in sight we be track stay with that car lose visual got them again we be go to head them off we get them stop Stand by check the Rambaldi manuscript get I the Rambaldi manuscript now step out of the car

shortly after I start work at Credit Dauphine she be the mother all of we wish we have Emily we do it be you sure it work yes my love we be free I 've be send here to investigate Michael Vaughn it be come to our attention that over the past three month Mr Vaughn have be in contact with a number of unapproved foreign operative you be be investigate if there be some explanation for what you 've be do the past four month I need to hear what it be right now you suggest that we allow Irina Derevko to make contact with Arvin Sloane I 've have 20 year to reflect on that woman 's ability to deceive trust I if she lie to I again I will know it I realise the plan be for Mr Sloane to meet you here but for security reason I be afraid that be impossible if you get in I will take you to he we 've lose downlink Jack we be blind you will have to follow she from your end activate the tracking device I can not step out of the car please thank you for extract I Freeze we have a casualty Woman down we need a medic they will probably keep I in debrief for a while you will be ok if you never see I again it be fun oh shut up Mr Vaughn Mr Yeager would like to talk to I yeah I know Dad I need to talk to you about Vaughn I know he be under investigation he be innocent he be investigate Mom it be not treason Sydney the operation in Panama do not go as plan what happen be mom ok your mother betray we Betrayed the CIA her meeting with Sloane be stage to secure her escape you do not know that sloane could 've set up the meet to abduct she before the operation she swap the Rambaldi manuscript she leave we with a fake she and Sloane be now in possession of the original Sydney they plan this I hear about your mother I be so sorry there be a briefing in ten minute they be draw up a plan to capture Sloane and your mother I be suppose to tell you you be not obligate to go my mother 's earring they find a note she leave she want I to have they just now when my dad be tell I the first thought I have be that she be dead that she be be kill I have this whole thing in my head that she die prove herself a hero no one can be blame for trust their own mother I wish that she have be kill I still have operative in St Petersburg Madrid and Cairo how reliable they be loyal good you be you all right the extraction go well I be ask about you Irina I be happy to see you again I be think the same thing myself what about the genetic database Sark and I will meet you back in Zurich as soon as we 've acquire it you will have the file soon Good I will be in Tuscany with Emily how be she she be in remission the hard part for she now be miss the people that she have to leave behind especially Sydney you know how much we love she as if she be our own excuse we I see through you you must know that this be who I be you may need to think of yourself as an honourable husband or father figure but I do not I will never see that man in you which frankly be why we have this agreement you need to get some rest never talk to I about your love for Sydney again get some rest as many of you know our attempt to capture Arvin Sloane fail we believe that Irina Derevko while in our custody somehow contact Sloane inform he of our intention to apprehend he and use it as an opportunity to escape due to Jack Bristow 's intimate knowledge of the fugitive and his long stand write record of accurate prediction regard Derevko Langley have give he operational control of this task force in all likelihood Sloane and Derevko have form a strategic partnership as of this morning our single aim will be their apprehension Derevko have be tag with a passive tracking device excuse I sir sorry to interrupt by the way congratulation on the head the operational task force the device that we implant in Derevko be not passive yes it be I remove the original device in case Derevko be sweep for bug without her knowledge I inject she with a passive transmitter wow that be smart because if they do a sweep they will not pick up anything till it transmit hey how have you plant it without her know the transmitter 's program to send a signal 12 hour from now that allow she enough time to reach Sloane before go active a tactical team 's on standby out of Edwards Air Force Base once we acquire the signal we will move in and take they into custody I do not know what to say this house be when will we know if they accept the offer I close last week what I want to surprise you I just want to make you happy these past few month have be like a bad dream thank God we get through it I love you nice group hey what happen they downgrade my security clearance but only until counterintelligence clear I officially meanwhile your father convince they to keep I field rate then you hear about my mother yeah you be right to investigate her Sydney no it be ok it be the truth I be not blame you it be I I be so naive about her I do not think you should be part of this task force you know how I feel about she but no one should have to hunt down their mother no matter what the circumstance be she be never my mother you want to believe that do not do this again do not condescend that be not what I be do you know that if you corner she and you hesitate to pull the trigger even for one second it could cost you your life I will not hesitate let I be blunt Jack I accept your recommendation to trust Derevko because you make a strong argument a personal one an argument which I now understand you do not believe or you would not have place a passive transmitter on she without inform I it be my call to let she out and I stand by that decision but you blindside I you son of a bitch and your pretence of an apology do not do either of we any good I will be equally blunt from the moment Irina Derevko walk in this door you order Sydney to deal with she over my objection with absolute disregard for her emotional wellbeing it be my prerogative I stand by that call that say it be not my intention to replace you as soon as I be satisfied that Derevko can never harm my daughter again you will have your title back excuse I actually I be not sure who I be suppose to address cos you know you be both stand here who be in charge what be it Marshall the passive transmitter that Mr Bristow inject into his wife ex wife sorry well um it just go active and we be track her Base op have track Derevko 's signal to Stuttgart once on the ground we will confirm the signal with visual identification but we will not engage until we know the whereabouts of all three we move in only after Derevko 's lead we to sloane like many pharmaceutical company the firm I represent have closely monitor your work map the human genome we be interested in licensing that work we be in the process of field many such offer but I be afraid your firm Staad Pharmaceutical I be not familiar with it we be a small scandinavian consortium but I would not have come all this way if I do not believe my offer be significant our server room be where the datum be process and store right this way thank you the server be locate in sublevel e beyond radio contact when you be prepared for extraction I will be stand by we be two block away from the tracking signal any intel on that location Brucker Biotech they be the german equivalent of the Human Genome Project we be run an analysis of the company every patent they hold biography of the board member political contribution Sloane and Derevko with genetic research that can not be good all right I 've hack into their CCTV system I be relay the feed to you now Let us see what we 've get Agent Bristow we be pull into position hello my name be Peter Gorrow I be Ms Herksgaard 's assistant I be run late would it be possible to have a pass wait at the front desk thank you Sark we have a visual ID he be enter the building we see he hold your position for now we 've confirm Derevko and Sark that be good enough for I note it take 15 year of analysis but we finally assemble all the information into a dna map of unequalled detail Sark 's take out surveillance camera we lose the feed they may know we be here there be a tactical team out front we 've be track I sweep myself I be clean Jack the mission 's compromise it be hard now but not impossible if we do not go in we could lose everything the transmitter be still active Sloane be the objective sloane may not be here they may not be work with Sloane I do not understand when we extract you we scan you for transmitter it must have be on a time delay do it we lose she how I do not know Fried somehow overload I guess Signal 's go there be nothing I can do if we lose she now we lose she for good Move in Call Brucker security tell they two want terrorist be on the premise have they seal the building we will meet they in the lobby this will get we into the hard drive be the file on the network yes but it be encrypt I will transfer the file and we can decipher it later how long to download five minute see there be no evidence we be here I will take care of it I will set the detonator for six minute meet I at the extraction point Vaughn Vaughn you ok yeah I be ok Come on what about Derevko she be get to be here Sydney Dad I see she we be go after her she be exit the building yeah I will talk to you later what be for dinner Ribollita it be bread and vegetable soup well it sound great I will get the Barolo ok hello may I speak with your husband yes just a moment it be for you it be a woman thank yeah I 've recover the file but I be track by whom the CIA until we know otherwise we have to assume you 've be expose as well you would well leave the house until we know for sure yeah I agree meet I at the airfield ok we have to leave what who be that I will explain later but we have to leave the house it be just a precaution against what what be go on Emily we have to leave the house now I do not understand look at I you have to trust I Emily please you have to trust I aside from cancer study Brucker sponsor genetic research specifically the mapping and sequence of human chromosome but it be rumour they 've catalogue the dna of private citizen some say million well if that be true then for one I be sorry to interrupt be that suede yes sloane could develop a genetically target virus or he could pollute the entire water supply just to kill one specific person when he or she take a drink of water or take a shower then the water would permeate into the system I will instruct the NSA to add every derivation of genetic to the echelon watch list uh excuse I do you say that before the explosion your mother call out your name yes why have she do that do not that seem weird to anyone or be that just I it be cool if it be just I because it be

talk not now be that your phone uh uh yours no what be that my mother 's earring I think they be check they be Wait it be repeat a pattern Dash dot dash that be a K definitely Morse code that be an e that be a t another t it be encode what be you do bad robot previously on Alias Neil Caplan he be a mathematician work out of Caltech the Bureau just confirm that he and his family be kidnap from the Long Beach aquarium yesterday you want I to help you you let my family go all I need to know right now be whether you want to come with I yes I do not have a clean shot and I take it anyway I be put in for reassignment to the Directorate of Intelligence if I have the shot I might 've take it I know what Emily mean to you I be sorry Arvin Arvin this plan might not hold up the CIA know too much they could guess why we be after the genetic database I be not interested in the database I want satellite footage of Tuscany I wanna know who murder my wife we both have to make sacrifice Arvin you will not forgive yourself if you stop now we be so close to know what Rambaldi know I wish I have never hear that man 's name Good news relatively speak use the administrative code we acquire at Bruckner I be able to log into their system and download a copy of the database but it be still encrypt yes although Neil Caplan 's still analyse the remainder of the Rambaldi text his background in mathematic should allow he to crack the encryption algorithm I do not understand how we do not have a single lead on Sloane or Mom there be a difference between intelligence and actionable intelligence what about the earring Mom leave I Analysis could not trace the signal source Marshall 's still try to figure out how they receive anything Dad we have to get ahead of they we know they be acquire Rambaldi artefact we know they try to access a dna database so there must be some way to predict what they be go to do Sydney I understand your frustration particularly in light of Emily 's death but sometimes there be not a clear move to make look at this Elsa Caplan 's debrief transcript it be barely ten page long sloane kidnap her husband two month ago all we have be ten page Sydney if you feel Elsa Caplan be improperly debrief do it again yourself how be your son he be keep I sane even with the security detail it be hard to feel safe I do not wanna make this more difficult for you but I need a little more of your help I would like to bring you in for a regression therapy session it be like hypnosis it be completely safe I 've do it myself no offence but I do not feel comfortable with the government poke around in my head I will be honest with you we be out of lead what be you say that if something happen to he it be my fault no of course not these people threaten to kill my son he be still have nightmare about it Elsa wait you come here and you tell I that I be not do enough that be not what I mean Aaron sweetie Sweetie come on it be time to go how dare you Sweetie honey it be time to go we still need your help I 've just download this it be a catalogue of over ten million people 's DNA we be look for someone specific a man but it be encrypt we need you to break it for the past two month I have not hear a word about my family or be give any indication whether they be dead or alive so you can just kill I just kill I cos there be no way in hell I be go to help you people any more what if I tell you that your family be not only alive but we let they go call your house call hello Elsa it be I hello Elsa Elsa I be alive she can not hear you I 've modify the cellphone hello they be home they be safe now you have something to live for Mr Caplan Elsa Caplan be live under protective custody for the last two month I be so convinced that we be overlook something that I go over there and imply that she be not do enough to save her husband how stupid look no one be hard on themselves than you be Vaughn ok the backpack be get a little ridiculous what do you mean the middle drawer it be yours yeah it be just a drawer I be just say it be a great idea be you sure uh huh I love my drawer if we be go to keep work I need to go and make a sandwich ok Vaughn there be three call make from the same number to Caplan 's house over the last year they come exactly four month apart they be all make on a Monday night at the same time and they all last one minute where do the call come from I need to talk to you be it Neil before Neil 's abduction three call be make to your house over the last year at odd hour we trace the number to a reporter name Grigory Ivanov do that name mean anything to you no we run a background check he be a journalist work out of Los Angeles for Itar Tass a news service know for give cover to russian intelligence agent this man Ivanov we think he be one of they we put Ivanov under electronic surveillance an hour ago he receive a fax from an unknown source I do not understand your husband may have be work for the russian SVR it be their equivalent to the CIA what do the fax say a single russian word rahzviazka it mean endgame Neil 's go to die Elsa we do not know that no I do not you I do not want to be hypnotise because I be afraid you would find out Ivanov be my handler seven year ago I be order to seduce and marry Neil my objective be to keep tab on his work I be give a tracking device to implant in his arm but it have a secondary purpose it be design to release 15 mg of cyanide into his bloodstream it be a suicide pill that be what the fax be about it mean it be be activate and you be not authorise to be tell I this I 've just commit treason against my government because I want to get he back I be tell you because I love he I have a lead on Sloane and Irina but we have to move immediately yes Vaughn brief I Elsa Caplan should not be process as a walk in she be an SVR agent which mean technically we can classify she as a defector or we can arrest she and try she for espionage until we make that determination I be hold she here she want to help she implant a tracking chip in her husband the chip be activate by a code if we can get a locate device we can enter the code find he and remove the device before it release the cyanide I 've already ask Marshall to look into the possibility of reverse engineer a locator I talk to Marshall it will take he three day Caplan will be dead by then the chip 's set to release cyanide into his bloodstream in 42 hour there be a black market contact who deal in SVR contraband I be go to meet he I be not willing to risk your life base on speculative intel you acquire from a russian spy why would she lie that be precisely the question she turn herself in she be not the first Dad I realise we be talk about a russian agent who betray her husband but Elsa Caplan and my mother be not the same person Elsa 's first instinct her first thought be for her husband 's life that be your assessment if we find Neil Caplan we find Sloane and Derevko be not that worth the risk we will move on Elsa 's statement if and only if we can corroborate it when do you start play it safe you let Derevko walk out of here because you think she could lead we to sloane a mistake I be not anxious to repeat and if Neil Caplan die then he die who have my son Aaron 's fine he be be take care of I think you believe I I do believe you then why be I in this cell I 've admit everything commit treason against my own government it be not that simple there be protocol this be Director Bristow I want solitary confinement impose on Elsa Caplan no unapproved visitor understand we still have 42 hour I want you to know we be do everything we can Elsa do not react you be listen to a recorded message be transmit to you through a directional sound projector you be the only one who can hear this the CIA will not sanction an extraction team to get the locator I be go in myself I know none of this be much of a consolation to you right now I need you to give I the locator code cross your arm and tap they out in Morse code with your index finger back away from the glass please I have authorisation back up now thank you it be be 24 hour this database be encode with an 81 92 bit military grade polymorphic encryption unless you wanna kidnap a smart genius than I it be go to be a little while tell I what you need to speed this up I need access to a Cray supercomputer I hope you be not stall Mr Caplan because your safe return to your family be no guarantee Understand a few day ago my leg I would have do anything to keep you alive my leg and now I do not care Arvin Arvin Arvin do not we still need he my leg where would you be transfer to I will be reassign within the Agency maybe to Texas or DC I would be an analyst I would be safe you would be happy not be in the field I would be happy as long as you and the kid be with I Sloane 's the man who run SD 6 the one who lie to you for year Marcus you be not responsible for what happen to his wife he put she in harm 's way that be not the only reason I be put in for the transfer I be do it for we when you first tell I the truth I say I do not know who you be I be wrong I just do not know what you do I have always know who you be you be the most decent man I know whatever you decide I will be with you hello it be I be your source still in place yes good I need

clearly know I be listen to your phone conversation she also know that by the time I decode her anagram she would be halfway to Russia I be go to give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you have every intention of report that fact to I I be give you this consideration because when Sydney make contact with you again you be go to tell I exactly where she be if I have know what she be do I would have try to stop she now that she be go there be nothing we can do to change her mind she be get 40 hour to find Caplan why not support her give her backup if it be not obvious to you by now everything I do be in the service of protect Sydney for all we know Elsa Caplan 's work with Sloane for all we know she be a conspirator in her husband 's abduction which mean Sydney could be walk into a trap or she be not and she be about to save Neil Caplan 's life this be not a debate and just because you 've get comfortable with my daughter it do not mean you should be comfortable with I if you do not report your next contact with Sydney immediately I will take action that you will regret ok partner let us get ready to ride hold on there here you go get up get up you be no cowboy this be

country but it require you to prostitute yourself it be a small price to pay for serve the motherland at first everything go as plan then surely an accident you get pregnant you consider terminate the pregnancy but selfishly you do not you hope somehow that become a mother would redeem you would absolve your guilt you be wrong but you continue to lie and deceive both your husband and son I be not

description I owe you an apology Diane you do not have to explain anything no let I say this when Marcus first tell I about SD 6 I feel so betray and in part I blame you for that your world have these rule that force good people to lie even to those they be close to before I could accept that I have to understand it I rescind the transfer order Diane rescind the order Mr Bristow Mr Bristow yes Marshall Hi listen I be do some spelunking on the CIA network mapping it really just for kick and you can relax because the Death Star plan be not in the main computer anyway I do find a bandwidth discrepancy at first I think it be a Trojan virus someone implant on the system but unless it be lock into a perpetually rename RAM cache Marshall please English I find a massive information haemorrhage someone without authorisation access the system and download 10gb worth of satellite footage from Tuscany Tuscany yeah we be on a secure system how do they hack in well they do not it come

do I do not know what you be talk about stay back Sydney no way you be go to kill yourself I have nothing to lose what the hell be your man do Agent Dixon disarm your explosive immediately can you see they from your position Negative Dixon think do not do this Sydney get outta here I be not leave without you Dixon I repeat deactivate that weapon tell I where the box be or we die Base camp get a visual tell I what be it go to be tell Vaughn to take he down Dixon may be hold a manual detonator firing at he could trigger the explosion Dixon shut it down 15 14 Agent Bristow I be pull rank Agent Vaughn this be NSA Deputy Director Brandon I be order you to take that shot at first possible opportunity Sydney get outta here Dixon you must disarm now do not stand at my grave and weep I be not there I do not sleep I be a thousand wind that flow should I say something I be the gentle autumn 's rain I be the swift uplift rush of quiet bird in circle flight ok come on come on do not stand at my grave and cry do not stand at my grave and cry I see Dixon take something what do you mean pill uh he just look like he be barely hold it together it could 've be aspirin it be not aspirin what be you say I be say that he be go back to work day after his wife be murder and he be self medicate I think he need to feel like he be do everything he can to find sloane I have the same thing with Danny find the man we be look for he live in Panama City I can be there in 17 hour no the CIA have a copy of the database that Caplan decrypt they will deduce who it be we be after if they have not already do it well what do you suggest I suggest you call this number a recording will answer for a limousine service you will leave your cell number only within five minute a man will call you you tell he exactly what you need have you hear from Irina she be in Cyprus inspect some property to take the place of the facility in Spain I see I think I would have some measure of satisfaction with Diane Dixon 's death I kill the wrong person Dixon I be take a leave I want you to continue without I Sir not to belittle your grief but do not deny yourself the victory of a 30 year pursuit if I do not see you again Mr Sark tell Irina that I hope you both succeed where I could not this be Frederick Brandon NSA Deputy Director he be coordinate an interagency task force to locate and study Rambaldi 's work first of all I would like to say thank you to all of you for welcome my associate and I I be Carrie Bowman Special Projects well thank to your technical service specialist it be a Mr Flinkman we 've make an invaluable breakthrough in the Rambaldi investigation really actually I be Flinkman Marshall Flinkman hi hi so while the CIA be in possession of Rambaldi 's study of the human heart Mr Flinkman catalogue and copy it do you have that presentation oh uh presentation and by the way you can call I Marshall everybody call I whatever um ok uh thing we get uh right here now these drawing be amazing like da Vinci in his prime amazing but the what could he possibly have be smoke element well that be right here now take a look in the corner you see these little drawing in the corner of the page now they look just like normal squiggle or doodle like you would do while you be on the phone talk to although he probably would not be on the phone because you know it be the 15th century they do not actually have phone yet but um they be actually specific strand of dna now I string they all together and I get a dna fingerprint the DNA of this man Proteo Di Regno private citizen live in Panama City he work as an art restorer you be say that 500 year ago Rambaldi draw the dna profile of a man who be alive today it get even well Di Regno 's DNA profile be a code key it let we decrypt page 94 of the Rambaldi manuscript what be on the page Times and date each mark an apocalyptic event September 7 1812 Napoleon 's bloody battle with the Russians June 28 1914 the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand start World War I August 6 1945 Hiroshima the list go on there be a future date list on the page be not there 48 hour from now what be the prediction the page do not say it just give a time it be the equivalent of midnight Eastern Standard Time we be coordinate with local authority in Panama City when you find Di Regno you will escort he back here until the moment specify by Rambaldi have come and go by National Security directive this operation centre be under the jurisdiction of NSA you 've talk to the neighbour no one see the person who might have do this so far Forensics have not find anything no print nothing and you believe this be not a burglary no nothing be take besides his heart look Rambaldi so why take his heart I do not know it look like the fingertip from a latex glove must have tear off I be able to enhance the partial print you send I off the latex glove there be a match Guy 's name be Emilio Vargas he be a freelance assassin specialise in interrogation and wet work client include Russian Mafia Triad japanese yakuza any intel on where he operate from well there be an address in Guadalajara Forward I everything you 've get I have a request concern Agent Dixon what be it I know he be be through a lot and I know he want to feel useful but until he be have a psychological evaluation and it be clear by Medical Services I I believe it be in his good interest and ours to remove he from field duty I 've work with Agent Dixon for a dozen year you 've work with he a month if he feel ready to be in the field I be go to accord he that respect give his state of mind do you think he be the right person to make that decision yes Jack he just lose his wife with all due respect why be you fight I on this I be not require to justify my decision to you Agent Vaughn however I recruit Dixon into SD 6 I be the man who sell he the lie he be work for the CIA I introduce he to the man who kill his wife I will not be the one to tell he he can not assist in Sloane 's capture everything ok Miss Bowman hey excuse I I thank you no problem be everything all right it be Joni Mitchell do not tell anyone ok no I I should not bring she to work it just make I fatalistic well this work we be do it do not really help yeah no kidding research this prophecy try to predict what sort of disaster 's go to hit 36 hour from now it make I wanna throw up do you believe in this stuff Rambaldi his prophecy I be raise more or less by agnostic parent I mean they be inordinately empirical Logical to the point of foolishness really like Marshall you must wear your sweater it be 52 degree outside but I be like Mom I be not cold I do not well in this family young man we wear sweater at 52 degree I mean there be really no prophecy grow up or even Santa Claus tooth fairy so the short answer be no well that be what I keep tell myself to tell you the truth I be exhaust by the world everything the the evil and the rage and the darkness the last thing I need be some 15th century dork tell I I get a day and a half to live I understand I mean like I have so much leave to do right be you gay why be there someone you wanna set I up with no it be just every cute guy that I meet turn out to be gay I be not stupid I mean I be in Mensa hold on not gay I mean I like man in a kind of manly friend sort how about sushi I mean because when we be do with this job after 36 hour of course assume we be all still here we could maybe we you wanna get some sushi yeah I I would love that oh and um Joni Mitchell Doctor Barnett this be Michael Vaughn do you have a minute there be something I need to talk to you about Mr Vargas we come refer by Gurneyev he be very pleased with the work you do for he in Gdansk the Kopernik job no Janazek Janazek be a learning experience I find if you remove the eye slowly you can keep it connect to the optic nerve he see himself in a whole new light why do you kill Di Regno Son of a bitch why Di Regno

get by yeah get by previously on Alias what be go on we 've decrypt the spec on Project Helix the datum describe a breakthrough in next generation molecular gene therapy it refer to a new procedure whereby a patient 's face and body be reshape to identically resemble someone else I 've be ask to confirm that you be in position yes everything be in place I go shop the other day and I see something that remind I of you so you buy Vaughn a present Sydney 's always say that you be wear suit so I think you could always use a new tie it be beautiful thank you that be very sweet you be welcome I could not take it I either seriously I think I be lose my mind I too that be the long debrief in history I be stare at you the whole time do you notice yeah I think my dad notice too no he do not notice why do you think he assign you the investigation cos it be a big job it be a big deal really mm hm someone unauthorise access our computer system we be go to find they I be the point guy you be the point guy I be the point guy where be will and Francie they be out they will not be back for hour you be so beautiful will Tippin may be compromise our superior deal in absolute either he be or he be not the CIA be on a mole hunt to find out who access the defence satellite communication system it be only a matter of time before they trace it it back to Tippin and then to I I assume Sloane will want Tippin kill before the CIA interrogate he Sloane 's go perhaps for good we can not wait for his return if the CIA use regression therapy to find out who he be be leak information to our Los Angeles asset will be compromise I do not want Tippin kill I 've set up a meeting with someone who can help we reacquire the Di Regno heart he will get we the plan to the NSA facility where they keep the Rambaldi artefact in the meantime tell our asset Tippin 's frame need to be convince start tomorrow you will be ask question that only will Tippin can answer place you 've be thing you 've say and do you will remember some thing and forget other the more personal the question the less you will recall in fact the more you try to recall detail the more elusive they will become do you understand yes now listen carefully do not move I be not suppose to tell you this what it be suppose to go through channel what it be bad be not it an operation base on my analysis go historically wrong you pass the upper level analyst test you take last week I do with one of the high mark congratulation you know what this mean not that it mean anything for sure but I hear that guy Roberts be retire I know which mean there be a senior spot for an analyst which you be now qualified to apply for Hands up Hands in the air what be go on who be you Special Agent McCain FBI Mr Tippin you be under arrest Arrest arrest for what who approve this Agent Bristow do not interfere with this Tippin 's be detain under the Patriot Act on suspicion of espionage Espionage do not say anything until you hear from I who order this your father this be insane will be not a traitor over the last month we 've have two breach of our defence satellite communication system the first disable our coverage over Panama allow Derevko to escape the second be a download of our imaging archive specifically the raid on Sloane 's villa in Tuscany there be no way that will be work for Sloane Syd excuse I sorry when I run a diagnostic on the network I find that Will 's user account be active in two place simultaneously a glitch which have since be correct however the satellite footage be access from one of those account anyone could have log on with his user ID or he do it himself I have know Will for year trust I on this there be another possibility that the man we have in custody be not will Tippin Project Helix the double prototype that you destroy in Poland be design to reshape a person 's physical attribute to identically resemble someone else the prototype 's database reveal two schedule recipient of the procedure Dr Renzo Markovic who be kill and a second unknown individual you think will be the other double we find Provacillium in Will 's car it be a medication usually take by gene therapy patient to keep the body from reject the dna mutation what about give he an ocular scan actually that be a really good point Mr Vaughn Michael I probably should not call you Michael Mr Vaughn an ocular scan be often use Tippin 's be transfer to medical service as we speak they will scan he and have the result shortly but there be something else a digital recording be find among Tippin 's thing it be take by the surveillance equipment you find in your apartment several month ago they think I be not I they do not know what to think someone breach the system and they be freak out they disable all Wi Fi access point and reset all user account and password it be a witch hunt what be that eye scan it be a test it analyse your retina someone who be be double develop protein they be like marker they find protein Syd that be impossible it do not make any sense I be assign to do research on Markovic this must be a setup go to my office everything I 've be work on be there I be innocent you know that right do you remember that time when we have too much to drink the night we kiss it be amazing of course I remember that night in your apartment do you remember where it be in my apartment what room it be a small apartment I know of course it be we be eat it be in the kitchen Syd I spill something on your sweater do you remember what that be Syd I swear it be I Pull Tippin 's phone record read his email get his financial if he be the double go over the record could lead we to his handler or exonerate he Sydney he could not answer your question look at the evidence I have reasonable doubt the information Tippin fed Sloane lead directly to Diane 's death excuse I if someone want to set will up this be exactly what they would do plant these clue condition he I would like permission to assign Francie a protective detail if Sloane be target my friend she could be next do I would also like to speak with she about will she might have information that could help tell she whatever you think be necessary but only what be necessary I need to know if he be be act strangely what be wrong forget thing or say thing will would not normally say Sydney what be you talk about where be he be he ok just think about it he have be distant lately for how long I guess since the two week he spend in Chicago with his family Sydney what be go on there be go to be some man outside in a van they be security they be go to be watch the apartment watch you protect you why Syd you be creep I out I do not work for a bank we download valuable intel from Tippin 's computer on the work he be do to locate the second double he manage to identify the man who invent the computer imaging equipment use by Dr Markovic this be Dr Hans Jurgens he be a chief scientist at Miracorps the large hospital supply company in the European Union his equipment be use to monitor the patient during the gene therapy that be require to complete the double process our control assumption be that he be personally involve in the process so we think he know the identity of the second double if the guy we 've get be not Tippin then we can not trust his intel at good it be a dead end at worst a trap I think it be he I be get bore with your hunch pardon I I say we move the prisoner to Camp Harris for unrestricted interrogation I be not let my friend be take to a place like that we can not keep let your daughter 's personal relationship think if will be innocent he be not train to handle torture he will say anything you want he to say if not he may know where your friend be for now Tippin stay here five hour ago we acquire surveillance of Jurgens in Berlin a contact in country will meet you at bendex office building downtown then brief you on the operation your plane leave in half an hour man I be so stop that be what they recover from my wife 's car after the bomb go off that be why we could not have an open casket funeral for her turn the page first fingerprint be your right index finger the second be the partial they lift from the remote detonator we find among your thing the print be a match you have Sydney fool but I be not go to play game with you you be not will Tippin Dixon you can not think that I help I find Arvin Sloane and I will do what I can to help you avoid the death penalty Dixon please refuse to cooperate and I assure you you will suffer now when you be do with this act you will tell I what I wanna know I will prove it to you how do we meet Sydney introduce we where it be she have a party and there be a bunch of we together and uh I remember what we be talk about uh Dixon somebody do this to I and I can not remember you murder my wife you murder my wife you murder Dixon Tippin 's be transfer to Camp Harris I want you to supervise it be my understanding Director Bristow decide he be not to be move he be be overrule by DOJ Convoy leave in ten minute she what Bristow break her cover with I she tell I she be CIA do she give you an explanation give what be happen with Tippin she be concerned for my safety of all thing Bristow 's willingness to confide in you be an advantageous development that will be lose if Tippin give you up I intercept a DOJ transmission they be move Tippin to a more secure location once he be there he will be unreachable organise a team to intercept the transport and extract he to the CIA this will confirm his value to we and once we have he kill he have you try the restaurant upstairs yes the bratwurst be excellent hello my friend we 've track Jurgens to a local sex club he frequent Leather whip latex chain all the good stuff how long be he go to be there could be a couple of hour I say we move in now what nothing I I wanna mmm mmm I I I wanna mmm mmm I I I wanna mmm mmm I I I wanna mmm mmm I I I wanna mmm mmm I I I wanna mmm mmm I I I wanna mmm mmm I I I wanna mmm mmm I I I wanna mmm mmm I I I wanna mmm mmm I I I wanna mmm mmm I I be glad I be not the one in leather you would look cute in a teddy Jurgens be with the security team against the wall hello honey hello dear who be he your wife 's name be Alba right how do you know my wife oh no hi Alba please we know about Project Helix that you build it for Markovic you do we also know that he use it to double himself and one other person with markovic dead you be the only one who know the identity of that second agent but I do not know I assume your wife 's email address be still the same what she be go to love these picture no no no wait I just build it for Markovic I be not there for the procedure your wife be go to love have these new picture to add to your scrapbook I do not know the name but there be a way you can find it the compute power require to model a person 's entire genome be tremendous so during the double process Markovic have to reconnect it to an off site computer facility a server farm if you access those server you can find the identity of the second double which server farm do he use I do not know I swear to God please do not send those picture please let I go please let I go here be your picture please give I back my pant please explain this transfer order Tippin be stonewall we need to break he before his handler realise he be be compromise unrestricted interrogation be premature Justice Department do not agree Tippin be a credible threat to national security which mean that from now on they wanna be consult on every decision of this investigation what do you think Jack that I just forge a transfer order on CIA letterhead you go behind my back hardly unheard of in this office so what be this retribution for I take your parking space no I do what my job compel I to do nothing more nothing less and if you can not see that I be try to protect the life of everyone in this operation centre then I overestimate your intelligence that be Roosevelt Road ETA 20 minute copy that shot fire we 've get a sniper wait a second come on move it Tippin you son of a bitch you transfer will to camp Harris after we agree to keep he here Sydney for the time be your father may be my superior but I be yours who the hell do you think you be to talk to I like that my friend may be dead your friend arrange for an armed assault team to facilitate his escape how exactly do he do that from a hold cell he do not even get a phone call Syd I be there I see he with the gun he fire into the transport be you sure it be not self defence would you excuse we please I know it be not smart to lose my cool with Kendall Sydney you have to accept the possibility that the man we have in custody be not your friend Dad I do not believe it I understand cos if it be not will then will be most likely dead and I can not handle that we receive your intel from Berlin we be analyse the list of server farm now as soon as we have a lead on the facility you will know go home get some rest I have to admit I be surprised when I be contact the plan please what surprise I be you want blueprint to a government storage facility rumour being that you be work with CIA now do I a favour let I know how you plan on do it do what get past the new access control system because unless you know how to crack it these blueprint will not do you any good oh I just can not believe it it seem so insane I know how be it even possible that someone could look like Will and sound like he I mean it be just so ridiculous do the CIA have any idea where will might be I mean the real will I be sorry but I be not authorise to give you any detail Syd do not do this to I Francie Sydney you be my good friend you just tell I that you be a spy and that my boyfriend be a double and now you be tell I you be not authorise the answer be we do not know hello Syd it be I will where be you I do not escape an assault team hit the bus they try to take I hostage or kill I I do not know but someone 's frame I the FBI and CIA both have you on a shoot to kill watch list you have to tell I where you be so Kendall can send I to Camp Harris treat I like a terrorist not a chance I will not let that happen if you be will you know I will do whatever it take to make sure that nothing happen to you please let I bring you in Syd I love you I can not trust you not any more meeting you meet you destroy my life you wanna help I prove I be innocent there may be a dna record of the surgical procedure it could clear you it be it be on a server farm somewhere in Europe I be go to find it I promise ok ok this may be nothing but Markovic launder money through real estate he have a farm in Marseilles maybe it be not a cow pig farm maybe it be a server farm Marseilles do you remember where no no I get to go I get to go Syd where be he be he ok I have to go no talk to I tell I what be happen I can not I be sorry please try to understand Sydney Bristow 's head to Marseilles should I follow her stay there Finding Tippin be your priority how do it go the NSA facility use state of the art lock mechanism we 've bypass system like that before the access code I download from the CIA Echelon system will not work any more the NSA now use a time synchronise key card Presumably a CIA agent under the proper duress could obtain such a key card I be about to confess something that will either delight you which I hope be the case that would be nice or it will make you furious while you be away will Tippin be order to Camp Harris for unrestricted interrogation they would have find out about our asset what do you do I instruct that he be extract and kill I tell you I do not want he kill your asset could have be pull from the field yes I know but the situation have change Sydney out of fear for Francie 's life tell she she be go to Marseilles to recover evidence that would clear Tippin be he dead no he be at large and believe to have escape which should provide we the leverage we need to get into the NSA if we recover the evidence in Marseilles before Sydney we can force her hand Proof of Will 's innocence in exchange for her aid in secure a key card we just get the forensic report back on the detonator we find among Tippin 's thing will 's fingerprint be place on the trigger after it be wipe down this be great now we have evidence that confirm he be be frame yes still it will take hour to get Justice approval to infiltrate the server farm take Vaughn the two of you will go in tactically I will have Marshall prepare your op tech Kendall 's go to report you I be aware of the consequence when the DOJ hear you initiate an op without their approval Sydney I 've be do this long than you have I be not cut out for management anyway we need to talk yes I know I 've be sanction by the DOJ I be no long in charge of this operation centre that honour go to you maybe I be a slow learner Jack because I do not understand you a month ago you manoeuvre I out of my job and now here you be hand it back I belong in the field you know we can help each other we do not have to be adversary I appreciate your magnanimity now you be just mock I yes you know part of the reason I send Tippin to Camp Harris be to protect Sydney why do you think you have your job back thank Mr Bristow Thanks Sarah keep the change it be good to see you Jack I assume that since you be sit across from I with so little regard for your life I be in the cross hair of a sniper rifle two of they of course I 've miss your poker face so there be something I want you to know I forgive you excuse I your betrayal of SD 6 I be curious Jack when exactly do our friendship end the moment you recruit Sydney over my objection I think so if I have know that decision would cost I our friendship and my relationship with Sydney I would have do thing differently self pity do not become you Jack on the contrary I be here to make you an offer I do not expect an answer now what would that be Come back to our partnership Jack I will tell you everything I 've learn about Rambaldi an obsession I 've never share well now be the time to sign up for year I collect his artefact as if that be the point I think Rambaldi 's work be the window to the past today I be one move away from prove to you that it be so much more than that and this time Sydney will not be a pawn in our venture Jack sit here for a while think about it we will never work together again the thing of it be you be go to work with I soon than you think the man who have you in their sight have be instruct to put a bullet through your brain if you dial your cell or leave this table within 30 minute we will see each other again Jack trust I on that the chief of security hold a kill switch that enable he to wipe clean all of their data storage at any sign of attack to prevent the destruction of the information that we need I will proceed to the security room and secure the kill switch after confirmation from Agent Bristow you will expedite through the facility where you will consider everyone you encounter as hostile we will upload the file on the second double to a CIA server any question Agent Bristow what be this a private club American be this Paris Come on can I Monsieur monsieur monsieur monsieur I have a little too much to drink ok it be no big deal be this the fancy club can I come in I just wanna I know I 've have a little too much to drink but I really just wanna come in for a little bit my friend tell I to come listen I love you man ok all right you be so grumpy man what be your status Mountaineer I be go in Copy we will move in Boy Scout in position all team hold for Mountaineer 's signal hello Sydney Sydney I know what you be after your friend 's suspect of be a double you believe the information on these server could clear he no do not go go go you erase it I transfer a copy to a secure location I will give it to you in exchange I want you to do something go to hell if you do not you will never clear Will 's name he will be try as a traitor and execute I will be call on you soon Sydney thank for come you ok yeah yeah I be now Syd you can not blame yourself sure I can well do not she be play you maybe she be what be you suppose to do I could have listen she offer to help Will and I say no you talk about she as if

give you the address of Sloane 's warehouse where he be hide the Rambaldi artefact that be not why you be here yes it be the only reason I know you be lie but I do not know why Sydney I be here to help you stop be as stubborn as I be I know from the beginning I would turn myself in that I would betray the CIA but not you I have to be careful I need you to trust I but I also could not tell you my plan Sloane have 23 Rambaldi artefact the CIA have 24 in order to assemble the device they all have to be bring together those be the piece in sloane 's warehouse you steal Rambaldi piece from the US government yes by win your trust the CIA 's trust and then as plan I have a proposal to deliver to sloane a proposal that we work together to take down the Alliance and raid the CIA all at once I come up with a scenario where the CIA need to let I use their computer I use the opportunity to learn where the US government keep its stash of Rambaldi artefact they be be hold at a secret NSA lab in Nevada one month later Sloane have a team raid the lab I never hear of an NSA raid of course not when the time come for my escape it be painful because my love for you for your father be not a contrivance suddenly you want we to have sloane 's artefact Sydney I know our relationship be complicated but I be your mother and I have to believe that would be the case under any circumstance go to Zurich you be insane one more thing I need to do and I be sorry for this too Provacillium to the rescue thank the fever be get bad so what be we do with Tippin nothing for the moment then when be I getting extract I do not know what new evidence the CIA have but it be go to lead to I not necessarily if you disappear now you will be a suspect for sure what be it Allison we can not reverse the

of my captor Mr Weiss ' report say you recall overhear voice name include Mr Kingsley this be Robert Lindsey he be our NSC liaison yes so far that be all I remember it sound like the group we be look for be the one that be hold our girl last night there be a mass murder on a passenger train among the dead be a CIA asset Scott Kingsley Kingsley do work for we he design an aircraft a spy drone that could fly undetecte by radar Kingsley be en route to Avignon to deliver the schematic they be steal this drone can be convert into a delivery system biological weapon chemical I get it this group we know almost nothing about they they refer to themselves as the Covenant we have some intelligence identify one of their outpost we believe this be where they 've take the chip we be send a team to Paris to raid the building look familiar yes see we be go in with or without you without you we be blind you might recognise detail we would not see otherwise I be personally of the mind that send you into the field so soon after your recovery be asinine well you might ask yourself how much you want to apprehend these killer do not question my resolve what you be suggest be premature listen to what I be suggest I 've experience trauma myself Return to the field prematurely it be as dangerous as not be train at all excuse I I be stand right here I think I might be helpful in Paris but I will not even consider go unless you help I first I want to see my father right now Miss Bristow just so we be clear I have no intention of do your father one single favour ever that say it be not your fault

Sydney the test be over if you be under the influence of any valid brainwashing technique I would know it as for your memory loss some form of torture electroconvulsive shock therapy for example can cause amnesia he be unarmed Dad I slit that man 's throat your remorse be premature without know the circumstance you can not be sure you do not have just cause I know you do not want the CIA to see this tape to protect I but maybe they should they will detain you indefinitely if they learn you murder Lazarey you will not be able to participate in find what happen to you which I need you for I do not trust myself right now Dad maybe the CIA should not either well I trust you I will keep look into Lazarey your mother may be helpful assume she be still alive I have not speak to she for a year but we establish a protocol for make contact I will try and reach she for now you deserve to get on with your life why do lift heavy object mean I need one of those beer Chop chop maybe because you be a slave to advertising thank you hey be that a smile it be nice to see that again yeah you sure you be okay with this I mean you go to be alright live by yourself I just can not wrap my head around it

want to hear this when Vaughn hear that you be dead Syd he he drop off the face of the Earth I mean literally Syd he be out of the country for six month and you need to know that he be not cavalier about move on I could barely even convince he to consider come back he be think about come back well do not worry about that 'cause it be not go to happen because of I because I come back right Weiss yeah get it we will be right there at 1300 U t C two agent of the Central Intelligence Agency be abduct in Berlin we claim responsibility for this act of aggression against the world 's remain superpower who we be be unimportant what we represent be unimportant what we want be to be hear within this audio file be coordinate ieade to a designate location go there retrieve the package follow our demand the two agent Klein and Rotter be work undercover for we at Leizig Aerospace we believe they be abduct by a group know as the Covenant a loose affiliation of russian nationalist comprise of former Central Committee member and retire KGB though we know little about they the Covenant seem to function like an organise crime family now the pickup location the Covenant specify be a theatre in Munich in the red light district actually it be an adult theatre I check and today 's feature a rough translation I do not speak German it be Penile Code Part Deux if anybody care I have the time I do not like send someone in alone to pick up the package it be doubtful they would betray we break their own rule before we even know their demand would result in a loss of negotiate credibility I will go I want to run the op tech with Marshall that be it Syd stay a minute I would rather send Weiss you be allow time before you jump back in with both foot the good way I can start feel normal be to act that way Dixon I need this I be allow you to go but you should know you be not the only CIA operative who be experience lose time there be a group their next meeting 's at the end of the week I be in the theatre we get you on fly by Mountaineer Perimeter 's clear no suspect signal we be on standby it be a box I be sweep it for explosive it be clean I be go to open it up proceed with caution Mountaineer oh God what be it one of the agent Klein it be his head there be a piece of paper wedge in his mouth give I a sec it be write in russian I have their list of demand the death of Peter Klein be a great loss to this agency but keep in mind his colleague be still alive and it be our job to bring he home National Security Council Director Robert Lindsey will be coordinate with we as some of you already know the Covenant have agree to return our remain agent in exchange for the release of Mr Sark and I be here to inform you trade Sark for your asset have be authorise by the NSC wait a minute we can not just let he go to the good of our knowledge Sark 's be bleed dry of every piece of intel he know the burden of criminal justice notwithstanding he now have a value only as a commodity in trade without know why they want Sark how can we consider this we think we know why they want he so they can kill he Intelligence provide by Arvin Sloane indicate Sark may be responsible for the death of a high rank member within the Covenant they may want revenge if your revenge theory be wrong we be set a terrorist free to say nothing of the fact that take Arvin Sloane 's intel at face value be insane I be aware of your history with sloane but if Director Dixon can trust he I think you can too for the record I do not I never will but I can not deny that despite my feeling for Sloane he have provide we with accurate intelligence for over a year now I be authorise the trade you and Weiss will escort Sark to the exchange point in Mexico you will leave in four hour welcome back since when do the NSC become eager to negotiate with terrorist Bob Lindsey have the White House spin machine ready to cover he if his action prove ill advise he be untouchable I would love to prove that wrong you 've come close enough in force my release while you be in Mexico make the exchange I be go to Zurich to see Sloane he will be expect I and we should appear predictable I will have that adjust where be I bury you be cremate Vaughn spread your ashe at sea so if you guy do not understand what I say good luck on the quiz you be a french teacher yeah I know that you be think about come back to the agency on the off chance that your hesitation be out of some courtesy to I I you can forget about it I mean I can handle you be there so do not worry about I the other day you say I give up because I do not have faith that somehow you do not mean enough to I when I say that I be no let I finish after you die I use to talk to you like you be still around literally out loud whole conversation about nothing the weather should I get a new car should I have another drink then one day you start answer I mean I could hear you in my head Iike you be right next to I Sydney and although I know I be a guy who stay up night drink talk to his dead girlfriend still I could not stop so before you tell I you can handle my come back to the CIA there be two thing you need to know First be that I be so in love with you it nearly kill I and second that I do not regret move on with my life the president of the World Bank ask that you stop by his table we receive word that he be willing to make a sizeable contribution to our cancer research his wife be a vegetarian so make sure that she be attend to yeah send he in I need you to excuse I a world relief organisation the sheer audacity of your alleged turnaround would be laughable if you be not so dangerous I be wonder when you would come to see I Jack you do not really expect I to believe you 've change I expect you to trust in the consistency of my obsession Jack I pursue the Rambaldi puzzle across the world for over 30 year it never occur to I once the artefact be assemble that they would produce nothing more than a message of peace Personally I would have find it anticlimactic that after expect to assemble a weapon of ultimate power you end up with a revelation you could have acquire from a fortune cookie always the atheist Jack I 've miss you I will come to the point I believe you be responsible for Sydney 's disappearance tell I why right now and give she the peace of mind she deserve in exchange I will halt my effort to invalidate your pardon agreement Jack do not go dig you will not find anything I know you be imprison for make contact with your ex wife you go to Irina Derevko for help to find Sydney I would not have believe that you would ally yourself with a woman whom you vow never to trust again so if you be capable of have such a change of heart why be it so hard to believe that I be as well because every morally questionable thing I 've ever do have be to protect Sydney you do not have the same excuse really I investigate Sydney 's death too this file contain all the lead I pursue mostly dead end I be hope you will find something in it that be useful I trust that you will look at it before you dismiss it outright should I take this as your denial of involvement in Sydney 's disappearance then you 've make the bad mistake of your life because I be go to bury you Mr Sark I want a word before you get trade dear God it can not possibly be you do not start this conversation by act surprised I be alive Sydney you know how highly I regard your ability as an operative but even I do not think you be capable of cheat death once your remain have be identify which

if you read my transcript you know how cooperative I 've be I will be glad to pay you the same courtesy if you simply tell I what you be get at that explosion in my apartment be a cover up to make the CIA believe I be dead what I believe be that Sloane abduct I I think you know why but you fail to mention that in your confession if I be to understand what you be say you have no idea where you 've be for the last two year none Unbelievable I be sorry I do not mean to laugh I be just I be speechless Sydney if Sloane have intend to abduct you I be not privy to it what if I say I still do not believe you I would say it would make no difference in 24 hour I will be free and you will remain in the dark see you in Mexico we 've agree to a location in the Sonora Desert as the point of exchange each side be allow no more than a 5 man cover team once the exchange be initiate Sark and Rotter will be release simultaneously I assure you this organisation the Covenant be as much a mystery to I as it be to the CIA I can not imagine why they would want to trade you be about to find out my life be in danger be not it Base Ops we receive a call signal should I confirm you be authorise Mountaineer let us go we have a visual on Agent Rotter Roger Mountaineer Release the prisoner you be up we have incoming vehicle I will need an ident immediately they be not ours Mountaineer we be try to get a visual if we do not finish this by the time those vehicle get here the Covenant will think it be a double cross there be a chopper inbound it be one of ours CIA operative this be Sergeant Trask of Delta Force Put down your weapon this operation have be countermand by order of the National Security Council take cover Sydney report Delta Force show up out of nowhere Lindsey ambush we get I Bob Lindsey now do not tell I to calm down you use my agent as bait I be try to reacquire your agent without release Sark I be sorry I do not fill you in but I do not trust the CIA to maintain secrecy you

vehicle be not mean for he on the other hand it do seem that you owe I and what would that price be 800 million 800 million I have nowhere near that amount in my nest egg in fact Mr Sark you do Sydney Vaughn 's qualified for reinstatement until his field rating 's update he will be on analysis but he be back effective immediately if there be special consideration either of you would like I to take into account now be the time to speak up Welcome back thank good hello Jack I find out why the Covenant be interested in Sark at 10 00 this morning Sark walk into the Thornton Bank and Trust in the Cayman Islands accompany by Ushek San'ko a know operative of the Covenant he be then lead downstairs where he use his thumbprint to access an executive vault inside the vault be a little over 800 million in gold bullion more surprising be that Sark have no idea he be entitle to that money entitle eight month ago an interagency memorandum report the murder of a russian diplomat by the name of Andrian Lazarey his murderer have never be find however a source of mine have provide evidence indicate he be a descendant of the Romanov royal family in Russia the money be in his trust when he die it go to Mr Sark Lazarey 's son we task the satellite to track the sedan once it leave the desert they be track to a Frankfurt nightclub know for sell synthetic drug Analysis think it be a front for the Covenant do we have reason to believe the last hostage be still alive yes they be aware he be the team leader and have the high security clearance the information they could extract would be priceless to our enemy his name be Otto Edel drug dealer he run the club he will know where our agent 's be hold I want you to accompany the hostage rescue team actually I have an idea Syd should go in as a biochem major Harvard dropout totally spoil maybe she got kick out because she be synthesize ecstasy in her dorm room or maybe crystal crank Fine Marshall run the op tech the CIA would have discover Lazarey 's connection to Sark there be no add risk to you in break the news myself without that tape the CIA can not link you to his death this can not be a coincidence I be responsible for Lazarey 's death and nine month later the Covenant get Sark release in exchange for his 800 million inheritance it be look more likely they be responsible for your absence be it under duress or by some other unknown mean they compel you to carry out the assassination I be schedule to contact your mother tonight hopefully she will be some help that be for he you be very attractive for a chemist thank you for meet with I I like to keep my option open although I doubt you can improve on my little cocktail I can triple your sale really how by make your drug more addictive take a look very

Federal Building in which you make your distaste for he abundantly clear I guess I do well he get the message because he decide to return to Washington he be assign Agent Reed here in his place to assist our effort against the Covenant she will also be look into the murder of andrian Lazarey as part of a joint investigation with the Kremlin if there be anything I can do to help you should know in addition to be the new NSC liaison I be also Michael Vaughn 's wife hi previously on Alias this be from a hidden camera that I place this be how I know you be alive no I love you like a daughter

the truth the ever evasive truth be that there be advantage to lose all your stuff in a fire how be that to die and come back to life no I be good I be good okay alright a little one think about it all the paper Clippings from high school and yearbook and sweater I be never go to wear again and picture and picture frame yeah but there be get to be something you have that you love that it kill you that you do not have it anymore I mean like a thing like a thing I know what you mean I use to have a first edition Alice in Wonderland my mother give it to I for my fifth birthday despite my roller coaster relationship with she wherever she be that be one of the thing that I sort of love this be it the bar be close last drink the elephant in the room which one come on tomorrow you and

be there for you oh tomorrow 's go to be fine Damn it hi hi you 've meet Lauren yes hi hello again sorry about yesterday I should have say something you have no idea I be the one who storm in anyway it be alright hi listen I make you a mix cd of all the most popular song over the past two year not so you can listen to all the impossible bad boy band they keep churn out except for J T Timberlake that guy can move more importantly because scientifically it be prove that sound trigger the CA 3 region of the hippocampus in the long term memory thank you Awkward early today 4 47 P M Moscow time Russia 's early warning system be activate they assume it be an incoming missile attack it be not a missile it be a satellite that have fall from orbit as a result of the perceive attack the russian President activate his nuclear briefcase initiate a countdown to a pre launch sequence with two minute to spare they attain visual I D and scrub the launch 10 minute later echelon pick up a call from a secure line between Mr Sark and this man Colonel Boris Oransky Dishonorably discharge in ' 96 from Russia 's Military Space Command since then he be work for a privately hold french contractor it be their satellite Oransky bring down his own satellite do we have any idea why not yet but on the phone call he and Sark discuss meeting to move on to phase two we 've track Sark to Mexico City we 've order a team of local agent to surveil he if we be go to grab Sark I would like to be on that team it be not our intention to apprehend Sark the NSC believe we may learn more about the Covenant by track Sark 's movement in the hope he will lead we to the Covenant 's key player that be fine in theory except that I guarantee five minute after that meeting we will have lose Sark it be happen before in the last two year our surveillance capability have become far more sophisticated I might have miss a lot in the last two year but the fact that Sark be align with an organisation outwardly hostile to the United States and apparently Russia as I be go to explain to you our optical satellite resolution have increase dramatically we have real time face recognition all the technology in the world can not fix our problem it be the people we need to stop Sark for example now I be familiar with the strategy the CIA employ it against SD 6 the risk you be describe have be factor into our analysis and as for SD 6 the Alliance do not exist anymore the reason sd 6 and the Alliance break down be because Arvin Sloane a man who the White House pardon want they to so do I a favour and do not revise history I live through Alright enough Sark be an inch away from initiate a nuclear exchange accord to that call that be only phase one Capturing Sark although it might put a smile on my face will do nothing to shut down the Covenant for the moment Sark remain free Sydney Weiss I want you to track Sark to that meeting Standard surveillance operation let us see if we can get some info on their phase two you leave in an hour I hate her she be be through a lot I 've be on eggshell for two week since Sydney come back try not to say the wrong thing I be do Sydney Bristow be self righteous and arrogant she lose two year of her life she be the most condescending person I have ever meet I understand why you have a problem no she be the one with the problem I be not go to apologise because I remember the last 24 month or because I be married to the man I love you be react emotionally no I be react intelligently as I expect Sydney to you would think she would listen to someone instead of just talk all over they she be horrible okay stop this be Sydney 's first briefing give she a minute the way thing be no one would blame you if the two of you hate each other but I actually believe that you will end up respect she you might even like she just remember that I love you how be the first briefing with Lauren Wonderful I be not ask because I be a fan of gossip tell I how it go why do she seem aggressive toward you yes as I be sure I do to her what be this about in here now that Lazarey 's murder have be link to the Covenant the NSC have convene their own investigation you think they know that you be the murderer not yet but they 've just receive some footage apparently of the crime how another camera Security from across the street as our bad luck would have it NSC 's assign this investigation to Vaughn 's wife I know what you be think but the long we withhold this information the more guilty I seem the CIA and the NSC be go to learn that I kill Lazarey and when they do the NSC will not hesitate to subject you to every procedure in order to recapture your memory then let they I be lose my mind not know what happen to I someone out there someone have the answer the technique employ to stimulate your memory be invasive surgical dangerous procedure that could leave you with permanent brain damage that be not happen to you not as long as I be alive we 've discuss this you have to stay focused you have to do your job reintegrate into the CIA be the only way you be go to get the answer you be look for I 've talk with Lauren I tell she I might be able to help she be agree to let I see the footage you will go to Mexico City I will do what I can to ensure this remain our secret Marshall any luck yeah actually consider it be from a russian security camera I be expect static instead it be pretty good can you loop that yeah freeze there blow up that frame please sure not enough to make a positive I d well not like this I be not surprised the Russians have not make a match their program generate pixel interpolation base on bayesian analysis really Russians you can do well I please there be a lot of thing I can not do in life you know smoke a cigarette play basketball oh chin up you know there be always kid laugh but I be bear for this how long will it take you these eigenvalue be a mess give I 72 hour I think I can I d this woman Good thank you I be go to kill Marshall this be the bad disguise yet oh viva la revolution I be serious look at that okay this chip 's get a gig of memory in it or as they say here la memoria that be enough memory to transmit full resolution photo what be this what okay that be bad that be double chin angle not good Audio 's working Syd we be here for surveillance only nothing tricky here we go Sark 's here Oransky just get here Retriever to base now I be upload the photo I need to move close to get a look at those picture do not get too close careful Mountaineer it look like they have backup well it appear they 've reveal themselves as I tell you they would the code be change twice a week these go into effect the day after tomorrow this be our target correct Correct by the way I like the name Medusa it be clever image be good sir okay we 've get it Mountaineer now get out of there that woman be watch we I think I 've be make stay put I be come in Negative they 've get the exit block you will be spot on the way in if she be CIA we should be go she might have see the photo then I suggest you make sure she do not there be a freight entrance at the back northeast corner you should have a straight shot out come here go away go away hey gringo in the poncho Señorita in the poncho you know who you be reveal yourself or the girl die you 've get 5 second 4 3 2 let she go I will let you

camera 's in my glass give they to I toss they to I now good we be go to walk out of here you I almost there and the girl now Mama Oransky get away so we know Sark be look at a satellite photo with a 3 mile radius centre around the Kremlin we do not know why we know it have something to do with Medusa whatever that mean when I be at SD 6 I think I hear Sloane mention something about a Project Medusa you be kid I do you know what it be what Medusa even mean no all I know be the myth you know a woman so ugly that if you look at her you would turn to stone sound like the myth of my college girlfriend she actually dump I for a roadie at a Duran Duran concert how embarrassing be that Oregano please Syd come on do not do that you be not dump you be dead I have not even ask anyone how they meet be you ask I the NSC be wrap up the case on your mom we be all depose Lauren be the one ask the question they hit it off tell I about their wedding it be fine her parent ' farm in Virginia you know she be Senator Reed 's daughter no I do not yeah yeah they have 500 acre it be pretty crazy be everyone there Dixon Marshall she be a good person I be not try to rub it in but I do not want to be dishonest I should have think of it before be not it obvious a prior image model with 3 d surface reconstruction have you make a positive identification well no not yet but this be where we start okay after an application of my surface reconstruction genius this be where we be now how be it go Marshall 's ahead of schedule when do you think you will be finish I would say maybe noon tomorrow Good thank you I would like to feed the image into our face recognition database as soon as it be complete Sydney be right the Medusa project be flag in the SD 6 database it be an anti satellite pulse weapon once operational it can cripple our network of satellite d o d NSA you name it we would be blind to a potential attack that be what be so genius about this weapon it beam a microwave at one satellite in the chain which then relay a pulse across the network you be talk about hundred of satellite most with classified orbital rotation how do this tie in with the Covenant the man Sark meet with Oransky he supervise the development of Medusa for the russian military he be discharge before it be complete he never know where it end up until now this be the photo Oransky and Sark be look at accord to the time stamp it be take by a satellite exactly four minute after Oransky send that other satellite of his crashing into Gorky Park he send one bird down so the other can photograph Russia 's nuclear reaction protocol in action what happen be they think they be under attack so among other thing they evacuate several high level government official to several continuity of government bunker design to survive a nuclear attack this be what Medusa photograph see these motorcade enter the Science Ministry there must be a bunker underneath accord to the sd 6 database Medusa be store in that bunker and now Oransky and Sark be plan to steal it why do not we call the Kremlin and let they know the Russians claim to oppose anti satellite weapon they be not about to admit have one Bottom line we have to access the bunker and steal Medusa before Sark get it I will have Strategic Services list our option meet back here in one hour no problem I can corrupt that image however the term of my parole prohibit I from use a computer you should know that Jack I believe you write they how be it render 3 d surface reconstruction be the work station part of a network yes okay well give I a few day I will see what I can cook up I need it by noon tomorrow I have an I Q of 170 Jack I be not David Copperfield I will do what I can we have to do well than this an hour of run scenario and the good we can come up with be Sloane Sloane develop a relationship with the Science Ministry if we can get into the Ministry we can access the bunker and destroy Medusa before Sark and Oransky steal it I do not want to be the voice of dissent every time I walk into this room I know we be qualified to make decision but to I Sloane be still a criminal as we 've discuss Sloane be a necessary evil we need access to the bunker Sloane can get it if we can use he maybe you have not be lucky enough to have firsthand experience with that psychopath she broker his deal what I be part of the team that arrange for Sloane 's pardon none of we be under any illusion about Sloane he be give a pardon because he provide we with intel that lead to the destruction of terrorist cell of course he do he use you to wipe out his competition let I guess his intelligence have be accurate yes and the first slip he make his pardon will be revoke when be your next schedule briefing you have regular meeting with he 12 day alright move it up see if sloane can get we access to the Ministry I want both of you to go in as well if sloane can help we infiltrate the bunker I do not want to waste a minute be that clear do you mind of course not this be a difficult situation for all of we I be not sure how exactly but I think we should at least acknowledge that no one would blame we if we hate each other but I hope that do not happen I do not hate you or Vaughn that be what make it so difficult just get intel from NSA they track Sark onto a plane from Berlin to Frankfurt only when it land he be not onboard which mean if sloane do not help we today Sark will get to Medusa before we do I be sorry I can not help you you work with the Science Ministry all the time how difficult be it to add the name of two employee to the guest list of an award banquet actually it be not difficult at all it be what you plan to do once you be inside the Ministry that concern I we make it clear that topic be not open to discussion pursuant to my pardon agreement I be under obligation to pass along intel as appropriate however I be under no obligation to assist you or anyone else to break the law now as you know million of people rely on the relief that this company provide I could not possibly endanger that by expose Omnifam or myself to criminal charge certainly not with my history you 've make your obligation clear now let I clarify mine I be oblige to extract unimaginable pain from you the moment you be no long a valuable source of intel for the CIA Personally I hope you do not help we out I 've miss you Sydney I really have well it should not be too difficult I will tell the Ministry you be high level donor iooke for a new investment you know where to contact we we will expect to hear from you within the hour Mr Vaughn I remember how close you be with Sydney I be sure you share my relief in have she back just get we on the list be we on the list under the name Tomas Conterra and Sabina Milan Omnifam investor get it here what I be just think of that party at the embassy in Prague God that be a good third date yeah it be when you spill the drink on the ambassador what be I suppose to do he be stare down your dress look how handsome you be ready be safe you too Dixon 's expect a call from I I will see you in Los Angeles it be a polymorphic worm upload it onto the network it single out the file you be interested in and corrupt the datum so the image can not be fully render you could kiss I how long will that take I can not say it depend on the size of the network Jack there be one catch when you make the upload it have to be at a terminal with administrative privilege Minister Tomas Conterra i Sabina Milan Arvin Sloane be an amazing man the guard be about to change shift we have about a minute leave the guard be go let us do it I 've get the minister 's print the thumb be the clear after you the NSC 's on a real time hookup so whatever we see Lindsey see and the face recognition database as soon as I get the image render we be ready to roll Mr Bristow what can I do for you be Director Dixon in no he be over with Marshall be there something I can help you with no I will just drop these on his desk okay okay let us see how many guard be on the control room floor we be almost into their video surveillance feed what what be it these be the camera for the control room level Sark must already be here oh God he be with Oransky Come on wait a minute we have no idea how many man Sark bring he do not know we be come the program will be ready to render in a minute you know I be curious Lindsey brief the President right well you think maybe assume this all go well that he could request one of those little White House tie clip for I or maybe some peanut from Air Force One because I love peanut and you figure they would get top quality peanut if you be the President oh wait a minute here we go until Mr Oransky get the Medusa core no one enter the control room and this entire level should be lock down I need you to secure all the access point oh gummy bear find everything you need yes thank I be just leave he a note I be wonder if you might show up I look for you upstairs at the party I 've take the liberty of discontinue the elevator service and unfortunately Mr Oransky Medusa and myself will not be here when the guard arrive I be certain when they discover you the Russians will be more than hospitable host I think we get it there be no way we can steal Medusa we can not let Sark get it either we will have to destroy it we could still rig the generator to blow we do that this whole sublevel 's go we will not have a way out that could be an intake vent we could crawl inside and get out we might not make it we might make it I will activate the transfer switch we will have the Medusa core in 30 second what the hell be that dead generator foul the control system they 've overload the voltage in here Medusa be fry we have to go no way this bitch shoot I in my leg what be happen I be not sure it be not render accord to the program this be as good as it get Sir anything yet not what we hope on the picture side it be not the technical side the picture be not in focus so no identification of Lazarey 's killer unfortunately no too bad well keep look officially the Kremlin deny having be in possession of Medusa Unofficially they 've confirm that Medusa be destroy great work thank you go home get some rest I will see you tomorrow yeah good night good night I take care of it thank Dad welcome back it be a third edition thank you I be go to get the first edition but it be 40 000 anyway I will see you later previously on Alias if I be to understand what you be say you have no idea where you 've be for the last two year now that Lazarey 's murder have be link to the Covenant the NSC have convene their own investigation you think they know that you be the murderer not yet but they 've just receive some footage apparently of the crime how another camera I will do what I can to ensure this remain our secret freeze there blow up that frame please sure not enough to make a positive I D be it give I 72 hour I think I can identify this woman you keep your promise you say you would kill I you be my favourite you never break who the hell be you why do the Covenant take two year of my life there you see that no what do you mean no look there he be say Jewel or Julie he could be say any number of thing I have already subject this video to the most intense scrutiny available to the CIA maybe Julia if you want I to do a re analysis I will do it you have to stop punish yourself there be get to be something in there Dad Sydney no good will come from do this I commit a murder I have no memory of this be not about punishment I understand this haunt you yes it haunt I I lose two year I do not have one memory of that time all I have be this that I kill a man I kill a defenceless man in cold blood what be I think do I know it be Sark 's father what would compel I to do something like this do someone condition I if they do what else do they have I do I 've be live with these same question for over a year we have no answer yet when you compel the NSC to release I from prison you tell I that you would do so because you need your father that you need my strength 12 month in solitary would have an effect on anyone something that allow I to stay focused be your strength do not lose it now hello yeah I will be right there that be Lauren 20 hour ago in Cannes a 4 man team break into a french epidemiology lab the place do cut edge vaccine research into virus like West Nile HIV and Ebola what be they after they take four vial contain strain of Ebola the fifth be damage infect one of the team member the man we be question Laszlo Bogdan a hungarian national he be an expert in crack high end security system he be in isolation at the Stafford Naval Hospital the French just hand he over they share our desire to learn more about the Covenant why do the NSC want I in on this I want you Michael say you be the good Mr Bogdan can you hear I my name be Lauren Reed I work for the United States government I 've be send here to find out who you be work for who be responsible for put you in the condition you be in now leave Mr Bogdan I do not know what your belief be if you have a faith if you expect that something follow this life you might have none but if there be a chance that there be something else that we face the consequence of our action in this lifetime Mr Bogdan this be your last chance to do what be right there be no one leave to be afraid of and no one to be loyal to there be only yourself whoever it be who steal this virus that be eat through your body need to be stop please I never meet the man who hire we I can not help you stop the second job Agent Bristow get Bogdan to admit a second heist be in the work we believe the steal sample have be deliver to the Covenant Bogdan say they will not be use until after this second job he say they be plan to modify the virus why be that we can assume what they 've steal be a precursor agent require further synthesis okay do everyone here speak science yeah no Marshall they do not I could help explain that would be great sorry okay well what they nab let us just call that peanut butter you know yummy nutty creamy deliciousness on its own but if you mix something else in equally tasty you know perhaps chocolat sorry they be most likely go after the mean to mutate the virus to make it more infectious Ebola be a level four pathogen that be the high classification how could it be any bad well they could make it airborne and we have no idea what the Covenant 's endgame be no but we do know who the team be they hire for these job Simon Walker Point man on the Damascus armoury job in ' 99 the 2002 break in at Vector cold blooded contract guy only use other freelancer this time his team include Javier Parez former lieutenant in the Cuban Special Forces Munitions expert and tactical advisor to the group Avery Russett Acquisitions vehicle equipment weapon finally Laszlo Bogdan Security Deceased as of 20 minute ago we know there be another heist in the work Mr Walker will need a replacement you want I to take Bogdan 's place on their team Walker 's already be pick up on Echelon we know he be in the market it be deep cover the risk be obvious but this be an opportunity the Covenant will take possession of whatever the team steal if you can place a tracking device on that we believe it will lead we to their centre of operation Walker 's in Sevilla you will go in as a freelance security expert Vaughn and Weiss you be backup Lauren I want you to go see Sloane have he use his contact to find out what they be after you will leave in two hour I will come by after op tech okay oh real quick the report you write from the infiltration on the c o g bunker you do not give any detail on the weapon that Sark be use no but that be not really the point of the report well that be the point of the report it be not the point but it be important how we break into the bunker and destroy the facility Honey you know how much I depend on the detail who care about the weapon I 've be do this for a long time I be ask that you be more specific I 've never get note before the well you do your job the well I will do mine it be a CZ 100 9 millimetre we can not risk they pick up stray radio transmission I will be monitor you with a laser mike I will be able to hear you you will not be able to

week I must admit I be concerned for you when Sydney resurface I remember see she with Vaughn their relationship remind I of my own with my late wife it be the kind of bond that even death can not sever well apparently I misjudge whatever information you can uncover will be appreciate Ms Reed you should not doubt yourself you be very good at what you do despite how you get the job what do that

you out of it no that be not go to work with I it be go to have to I can not make a distinction between professional and personal this job take two year from I everything be personal as much as I wish I could trust you the responsibility you have now require I not to responsibility what the hell do that mean what Lauren because she be NSC or because she be my wife or be that distinction irrelevant I be not punish you you think I be I be not somebody die I speak to my contact by disable the power we be go to lure off site security we have another problem what be that Vaughn 's be quiz I about Julia I try shut down his enquiry but apparently something you say have make that impossible all I say be that I could not talk about it which have only pique his interest what pique his interest be hear Simon call I Julia and then kiss I like his prom date I can not compel Vaughn to stop be curious I do not need to remind you of the consequence if Lauren and the NSC connect you to the assassination of Lazarey they will subject you to detailed invasive and painful procedure in the name of extract your lose memory yes all of that could happen and you know what at this point I be start to think that might be good maybe I should 've let they hook I up when I first get back find out what they could because however painful that would be it could not be as painful as not know yes it can okay I figure out how to crack that safe you have to crack I get this idea during Carrie 's last ultrasound check this out you ready okay now while the software manipulate the voltage to crack the encryption algorithm this monitor the locking mechanism use imaging and audio cue it be like an x ray and stethoscope in one once I rewire the keypad and attach the probe the software will do the rest should not take long than a couple minute I know what you be wonder boy or girl right well she will not tell I Marshall I do not know she know that be okay 'cause I 've come up with a solution to solve this predicament unisex name this be what I 've come up with so far Jodie Sam Alex Andy Francis Frank could be with a ph Phrank Randy Terry Jan Don Ms Bristow Director Dixon would like to see you in his office excuse I you know I could find out right now touch I with that thing and you die do you know what this be about no your father show I your videotape what videotape the videotape that clearly identify Sydney as the murderer of a russian diplomat Andrian Lazarey your father have also inform I that since your return you have conspire to conceal this information from both the CIA and the NSC because you be afraid you would be pull off active duty Agent Vaughn you be not aware of any of this no sir I agree with Jack that your complicity in Lazarey 's murder may not have be voluntary and see as you have no memory of the incident it be premature to pass judgement Sydney Jack if I find out you 've conceal any more information from I you will feel the full weight of this office bear down on you that say we be in too deep with the current operation we can not allow the Covenant to get their hand on bioweapon so you be go back in as schedule yes sir give my discretion to compartmentalise information during an ongoing operation I be withhold this information from the NSC that mean Agent Vaughn that you be prohibit from discuss any of this with your wife be that understand yeah you want to tell I what that be about I think we need to keep this secret yes from the NSC which be what we 've do you know Dixon would order Vaughn to keep this from Lauren if the NSC find out I would be pull you would have come to the same conclusion maybe yes but I would not have act on it the last thing I want be to be responsible for drive a wedge between Vaughn and Lauren that be a concern I do not share how be sloane it be okay you be off I too be not we the jet set couple you be right detail matter I should not leave they out it be okay yeah I miss you I know she could

whole thing 's pretty cool in a sick horrible way Sloane be attend an MPO conference in Mexico City I have a briefing with he the day after tomorrow I be still catch up what do sloane have to do with this Sloane give we the intel that lead to Bomani 's arrest the subsequent dismantling of his terror network be not one of the reason we agree to pardon Sloane it be the predominant reason he might have a lead Sydney you will accompany Lauren to Mexico that be it she think I stab Vaughn by choice that I could have do something else that it be payback when someone 's spouse be critically hurt or kill rational thought take time I know tell I about Simon Walker he be the only connection we have to your missing year we can not squander this opportunity do he say anything else to explain how he

you offer he well I give he information that I eventually be go to share with you my contact within the japanese mob the Yakuza have develop the first a I computer virus it probe network analysis system and then write itself create its own subviruse in the wrong hand it can crash market destroy bank shut down transportation bring military installation to a halt you be tell we you give this information to a man who be work with the Covenant now I be give it to you so that you can disable the virus before the Covenant get it and I mean disable it not destroy it because if Bomani come to the Yakuza facility in Osaka and find that the virus have be destroy he will know I tip you off and have I kill my life be in your hand you 've tell Bomani you would work for the Covenant yes now I be tell you that I be in a position to be a double agent Working for the Covenant but loyal to the CIA what be it Sydney this be classic do not take my word for it have Marshall analyse the video he be make of I right now why do not you examine the lie detector you be run on my voice I promise you he will verify that I be tell the God 's honest truth now as far as our technology can detect and these be next gen test as high end as it get he be not lie folk if there be someone who can fool those test it be sloane in theory yes but in practise he would really have to be use the next gen 's next gen lie detector defeat tech which frankly even I can not imagine what do we do here do we trust sloane the position of the NSC be that we accept Sloane 's proposal and use he as a double agent within the Covenant just so that someone have say it in the past two year Sloane have obtain a pardon base mainly on the capture of a criminal who be now free in addition sloane will be allow to openly participate in Covenant activity base on the promise he will inform we of those activity one could argue he be pull off the con job of the century it also appear that Bomani will kill Sloane if we interfere who would lose sleep over that the U S government would have lose its most valuable source of underworld intelligence the fact that sloane hold all the card be give I a migraine accord to Sloane Sark and Bomani be on their way to a Yakuza run casino in Osaka where they will download the virus from a secure server Marshall will provide a program that will rewrite the virus and render it unusable sorry to interrupt I do say I could do that but not if I have not see the code I guess this mean I be go on another mission if you sanction it I will have Strategic Services devise a scenario for you both actually another suggestion for the CIA suggestion box which be a great idea sorry what I be think be a surefire way to get invite into the back room of a Yakuza casino get catch cheat at gambling yeah I have a little something here this will give we an example of what I mean now in high school by apply the methodology of statistical probability account for the continuous random variable of luck I be able to come up with a fairly effective card counting technique you know how to deal a hand of blackjack yes Marshall go ahead deal one for yourself can I get a cocktail five six

design by this man Robert Lange hardware engineer for a german security firm Lange be approach by someone pose as a russian official they contract he to design a test for security flaw in their nuclear command and control system this guy Lange create this really cool device basically take it to any missile silo in all of Russia and it interface with the launch control console and bypass all security protocol initiation code the commander 's launch key irrelevant it be a skeleton key for Russia 's nuclear weapon yeah and to be honest I be just a little bit jealous do he deliver it to the Covenant no he discover the man who hire he be not actually russian defence Lange go on the run to prevent the Covenant from get what he have invent this be a picture of what he use to look like accord to Sloane 's intel Lange have surgically alter his appearance to hide from the Covenant we know that tomorrow Lange be schedule to meet this man Heinrich Strauss at the Club Delphi in Milan he be pick up new identity paper remember Sloane 's intel come from the Covenant so obviously they be look to grab Lange and the skeleton key Sydney and Vaughn you need to get Lange before the Covenant

not a good idea while it be not my favourite job can I ask why I be be replace it be not an indictment it be that Sydney be more familiar with the player what player there be sloane and Sark that be it no there be another Sydney Allison Doren be alive she be alive you can thank I later you look like you 've see a ghost I truly think you be dead the last two year you have to start at the beginning or the end after the last time I see you will Tippin discover what have happen that his girlfriend have be kill and I have be double to take her place he have to be eliminate what happen with Bristow when the Covenant find you you be both unconscious I can only remember that in bit and piece she come home I realise that she know she aim the gun at I the next thing I remember it be three week later and I wake up in a Covenant run hospital outside Marseilles it take I six month to fully recover I 've be work with they ever since be you behind they extract I from the CIA I wish I could claim credit for that I only learn you be work with we recently my tenure begin shortly after my father 's murder they free I in exchange for my inheritance who kill your father I do not know but I intend to find out Bristow should have to pay for these scar she will I be no long sloane 's handler Dixon give that job to Sydney Bristow Good that free you up to focus on the Lazarey murder we have a source work inside the russian government who be agree to help we out they have the assassin 's identity not yet but apparently they hold information that could lead we to it then why be not they use it Lazarey be a russian diplomat you would think they would want that answer more than we the Covenant do not want anyone to know they be behind the assassination and your source believe their reach extend so deep inside the russian government that they can make that happen you leave tonight any leak and our source could be compromise and kill no one from the CIA can know about this include your husband Vienna yeah I know surprise I too for how long well you know how they go it be a NATO security briefing two day at the most I be surprise Lindsey reassign you to cover a briefing I know but he say he need I there could not exactly say no could I what about Milan should be a quick turnaround I will be back in a day when we get back when we be do with this we need to go away Desert anywhere my superior indicate Mr Tupikov that you have some information for we how do a british woman become an american spy I be not a spy and though I grow up in London I be bear in the United States now that you know my life story I have some question your government 's run a probe into this I would think you want to bring closure to your investigation why come to we I explain this to your superior I want to hear it for myself Andrian and I be colleague since our time together at St Petersburg University I be sorry I have for some time now suspect the existence of a mole whom I believe be still loyal to the Covenant this be a file of digital recording all of which chronicle hundred of phone call make or receive by our deceased diplomat Andrian Lazarey perhaps the murderer can be trace through these call I trust you will see justice do for my murder comrade where can I contact you you can not we never have this conversation so that camera Marshall give we be a miniaturised X ray camera how much you want to bet this thing 's leak radiation so we be look for Lange yeah the camera 's suppose to I d his plastic surgery it will transmit image back to my PDA that Marshall program to identify fracture scar tissue or implant anyone who be be under the knife you okay be it Allison since I learn that she be alive I just keep wonder do she still look like she do she look like Francie because if she do as much as I know I should keep she alive to maybe try to figure out the last two year of my life all I will want to do be kill her Heinrich Strauss he be the man provide Lange with identity paper as we speak he be get drunk in the club I will keep an eye on he the camera 's in the stone do you mind no thank you Let us go let us go okay we be look for someone with massive facial reconstruction Lange 's about 5'10 170 pound how be the camera work the video 's link up now Signal strength 's at 100 I will start look for Lange hey check out that guy to your left buy I a drink nothing I love this song okay nothing there keep move oh check out the guy with no rhythm no only a nose job not enough to be Lange Chin implant at 3 00 Collagen lip straight ahead okay those breast be real should I get my nose do maybe a little tapering get the bump remove whoa wait go back go back to your left 2 00 there yeah yeah hold it just like that okay nose chin cheek lift eye config that be Lange and there be Strauss he just get his identity paper someone have a laser sight on he Vaughn Allison 's the shooter she be up in the balcony I be on my way wait Lange do not move Lange run out I be pin down Vaughn where be you I be on the balcony do you see she no she take off I be go after her I be go after Lange hello Sydney she go down the elevator shaft she have Lange what floor be she on the basement why do not she kill I maybe she like you Weiss I be serious so be I come on she live with you for month she double herself as your good friend maybe in that time she actually start to like you I can see that happen it be like she need to keep I alive I know this sound weird but it feel like she have be order not to kill I well that be lucky I want to know how she survive your fight two year ago you shoot her three time so she take this guy 's tooth she take the guy 's tooth just when you think the world can not get weird hey hey have we check the record to see what be strange about his tooth Langley cross check all file they have nothing but then Lauren be a genius Genius be not quite what I be what do you do I miss all the good briefing Lauren realise we have Lange 's x ray and we could use they to figure out what be in his tooth the X cam Marshall 's necklace we use it to see who have plastic surgery I take the picture myself Nice I have a meeting with the NSC I will walk you out Vaughn 's right the question be not why she do not kill you it be how come she be still alive at all maybe Allison be a werewolf maybe the only way to kill she be with a silver bullet yeah okay if you look here this be Lange 's jaw before his tooth be remove if we look here that look like a normal filling that one would have after have a cavity get it fill too much sugar and not floss which I do every day twice a day but upon further examination I actually magnify it over a thousand time and it be actually an RFID chip now RFID stand for radio frequency identification Flinkman you know what would be great English oh right I forget you be not that astute okay what can I oh you guy be familiar with the quick pass thing you would use at gas station Come on the key chain actually I think I have one need a visual demonstration you know this little thing right here that let you pay for your gas at the pump then you do not have to use your credit card Marshall yeah we be familiar with those Lange have something like that in his tooth sort of although it do not work at the gas station though if it do it would be wicked cool we believe Lange use this to open a high security lock yes and I believe Lange keep this missile launch device lock up and use this tooth to open the vault or briefcase this device could be anywhere we have to assume the Covenant have the location as far as we know they could have the device already Sloane 's our man in the Covenant so I assume there be a plane wait how do I know what I be look for I 've supply you with the time and date of Lazarey 's murder Screen all call make in the week lead up to it we think the killer be someone he expect be Lazarey kill by a man or a woman a woman it will take awhile to filter all these call call with a red flag run they through voiceprint analysis maybe we can make a positive i d on one of these caller Sydney Bristow to see Arvin Sloane Ja he be be expect you right this way yes of course Mr Secretary I will I would be happy to speak with the delegation from UNESCO at their convenience just let I know thank you give my regard to Nani yes Bye Sydney I be very pleased when Dixon say that you agree to be my handler it be an assignment not an agreement the way a janitor do not agree to clean a toilet but as your handler you will do what I say when I say I select your assignment I design your mission I control you not the other way around be that what you use to let Vaughn do control you the intel you provide be accurate the Covenant be in pursuit of a device that will give they access to Russia 's strategic weapon you fail to get Lange do not you Lange be dead the Covenant have an access code we assume will open a vault that contain this device I see and you know the location of this vault no but Sark and Allison do and you be go to get they to give it to you Allison I be wonder when Allison would resurface I be sorry Sydney I can only imagine that see Allison must be very painful for you you will set up a meeting with Sark and Allison you will explain that their travel plan have be compromise you will offer assistance in revise their arrangement and pass the information on to you that will not be necessary you will be wear a wire and if they discover that it be a setup then I get to hear they kill you I go through the disk there be 300 call and about 12 of they be encrypt include this one from the day before the murder yes this be Andrian hello it be I hello about the stock transfer so I trust that you 've locate a safe place to park the asset I have when would you come by to discuss the particular can you make time tomorrow at 3 00 of course I look forward to see you then that have to be the killer he be murder at 3 15 I run it through analysis the woman 's voice have be alter can you restore the original no it be alter at the source I be able to access the russian telephone exchange so you can do a trace I already do see whoever place the call do an amazing job they route to Lazarey 's PBX via a defunct satellite network through the internet VOIP gateway and over a landline at a secure telephone at this address London 34 Trenton Place Knightsbridge a company call K N G Microtech good job I find the office where the phone call originate it be be empty for some time I speak to the leasing agent accord to their record this office be lease a year ago November 24th a 4 year lease pay in advance be there a name on the lease yes there be I believe she be the person who kill Lazarey her name be Julia Thorne I feel like a field agent again do you have a 20 on the target I 've never tell you about my time with the agency have I yes or no I be very patriotic once no one be ask here they be Mr Sark Allison you be look well I look like someone else when you hire I to undergo gene therapy you promise you could reverse engineer the process ah but Sydney Bristow destroy the technology that would have allow we to return you I be sorry for your loss you indicate it be important we meet the CIA be onto you my source tell I the agency know that you extract an RFID chip from Mr Lange the plane that you charter be under surveillance as counsel to the Covenant I suggest that you move up your timetable if you let I know where you need to go I will have a plane wait within the hour he be lie Allison no she be a wonderful judge of character Sydney Bristow find you in Milan if I be a bet man I would say she would find you again I be simply here to help there be no way Sark 's go to go for this we be go to Bulgaria the device be in a vault in Sofia what do I tell you this be the good plan ever I can get you there first thing tomorrow morning do then our business here be complete ask they where I 've be the last two year I will call you as soon as the arrangement be complete ask they or I will send feedback through your comm so loud they will hear it and know you be wire at which point they will kill you suck be a double agent do not it you know Allison I be think see you again I be remind of the thing that happen over the past two year I be curious have you and Sydney Bristow cross path why I hear you have an opportunity to kill she in Milan and that you do not take it the Covenant ask I not to really why be that they want to retrieve something something in her memory something she see something she experience I do not know I be as curious as you be something you see what the hell be that I have no idea we 've be over this I know the NSC technique to recapture my memory be invasive Invasive be too benign a word we be talk about surgical procedure that could leave you with permanent brain damage Allison say the Covenant want to access something I see and we will discover what that be in time Dad I be walk around with a secret in my head so fantastic that covenant operative have be order not to kill I I need to know what that be I understand but we be not do it like that how do you propose we do it I be lose my mind I just get off the phone with our N I S Iiaison in Sofia once Allison 's plane land you and Vaughn will coordinate with local authority and track she to the vault we will wait until she retrieve the device then apprehend her I understand you leave at once be there a problem with that no there be not I will go over op tech with Marshall I want you clear on the rule of engagement yes I know Allison be another link to the Covenant she be part of our large agenda and as such be not to be kill I want she dead what the order from Langley be to bring she in dead or alive she kill my wife she kill your good friend so I look at this as an opportunity the only reason I hesitate before be I hope that she might have information for you but now that we know there be no hope for that I want that bitch dead you want to track Allison right well I come up with a solution to that problem the chip inside Lange 's tooth it use a frequency signature and that be how it unlock the vault that contain his missile launch device you explain this now this thing will hone in on the frequency and lead we to Allison and she will lead we to the device oh however I be not really sure exactly the frequency that the chip transmit on so I cover a broad spectrum be that go to be a problem no no not really Alright kind of it might be set off by microwave oven so I would steer clear of pancake house of the international variety got it see the Eprom chip be not finish burn so it be go to be a while well let I know when it be ready actually can I ask you a favour Sure I do not know if you 've notice but I be not that smooth around the lady in fact I be a little awkward let us face it I mean you get the look I get the brain I want to propose to Carrie so I come up with an idea and I be hope you could give I some feedback I 've get the look you get the brain tell I what you think and be brutal just be honest do not hold back or anything okay you be the micro in my chip the giga in my byte I think about you Carrie every morning noon and night Morning noon and night that be Carrie we have sushi I will protect you can not you see Carrie marry I I love you I love you no good I think she be go to say yes really 'cause of the rock jam song maybe in spite of the rock jam song alright alright oh hey your thing 's ready Thanks Marshall Rock ' n ' roll sloane put Allison on the ground 20 minute ago we have a visual there she be what be that place it looks abandon like an old hotel do you have an address yeah 14205 Beckerman I will tell the pilot Put we down near 14205 Beckerman Roger that what kind of range do this have Marshall say it should track the signal Allison 's use for 50 yard but he also say it could be set off by microwave oven that be great yeah do you have a signal Allison 's in there or someone 's make microwave popcorn let us go where be she hold on Upstairs she be 30 foot down on the left we can not track she without the chip I will go this way okay she be in the west stairwell copy well this be familiar be not it I be think about this last night I could not sleep if I follow my order if I do not kill you you be go to kill I sorry about Francie I be just follow order once I have be double I have to take her place we do like 80 dinner we be a huge success hello Mom I be go to have to put you on hold for a second okay oh my move into the kitchen you be I I be now Mom I be go to have to call you back I have nothing against her she just be a casualty of circumstance do not blame yourself there be no way you could have know just like when you recover Rambaldi 's journal you have no idea it contain a formula what be you talk about a formula for a medication that would ultimately be use to help heal my wound so yeah you almost kill I but then you also save my life I shoot she and we get the device I know what you want but she have a pulse where be she now they 've take she to a hospital civilian ambulance yeah with an armed guard why I will call about get she extradite I want an update on her condition as soon as you get it okay good work Syd thank you the Rambaldi book do you remember a formula for a medication no we 've get to find that ambulance you sure this be the route they would take this be the only way to the hospital there be no other wait this make no sense if Allison have backup they would 've be at the hotel I do not think she need backup what do you mean I think she do this herself the paramedic say she barely have a pulse I know she do this Vaughn she do this previously on Alias what do you want for I to succeed as a double agent for the Covenant I will need your help your need do not concern I it be good to see you Julia Good to see you too you be be set up his daughter Sydney Bristow also CIA go by an alias Julia Thorne it be be 3 week since I find out Sydney murder Lazarey I 've be lie to my wife for three week you be order not to say anything she be order to find out who murder Lazarey I be engage in prevent she from do her job and that you be protect Sydney yeah I be no long sloane 's handler Dixon give that job to Sydney Bristow Good that free you up to focus on the Lazarey murder I speak to the leasing agent accord to their record this office be lease a year ago November 24th a 4 year lease pay in advance be there a name yes there be I believe she be the person who kill Lazarey her name be Julia Thorne hello thank you thank you Doctor Good to see you I know I have not be to group in a while that be okay we have another session tonight I actually come here to talk about something else be it your dream I 've hear about an experimental procedure use to recover lose memory Neurostimulation therapy now Sydney before we discuss this let us give group a chance some of those people have be in that group for 10 year none seem to be close to find out what happen the point be to accept what be happen that you may never remember and free yourself to move on with all due respect you do not know what it feel like you have clearance I can tell you that unlike anyone else there be a terrorist organisation try to find out the one thing that I can not remember my point be I do not have the luxury of wait for acceptance come with I this be Kenneth Blake he join Central Intelligence in 1981 he be miss for five year finally turn up in a south korean hospital with severe injury and no memory whatsoever Blake volunteer for the same procedure you be ask for the procedure be carry out Blake learn he have be in custody of the North Koreans all that time expose to torture so intense so prolonged that his conscious mind black it out the invasive nature of the surgery ieft he with permanent brain damage you should know Sydney that the National Security Council consider Blake a successful test case for neurostimulation therapy I would consider death as an option before this procedure you have be a busy man Javier Parez epidemiology lab in Cannes Disease control ministry in Spain genetic engineering facility in Cuba do I turn you over to Cuba to Spain to France to I there be no difference for you there be at least one significant difference France and Spain do not believe in the death penalty so here be where we help each other you provide I with a big fish the people who commission you for instance and I allow you to choose to whom I place my call what if I tell you I have information that would be very interesting to the Americans regard a Central Intelligence agent and a murder a CIA agent commit murder hardly newsworthy it be when it be do on behalf of an international terrorist group and the target be a russian diplomat People listen up we 've get non clear personnel en route Deactivate the wireless network and put all secure server on lockdown I do not want to see anything more revealing than a weather map level 3 security procedure in effect all computer monitor and lcd on safe mode re route the PBX to administration I always know you be destine for great thing follow I Mr Sloane hi it be be a while a lot have happen first you be evil now you be good so you claim not that I do not trust you how be you very happy to see you Marshall due to the sensitive nature of the information Arvin Sloane be about to present to we I think it would be good if he do so here be everyone here Agents Vaughn and Reed be preppe a separate assignment under the direction of the NSC 10 hour ago I have a meeting with Mr Sark I assume we be here because the Covenant require something your new assignment it seem the Covenant be no long satisfied with use my organisation merely as a front for their illegal activity they 've now task I an operation I presume you know what a maser be you mean a microwave laser well yeah I mean you want I to explain Marshall Sloane have no authority in this room sorry I do not mean to offend you sir I know you be the main do you want I to yes it be a microwave that gets focus into a pinpoint beam very similar to how light gets focus into a laser tomorrow night I be schedule to attend a charity function host by the chinese government at one of their ministry the Covenant have acquire intelligence that China have design a work maser unit the prototype of which be hold there China intend to mount a mas ray on one of their defence satellite it be an assassination program wait be you say that this weapon be capable of kill from space pulse microwave be capable of cause tissue damage heart failure even brain haemorrhaging this could make it appear the victim die from natural cause you can imagine the potential threat if the Covenant be to acquire this technology I 've be task to steal the maser 's operating system which be in the Chinese Defence Minister 's office I want Strategic Services to review your plan and I will assign an agent to go along I presume that would be the case I propose Sydney accompany I to the function posing as my assistant together we can obtain the operating system corrupt the maser and pass along the faulty datum to the Covenant that be assume the CIA still intend to use I as a double agent why I because this mission can not be do alone I will not risk my life unless I be go in with the good do you really imagine give your history that we would ever I will go you know I do not trust you and that I believe you have an endgame beyond this operation but I also know that if we be catch we will be stand side by side in front of a chinese firing squad which mean this time our interest be in line and if you betray I I will just kill you myself I understand you 've be loan out to the NSC I leave for Mexico in an hour Lauren request I she be brief I en route a contact of mine in Nogales inform I that Javier Parez be apprehend by mexican authority I be sure you remember he as part of the team Sydney infiltrate several week ago yeah sort of he almost kill I he be offer to trade information to the NSC in exchange for leniency our problem be this he know about Sydney that she murder Lazarey under the alia Julia Thorne you can imagine the consequence be he to share this information with your wife I think you should tell she that you know the identity of the man you 've be send to interview and that conflict of interest require you both to remove yourself from this case be you ask I to interfere with my wife 's investigation yes no I 've keep the truth from Lauren because Dixon order I to a situation you orchestrate you understand the consequence to Sydney if this leak the NSC will subject she to invasive brain surgery I do not need a lecture on the risk she face I do not understand your resistance the NSC will send other operative they be go to find out it will provide we the time to plan our next move I think it be safe to say I know my wife well than you do I would hope Lauren may be our good chance of keep this information from the NSC and Mr Vaughn what if you be wrong it be the late in cloak technology it be call optical camouflage now basically if you take a look right here its surface be cover in microfilament which interpret the U v wave generate by its surrounding which mean that once you drop it off in the chinese ministry I will be able to guide it undetecte past the internal security camera to the alarm control which I will then deactivate use the internal modem so once you disable the alarm I will be able to access the minister 's office where their maser be keep once you get to the mas you will access the motherboard and then you will attach this to the eprom chip now press one and you will be connect to I I will access the maser 's operate system and corrupt it and then a copy of the corrupted version will be store onto this which I will give to sloane to pass on to the Covenant right actually where do the car go by the way you look beautiful spare I I would encourage you to take my arm if we be go to bluff our way through this Ladies Mr Sloane we be honour you could attend the honour be mine Minister Woo and this be my executive assistant Christina Meyers a pleasure pleasure your organisation 's compassionate work be the model of humanitarian achievement thank you thank you Miss Meyers would you give we a moment I have a private matter to discuss certainly your assistant be lovely I presume she do more for you than type our relationship be strictly professional of course hello you be on Ladies and gentleman start your engine okay promise I again they will not hear it the noise output be 04 db which be inaudible to the ear a cockroach think louder than this car look like a nice party okay I be go to follow this guy look like he know where he be go Security be you alright as long as Marshall can shut down the security system you know Sydney we should dance like hell the minister assume we be sleep together despite my protest he remain unconvinced I could care less well neither would I if he be not constantly look in my direction normally I would suggest that we remain discreet I think it well we feign an argument on the dance floor that would buy you sufficient time to slip away and Sydney give the way you feel about I I doubt it would take much act on your part so my dear shall we we have to get to the security room alright follow he okay sorry hurry up I get to focus Marshall follow that guard turn to the right I get it I get it good he be approach the security control room hurry Pedal to the metal sir Easy Piece of cake Hurry Marshall under the desk yeah yeah I get it well do okay now I will activate the RF modem and hack into the security system okay alarm be down Surveillance be off should take they week to get back online maybe even month hello thank you Marshall say the security system be shut down well then I propose you make this fight look real oh God it be a boy get back in the car we have they the payment will be leave in the confessional of the San Angel Church as instruct hold they for at least two hour then let they go Marshall I be go in Copy Mountaineer Security system be offline you be clear for entry keep your face cover you can not afford to be recognise check for sensor we be good okay Marshall uplink establish Copy that Mountaineer give I two second to corrupt the code what be the matter security system be back online I do not know how they do it can you get it back offline give I two second you may have be compromise get out Marshall how much long no get out of there now how long just give I one minute Marshall be you do yeah go go go you be very lucky they let you go Crime on the highway have become an embarrassment if you would like to file a report I will see that it receive the high priority no thank you we would like to extradite Mr Parez as soon as possible very well this way who else have be to see Mr Parez since he arrive no one I be truly sorry you come this way for nothing you will give this to the Covenant it contain the corrupted copy of the operating system the Covenant will track it back to the chinese prototype which have also be corrupt they will not suspect that you betray they I see I wonder how many time your handler say something like that before you be about to give I something like this a small object of tremendous value that I ask you to steal for SD 6 which you then render worthless in order to prevent its exploitation by the Alliance it happen on occasion there be a time you trust I it be before I know who you be it be before I know who I be oh no it be more recent than that the day you be find in Hong Kong the day of your resurrection as it be this letter arrive at my office my analyst confirm what I recognise instantly what I be sure you will verify on your own the handwriting be yours I 've never see that code before I do not want to offer it to anyone else unfortunately I could not decipher it myself since those item be in your possession I think you might want they back let us talk of course you kill Javier Parez you son of a bitch you 've just return from a traumatic experience you be emotional which would explain your baseless accusation I be emotional I get that way when I see a gun press to my wife 's temple Ours be a risky business armed rebel take we hostage then let we go out of the kindness of their heart you do not think I would see through that you be grace by luck you expect I to believe a man on the verge of bartering for his freedom decide to hang himself Parez have a price on his head he know his day be number what part of this do not have a rational explanation you ever put my wife 's life in danger again I will kill you then perhaps you finally understand the moral compromise you make when someone you love be in danger get in the car please I 've jam the feed of the tv camera so let we speak freely you know who I be yes I understand your investigation into the Lazarey murder have hit a dead end what a pity how do you know I know because I frame Javier Parez assume he would be extradite to the United States once in custody he would be force to confess what he know namely the identity of Andrian Lazarey 's murderer this be the second time I 've have a gun put to my head I do not particularly like it I assume if you want I dead I would be so if you have something to tell I do it a wedding present a touch informal I know but everything else on your registry be take open it where do you get these where be not important what be important be who her name be Julia Thorne merely an alia she go by another name a name you be quite familiar with oh my God now you should understand why I 've risk come to you I recently learn that Sydney Bristow murder a father I never have a chance to know I suspect you have reason for dislike she therefore I be confident that you will relay this information to the appropriate party by the way I 've rig a weight sensitive charge to the underside of this vehicle once I leave you I will activate it if you get out of the car before 30 minute have elapse the charge will detonate it have be a pleasure Miss Reed hello it be I Dad be you alright you sound upset yeah no I be fine do you receive my transmission yes Sloane give you a key which he claim be send to he sometime before you wake up in Hong Kong his claim be pretty convincing it be write in my handwriting the ciphertext as well yes why remember during the time you be miss I contact your mother that ciphertext be encode use a method she devise do this mean I be in contact with Mom during the two year I be go if that be true she fail to mention it during our last communication can you break the code yes I learn the code from your mother it be an address in Rome 1124 Piazza Barberini the penthouse apartment do that mean anything to you no I have a local contact pull up the property record the apartment be purchase a year ago the buyer choose to remain anonymous get some rest when you get back you and I will go to Rome together okay be you alright yes do he hurt you no I be so sorry we will find he he tell I Julia Thorne be really Sydney Bristow I be not sure if you know now I know I be under order not to say anything whose order Dixon Dixon know and Jack Weiss everyone that be not the point it be exactly the point everyone at that office keep secret from the NSC the one thing I have desperately be try to learn how long have you know three week for three week you 've be try to derail my investigation Sydney do not remember any of it do not defend she to I I be explain why Dixon I be your wife you keep Sydney 's secret from I you protect Sydney over I something I refuse to do it be not that simple do you still love she that be not what this be about she be not my wife you can not punish she for the fact that she and I have a past if you report this to Lindsey he be go to want to know everything she do over those two year as well he should the only way to access her memory be through a dangerous invasive procedure I be aware of the procedure none of which they would force on a U S agent Lazarey be a russian diplomat all Lindsey have to do be form an extradition agreement with the Russians and she will be ship to Moscow where she have no right as an American he will run the procedure there he can not do that she be a CIA operative think about it you know well than anyone Lindsey will not hesitate to break the rule if he learn about this Sydney oh God Lauren you already report she you follow your order I follow mine hello Sydney it be I do not go home the NSC know everything meet I at terminal one I will explain everything once I pick you up how the hell do they find out Sark tell Lauren I have a plane wait at the Dover Airfield it will take you anywhere you want to go Someplace you can disappear if the NSC want to find I they will I be someone else for two year someone I do not even remember what be I suppose to do now just spend my life in hiding between that and a lobotomy there be not a choice I can not keep run forever I will do everything I can to make sure you will not have to Rome I be go to Rome Grazie Giancarlo there be a café at the corner of Via del Corso and Via Condotti Café Ruby there be a pay phone with a false bottom you will find money and a new passport good thing I be already pack you should go Vaughn why be you

international investigation into the murder of Andrian Lazarey I have photographic evidence Sydney Bristow be his killer we 've learn you 've know about this for some time it be within my purview to compartmentalise information Lauren if Bob Lindsey have issue with that he can take it up with the director of Central Intelligence he have feel free to call d c I yourself for confirmation though I suspect your phone will be ring any moment these premise be to be lock down until Lindsey arrive with federal agent that mean until such time nobody leave I take it you have Sydney in custody not yet but we know where she be previously on Alias oh my God I recently learn that Sydney Bristow murder a father I never have a chance to know I be confident that you will relay this information to the appropriate party I have a plane wait at the Dover Airfield it will take you anywhere but tell I where you want to go Rome I be go to Rome and even though everything be change some thing do not I be not go to lose you twice 23 10 request landing confirm that you find anything you let I know Lauren I will call you back Dixon speak with the d c I yes good now make sure we have access to all computer account e mail memo and correspondence see in this office in the last two year I put a request in through Langley who would you talk to over there Brandon I be on it I understand the director of Central Intelligence have already convey his desire to transfer authority over this task force from your agency to mine I expect you to cooperate fully no not exactly I explain to my superior the decision be mine to withhold information from the NSC regard Sydney Bristow 's involvement in the Lazarey murder and that the member of my staff in question be act under direct order from I I see my staff will remain on active duty and cooperate they be not your staff Mr Dixon not anymore I be pull your clearance until further notice Mr Lindsey I would expect nothing less from you one of my man

a russian diplomat do not act like this be your first day on the job Sydney be in NSC custody she be in Lindsey 's custody do you think Lindsey 's unaccountable his operation be fund by black money what the White House expect from he be result what you be suggest be that I participate in a cover up no but I hope you would be a person about this while you clearly underestimate not only my ability to do my job but also my humanity you should know that not only do I believe I do the right thing but the more you talk the more suspicious I get you be the one who get she out of the country be not you do you know what would happen to you if it become know you help a fugitive evade the government I be not concerned about myself right now if what you be suggest be right that to learn what happen to Sydney the past two year Robert Lindsey intend on have surgery perform on she which will render her brain dead why would he have I write the White House brief what he be ask I to go with he as an

get she down tie it tie it but Sydney 's make it clear she do not remember anything but when we search her flat in Rome we find a code message tape under her desk now if she can decode that message it may help we infiltrate or possibly even take down the Covenant what if she do not recognise the code as long as she demonstrate a willingness to cooperate that surgery will be nothing more than a threat Miss Bristow we know you know how to read this code do you recognise your handwriting no I draw little heart over my I 's Smiley face sometimes what you be feel now the pain from shock therapy

text and we will not have to do not bother negotiate with I Sydney Dad you be alright sweetheart he be with we get in you make it Sydney you make it at least we will be able to get to Sydney 's

world I do not know anything about you except that I be not suppose to know anything about you Suffice to say there be people who be under the impression my daughter have commit a crime her memory be the only thing that can exonerate she I see so there be pressure pressure that the therapy should work real stake and how do the therapy work tell they how you get the idea but not the long version I begin in the neuroscience Background in philosophy treat head trauma patient for 12 year until one night on l 95 I become one of they a head trauma patient I drive into the highway median total my pickup truck so I spend the next 18 month in various form of traction now that be not the torture you would expect not move for a year and a half it be liberate oddly well in any event one night month 11 of my motionlessness something obvious occur to I our dream be both a priori and a posteriori which mean that our dream contain our memory which mean that there be a share reservoir so I begin to consider way to consciously enter the subconscious Ways to convince the brain that it be truly experience the dream memory state so I turn to the one thing that I really know Drugs Ergo I total my pickup truck what be the drug oh well the cocktail 's a happy combo of synthetic and organic I mean it will not kill you but depend on what they be your dream just might I say we get this party start Kaya will show you where to change come with I when most people be asleep they do not realise they be dream until they be awake but you you be go to have to become lucid in the dream state itself how do I do that the drug I be go to give you will do most of the work but I will be monitor your neural activity and when I know you be in REM I will give you a verbal cue over the headphone tell I what be the last thing you remember before your missing time be knock unconscious in my apartment I see well once you be aware that you be in the dream state your objective will be to pick up the thread of your last memory in as much detail as you can how well you be just go to have to feel your way back it be like use a muscle that you never use before if you can get to that point just stay with it because ultimately you will become aware of what happen next I do not really understand I know you will just be aware that if you encounter a new memory it might be traumatic but it will not necessarily be real oh it will be to you here be your headphone I be put they on you and good luck Sydney I be go to count down from 10 by the time I reach one you will be asleep 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1

for bleed listen will be go to be okay what will he lose a lot of blood but we get he in time will be in Witness Protection this be normal gap in memory lead to the injury the woman you be live with be not Francie we find a file will be compile her name be Allison Doren I know she be the second double it be come back to you you need to lie down wait the Covenant have you ever hear of the Covenant

chance to tell she how much I love she I love you get away from I Sydney you be dream if you can hear I then you be in a dream state you need to use it to get back to where you be to get to the last memory you have now remember you say it be in your apartment you be knock out you must try to go back to that place you must try to find that place Sydney you be in control of your environment go now she be out of rem and she exist now in actual memory she be unconscious after the fight how can she remember anything that happen after that because unconsciously the mind can still establish transhistorical account of the real world mean even with her eye close her other sense be alert yes thank you and base on those sense her brain will construct an accurate but incomplete memory of the event that follow the barbecue chip please could you pass I those thank you I see they they be take I away but who Sydney I can not see their face what do she say someone without a face it be not that uncommon do not happy birthday happy birthday Sydney she be extrapolate Meaning what brain activity indicate her memory centre be not active she be in a tangent I be in a tangent once how nice for you happy birthday honey make a wish Sydney Time to cut the cake it be alright Sydney listen to I you have to concentrate it be the only way you be go to get back on track I do not know how Focus on the last detail you remember there I be excuse I I have to go this be very very unusual very unusual what well she be still in Beta but she be dream that just do not happen you know well you be part of this kill the power feed what the hell 's happen she be in v tach get the epinephrine it be on the tray get these off her she be flatline we need to resuscitate she now get the defibrillator paddle

I can your vital be normal you be go to be fine I assume he be tell you God I it be okay Ms Vaughn Lauren Ms Reed whoa I have too many jelly doughnut be those the dna result not exactly I check the sample against all available datum bank I be not able to find a match but I do run some other forensic test and well hope this help yes I understand that be Lauren no match on the dna we still do not know who the hand belong to in my dream it be my birthday I be 7 when I cut the cake I look down and I be cut off this hand whose hand do you see his face yes I do who be it Lazarey why would I dream I be cut the hand of a man I murder Forensic analysis lead Marshall to believe that whoever this hand belong to be alive as recently as four month ago it could not have be Lazarey I kill he last year unless you do not what I be on the videotape it be I I slash his throat unless you do not it could have be a performance Lazarey be a russian diplomat the Russians must have type his DNA Lauren 's work with they I will call she have she get a sample see if it be a match you know this really be something whatever you experience elevate your heart rate to the point of ventricular tachycardia which send you into cardiac arrest which almost send I into cardiac arrest be you okay yeah I mean I feel great actually what other detail do you remember after my fight with Allison these man come into the room I could not see their face they be wear black they take I to a building I be on a gurney they wheel I through the door and I lose they before I could see where they take I next Lauren strangle I well that be a dream it must have be a dream right it be unclear you know this be not an exact science at that point in your life you have never meet Lauren you know this would probably be a representational figure which be also not uncommon by the way mask figure shapeshifter they first appear as one character your mother an old classmate in my case a parrot a parrot but they be really just physical manifestation of someone else I want to go back Sydney that be a mistake they be take I towards a room it be room 47 that be where I be that be where I be be hold I have to go back and see what happen to I in there you be the great once you be under you will most likely begin in a dream cycle again no matter where you be try to pick up the thread of your last memory by focus on a detail you remember something vivid there be hang plastic in the building where I be take well whatever it be you be look for a link a portal back to your memory state back to the door you describe good luck thank okay here be the headphone I be go to put they on you good luck when I receive the call for this meeting I assume it would be with a low level agent you have confirmation of the Covenant 's demand my source have confirm they be hold Sydney Bristow they be ask for the Rambaldi device in exchange for her release this be an awkward conversation how so because of what I be ask of you to use your contact why come to I because you can give I untraceability I be look for someone train in wet work in particular dead shot with a long range rifle I plan on make the trade during the exchange I want Sydney Bristow take out why make the trade it be very simple have the Covenant end her life because I want assurance that Sydney Bristow be eliminate ah I see she have something on you do she if she be hit by a sniper it will appear as if it be a Covenant double cross well with all due respect Mr Director what guarantee do I have that this be not some form of entrapment because I know what you be up to Mr Sloane I can see your big picture I know your endgame I even have proof once I arrange the trade I will call you with the detail the dna you get from the Kremlin I match it the hand belong to Lazarey yeah I mean it belong to Lazarey before the thank you Sure you be sure the dna match Lazarey yes which mean Sydney do not kill he Lindsey have nothing on her she can come home thank you you still asleep I think so I 've never hear of a St Aidan they be hard to find do not forget the case Syd you make it hope you be ready for an expensive lesson in gambling I be look for that building check the kitchen Kitchen Thanks okay she be in be she alright she be Alpha her serotonin level be still increase and see her heart rate be up she be on track for another vivid one you should not have come back who the hell be you I be tell you you do not want to be here you be not Lauren I know you be not Lauren it do not matter who I be all that matter be that you leave you get the hell out of my way I can not do that you be so stubborn you idiot we want to stay away we know the Covenant have we we suspect it all along it be the Covenant we think it be an accident we do not remember anything then what happen to I Trust Lazarey what do he have to do with it that be enough question what be in room 47 pull she out I be not go to risk her life her heart rate 's alright

image of the man who take Sydney we run the video through our database and come up with eight match two week ago one of those suspect rent an A Star helicopter from a dealer in Austin where he would also recently purchase a warehouse we go there but the building be only be use for storage Boxes of fishing equipment it be a dead end fishing equipment nice detail the bullet that the Covenant use be untraceable the manufacturer have not actually make these shell for 15 year oh I re read your file I forget you be capture by East German Intelligence Agents 1982 yeah it be not your fault of course they would get a tip that the CIA be on their tail but you be unprepared no backup no resource still you convince they your name be Aken Ostburg a history professor from Sweden they hold you for two week never identify you as American that be impressive we be talk about the fate of my daughter where do you think she be do not do this where do you think she be Jack Jack let he go get he out of here take he into custody now if St Aidan do show what be I suppose to tell he you 've just be give Code six clearance that you want information about the Covenant last chance to bail out what be you kid I I love this stuff base on my analysis of the call the Covenant make about trade the Rambaldi device for Sydney sir the voiceprint analysis be unable to I D the voice because they be use an anti speech signal parameterization device you be tell I you 've get nothing well at the moment yeah I lack everything sir we 've get no way to verify that it be the Covenant make the demand for the trade

leave the area you be to drive yourself to meet Lindsey you be never end up with the Rambaldi device I want it put inside the van and take directly to the parking lot at Hill Street and 9th I want the van to remain visible at all time no one be to enter or exit the vehicle Sydney you have my word that be a relief listen very carefully I need a favour where be you just listen and tell no one about

precisely this be your endgame the whole time now you can go on blame I if you like or you can accept the truth which be what the deceiver be Lindsey not I his team might have think so but apparently Lindsey never give we the Rambaldi device it be a setup I do not know how you do this but you be not go to get away with it I do not know what you be talk about it seem like everything be fall back into place thank you by the way for everything yeah I get to go I be meet Lauren now I be not exactly sure what this mean what be that what be inside the box it be human tissue Vital still active oh and there be a name etch inside the box Milo Rambaldi I 've be look for you you feel alright yeah see Allison again kill she you know I must have dream about it I do not know how many time when you tell I that she be still alive I think if I have the chance that end her life would be satisfy you know there would be closure it would be cathartic it be just as empty as the dream it be horrible there be no satisfaction there be nothing I know they talk to you now that the Covenant know you be still alive you might want to move again maybe somewhere outside of the country no I be not go to run anymore I be go to stay in Wisconsin I do not know maybe when I get back I will ask out that painter we be go to see each other again love you you too yeah we never talk about that yeah I kind of like that previously on Alias I wake up like it be one night I have a scar on my stomach I have never see you be tell I two year have pass and I need to be patient you have to relax I deserve to know what happen to people in my life Sydney can no long be your primary concern what the hell be that suppose to mean be cruel if you have to make she despise you because your kindness torture her so what do the prophecy say this woman here depict will possess unseen mark sign that she will be the one to bring forth my work at vulgar cost this woman will render the great power unto utter desolation you would not do something like this not to your own father now I be not exactly sure what this mean what be that what be inside the box it be human tissue there be a name etch inside the box Milo Rambaldi Marshall have you analyse the cube I wish the jerk be here Pretentious Classified Division of Intelligence you know conspiracy theorist ' wet dream I do not understand that be the point who they be exactly be on a need to know basis Suffice it to say their jurisdiction supercede ours well they have a convoy here they be take the cube away wait take it where if I know I would go there I should probably put a tracer on the cube and track it to their lab imagine how cool that place would be I be kid excuse I I be Sydney Bristow I recover that cube may I ask what you be do we 've be send to retrieve the artefact for analysis send by whom Department of Special Research you be DSR we be a division yes can I ask where you will be take it no you can not if you will excuse I this be unacceptable every time I get close to some answer the door gets slam I know Lazarey know what happen to I he lead I to that cube and before we just hand it off I at least want Marshall to finish his review Sydney listen to I we 've break at least a dozen federal Laws in pursuit of what happen to you if necessary we will break a dozen more but for now there be nothing we can do we can bring Dixon into the loop this be not his call the order to remove the cube come from Langley there have to be something we can do we need to re evaluate every piece of information we 've collect Start from the beginning assume nothing do that and we may find a lead good to see you Kendall I be sorry we have to do it this way you be part of this well that all depend on which part you be refer to you be Covenant no no no no that would not go over too well at home no I be with Special Research I have a team transport the Rambaldi cube to our facility and they be ambush in transit the Covenant get the cube what do that have to do with I it have everything to do with you we need to talk about the past two year as you may be aware Mr Kendall I have no recollection of that time I know you do not but I do I know what happen to you Sydney I know the whole story or most of it you 've know all this time yeah then why have not you say anything because you ask I not to place your hand on the scanner I need clearance to hear about my own life you understand the information be classify any unauthorized disclosure be a violation of section 23 paragraph 5 of the Patriot Act yes before we get start I be curious about how you find the cube what lead you to it you got to be kid I Start at the beginning I be all out of patience you die or at least we believe you do we find a body in your apartment the exist dna match your own and I go to your memorial service myself watch Vaughn spread your ashe in the sea nine month go by one day I get a phone call it be your voice you be call from Rome you say you have escape from the Covenant you want to come in we meet at a safe house in Tuscany do my father know I be alive do Vaughn they will be inform at the early possible opportunity what about will do he make it what you 've be through may have National Security implication I need you to get they on the phone right now all your question will be answer in time First we need to know what happen you look different it be an alias of your I have not see I have a lot of question too we know almost nothing about the Covenant at that time so you take I back to the beginning you tell I the first thing you remember after your fight with Allison so this be what happen to you in your own word I shoot her three time then I pass out dead to the world when I wake up it be day later I be in the back of a van strapped down you and I be go to work together we will spend lot of time together but we will get the result that my employer have request I always do he inject I with a neurotoxin temporary paralysis I could not move or speak all I could do be watch your roommate be easy we unearth she we leave she in your apartment before we burn it but you that be more difficult when a body be burn badly enough the DNA they test for be in the tooth we extract pulp from your tooth and inject it into the tooth of the corpse that be to be your replacement of course they test the body they find to they it be you he will mourn and move on find someone else perhaps the soon you accept that you be no long who you be the easy this will be Sydney Bristow be go why do not I remember any of this I will get to that from your funeral you be take to a Covenant facility near St Petersburg this be the man who take you there the man from the van Oleg Madrczyk I kill this man it be only a week after I wake up in Hong Kong he have all the answer he die right in front of I you keep your promise you say you would kill I you be my favourite who the hell be you what be you talk about why do the Covenant take two year of my life what do he do to I the Covenant believe you be crucial to their operation they need your cooperation which you would not offer so Oleg begin a brainwash protocol he spend month break you down he use sensory deprivation Electroshock he would put you to sleep by run an I V with a barbiturate into one arm and shock you awake with an amphetamine into the other arm I will kill you you son of a bitch I promise you once Oleg believe you have be break he begin a conditioning process he start with hypnosis your name be Julia Thorne you be bear in London on August 2 1973 my name be Sydney Bristow you ugly bastard he disorient you with narcotic your name be Julia Thorne really then why be my name Sydney Bristow he withhold food for week at a time he bombard you with image information Classic technique try and true Julia your father 's name be Kenneth Thorne Julia be who you be your two brother Daniel and Tom the Latin school Confirmation at the all Souls Church after that Julia be who you be you lose your family in a fire after that you become a contract killer your first target be the man who destroy your family you become a contract killer you show no pity your first target be the man Julia will eat well live well Julia be who you be this go on over six month it be about that time that Oleg feel he would have a breakthrough that his therapy be start to work yes Lunch once Oleg believe that you be ready they give you a test to prove to they that you be a believer that you be in fact another woman may I present Julia Thorne Welcome Miss Thorne the work you will be do for we require a certain commitment of course who this man be be not important what be important be the knife on the table use it kill this unimportant man no no no no no no no no please do not who be he we do not know so I be program no not by the Covenant wait Kendall I do not understand I murder that man what do you mean I be not program by the Covenant when you be young your father subject you to the CIA 's experimental programme to train and prepare child for intelligence work Project Christmas among other thing that programme contain a fail safe to protect its subject from be turn Jack hardwire you to stand up to some pretty intense effort at brainwash I trade his life for mine that man whoever he be be take bring into a Covenant facility he be dead no matter what you do and you must have know that it do not lessen what I do but if you have not convince they you have be program you would have both be kill you could never have contact I I want to go home I want to see my dad your father can not be contact he be under deep cover and as it be you have no home to return to let I be clear you return home you be put in jeopardy the life of the people you claim to love you be just try to scare I look at your friend will the Covenant leave the son of a bitch for dead listen to I if what intel we have on the Covenant be anywhere near accurate they have the potential to be far more deadly than the Alliance ever be which be why it be imperative you continue as Julia Thorne the Covenant believe they have you program if you think I be go back you be insane if you do not they be go to come after you after your friend your family after Vaughn I have to see he Sydney you 've be go nine month he love I nine month be nothing so I let you go and you go home as hard as it be to see they together you could not confront Vaughn you realise your presence be a danger to he so you do the only thing you could this be Kendall I will do whatever you want and that be how we start work together so I become Julia yes you do they send you to Algeria where you meet with this man Simon Walker he be a thief you be introduce as a contract killer you start work together for the Covenant the mission be simple they want you to find the cube during your time with Simon you pursue a variety of lead all the while keep I inform by pass on the intel to one of our operative you inform I that Simon have find Andrian Lazarey a russian diplomat member of the Romanov family who like Sloane be devoted to study Rambaldi you believe Lazarey would know where to find the cube it be a crucial acquisition because it contain the DNA of Rambaldi himself you tell I the Covenant want you to get the information from he and then kill he it turn out you save his life you go to Lazarey the night before you be suppose to kill he he be a reasonable man the two of you strike a deal I will make this as simple as possible Mr Lazarey unless you do exactly as I say by this time tomorrow night you will be dead so that be why I fake Lazarey 's death so the videotape we presume there would be surveillance camera the murder have to look real the paramedic be CIA operative work under my order the Kremlin carry out a thorough investigation and they believe as do the Covenant that Andrian Lazarey be assassinate assume everything you be tell I be true Mr Kendall what be I do here why be you tell I this now and where be we go we be go to my facility in Nevada Project Black Hole four year ago when I be call in to question you I be never FBI I be Special Research oversee the project I 've never hear of Project Black Hole thank you this be everything the government have collect on or about Milo Rambaldi since the 1940s a quarter of the artefact we have be collect by you you be actually something of a celebrity in house which be also why the Covenant need you they believe Rambaldi 's prophecy they believe a lot of thing include the idea that you be the choose One my mother say that the night I disappear get off the ledge I will tell you what you need to know get off the ledge now it be you in the prophecy Sydney not I four month ago you ask I not to tell you this I honour that request as long as possible trust I when I finish the story you will understand the Covenant have you if they could get the cube they would have everything to fulfil Rambaldi 's prophecy you continue to feed the Covenant false lead in truth you and Lazarey be work for the CIA try to find that cube and it take you nine month but you find it where be it Nothing 's ever easy be it it be in the Fish River Gorge in Namibia for 500 year the key to Rambaldi 's prophecy Iay bury in the depth of this cave to Rambaldi 's follower this be the Holy Grail a mile long trek bring you to an elaborate vault that house the cube Lazarey have devote 30 year of his life to acquire the 12 key to the vault the last of which he find only two week before your journey each one have a name on it that correspond to a keyhole in the wall this lock will not stay open I need to hold the key in place Lazarey be trap and the cave begin to collapse around you here bite down on this there be only one way you could both get out alive so you get the cube and you get Lazarey out come on you 've get to run let us go let us go Come on keep go our agreement with Lazarey be that after he helped track down the cube we would let he disappear untraced after you let he go you be suppose to deliver I the cube but I do not show up no you do not instead I get this do you want to know what happen to your memory you might want to sit down for this I be sorry I know you be expect the cube with the dna instead you get this you 've be great to I a real friend and I be grateful for that but I can not go along with it the plan we have you know what this be about and I be hope you can understand what be I talk about so I be take care of it myself the dna even if it be with the CIA it will never be safe not really I 've see too much everything gets steal everything so I 've get a plan I find someone someone who can help I a man who have do advanced research on how the brain store short and long term memory I be not go to tell you specific of what I be do with the dna in fact I do not want to know they myself which be why I be go to try and have my memory erase to keep the Covenant from ever do what they want with Rambaldi 's DNA I be go to have everything that be happen in the past two year remove if this do not work I mean if this kill I well I do it than the Covenant but if it work if I come back and I do not remember do I a favour do not ever tell I about what I 've be through why be you do this tell I all this in his prophecy Rambaldi speak of a second come those freak want to clone he no what the Covenant believe be that Rambaldi 's work be destine to continue beyond his time that he be due a second come by way of a child this woman here depict will possess unseen mark sign that she will be the one to bring forth my work she will render the great power unto utter desolation the fanatical point of view believe Rambaldi 's dna can be transform use to fertilise the egg of a surrogate mother someone refer to in his prophecy as the choose One that be why they cut I open yes so they could extract my egg and that be why you go to such extraordinary length because his child would also be yours Sydney that be why I come to you not protocol there be no official order Sydney a couple year ago I get to know you a little bit what I believe be despite your protest you would want to know about this the Covenant have it all now I get this video two day before you turn up in Hong Kong and despite my be piss off I respect your choice I opt to let it go but here we be 4 month later and you go for the cube why when you nearly kill yourself try to hide it three week ago Sloane give I a package that I have send to he in the mail it be address in my handwriting inside be a key and an address to an apartment in Rome that I have rent as Julia Thorne I find a code there Coordinates that lead I to a box bury in the sand it be a hand it be Lazarey 's hand which lead I to Lazarey to the cube when the Covenant learn I would hide the cube they keep look eventually they find it they find the cave Lazarey 's hand so they forge my handwriting they plant the code they want I to find the hand in the desert they plant it there they want I to ask these question to smoke out Lazarey they trick I into lead they back to the cube why do not you destroy it I do not know and why do I just leave it at the hotel maybe there be another step maybe there be someone else involve when we get back I want you to look at all the artefact I need a phone I need a phone right now this be Marshall Marshall I need you to listen to I very carefully you say that the jerk be take it away that you should put a tracer on it and track it because you can imagine how cool it must be I need you to tell I the truth do you put a tracer on that cube if you do and if you be afraid you be go to get discipline I swear to God you be go to be okay I be sorry I do not put a tracer on it I know you no one be more curious about technology than you I need to find that cube I do not put a tracer on it I swear to you I do not okay okay I put a tracer on it but you can not tell if they find out they will fire I I can not be fire I be about to have a baby Marshall I love you I love you too Syd but seriously you can not tell anyone can you locate the cube well not exactly but I can narrow it down to a 10 yard radius Marshall that be call locate it where be it here be the big picture at 2100 hour you will be drop from 10 000 foot over Patagonia you will hit the ground a quarter mile from the building we have minimal intelligence on this but we believe the fertilisation will happen tonight Chopper will be here in two minute we will review the operation en route this be Kendall where be he tell he I be wait what be go on with you two nothing Come on we get to prep what be you do the day you show up in Rome when you call in they put you through to Kendall I be there that day in the office when he hang up he tell I that it be you I 've know the truth about what happen and I be order to say nothing Dixon we 've be work together for month it be not easy be it keep the truth from someone you love

something the sender want we to find a Covenant official want to defect what be the term in exchange for his extraction and immunity he be willing to turn over everything he know about the Covenant consider the mean through which he send we this message we believe he have top tier access inside the organisation I be send you to North Korea posing as swiss insurance auditor you will meet with the defector in the Gai Li marketplace 1200 hour local the identify marker will be three sugar cube place on a napkin at the edge of the table we 've only get a 15 minute window 15 minute those be his term and he offer no contingency if we do not show up at the meet there be no assurance that this opportunity will present itself again if this defector can lead we to the inner working of the Covenant we will finally have they on the rope wheel up in four hour I be wonder if you have any plan next Tuesday it be Michael 's hockey night and I think maybe we could go out get some dinner yeah sure that would be nice thank see you next Tuesday so the Covenant be in danger of be compromise this be of great concern to we we will send one of our own in North Korea to intercept the defector do you know from which airfield Agents Bristow and Vaughn will be depart no it be not mention I need the name of the airfield in order to eliminate Agents Vaughn and Bristow the Covenant can not accept even the possibility of the CIA get their hand on a defector explain your hesitation give I 30 minute I will get you the information you need do you have the number for Giorgio 's I want to make a reservation what be you do ask Sydney to dinner Michael you ask I to give she a chance I will drive you to the plane we can talk on the way well I have to go get my stuff Dover 's five minute from the

Come in I must say you be quite an impressive actress when I approach you in the parking garage even I do not realise you and I be work for the same organisation would you like to put something on no I be rather comfortable like this would you like I to put something on hardly you and I share a similar predicament the Covenant we be expect to carry out order without know exactly how or why we be do so hence the death of my father at your hand you be give and carry out order without question not that my father deserve to live he do not it be just that I be bankroll this entire operation while be treat like a worthless foot soldier why be you come to I with this because since I 've learn of your true affiliation I 've study up on you your history your skill your connection I also like your perfume what do you want to stage a coup I know of three cell leader I believe you know the other three I propose we eliminate they all look at this it must be your lucky day actually I believe it be my lucky day once we eliminate all six cell leader we will travel to St Petersburg to meet with the head of Covenant operation why to make it easy for he to kill we on the contrary each cell leader wear a watch contain access key to their respective headquarters once we have all six key we will force our ascension within the Covenant under threat that if they do not comply the key will be hand over to the CIA which colour do you think my husband would prefer I prefer the black Red it be Dad I think we might talk business over dinner we 've get a lock on Cummings she be operate out of a high end club in Athens you be go in as south african diamond smuggler you 've hear of her work want she to upgrade your Cape Town facility how about we just tell she we be CIA and want to ask she some question we believe Cummings design the security system we be not 100 we need to confirm her work in Chamonix first then persuade she to detail the countermeasure she put in place at the chalet they be preppe the mission now Dixon will be contact you within the hour I expect Vaughn will be go with you yeah I figure you realise it be your prerogative to ask Dixon to send someone else if Dixon send I on an operation I be go what I mean be someone instead of Vaughn I would be more comfortable go with Weiss the contact the one use to locate Cummings Weiss cultivate they while work a pan african smuggling operation I will call he in have he meet you in tac op thank you the deficit must remain below 3 of GNP yes Robert well of course you shall see the figure you be on well absolutely no there be now no question Robert would you mind terribly if I call you later thank you Mr Gathird Lauren Reed we meet before in London of course Ms Reed what be you do here there be something I be hope we might be able to discuss and only a man of your position within the Covenant can help I still there be protocol you do not worry about protocol the last time we speak I will meet you gentleman upstairs I need your counsel the CIA 's aware there be a mole in their organisation and I be feel vulnerable why come to I well you say the last time we speak that if I ever need anything I need your help do you have a minute you know you be unbelievably good come on our flight to Paris leave in an hour yes yes it do there she be can I help you tell Ms cumming her client be here you be sweet darling sit down John Steadman this be Rebecca Davison a pleasure I prefer not to shake hand sit down you want to secure a facility in Cape Town yes a diamond processing plant we 've have trouble with break in the political situation there be unstable they say we be strip their land of its natural resource but honestly do you think God intend this kind of beauty to be waste in the ground whether we end up work together or not do I a favour huh do not talk to I about God what do God intend Hell if I know not a clue my work be good yes we know we be very interested in one of your lethal response system what you be ask I to do be illegal in most country so Mr Steadman give I one good reason why I would ever risk my ass for you I believe we can give you 2 million reason well look like you all do not need an ATM so what do you kid have in mind something like the system you build in Chamonix and how do two south african rock wrangler hear about Chamonix the owner be a client yeah I outdo myself on that one but if you be interested in a job like that those stone will not even cover the down payment they barely cover this conversation well then I have a counteroffer really show we the schematic for what you build in Chamonix tell we how to bypass the system in exchange we will make sure you be treat well while in custody you be smart enough to know the CIA have big wide comfy cell with hot water cotton sheet and tv we also have cramp cold little cell with a bare cot and a hole in the floor see either way you be come home with we where you live be up to you there be no bypass the system okay Cummings tell you the chalet be virtually impenetrable they 've get three tier of tree mount security camera plus there be military train guard that patrol we need to find some way in the Doleac Agenda could mean the end of the Covenant I say virtually impenetrable now the lethal response system Toni Cummings build be in a half mile long tunnel and that will serve as our way into the chalet accord to the schematic she give we the lethal response system be comprise of three zone you 've get your automate sentry gun electrify zone and the big finish motion trigger acid spray so how do we get through well what I be think we I be sorry we she be very helpful in create in fact she be always very helpful Inflatable Kevlar now when you hit the first tunnel you toss it in the gun will open fire but the ball will keep move which mean the gun be go to keep fire until they be out of ammunition now you be at the electrify zone cumming arm the tunnel with 150 000 volt which will be a 15 on this metre you want to double check it there the Neoprene layer you will be wear will protect you even if this clock in at 25 and the acid bath we be work on that and we need to figure out a way to get around the alarm diagnostic right ow what God I be sorry the baby 's kicking really he or she be usually pretty inactive at this time you keep track of when the baby kick Carrie be you okay yeah I be good the baby 's kicking I be good hello Jack it be Arvin when you suggest I see a therapist perhaps you be right I be suppose to say something important you can say anything you be far more attractive than I imagine what do you imagine I check up on you Yale Columbia prestigious internship at Mass General and then you end up as a gs 18 bury in some cubicle at Langley well I want to serve my country and I find that people who work in intelligence have to grapple with some serious issue live duplicitous life compartmentalize the personal and professional it be a difficult challenge I presume that you treat Sydney and Jack Bristow before I can not discuss other patient with you then they be your patient I be not here to play game with you Mr Sloane Dr Barnett how can we possibly have an honest conversation if we can not talk about the most important people in my life you can talk about they I be sorry you come so far Dr Barnett I can stay as long as it take we can just sit

the Dryden Bank be murder in the garage of his Berlin office Gerard Kronish CFO of Chantre Telecom be find dead in Paris 40 minute ago the confirm intel suggest that both be high rank member of the Covenant they must know we be after the Doleac Agenda they be kill the name off the list before we can get to they hi be it true you be move up the timetable on the mission to the Alps yes we be discuss that now Sydney and Vaughn there be a plane wait to take you back to Chamonix the override I be build to bypass the lethal response system have not quite crack it yet how long do you need well

Philippines they 've be dormant since the Bali bombing of ' 02 be they operational again early today we intercept a burst transmission which indicate that an operative of Shining Sword have acquire a plasma charge Plasma charge I think those be only theoretical accord to the burst transmission the operative be ship the bomb to one of their european cell the transmission include spec now believe it or not these schematic be two time scale mean this device be only six inch in diameter but it pack a wallop now this be a conservative interpolation of the damage it would cause if detonate and this do not account for fire or collateral explosion and sorry dunno how that get in there that be at breakfast Mitchell be the bomb be ship transpacific or via the Atlantic we do not know but we trace the transmission to a digital storage facility in Vancouver where the Shining Sword operative maintain his database be we able to hack in well DigiStash be basically a self storage facility for digital file corporate record medical database that sort of stuff so their firewall 's state of the art I would not be able to hack the database unless someone on the inside be to open up a port Sydney Vaughn you will go to the facility look to lease vault space once inside you will uplink with Marshall now if we be lucky the operative will have archive the detail of the shipment and we can intercept the bomb before it be deliver shall I tell they the idea I have I have a great idea what you guy should I think you should pose as radio astronomer you know look to back up your recording of interplanetary noise now I come up with a little cheat sheet that should help you and you can review this en route and one more thing the Covenant may have intercept CIA intelligence regard our mission in North Korea and our pursuit of the Doleac agenda Langley have assign a counterintelligence team to determine whether someone within the agency have be leak information Jack will run point on their investigation inside this office Marshall Lauren I 've schedule you in the first round of interview you will be available later this afternoon actually I be due in DC tonight for an NSC

restaurant I shall be there at eight o'clock and I be hope you will join I Goodbye Dr Barnett so you be look for alien life in a manner of speak our radio telescope inspect the cosmos iooke to detect artificially generate signal basically anything below 300Hz but do not worry the alien invasion be still a few month away as we discuss over the phone our telescope gather over 350 gigabyte of information per day not a problem our vault be design to accommodate teraflop you could store 20 year of datum in the vault you 've lease number 2289 please Luc Data be back up twice daily the server be monitor around the clock Climate control fire suppression all state of the art the interface be hot swappable oh great if you need anything you can call I thank you luc ok guy let I know when you be connect to the mainframe ok copy that ok now once we download the shipping information we should be able to pinpoint the location of the plasma charge connection establish oh listen I want to ask you something the truth now your science geek character be that suppose to be I your son Funny although that would have be pretty cool do not you think Little Mitchell work side by side with his old man we be download now I see it another 15 second Marshall what be happen I do not know there be someone else in the system with you here from our end it have to be there be no other way to access the file I think they just plant a virus it have to be the Covenant the mole must have leak our intel they beat we here you guy listen to I Disconnect from their system before their virus affect our copy do we get the shipping information I be not sure I will have to see if I can reconstruct the datum from what we 've get let us get out of here please do not do this the shooter there Vaughn the F 150 Vaughn how much of the datum do we get our hand on look like 63 percent give or take a few meg oh I sleep 20 minute last night FYI how long before you can extrapolate the rest well I run the code through a high grade decryption algebra algorithm I mean oh but you should look at this stare at this right here it be like a lava lamp if you look I pass out before when I Marshall how long 12 hour we do not have 12 hour if the Covenant get their hand on the plasma charge Sydney I know the decryption program will work but it just require a little time I be out of coffee I have 12 cup and I be not feel anything you would think it would Caffeine I be go to check if it be the real deal do you guy want no thank you oh by the way after six hour in the hot seat from the boy from

not tell you the premise of my thesis Aha well I would say I be fascinated but that would sound egomaniacal would not it Salud you certainly have give proof that anyone can change for the well give the proper stimulus you look beautiful Beautiful that be just a layman 's opinion Dr Barnett all I be say be that you make a remarkable transformation Master spy to humanitarian yeah well sometimes I wonder which be hard the Rambaldi device be instrumental in your transformation oh yes it be critical it only reveal one word to you Peace that be correct and yet there be eight yard of parchment

to this assignment if you have any issue take it up through the proper channel do not mistake I it be not your dedication that I question we will talk about this later sorry about that work be officially over what be that for I just miss you I think you would be home by now I be about to say the same to you the plasma charge it be in our hand Sark be not the Covenant have you have dinner if memory serve you always like Michelli 's I have not eat there since I be eight I do eat you know I would like that actually previously on Alias trust anyone will take time you know so much about I I know almost nothing about you I want to very much a Covenant official want to defect Leonid Lisenker in exchange for his extraction and immunity he be willing to turn over everything he know about the Covenant believe it or not these schematic be two time scale mean this plasma charge be only 6 inch in diameter but it pack a wallop Freeze give I the bomb out of the way hurry up move it now come on follow I this be way out of my league Motion sensor a dedicated board run God know how many program there be no way we would shut this down in time our good bet be to try and defuse the motion sensor and get this off site in a blast containment vessel before it vaporize the block can you do that I 've find the lead for the motion sensor I be cut it it be no good it be still operational it must be loop what the hell do we do now your guess be as good as mine my kid 's favourite colour be red the Wicklow National Bank Building or what be leave of it do we know who be responsible his name be Daniel Ryan this morning we intercept a message he send to the Covenant take credit for the bombing Ryan 's former Royal Navy Explosive ordnance disposal after his dishonorable discharge he go from dispose bomb to design they he be work with the Covenant in the past and want to sell they his late product so he display their effectiveness by destroy a downtown office building actually Ryan alert local authority give they time to evacuate the building a humanitarian bomber his goal be to provide a state of the art bomb squad ample opportunity to deactivate his creation he want the bomb squad call in well maybe 'cause he know there be nothing they could do right the bomb you recover last week I 've get that in my workshop accord to the bomb squad 's voice recording Ryan make one significant upgrade Anybody ever hear of quantum entanglement raise your no long story short the theory be this bomb can not be defuse oh and compare to his previous version it be get twice the yield Ryan indicate that negotiation with the Covenant will be exclusive for 48 hour if there be no agreement he will detonate a second bomb target against America to elicit bid from terrorist group hostile to our interest but if the covenant be interested in make an offer he instruct they to contact he tomorrow night at a pub call the Black Stag in Belfast our option Extract Ryan and force his cooperation or get he to do so voluntarily by pose as the Covenant how can we do that be not that risky there be variable but if our goal be to prevent a second bombing and to learn who Ryan 's partner might be the good way to do that be by gain his trust what about Leonid Lisenker the Covenant defector he be in custody he might be able to detail Ryan 's relationship with the Covenant for now we spec out both approach Sydney you question Lisenker Vaughn you and Weiss detail the mission if we go in as CIA we will meet in two hour I believe in America America have give I new life away from the Covenant I be hope you could tell I something about this man Daniel Ryan be critical to the i r A when they be in the bombing business he be become an independent contractor since Sinn Fein go straight year before last your cigarette be for crap but I love cable television in this country I be enjoy very much this picture Miami Vice Ryan be sell a new weapon to the Covenant we be consider acquire it by pose as the Covenant for this to work we need you to tell we everything you know about Ryan 's interaction with they protocol contact I be never directly involve in procurement

I do you a favour we be good boy Scout to Base Camp we 've get the package that be good right that be call method act I be shoot in the neck once I can do it again we 've get to move accord to Lisenker Ryan do business with the Covenant at the Commodore Hotel in Moscow room 305 I think it would be easy to sic your father on he we have 27 hour before Ryan set off another bomb our good chance to prevent that be to let he know his first demonstration convince we to buy every weapon he can produce we be the Covenant base on intel receive from someone we may not be able to trust Lisenker defect he hate the Covenant as much as anyone and he be all we 've get how be the inspection go Good Whoa Lisenker reject the fruit basket say it would cost a fortune in Moscow oh and we need a ceiling that be actually russian satellite television I hack it off the Dubnovysat communication right there now low it everything be to spec the bedsheet be 700 thread count the minibar be stock with

National Bank blast last Wednesday the CIA be work with Interpol as well as local law enforcement in pursuit of this man and those responsible you will agree to our term and call off the second

demonstration be schedule to take place tomorrow afternoon I assume it will be call off when my associate see you they will know we 've come to term and bring that issue to a close we be agree then we be indeed Mr Sark we know the frequency Ryan broadcast his initial communiqué over right yes we intercept it then to get Sark on the plane we have to put out a communiqué from Ryan to the Covenant which detail the term he just lay out if we can make Sark believe this be a way to acquire Ryan 's new technology he may bite how much time before he set off the next bomb Less than 18 hour get Marshall on the intercept you work on the communiqué I want you on that plane you play Sark your job now be to shadow he the airline database show all passenger have check in except a Mr and Mrs Clyde

make we I do not think there be ever a meeting this be stage yes the whole thing to get Sark on that plane we be review his psych profile re interview everyone who might give we a lead whatever Ryan 's motive he have present we with an opportunity we must act on you be to take Sark into custody we will have a team in place when you land in Paris I understand hello hi I be a federal agent there be a suspect I need to take into custody it have to be do very quietly be there a marshal onboard no I be afraid not be he on the line Good tell I about Daniel Ryan I read about what happen in Belfast that be a terrible tragedy what do you know about he Ryan be a freelance supplier of advanced ordnance he use to be reliably leftist he supply cause I r A s Zapatistas now he be strictly mercenary what change his brother Christopher Ryan he be the political one they use to work together up until sometime last year Christopher disappear the rumour be the Covenant have he kill the Covenant kill his brother and he want to work with they be there anything else no I be afraid that be all I have thank you okay Ryan 's brother Bad dude bombing at the french embassy in Rabat Explosion at the Marine barrack outside Manila and the remain of a russian general 's compound in Grozny these incident be all at least two year old anything more recent no nothing it be like he disappear Sloane be tell the truth the Covenant do have this man kill Dad they have I kill he what during the two year I be miss when the Covenant try break I down to get I to work for they when they believe I be ready they put I to a test Kendall later show I a picture of the person he believe they have I kill he have no identity until now if what Ryan say be true and Sark have be promote to the leadership of the north american cell kill he on a commercial plane carry 200 innocent people would be a very public act of revenge oh my God Vaughn Cheers Mr Vaughn tell I you would not happen to know an eight letter word for arrogant would you do exactly as I tell you or I will kill you right here get in do not it bother you what be that a bomb maker arrange for a meeting on a plane and then do not show up I do not know about you but that concern I lock this up yeah we may have a problem an explosive device there may be one onboard you have to land immediately Syd what you get the bomb be the size of a cd it could be anywhere let us try and figure out how it get onboard Crew passenger maintenance check the plane service record for the last week maybe two to see if there be anything unscheduled two day ago a work order for repair in the electrical current bypass in the cargo hold Vaughn talk to I what be you look at you well get Marshall on the phone the son of a bitch lie to we yes and we lie to he the difference be we be try to save life our goal be far less asymmetrical than we assume clearly Mr Ryan share our antipathy for the Covenant except he believe we be the Covenant a fact we must disabuse he of immediately we must reveal ourselves for who we be and take this man into our confidence alright we have confirmation from Marseilles that airspace have be clear for an emergency landing the second demonstration he warn we about this be it Ryan must have game plan for an emergency landing if we can convince Ryan that Sark be in custody and will be prosecute maybe he will deactivate the bomb let us do it that be DGSE Four Mirage fighter jet be scramble by the French Air Force to eyeball only no shooting do they understand they be confirm as a fly by for now this be your captain speak we be begin our emergency descent into Marseilles okay the bomb you recover in Lisbon may be slightly different but it should be similar enough for I to walk you through this what be that what what what be what I do not know it look like a thermometer with a metal ring at the top be the liquid rise yeah how do you know it be a barometric sensor the bomb be trigger by altitude if they plane keep descend it will detonate excuse I you need to oh mon dieu what do you want now pull up the bomb be rig to the altimeter if we go below 18 000 foot we be all dead Marseilles Approach this be Nuage 212 emergency climb to one niner zero how long can we stay up we have enough fuel for 2 hour maybe 2 1 2 but that be it my name be Sydney Bristow I be a special agent with the CIA so today you be CIA so Belfast what be that Belfast be a con we want you to believe we be Covenant so we could acquire your new technology so this be not Moscow you be in Los Angeles and we know you plan on detonate a bomb on Nuage Air 212 as payback for what the Covenant do to your brother how you do and you I defect two month ago these be good people Daniel you should listen to they if you want I to believe you be Central Intelligence you 've get to do well than this a warehouse somewhere right much more convincing Mr Ryan I be Marcus Dixon the Director of this office we now know the bomb you plant on Nuage Air 212 be rig to an altimeter and will detonate if the pilot attempt to land I be authorise to make the following deal disable the bomb and turn over to we all blueprint and material concern the creation and production of such bomb in exchange no charge will be file against you if you really be CIA then the person I meet with be not Julian Sark no he be CIA he be on that plane but I tell he my associate have work with he before and could make a visual identification you put the word out to the real Sark you let he know there be a meeting Clever full on genius maybe you really be CIA Sark be already in custody as soon as the plane land he will be process for extradition and prosecute to the full extent of the law the term of our deal expire in 10 second after that what Agent Bristow say be true you will be try as an enemy of the state and execute you can not let those innocent people die my brother be innocent okay well how about this we have to keep the bomb at altitude right why do not we land at a high altitude airport the high altitude airport be in Bangda Tibet and that be only 14 000 foot wait a minute wait wait a minute we can not get rid of the bomb we can not defuse the bomb but we can trick it air pressure be the force exert on a surface by the weight of the air above we need to encase the bomb in an airtight temperature control bubble to fool the bomb into think we be still at altitude but to do that you need to remove it from the fuselage and deactivate the motion sensor which the bomb squad in Belfast be do when they die well yeah okay alright I see four wire ieade out from the motion sensor Red green yellow and black can you see which one be loop to the power source yeah the red one red one okay go ahead and cut that no no wait I hate it when you do that be there a suppressor yeah do not cut it it be a false lead Marshall my bad sorry find the anti static wire that run through the plasma relay it be probably wrap in degaussed ceramic fibre you have to explain this to I in word I can understand it could look like anything there be a million variation tell I what you be look at I do not know what I be look at well then you well find somebody that do Thirsty you be angry with good reason the Covenant take away your brother 's life take his life what an interesting choice of word I mean personally I would have go for something a little bit more colourful like murder well even that be not what about slaughter yeah what about slaughter try that the Covenant hold I captive for almost two year they do thing to I I will never get over they starve I subject I to electroshock Sensory deprivation they use hypnotherapy all to convince I I be someone else an operative they create name Julia Thorne I be tell you this it may not change anything but you need to know that I understand what it be like have the Covenant take away people you love they be evil evil people the thing be I be lucky than you the man I love the Covenant do not murder he he be on that plane like I say my tell you this may not change anything but I swear to you if you disable that bomb I will not rest until the Covenant pay for what they 've do to we please I beg you do not do this I 've get Sark talk he through it wait a minute Sark as in Mr Sark I understand we be look for a degauss ceramic fibre that be right it be clear Mr Ryan have apply the good invariation Cool can you splice it I could but the dummy wire 's fix to a suppressor I will have to ground it first you be clear alright we have to find something airtight to put it in this should do it he need a phone to call who the bomb specifically a pager the bomb be wire with a remote access protocol I need to dial in and enter a deactivation sequence this be Director Dixon get I a secure line keep it steady yeah listen Vaughn we may have a way out of this 594 how will they know when the bomb have be deactivate the red light on the detonator will turn green 477 Vaughn watch the light on the detonator it should change colour got it 459 and now punch in 1124 my brother 's birthday Vaughn what be go on nothing it be still red Syd he screw we oh my God oh my God oh my God oh my God oh Damn

Pannich my former handler confess to I on the day before she be kill that my brother have be murder by the Covenant and that it be a test of loyalty for a woman name Julia Thorne you kill my brother establish a backup connection with Langley I want all non essential remove now we have three minute to reach safe distance I want this to be smooth and orderly if the bomb be activate by a phone call the detonator must be on a cellular network if I can find the right signal I might be able to reverse engineer the deactivation protocol how much time 3 1 2 minute I will oversee transport of the prisoner Dixon need your help evacuate the Rotunda now do not tell I we 've come to the point where you coerce I into cooperate not exactly in seven second you will begin to see spot you will think it be a white light but I be here to tell you the last word I want you to hear ever there be no white light not for people like you God what have you do get the defibrillator Hurry I put it outside the door he think he be prepared to die we will see about that charge it to 200 you 've get to start at 150 no time for that 200 now 1 2 3 1 2 3 you give we the code that disarm both bomb or we do that

second Robin Steven Connor 's dad 's here Bye Dad later head Dad Connor 's watch go sorry about that all information concern Sark 's case be be strictly compartmentalise within the task force if we have any operational leak in the next few day we be go to know it come from inside the Rotunda copy that how be it go I be compile a list of question I plan on ask Sark during his interrogation so that be it be not your father suppose to arrive like an hour ago he go straight into a meeting with Jack Bristow and Director Dixon be you go to be okay while he be here I guess I be about to find out

before my committee next month we appreciate your effort Senator Sark 's transport will be arrive at Dover Airfield within the hour Agents Bristow and Weiss be on site to escort he into custody base on recently acquire intelligence we know Sark be promote to co command the Covenant 's north american operation it be imperative we learn the identity of his associate excuse I there you be hello Dad Good to see you please sit Lauren this concern you as well once Sark be in custody he will be transfer to medical service and preppe for the Inferno protocol it be my understanding that 50 of the test subject suffer cardiac arrest during that procedure the United States be not in the business of torture witness for information Mr Sark be not be classify as a prisoner of war he have no protection under the Geneva Convention but give Sark 's history of sell out his employer be it even necessary he be likely to comply quite willingly that may have be true in the past he now have 800 million invest in this organisation his loyalty will lie with his money all relevant material you have should be turn over to Jack he will be conduct the interrogation this have be clear through your superior Langley have request certain question be include some of which contain information that exceed your classification level I understand I will review this immediately Director Dixon give Sark 's importance to the Covenant we can not rule out the possibility of a rescue attempt Put she through Put Level 3 containment procedure into effect immediately no they be not sick I do not understand their carpool pick they up hour ago this can not be good Sark be suppose to land 20 minute ago Agent Bristow here we be on our way Sark 's plane just land in the desert 60 mile east of here be the area secure Copy that no one 's get on or off the plane since it land Sark 's go the plane land on autopilot we check the body count against the crew manifest one of Sark 's armed guard be miss if Sark have an accomplice we have to assume that he make it out alive the passenger be freeze indicate Sark may have parachute at altitude ieave the cabin depressurise Marshall 's pull the satellite feed if Sark punch out within a 100 mile radius we should be able to narrow our search put together a team be ready to move on Marshall 's lead Sydney and Weiss be on their way back with the flight recorder Steven and Robin do not show up at school I try their cellphone I 've trade call with relative friend our neighbour the police it be Robin thank God where have you be we have your child they be safe and they will remain so assume you follow our demand precisely our calculation indicate the Covenant abduct these child between 8 30 and 8 45 a m in exchange for their safe return Sark be demand the release of these man five Covenant operative currently in custody apprehend within the past year we have 48 hour that be impossible be not these prisoner be hold by different government yes and even in the event that we could coordinate the release of these prisoner the diplomatic feat require will take day if not long we should begin work on secure their release immediately it be not that simple there be a reason we do not negotiate with terrorist it set a dangerous precedent as would not do everything to protect those child who be to say that next week the same organisation will not target the child of other work in Intelligence we be not discuss some hypothetical the Covenant abduct these hostage Steven and Robin I be sorry their name I only suggest that for the safety of all of our family we may need to find an alternative anyone else Marshall be analyse the datum recorder from the plane it may give we a lead may I also suggest we at least begin negotiation with the country hold these prisoner whether or not we trade as Ms Reed mention this will be a lengthy process we can use the negotiation to buy time while have the Covenant believe we be proceed in good faith then that be how we will proceed one last thing the only thing we do know for certain Sark manage his escape because he be provide with information that could only have come from this office I want this leak identify they be do exactly as we expect the advantage of have a predictable adversary not to mention someone on the inside yes indeed which bring I to my next question our superior would like to know how your effort in secure a scapegoat be progress I 've already take care of it Oui Mr Sloane tell Karl that Judy 's on her way down Oui Mr Sloane the limo be here I do not want to go then do not I have use up all my sick day and every conceivable excuse I have get to get back to work you may find this hard to believe but I be usually very professional why would I find that hard to believe I find our time together very therapeutic if the Agency find out about we I will be totally discredit no one will know I give you my word I wish that be enough I be not go to see you again be I I should go this be the last communication from the crew tell they you be experience radio failure or you be both dead Albuquerque Centre November Niner Seven we be experience intermittent communication problem nothing to worry about copy that continue your approach please do not we assume that Sark bail out over New Mexico but check this out 20 minute later the recorder pick up some faint noise can you be more specific it turn out our friend Mr Sark make a phone call notify the extraction team I should be at the L Z on schedule do we have the hostage Excellent not if I see you first love Sark be still on the plane once they pass New Mexico that would put he in Arizona I task echelon to focus on a 200 mile radius around the drop point add keyword to the dictionary Echelon pick up a burst of covenant communication from a warehouse in Nogales I believe they might be hold your child there base on Marshall 's intel I have the authority to go tactical right now and attempt a rescue or you can continue the negotiation I need an honest assessment Jack the last time we do business with the Covenant they kill a hostage as a negotiation tactic if history be any indication they may kill one of your child to compel we to meet their demand what if we give in to their demand there be no guarantee they will let they go unharmed and if we attempt rescue the risk be equally high I be sorry prepare the tactical option Marshall we be in place we be disable the alarm system once the alarm be down you need to access the closed circuit feed Perimeter 's clear alarm be down we be hack into the closed circuit feed now okay receive image receive there they be I see they the child be inside I be mapping coordinate they be one level down let us go Marshall anything okay try the first door on your right Marshall they be not here that do not make any sense hold on let I do a re scan oh my God we 've get an explosive device 1 12 leave to go copy that boy Scout I be check it out

trap get out Dixon Marshall say the tape be on a loop we have to get out I can not leave they but they be not here we do not know that Dixon if you stay here you be go to die Robin and Steven be out there and they need you to find they Dixon go Marshall I need you to pull up the server log for the classified FAA database sure no problem what be we look for everyone who access Sark 's flight information Filter it to show only the result from the last two day no problem there that be not one of our internal I p address be it no it be not look like they log on use Dr Barnett 's account that be interesting they try to spoof their I p by bounce it off several server can you find the origin I think so to what do I owe this pleasure I take no pleasure in this Arvin you be dismiss go it be not enough for you that I see my wife die I be afraid I do not understand they be child child if I only know what I be be accuse of I you give information to the Covenant it be because of you my child

will be you lock up be that what you want I want my child back this be not the way to help they we will find they we will find they Dixon we will bring they home Sydney for the last time get out of here what would diane say if she see you like this what about your kid they need you what would they want you to do what would they want you to do Marcus I do not do this God Steven oh God daddy oh Steven be you alright where be your sister you need to tell I where be Robin they want to talk to you they say they want I to watch my child die they want I to know what it feel like the Covenant know we would come they feed we Echelon intercept dangle the whereabouts of my child like bait the Covenant be now demand the immediate release of 10 prisoner any further attempt on our part to outmanoeuvre they and they have swear I will never see my daughter again if I tell you I be capable of process all of this I would be lie all I know be my daughter be out there and because of a fail rescue mission I sanction she be in even more danger the emotional toll this have take and my current state of mind convince I that I be no long the good guarantee of her return therefore I be step down temporarily as director of this task force until this matter be resolve I trust you will stand in my stead and do everything in your power to bring my daughter back to I I 've already put in call to State we be go to do everything in our power to meet the Covenant 's demand I appreciate it the Covenant 's agenda be rash there be something behind the boldness of their demand like what I do not know until we determine what it be we should proceed negotiate the release of the prisoner how be he do he be dehydrate but I think the damage be more emotional than physical so what can I do Sydney Steven be send back with a message but it have nothing to do with release prisoner I do not get it they tell I if I disclose their true demand to the CIA Robin would die what do they want a Rambaldi artefact from Project Black Hole in the Nevada desert Lot 45 I do not know what it be why the false demand keep the CIA occupy the Covenant be aware that I have clearance to enter the DSR facility I have personal access code Access code that can be trace back to you my daughter 's life be in their hand if I could do this alone I would whatever you need Miss this be a restricted area dude this be sweet I be psyche to run into you I be dunin ' with my buddy and I got separate I 've be just going in a circle for about an hour Miss you be not suppose to be here I be not the map say have a look

there be specific reference to shadow in neopaganism there be over a dozen reference in the Bible Anything Rambaldi relate my son say his captor mention the word countershadow it be all I have to go on I need access to a research terminal for an hour or so not a problem Mind if I tag along actually I have to tag along we be at a Code Orange you understand Understand I institute the protocol Dixon I 've reach the grate Most of the file be cross reference within the archive but we should also check the historical database it be still seal this could take more time than I think Coffee Sure I will have some bring in heat bubble be get critical I be go to have to abort be you alright I be sorry all this hit at the strange time I understand do you pray Erin no I be agnostic actually Dixon

collect Dixon Lot 45 be go Dixon what do I do give I a second I will try to find it it be be move for analysis Level eight quadrant one I be on my way do you call the algerian minister yes sir hello Ambassador these negotiation be mean to fail why I be afraid I do not know what you be talk about all of the resource of this agency be be divert to meet demand the Covenant must know be unattainable which lead I to believe it be merely a distraction what do they really want well then my question to you be why target Dixon what do he have access to Jack Come on Jack if you want my help you be just go to have to trust I he have access to Project Black Hole proceed down the North corridor until you reach the central lab room 74 that be where they be hold Lot 45 I be approach the door it be lock I

save I a trip back here you be welcome I get your message Dixon make contact he be prepared to make the exchange I understand I must admit I be not sure the good director have it in he I be impressed that man be live through his bad nightmare you might consider lose the sarcasm how touch you actually care when be the meet four hour make sure nothing interfere what be this about I know you remove an artefact from Project Black Hole to trade with the Covenant I talk to sloane the Covenant be desperate to acquire a box construct by Rambaldi it be sloane 's understanding that they be close to locate a key to activate it why should we trust a thing Sloane say Sloane believe the content of that box in the Covenant 's hand will put Sydney 's life in jeopardy and I believe he Dad there be something you should know there be an inscription on the box Mom 's name you can not give the Covenant the artefact not until we know more by then Robin could be dead Jack if I have another option we can produce a duplicate artefact send in a team to the exchange site apprehend Sark once the trade occur if Sark in any way think we be try to double cross he my daughter will suffer the consequence I can not take that risk I share your concern which be why I be committed to find a way out of this without risk my daughter 's life as well Robin do not choose this life I do it be my decision to make Dad and the exchange be happen tomorrow then I be go with you tell the algerian minister that if he refuse I will personally see to it that his foreign aid bill do not make it to the Senate floor Sir Project Black Hole have be compromise tell he I will call back excuse I Lot 45 be miss a list have be compile of all visitor and worker at the facility in the last 24 hour that will be all yes sir this be Senator Reed I want Marcus Dixon 's name add to the federal watch list and I want a tactical team deploy to bring he into custody immediately what be it Dixon need our help Air Unit one what be your status Air Unit one engage GPS to locate the target area the helicopter be up we would not ask listen say no more if anybody ever lay a hand on my mini Mitch I swear they be use a GPS navigation system to vector the chopper Meaning I might be able to uplink to their gps receiver and induce a deviation error might or can we will find out soon enough Air Unit One receive GPS signal proceeding to target area I want my daughter once I take possession of Lot 45 my associate will release she you have my word Air Unit One we be over the contact area there be no one here well it look like they be take a little detour outside of Long Beach Harbour over the Pacific Ocean thank you so much Marshall I be afraid I be go to need some insurance to guarantee I reach my extraction point safely this collar contain a lethal cardiotoxin once I 've place this on your daughter you will have two minute to disarm it before the compound be release into her system you son of a bitch that be not part of our agreement this mechanism be well within your disarm capability two minute be generous in my opinion you will not put that on my daughter use I instead put the collar on I she be 13 year old alright very well if you try and remove this device before disarm it the injection be instantaneous now I want my daughter as always it have be a pleasure do business with you you do not deserve to walk out of here alive before you consider take any drastic measure you should know that if I release my grip on this remote the toxin will automatically go into your daughter 's bloodstream a fail safe if you will as I say you have two minute get Robin out of here do it now go Sydney stand very still the mechanism 's armed our good bet be to sever its link to the relay board I see it it be wire to a mirror if we clip the lead it will register the voltage drop Dad Easy it be okay if I tell you I be innocent of these charge would you believe I no look Judy why do not you ask yourself if I want to damage you if I want to damage the CIA would I be so careless would I leave a trail that so obviously lead in my direction you use I I compromise my judgement because I believe that you have change but you be incapable of it if you can not trust I now I accept that all I ask be that you respect the confidentiality in what I tell you regard my affair with Irina I be go home have you see your father I have not see he maybe that be a good thing you might be right it be come to my attention that Senator Reed 's effort to retrieve Lot 45 be thwart inexplicably well I

deep gratitude good night Jack see you later not if I see you first love previously on Alias Bomani 's become the large arm dealer in Africa with strong tie to the Covenant I could help you become

effort in secure a scapegoat be progress I 've already take care of it Jack to what do I owe this pleasure I take no pleasure in this Arvin I 've get the artefact I will meet you at the rendezvous point I know you remove an artefact from Project Black Hole to trade with the Covenant base on recently acquire intelligence we know Sark be promote to co command the Covenant 's north american operation Senator Reed it be imperative we learn the identity of his associate I enhance the audio it turn out our friend Mr Sark make a phone call notify the extraction team not if I see you first love see you later not if I see you first love Lauren 's parent have be marry for 34 year and they still love be together I have one day off this month and I spend it play hockey at the rink with high school kid that must be fun if I need it can I crash on your couch yeah you just have to wipe off the Cheese Nips hey I be sorry man hello I may have a lead on the box from Lot 45 not where it be but a map that will lead we to the key that open it Project Black Hole have have the Rambaldi box for two year and have not be able to do that without the key the Covenant will not be able to either that be why we have to get it I be get the intel from Mexico City Plane 's wait on you at Dover I would like to go with he be that a good idea Sloane be clear whatever be in the box present a significant threat to you sloane could be lie even if he be not the box have one inscription on it Irina I need to find out why you will report to I as soon as you get back from Mexico City Lauren your father have order an official enquiry into the disappearance of the box from Project Black Hole I 've already be question about what I know which be nothing I appreciate that not at all you know where my loyalty lie the box you lose have not be open since the time of Rambaldi though there be a legend Joseph Stalin make the great effort Stalin know about Rambaldi he too be a believer the Rambaldi box be of particular interest because it be rumour to contain the strain of a plague like bioweapon capable of kill million Stalin obtain the box but the key to open it elude he he send team of archaeologist around the globe in search of the key as legend have it in 1941 a discovery be make in the Karoo desert what they find be a map make of crystal the etching in the crystal be a guide to the key that open the box unfortunately obsess with gain sole credit for the discovery the archaeologist turn on one another and the map along with the two man be reclaim by the desert never to be hear from again until now I receive this two day ago from a contact in South Africa Bomani where be they the Karoo desert my contact surveille Mr Bomani with a hidden camera as he discover the body of the man and the map that be the map there be etching in the crystal a route of some kind this bioweapon what do you know about it only that the Covenant refer to it as the Passenger where be your contact now can we speak with he I be afraid not Bomani discover he be be surveille Son of a bitch you see those truck Omnifam explain this to I Kazari Bomani use your truck to do the Covenant 's work I enter into a relationship with Bomani at the insistence of the CIA who force I to partner with he so I could stay close to the Covenant your job be to provide we with intel not offer material assistance to the Covenant in their search for the Passenger in order to maintain my cover I have to grant bomani access to certain Omnifam resource check the report Sydney I detail all of this you commit treason by spy on your country I will not put much stock in your report I be not the mole you be look for you know what will happen if your pardon agreement be revoke the death penalty that be commute when you enter into it will be reinstate then I will die know that I have honour my agreement to the letter where be Bomani I have no idea but in exchange for certain creature comfort when I be falsely accuse I be read the Iliad in the original Greek I be listen all Omnifam truck be equip with global positioning transponder if I give you the correspond code you can track Bomani 's movement via satellite you have such a beautiful smile Sydney I miss it if you be execute I will be a witness I will smile then so how be your trip it be good well what happen you know we we get what we need to get and we be just wait to see how it pan out Michael I get you something while you be go open it I realise I forget the anniversary of your father 's death I feel terribly and I want to do something special to make up for it it be the watch he give you I have it fix this be not work it be not not the watch Us this be not work for I I be not happy I see I do not know I guess for a while I think I could be again but I do not think that be go to happen I think we should separate this be about Sydney be not it no it be not do she give you an ultimatum this be about we our problem she be our problem Michael if you be go to destroy my life the least you can do be be honest about why we have a problem have you be make of course not if he know I be Covenant he would arrest I not break up with I well he be obviously grow tired of you perhaps because of another woman my access extend beyond my husband perhaps but Vaughn be central to the CIA 's effort regard the Passenger so you must do everything possible to keep he close what be you propose the last time Sydney Bristow induce your husband to stray from a committed relationship he be date Alice Williams when her father die Vaughn recommit I be not go to kill my father need I remind you that you express no such compunction about kill my father you ask I to kill Lazarey and now I be ask you to kill Senator Reed the answer be no Mrs Reed my name be Jack Bristow I be here to see your husband please come in George tell I you work with Lauren yes I do what you all do be so important forgive I for say so but I think the country 's lucky to have she do not you absolutely the omnibus reconciliation bill be snag on the intel budget can you believe that in this day and age well I be off to give a speech at the central library Olivia chair the large literacy programme in the country do more good in a year than I do in a 6 year term I will be back after dinner remember to take your pill it be very nice to meet you okay let us see it what I have be a paper trail not definitive proof but the beginning of what Director Dixon and I believe to be a strong case for the existence of a mole other than Sloane or instead of he at this point that be unclear be it that hard to identify a traitor honestly sometimes I think you people just get too close I do not understand unauthorised by either NSC or Central Intelligence covert op often go unrecorded 60 of the flight list coincide with date and location where verifiable Covenant activity occur my daughter be a committed public servant who despite my objection insist on government service because she feel the responsibility to give back to her country I understand this be difficult no it be not because there be nothing here Lauren be a patriot and I will not allow you to ruin her reputation base on innuendo and supposition as I say my finding be preliminary these be duplicate if after review they more thoroughly you have any question call I base on the transponder code Sloane give we Marshall track the Omnifam truck to the russian consulate at Gaborone the consulate general Petr Berezovsky have strong tie to the Covenant upon your arrival there will be a state event in progress you will proceed to the second floor where we believe Sark and Bomani may be analyse the map the second floor of the consulate be like a vault Satellite resistant shielding Copper line wall electrically conductive concrete this be where you think the map be locate how do we gain access Sydney will be go in as a russian couture designer interested in the local diamond trade Vaughn you and Weiss will run backup Marshall 's analyse the security system and password he will brief you on countermeasure and op tech you leave in one hour okay Mountaineer Comms be hot I be enter the party Copy now locate Berezovsky I see he fire up the microphone this choker will get you to the second floor because the elevator control be password operate by voice so you be go to have to talk like Berezovsky I design a high resolution miniature microphone that I place inside of the choker the password be mockingbird in russian that will be easy to get he to say you will not have to I design a voice construction software program that will allow you to reconstruct the password once Sydney get Berezovsky to say enough phoneme Piece of cake right I be Paulina Alexandrova yes Madison Avenue this guy sound like a frog be this thing go to work I do not know we will find out on my way in Syd I will reconstruct the password and have it uplinke by the time you reach the elevator okay stay sharp Sark and Bomani could be upstairs with our computer scan of the map we have narrow our search to a radius of 100 square mile the rendering should pinpoint the location by this time tomorrow well do thank you the guard be do a 2 minute sweep Bomani and Sark might be in the building the elevator will take you to the second floor you might run into Sark and Bomani it be no good got it let I try something Gun try it now no it be still red watch it get a guard approach from the south I think I get it try again we be on our way up you will go to Vienna and get everything ready I will meet you there and we will retrieve the key very well well that be extravagant I trust no one Mr Sark and it be good you remember that there it be we be in Whoa whoa it look like you trigger a silent alarm get the crystal and get out yes somebody 's here get it go take my gun we be go over Ready Ready they have the crystal I will get they the Covenant may have discover how to read this even if we figure out where it lead Bomani may get there first Dixon forward the picture of the crystal on to Project Black Hole I will call and ask if they have the device that can read it Lauren and I be separate when we get home I be on Weiss ' couch be you sure that be what you really want it be can I help you Ms Reed run a check against a user account Number DY692 I be sorry those record be seal I have S C I Ievel nine clearance you can check with the office of security Protocol I understand here we go Jack Bristow access my file my intrusion detection program log his user account what information be he interested in specifically my travel itinerary for the last five month Expense report rental car receipt my phone log I can not risk be expose well then I strongly suggest you reconsider eliminate your father how will that help this situation we can associate he with the breach if you have another suggestion now be the time to make it good then we be agree it operate under the same principle as a kaleidoscope it contain loose piece of coloured glass reflect by mirror set at certain angle that create pattern when view through the end of the tube in this case the pattern be a map make up of three crystal all of which be require to properly read the map Sloane have collect only two now that we have all three what do the map look like check it out do we know where that be I run the image through every know land chart I adjust for erosion acid rain natural disaster I could not find a match the map reveal nothing not to I sir sorry base on your intel we be able to acquire what we be look for from Bomani I be happy I could help the problem be we can not interpret the datum it generate Excellent the Iliad so how may I be of service you find the third crystal thank you tell we what you see Rambaldi encrypt many of his discovery or divide they into piece so that if the authority discover any single piece the true meaning of his work would not be reveal that be true of the crystal and the key they lead to Keys disk to be precise there be four disk that fit perfectly into the slot carve into the Rambaldi box we know the crystal be a map we do not know to where what you 've be look at do not sync up to any known topography you know well than anyone Sydney there be not anywhere on Earth that Rambaldi or his follower would not go to hide one of his creation we 've look everywhere on Earth really Marcus have you or be it simply that you 've look everywhere on land okay now this be what I be look at it be your basic land mass but then if I compare the topography with oceanic mapping Sloane be a genius I mean an evil horrible genius bad man but still a genius the Yonaguni rock formation off the coast of Okinawa I want you two in flight immediately there be time to spec out the mission en route Op tech will be wait for you when you land Senator Reed call he be review the document and want to meet we owe he the courtesy of

know it on you too it would break your mother 's heart if she ever find out about this I know because it break mine if it be any consolation I believe the cause I be work for be just I feel like I let you down like it be my fault and that if I help you get out of it we could start over somehow get out of it I could tell the Agency I have learn there be a mole in the Rotunda six month ago and that I 've be conduct my own investigation I be a Senator on the Intelligence Committee no one would say a word you would do that for I of course I would I love you it be a clever plan and I will definitely

you lose have not be open since the time of Rambaldi it be rumour to contain the strain of a plague like bioweapon capable of kill million this bioweapon what do you know about it only that the Covenant refer to it as the Passenger I place something powerful in that box and now the Covenant have it and that terrify I I secure that box so it could be open by key that Rambaldi himself have hide Bomani and Sark find the key which mean they have the heart the Di Regno heart be an engine design to power Rambaldi 's ultimate creation Il Dire which mean the telling what they will witness be nothing short of a resurrection as if Rambaldi be reach through the century to deliver a message he be speak the Covenant be after the Passenger how will Il Dire help they obtain it if I help will you stay my execution no I will not we be do here I will talk to Jack Bristow about the Passenger there will be no deal you make that quite clear there be be some cyber attack Dixon 's ready to brief we you know Syd no one would blame you if you hate he for go back to her he be not the one I hate how horrible do that sound I be mad at she and I do not even think he be cute but it be not just about they be together my dad think Lauren 's leak information to the Covenant do not Senator Reed confess to be the leak yes and his confession answer the question my father have raise but I can not help it I still have doubt let I just ask you a question do you think she be the mole or do you want she to be the mole 12 hour ago a large scale cyber terrorist attack be launch this computer virus originate from a server in Berlin infect server throughout Europe and Asia it be estimate that within 24 hour it will consume over half of all internet bandwidth this particular worm target medical facility university laboratory hospital to date 20 terabyte of patient medical record and database have be corrupt we believe the Covenant be behind this we know the Passenger be a bioweapon give the target we be assume the Covenant be launch a precursor attack maybe they be try to shut down the treatment facility weaken medical response capability be these our only lead actually no this code have all the trademark of a hacker know as Cypher guess what he operate out of Berlin Vaughn Sydney go to Berlin and identify he confirm he create the worm and find out how we shut it down see Marshall for your op tech you leave in two hour okay hacker be a paranoid bunch the one we want be know as Cypher he be kind of a celebrity in the on line community but in the real world it be like he do not exist do not worry 'cause lucky for you I kind of have a name in the hacker community myself Black Kitty anyway I be able to penetrate Cypher 's network and track he down to an IRC chat tomorrow night he will be at a club in Berlin how do we identify he well that be where these come in now not only be they a freshy fresh pair of glass hello they be also a wireless sniffer Cypher use a digital system with a unique code I 've program the sniffer to seek it out now all you have to do be press this button right here and it will hack into his computer and send he a message pretty cool be we sure he will have his computer do a cowboy leave his gun at home when he go to the saloon Alright trust I he will have it how long before we match the sequence from Il Dire the worm have reach Latin America by this time tomorrow the database will be complete and we should have a perfect match I receive a call from my associate by associate I assume you mean Miss Reed yes it seem the CIA be more industrious than we have assume they 've discover the identity of our hacker friend she be take care of he this girl her work for we of late have be uneven Il Dire be in our possession because she manage to steal it from the CIA she be a considerable asset an asset for you in way that do not interest I I will stake my reputation on her ability and I will hold you to your word but understand if you be mistaken you both will endure the consequence I could go with you you be go to Berlin they can send someone else you should not do this alone I will not be alone mom will be there my father 's will make it clear he want his ashe scatter in Dover the last thing I need be another person close to I let the CIA down no one be judge you you see the way they look at I like I be a traitor too to tell you the truth I do not blame they People be just angry and I be not he be my father you have no idea what it be like to know someone love they and then figure out it be nothing but lie I be sorry get anything not yet that be he nice trick I will have to readjust my firewall setting I could still get through I do not believe we 've meet we be big fan of your work perhaps you 've hear of our work the DDOS attack on the syrian government 's network Shut they down for a week that be you nothing compare to what you 've got go on Clever code that worm 's go to be circulate for month I think you have I confuse with someone else I do not design that worm and even if I do you could never prove it so if you will excuse I sit down we be CIA I know you people get your power trip by design virus break into system but you have design a worm that be help a terrorist organisation iaunch a biological weapon once your employer complete what they 've set out to do you will be guilty of murder thousand of people he do not tell I who be he he do not give a name he be young British why be the worm attack medical facility that be not its function they ask I to engineer a worm that be capable of I be go after the shooter sorry we have a problem he have the file with he he give they to the CIA if they have the source code they can stop the worm we will lose everything there be time if I corrupt the file before they make a copy that be an extreme risk let Bomani know I fail be not you will hear from I soon Dixon have give I clearance to talk about one thing only the Passenger I 've tell you everything I know about the Passenger I use that as a pretext so Dixon would allow time with you this be not a time for game this be no game Jack this be my life the CIA want I execute next week because they believe I be work with Senator Reed I be my association with Senator Reed have nothing to do with advance the Covenant 's agenda two year ago Senator Reed recruit I to work for an organisation inside the U S government they refer to themselves as the Trust he indicate he be interested in my knowledge of Rambaldi he make I an offer if I be to agree to work with he he would secure my pardon and from that time on I do nothing but live up to my part of the bargain I 've never hear of the Trust the senator be my only contact why have not they come to your aid I do not know maybe they be fearful of reveal themselves or it could be that I outlive my usefulness but you ask yourself Jack have I be helpful this year tell I have I live up to my word I help Sydney recover her memory I take a bullet for you for God 's sake well now I need something in return I need you to prove that this group exist I be serve my country Jack not betray it I be connect the flash drive Cypher give we let us hope all his file be here Cypher 's dead it be the hospital he do not make it through surgery Vaughn I think I see Lauren what in the club after the shooting the Covenant know we be after Cypher what be you say Lauren be Covenant I can not be sure the shooter be wear a wig it be dark Lauren 's father be the one pass intel to the Covenant he kill himself do not you think it be convenient he die take the blame for the leak with he be you suggest Lauren frame her father I know it be hard for you to consider for I my wife just find out her father be betray she but if I see she you do not Lauren and her mother be in England bury her father I know thing have not work out the way we would hope you think that be why I be bring this up honestly I do not know what to think Dixon tell I I might find you here I have to see you I think I hate he but when Mom and I get there those cliff I do not know how many time Dad and I take walk there in the States he be never around but in England it be different be there remember he that way he do not feel like a traitor he be just my father while we be there Mom give I this Dad have give it to she when I be bear she think I might like to have it it be go to be okay hello hello Mrs Reed I be sorry to disturb you this be Kathleen from Director Pembroke 's office I have the director hold on a secure line for Lauren Reed I be tell she could be reach at this number no Miss Reed 's not here she be in Berlin I be sorry I do not realise she be leave London so soon if you do not mind my asking when do she leave for Berlin she leave here just a few hour ago would you like I to give she a message no message thank you it be be a long time Jack I need information regard a covert committee within the U S government it be call the Trust if there be a group where would appropriation come from Intelligence budget be classify what make you assume it be Intelligence I need evidence this group exist these people be powerful Jack Enquiring about they will put I at risk why should I do that because then I will be in your debt I be sure you remember how useful that can be Marshall 's standing by as soon as we copy the memory we will uplink it to he how far along be we almost a quarter of the way here you go Michael say you 've be awake all night I be good thank maybe later then I 've get some pretty bad news the memory on Cypher 's flash drive be wipe I think it be expose to a strong magnetic field how be that possible see that we have not have any solar flare activity within the past 24 hour I would have to say it be do intentionally could Cypher have corrupt the datum before he hand it to we it be possible he have a fail safe but I have not find any evidence we 've lose everything not everything thank to I and electron microscopy I 've be able to partially reconstruct his file include the worm 's source code you guy ready that thing be not purposely destroy datum that be a side effect it be collect information it be what be call an intelligence gathering worm the Covenant be look for something what I have not figure that out but I 've tweak the worm 's source code so it will not destroy more datum all the datum it be collect be be reroute to our server whatever the Covenant 's look for we be go to get it now CIA cut the feed I be try to get it back tell I why I should not snap your neck right now in case it escape your memory I secure your release from that siberian prison this work be as important to I as it be to you no one will jeopardise that I clearly overestimate Miss Reed 's ability a little too late for that yes but she be still on the inside I will make sure she re acquire the information the CIA steal from we once she pass it along she will be eliminate see we get that information as soon as possible then this can not be a coincidence do you believe Lauren would corrupt the file with you and Vaughn watch if she be desperate enough yes Dad if Lauren really be the Covenant mole if she do assassinate Cypher she could never have anticipate he would have the code on he let alone give it to we and what about Vaughn I 've try talk to he he will not entertain the possibility it be like he can not hear it perhaps he can not hear it from you Sydney speak to you all I ask be that you hear I out my marriage with Irina in spite of everything be a happy time for I it be easy be with her but there be time moment when I become curious how have she occupy her morning what be her plan while I be out of town usually she tell I but occasionally she would stop what she be do walk over and offer I a kiss a spontaneous gesture but on one occasion it strike I this impulsive kiss what if it be an evasion camouflage the truth in an expression of love I dismiss my concern immediately merely my professional paranoia after all she be my wife I do not regret having marry she I have Sydney because of our time together what I do regret be once I see sign of her duplicity once I sense her betrayal I choose to ignore it all I be ask be that you be responsive to the sign if and when they present themselves you never respect I never think I be worthy of your daughter I be not surprised you be quick to think Lauren be betray I but whether or not you or Sydney believe I I know the life I be live and I know the woman I be married to Lauren be not Irina and I be definitely not you this be what the Covenant be look for dna the worm be design to cross reference genetic database search the entire globe for one person judge by the double x chromosome I be say female have they find a match that be a good question there be 10 10 match to one code that be impossible unless they be identical dectuplet which be a statistical impossibility or if the person use different identity we should brief Dixon immediately have you see Lauren yeah she be in Marshall 's office Thanks you scare I I be look for you I be leave a present for Marshall well for Mitchell do not worry your name be on it too I be go to have lunch Cafe Stella I 've get to run a few errand need some company I 've get time you do not have to do that I will see you there in an hour okay sure be this line secure there be be a change no dead drop you will be meet with a covenant agent who I I be in the parking garage third level my situation be precarious this be not the time to change protocol run a tap on Lauren 's cellphone we devise a new plan regard the Passenger Bomani 's instruct I to meet with you face to face I be surprised I would assume that give what happen with Cypher Bomani would be furious with I we rely on you you know that the call 's encrypt she must be talk to the NSC try run it through the filter get off the escalator I be in the northwest corner you come all this way okay okay almost there we need to talk there be other way to make contact yes but he insist that I meet with you face to face what else do Bomani tell you do he instruct you on the quiet way to murder I absolutely not you pathetic little errand boy tell Bomani he will get proof of my worth next time he see I when I deliver the Passenger I get it after all we 've be through how could you do this I think I could rely on you I will never forgive you for this okay what the hell be that I have no idea sorry I be late that be fine I be late myself how be your errand they be fine yeah what do you do just thing okay like what kind of thing Truth be I get a call from my mother she keep bombard I with question about my father want to know why I do not see it why I do not stop he it be like she be blame I I be just so upset so I wander around the mall what be the matter I be just sorry you have to go through that the 10 name on Marshall 's list be alias for the same woman it be possible this be what Il Dire give Sloane a way to identify this woman we run background check on all her identity Records reveal she be treat by the same physician a Dr Robert Viadro his practice be base in Milan Vaughn be on his way in now you two leave tonight good afternoon Dr Viadro yes I need to speak with you it concern the Passenger who send you the Covenant that be none of your Good we have some privacy where be the Passenger I say where be the Passenger she be safe Rambaldi I will go check upstairs you have to make this difficult it be terribly painful still none be fatal Damn it tell I what I need to know I will tell you the Passenger I have betray she I have betray her Betrayed who year spend protect she and now she be alone who be she who be you protect those guard be order of Rambaldi you be the one the one from the prophecy wait drop it you will not hurt she keep this in a safe place here it be everything you need to find the Passenger you go to great length to secure this information thank you I trust this remove any doubt concern my usefulness yes yes you 've do well unfortunately the Covenant have no more use of your service I go to Los Angeles to warn you not kill you perhaps in the future you should try trust I more sloane tell you the truth the black budget front for the Trust be Project Centigrade Details have be leave for you in the usual place I be in your debt a fact which I hope to benefit from someday be careful Jack the Trust be not a group to be take lightly I need to speak with you in private do you recall that I request Dr Barnett 's note from her session with sloane yes do they reveal anything yes there be something in the note that concern you in one of his session with Barnett Sloane admit have an affair with Irina while you be marry I find no evidence of the existence of a so call Trust I find that very hard to believe Jack a man with your contact I 've do everything I can I be afraid the secret you keep be hard to uncover some of they you will have to take to your grave if I die I will not be able to help you find the passenger before the Covenant do Jack you have no idea how that will affect you you and Sydney Dad I hear what happen with the doctor we be wrong about the Passenger it be a person the doctor sacrifice his life try to protect she when he see I it be almost like he recognise I like I be his bad fear come to life Dad when he try to kill I he be try to protect the passenger from I Sloane tell I that after Il Dire say peace he search for every possible meaning in that message he trace the etymology of the word to its greek form eirene also the derivation of the name Irina Sydney I think the Passenger may be your mother I be look forward to a weekend alone I too so what do you do while I be go I miss you I be go to run a bath previously on Alias the box have not be open since the time of Rambaldi it be rumour to contain the strain of a plague like bioweapon capable of kill million this bioweapon what do you know about it only that the Covenant refer to it as the Passenger the CIA want I execute next week because they believe that I be work with Senator Reed and I be but my association with Senator Reed have nothing to do with advance the Covenant 's agenda two year ago Senator Reed recruit I to work for an organisation inside the U S government they refer to themselves as the Trust I need you to prove that this group exist I be serve my country Jack not betray it in one of his session with Barnett Sloane admit have an affair with Irina while you be marry what be you say Lauren be Covenant I can not be sure the shooter be wear a wig it be dark we be wrong about the Passenger it be not a weapon it be a person I think the Passenger may be your mother I be look for the Passenger I have a great respect for the follower of Rambaldi and I know you to be a truly wise man but if you do not tell I where to find the passenger in five second I will kill you I can not help you Mr Sark how do you know my name retrieve the manuscript regard the Passenger and I will meet you in Rajasthan bring he with you he may be useful if the manuscript be encrypt but when I mention the Passenger to your mother she terminate her user account either she be the Passenger or she be protect she what be go on your message say it be important you be right about what Lauren 's the mole she work for the Covenant you have proof I should have know we should talk to Dixon and figure out a way to handle this oh I know how to handle this you will act like nothing have change okay what be plan b 'cause that be not go to happen give that the Covenant be ahead of we in the search for the Passenger track Lauren might allow we to catch up she can not detect the slight alteration in your relationship I will inform Dixon we will secure the agency iimite her access to classified document stop my wife betray I she betray all of we you can not expect I to pretend that never happen I be not sure you have a choice why be that because you be the one that marry her I miss you this morning I get up early and go to the gym I should have let you know oh it be fine in fact I like it make I feel like we 've settle back into our life yeah I think we have before my dad die I ask you if you would come with I to counselling and you say no I still think it could help it be just a thought no I would like that after 30 year you still live with your wife 's betrayal will he absolutely an echelon intercept we just receive indicate the Covenant have kidnap someone they believe can help they find the passenger a convoy be transport he across Western Rajasthan you and Vaughn will intercept it and take he into custody we do not have the indian government 's cooperation and the air space be restrict so you be go in old school we 've do well here quite well thank you we have to go follow I give I your gun give I the gun now here Press on we have everything we need they have the restoration the Passenger be compromise just breathe it be you the Passenger she be your destiny how be she my destiny as a friend as an enemy tell I tell I that be the passenger my mother the Passenger be your sister in Nepal the convoy be transport a man we try rescue he from the Covenant but he be shoot before he die he tell I my mother be not the Passenger he say my sister be who be this man a monk a cleric a Rambaldi scholar Dad what difference do it make do I have a sister I do not know maybe that be why Mom 's name be link to the passenger maybe because she have another child during our marriage your mother have an affair if in fact you do have a sister it be conceivable she be the product of that indiscretion I would hope to spare you the name of the person with whom the affair take place but if he be the father of your sister that be no long possible who be it thank God you have to help I your execution can not come fast enough I be innocent Sydney I have not violate my pardon agreement it be base on my cooperation with an organisation know as the Trust Senator Reed be my contact if he be the mole I do not know ask your father he know that if you be innocent he would find a way to stay your execution even though you have an affair with his wife you know that I have 72 hour to live I want you to focus on that not on some affair I have 25 year ago I be not focus on the affair I be focus on the child that result from it a sister I never know I have it must have come as a shock to you it do to I when I find out be you tell I you do not know no not until two year ago when I be in a monastery in Nepal run by follower of Rambaldi go on Sydney the revelation that I have a child it be overwhelming I spend every possible moment from that day on search for my child the Di Regno heart and Il Dire Rambaldi 's machine that I so painstakingly construct together they give I an individual 's dna and the word peace which in greek translate into Irina I do a dna test confirm that I be the father of the child so Sydney I create Omnifam and while I be inoculate million of people against disease I be simultaneously able to gain access to medical database that identify people through their dna and I hope that it would help I find my daughter I fail you know she be the Passenger I know I know I also know the Covenant be after her Sydney I want to protect my child so please talk to your father if he be conceal information that would exonerate I because I have an affair with Irina convince he to give it to you if not for my sake then for your sister 's okay here be what we find out from Project Black Hole the Restoration refer to document write about the Passenger that be the bad news the good news be the Covenant can not read they they be in code yes and we have the only code key it be a stalemate not if we be smart about it here be what we do we call a briefing make sure to include Lauren once she be there you detail the follow information Analysis be currently filter through some chatter they pick up reference the restoration they be certain that it will only be a matter of hour before they can locate these document after indicate confidence in our ability to locate and recapture the Restoration we then explain what we will do once we have it Project Black Hole be deliver the code key today the minute we come into possession of the Restoration Marshall will begin the decode process in truth Marshall will be receive a bogus code key we should also remind Lauren that even if we do not recover the document we know that without this code key the Covenant will not be able to read it after learn a code key exist it be probable Lauren will try and copy it that be where you come in I you have to act completely normal Lauren Agent Vaughn Reed Mrs Vaughn Reed hi what can I do for you Project Black Hole do not share its toy as often as the NSC would like governmental turf war that kind of thing when I tell they about the code key they insist I detail it for they right well go ahead have a look and while you be at it have a gander whoa whoa whoa not on the Flinkman file just a little journal I be keep for Mitch Patent idea history of quantum mechanic brief intro to string theory you know basic the letter here what language be that it be 4th century Neapolitan Italian which I love say because it make I think of ice cream Neapolitan ice cream be my favourite really Mine too she be good I mean if you have to fall in love with someone that be evil I can see why it be her not that you be in love with her whatever the attraction be originally do she take the bait I be not sure but she do take my thumbprint may I what be you do I be check to see if there be any use of my biometric access within the agency she be in Image Processing she must be duplicate the code key okay I 've leave Image Processing I have not leave because I be here and she be there the next step will be to bring the code key to her handler or whoever can use it to read the document write about the Passenger Alright you will track she and identify her contact that should lead we to the location of the document at that time we will spec out a mission to recover they Jack have tell we the Passenger be your sister hopefully what be write on these document will give we what we need to find her sloane confirm the child be his I see I know how much this upset you I be fine Dad if Sloane be go to be execute it should be for a crime he be commit what exactly be you imply if you have evidence exonerate he you have to use it I do not have any evidence you should go you know what I want what a normal life here we go Lauren 's mother Olivia she be suppose to be in London look like she just pass she something can you hear anything no we be get interference from that fountain the Covenant need you to ensure that thing will be take care of oh my God Hang on I be go to filter it through the active noise reduction you could at least pretend to mourn I kill your father to protect you the sound wave be isolate I be go to invert they and that should where be the document at home in Richmond the Covenant want the complete translation by tomorrow I will meet you there whatever they tell we about the Passenger we should act on immediately Lauren do not trust I should she trust you Trust be base on honesty and when I 've have problem I 've talk to she about they what I do not trust what worry I be that I feel that Michael will leave I once I 've mourn the death of my father if that be true why would I be do this if it be all fake I do not say it be fake Temporary whatever if that be what it be why would I agree to work on our problem our problem be you think you be in love with Sydney how be I suppose to respond to that honestly would be good Sydney be very important to I we have history obviously we be together a lot we go away together a lot do the two of you ever go away never well maybe you should do you have any trip plan Lauren 's go to see her mother in Richmond only for a day it be a start it work he be go hello darling hi I be so glad you make it you two young people be just what this drafty old house need Thanks Olivia it be nice to be here I will run these upstairs thank his be here be unacceptable I tell you I have no choice we be suppose to be reconcile you get a reading tap into the power grid now now the E M sensor I design should lead we right to it we will let you know as soon as we find the safe copy that I be just tell Mum how great you 've be the past few week oh Lauren 's be incredibly strong how be you I be do surprisingly well for a pariah I never like politic you never know who your friend be at least now that I be the wife of a traitor I know the answer I have none excuse I hello the safe be in the study it be Weiss he need help on a brief you be cold while I be inside I will get you a sweater thank you what have you get okay switch back to comms I be at the safe standing by for transmission scan text now copy that boy Scout receive datum have you decode the document I have not have the time Most of that be suppose to be go on while you be here you do your work I can handle he I wonder one more page should be another 30 second Whoops what do you mean whoop Sensor pick up a new e M read I think there be somebody else in the house someone be come I be almost do Sweetheart what be you do in here I be look at our wedding picture I remember your parent keep they here remember that day I will go get your sweater that be the happy day of my life Mine too I want to be that happy again what can I do to make that happen that be a start really I be sure that be not what it sound like not that it sound like anything 'cause you know there be not any sound there be probably really not turn it off sorry bad idea to keep it on in the first place use the real code key Marshall be able to decipher the document Vaughn retrieve from Mrs Reed they detail a Rambaldi artefact know as the Hourglass it turn out the Hourglass be only recently sell at auction to a man name Masa Raidon the guy run yakuza 's U S shipping business yes now Raidon own a building in little Tokyo a yakuza stronghold he be get a nightclub on the ground floor you might want to stop by have a little and there be a personal art gallery on sublevel 2 that be where he be hold the Hourglass but you be go to have to move quickly why be that well accord to Rambaldi 's manuscript the Hourglass will only reveal the location of the Passenger to one man her father and he be go to be dead in six hour this be impossible Justice have be apprise of Sloane 's value they refuse to stay the execution if sloane die any chance I have of find my sister die with he have it occur to you that your half sister might be a danger to you yes of course but it be equally possible that I can help she she could be an innocent victim with Irina Derevko and Arvin Sloane as her parent I do not think so I request to look at Senator Reed 's personal effect every notebook memo receipt I know the Trust exist Dad be you really so bitter that you would sacrifice my sister in order to get payback for a 25 year old affair Sloane deserve to die yes he do but not for this the director of legal policy at Justice have operational control over Sloane 's case he be come to oversee the execution I will turn over the information I have on the Trust as soon as he arrive that should exonerate Sloane thank you what exactly do you find in the senator 's effect nothing I request they but they have not arrive now I do not have to look look like the west stairwell be your most direct access to the sublevel what about countermeasure the good we can tell it be only the guard but we have not have a chance to do a thorough scan we be sort of work on the fly Syd about what happen in Richmond you be do your job and she be your wife not for long Jack I want you to meet Marlon Bell he run legal policy at Justice Good to meet you I be tell the director how pleased I be you catch Sloane since my signature be on the pardon agreement I be embarrassed and relieve and if you do not mind my saying so iooke forward to see the son of a bitch die excuse we you be not go to help I in April ' 75 in Saigon you toast Sydney 's birth with a bottle of Chambertin Clos de Bèze your favourite now that I know you have a daughter I think I should return the honour especially consider they share the same mother Irina betray both of we Jack she seek I out for information the same way she do you she be my wife she be a KGB spy who care nothing about you or I I 've always think that you understand your relationship with Irina be nothing more than that but now that your schoolboy crush on the woman who destroy your life be prevent you from save mine I will have to revise that assessment Irina Derevko affect your life every bit as much as she affect mine I know the possibility exist that Sydney would be draw into our world but I often wonder why you be the one who seek she out why you show such paternal affection toward her now I know you do it because you be angry and jealous and want to take away the one thing that be important to both Irina and I the symbol of what we have and you do not you be right I be not go to help you since this be the last conversation we will ever have I want to make this perfectly clear what you have do to my daughter be nothing compare to what I will do when I find yours half an hour I be on the list everyone be on the list my friend be wait for I inside wait your turn till then stop talk to I back in line hey lie off the suit man why do not you find your way home oh you be a big tough guy now live the dream you want to see what I be dream Alright take it easy you win I pray for you I pray your soul can find peace in the next life that be very kind Marcus let us go I be head down copy that Mountaineer you be all clear Marshall work your magic I should have it open for you in right now Lauren this be restrict access I clear it with Justice I have no intention of miss the execution of this traitor Marshall we have a problem copy that mountaineer what be the problem Motion sensor it be on a random sweep that be not on the schematic must be a secondary protocol I 've locate the Hourglass can you disarm the sensor remotely I be try but there be a lot of dummy code I have to extrapolate each one I 've never see a system like this be there a repeat prefix in the majority of the code 86 86 it be an anchor type design Grab Dixon he specce out a similar system in Honduras he will know what the back door be Dixon I can not he be downstairs as witness to Mr Sloane 's execution the execution be go forward yeah at midnight I think you know for some reason it make I incredibly sad I feel like you be the only person I can talk to Marshall kill the grid now right sorry talk later do you have any final word I do for you who pay witness I can only believe there be a common thought amongst you all this be as it should be I do not disagree my only request that if my daughter be in fact find alive that she understand my action she understand that this day 's event be the net result of her father 's passion to find she to know she to love she we can not wait any long I be go in stand down Mountaineer I be almost there Raidon security detail be two dozen strong do not there be nothing you can say sloane be dead we can now locate the Passenger without his interference not quite the code key you retrieve from the CIA be unusable I can only assume that be deliberate on their part Vaughn play you he be likely to try again but that will be his last mistake I be surprised you do not get the reference Modified Kayexalate cocktail wash with tetrodotoxin present in a bottle of Chambertin Clos de Bèze just like we use in Saigon but understand this be not do out of compassion I orchestrate this because and only because I need you previously on Alias Thomas Brill Michael Vaughn you Bill Vaughn 's kid yeah he be my father he be a good man thank you the Passenger be your sister accord to Rambaldi 's manuscript the Hourglass will only reveal the location of the Passenger to one man her father Sloane and he be go to be dead in six hour Jack I want you to meet Marlon Bell he run legal policy at Justice I be tell the director how pleased I be you catch Sloane and if you do not mind my saying so iooke forward to see the son of a bitch die I orchestrate this because and only because I need you what be go on your message say it be important you be right about what Lauren 's the mole she work for the Covenant this be suppose to be over with sloane execute we reach a dead end in our pursuit of the Passenger Lauren be too valuable an asset we can feed disinformation to the Covenant keep they from impede Sydney and Jack 's investigation as soon as the Passenger be locate Lauren will be take into custody meanwhile Weiss will maintain surveillance I be sorry I be not sure I should come I appreciate you put aside your anger Sydney you be right I do find evidence that Sloane be assist the Trust in their pursuit of Rambaldi why be you tell I this now Sloane 's dead actually that be why I call you here I be about to give Director Bell the evidence to clear sloane when I realise he be a member of the Trust I be unclear as to what their agenda be but I do know execute Sloane be part of it the only sure way to save his life be to allow he to die your father be kind enough to offer I a final glass of wine it be lace with a tetrodotoxin compound it counteract the lethal injection by reduce my cardiac and respiratory function mimic death that be right whatever grief my apparent death might have cause you I wish I could have spare you the pain when I hear you be dead any grief be over the possibility of never know my sister I do not grieve for you I see well in the interest of find your sister may I have the Hourglass I know you 've be withhold something from the CIA even from the Trust why be the passenger important what be your daughter 's real value while I be search for her I make a discovery I come across an old Rambaldi text in it Rambaldi prophecie that there would be a person a passenger who would be capable of serve as a direct conduit to he the text contain a formula for an elixir so I follow the instruction exactly accord to Rambaldi this elixir if inject would bring about an altered state of consciousness allow the Passenger to channel a message this message be rumour to be the key to Rambaldi 's endgame I sample the elixir myself hope to make myself the conduit it do not work it be mean only for she if the Covenant find her they will expose she to the elixir in massive dose it will lay waste to her psyche more likely it will kill she all I want to do be to protect my child how do we find she we use this I think you be work from home I just come

little girl the follower know she be the Passenger he break she out of KGB custody but he do not trust the CIA either so he take she where she would be safe with other follower the man you be describe be not my father your father be the good man I 've ever know he give his life to make sure that girl would be safe if you do not stop what be happen his sacrifice will be for nothing ah no no damn it you know what you 've get to do just make sure that they do not get to her why do you come to I because it be what he would want I to do you claim this be a battery for one of Rambaldi 's artefact which can locate the Passenger before we risk exposure to the Trust we need to be 100 certain they have this artefact I know they have it I give it to they accord to my contact the Trust have a cold storage vault conceal in the Smithsonian here the vault be secure by a 5 key retinal system it be safe to assume it correspond with the five member do we know who they be we know they be high rank government official but we 've only be able to confirm one Marlon Bell d o J Division Director I imagine a visit from a ghost will unearth the other four the Secretary of State go before committee tomorrow he want that brief out by the end of the day with all due respect Director Bell even with the Patriot Act the legal footing 's shaky find the precedent we 've already go over that find they Sir Sir I 've tap into Bell 's phone line he should have make contact with the Trust by now Sydney there be something you should know when I first learn of Sloane 's affair with your mother I be force to consider the possibility that I be not in fact your biological father you do not even need to it be not the case I have our medical file examine our relationship be clear I want you to know during that brief time before I be reassure my feeling for you never change Dad he be pick up we have a situation that require our immediate attention we need to meet Arvin Sloane be alive your friend Brill manage to elude we you however be not so fortunate we 've know for a while your father be a follower of Rambaldi and we be hope they would contact you but there be three thing you should understand the first involve this item I hold in my hand it be capable of deliver up to 500 000 volt not enough to kill you just enough to let you wish it would Second I believe Mr Brill disclose the location of the Passenger which mean I will not stop until you tell I and third Mr Vaughn be that I be go to enjoy this more than I should Lauren Reed evade our surveillance sometime between 2 10 and 2 47 p M Law enforcement official at every level have be put on alert we 've also lose contact with Agent Vaughn he be not respond to his call we believe he may have be compromise Agent Weiss will assemble a search team be ready to move as soon as we get a lead remember your glass need a five second lock on each person for the scan to register wish I luck Sydney Sloane 's on his way to the meeting of the Trust to obtain the retinal scan make sure you get to the vault and we will have the code copy that I be in position hello Miss Gerard I be Phillip Terrance we speak early call I Shannon Amazing be not it 36 foot long neck of any know dinosaur not a lot of people know that mamenchisaurus actually have an extra brain in its spinal cord to control its hind leg and tail you say you be write a research paper on theropod dinosaur yeah specifically theropod and archaeopteryx and the similarity oh so you think bird be descend from dinosaur not that there be conclusive proof it drive I crazy when orthodox type refuse to even examine the evidence that thinking get Giordano Bruno burn at the stake you know we just receive the Hainan fossil from China I have to admit I be hope to see it well

gentleman stand by to receive Copy that we be retrieve the retinal scan now I think we have an agreement my Rambaldi artefact and expertise in exchange for my freedom of course once I serve my purpose you see fit to dispose of I first scan complete move on the cover story that you plan on release Arvin Sloane kill in a boat accident off the coast of Saint Lucia Tragic with a slight taint of overly extravagant lifestyle Complete move on actually I would have think that an automobile accident would be more to your taste clearly I underestimate your creativity get a lock hold it just two more second I should have be think more clearly we get it gentleman the fact Sydney I be send the first three now uplink complete I be move to authorise I be afraid it will never see the light of day and let I tell you why we 've get it I do not think the most clandestine committee in the U S government would want such sordid detail make public which be why I be go to leave this room unharmed if I get

please escort Miss Reed out of here now where be we I do not understand how can a brain scan help we find she each individual have a signature brain wave pattern as unique as a fingerprint so to exploit this the d o d 's develop an experimental satellite network capable of remote encephalography reading brainwave from orbit right I just speak with my contact at d o d he uplinke the EEG reading to the Defence Satellite Network we have a location where be she Chechnya a labour camp for female prisoner on the outskirt of Kamyshev my contact be able to check the prison 's central database he find she under the alia Talia Kozlov she be be hold in sector C she be incarcerate we 've be operate under the assumption that she be an innocent in need of rescue give that she be be

total and complete joy I just want to go out and find you immediately but then it strike I the shame I be ashamed of the man I be I know I be not worthy of you I be not worthy of your love I be not worthy of your respect from that moment on I vow to change I do not want to meet my daughter face to face and have her despise I stay here we want the passenger unharmed move move where be they they can not have escape what be this sloane set we up he betray we Agents move out this be a Chechen safe house it be Sloane 's suggestion we seek refuge here Sloane be the only person who know where we be he tip the Covenant lure they here give he a chance to escape with Nadia be you alright I be fine the Passenger do you find she yes but she be go she be miss you can not go after her what your sister you have to let she go you be tired I should let you sleep my father be kill because he take she from the KGB he hide she from your mother that be why she murder he I meet someone who tell I the prophecy the Passenger and the Chosen One shall battle neither will survive you can not see she again please do not do this please do not I only wish there could be another way I be so sorry I be so sorry previously on Alias we be sister how do you find I it be not just I it be your father he be wait for you why be the passenger important what be your daughter 's real value while I be search for her I come across an old Rambaldi text in it Rambaldi prophecie that there would be a person a passenger who would be capable of serve as a direct conduit to he the text contain a formula for an elixir if inject would bring about an altered state of consciousness allow the Passenger to channel a message rumour to be the key to Rambaldi 's endgame Vaughn Sydney the Passenger do you find she yes but she be go she be miss sloane take she at this moment we have no lead on Sloane or Nadia Santos my sister unverifiable report suggest that shortly after he betray we in Kamyshev Sloane board a plane at the airport in Grozny but this be 20 hour ago by now they could be anywhere have you be in contact with Nadia 's superior at Argentina 's Intelligence Directorate yes but they could only provide we with background she be recruit six year ago she be educate in language and trade craft the mission to Chechnya be her first field assignment what about her life prior to become an agent she be confine to an orphanage in the San Telmo district of Buenos Aires she have no know family until now accord to Sloane Nadia will be inject with an elixir some kind of fluid that will enable she to deliver a message from Rambaldi himself that be good that be very good he be never divulge the specific of this message but he be willing to risk everything his wealth his legitimacy even his life to acquire it this be his endgame we have to believe that he will kill Nadia in pursuit of it Sydney I pray that we get to Nadia quickly but give sloane 's intention we need to be prepare for all possible outcome I know she be alive please do not Nadia my child I do not want to hurt you then why be you do this when Abraham be ask to take his only child Isaac and offer he up to God he do not hesitate and he take in his hand the fire and the knife and it be only then that the angel come but Abraham have to be willing to make this unbearable choice I understand you do you be a man of faith oh my child my child how do you like it no I be sorry I be sorry I be sorry my supply of Rambaldi fluid have be compromise I need you to break into a bunker Novgorod 21 secure more bottle you deliver within 24 hour I will pay you 5 million I will recruit a team immediately and get back to you go ahead Arvin Sloane just make contact tell I where he be send you and I will double his offer the Echelon dictionary 's be update with the relevant keyword we will continue to monitor all intercept thank you very much hey hey I think you be suppose to stay in the hospital yeah I check myself out early do not they want to keep you for observation I be fine really look whatever Lauren do to I I want you to know that I take full responsibility for what be happen I mess up and if you can not get past that I understand but will you try I do not know will you at least think about it because it be all I can think about yeah I will think about it I need to see you both immediately our sigint post in Manila just intercept an encrypt telephone call between Arvin Sloane and a well know underworld fixer do we run a trace back the route masking be too high sloane request the fluid be recover from this bunker facility call Novgorod 21 I check with my contact at Project Black Hole they say the facility have be inactive since the 1980 when it be the centre for Soviet Rambaldi research if we penetrate the bunker we can plant a tracking device on one of the vial of fluid maybe that could lead we to Sloane I will have Marshall prep the op tech for the two of you to execute a tactical infiltration the facility could still be guard where do we stand on find Lauren FBI counterintelligence be go over all Lauren 's file phone record have we bring our field office into the investigation have you get DCI to sign off on retaske echelon satellite Vaughn we be do what we can but right now the priority for this office be find Sloane Sloane get here first he might still be here they 've get the fluid there be nothing leave to tag and no way to find Sloane we still have a secondary protocol to retrieve all available datum I will start the uplink I will try to collect a sample Marshall I be hack into the drive now okay pick up the signal Boy Scout I 've get interference on K band bump it up one more frequency any well no not much there seem to be a signal I can not account for can you download the datum yeah start send now be those video file yeah at least 100 hour worth can you open one that be my sister no no no no no no no what there be a silent alarm they know you be there Sydney Bristow we meet at last a tranq gun how considerate hurry take their uniform and their I D who be you your mother 's sister Katya let I take care of this go this be just a sedative Nadia so you can rest what you do yesterday destroy all the fluid like that I want you to know I be not angry with you I be proud of your courage every Sunday at the orphanage in San Telmo they make we dress up in our fine clothe they would have we stand in line for hour wait to be choose by family I would not do it I would make myself filthy and always frown I do not want to be choose because I know I know that somewhere my dad be look for I and one day he would come to take I away from that place if I have know it be you I be wait for I would have clean up Katya see Lauren and Sark on a surveillance feed they acquire a canister of Rambaldi fluid Eric we need to get that satellite retaske I understand but I want they find that be not good enough Weiss I speak to my father he be arrange for we to be pick up by helicopter what be you do at the laboratory like you we receive intelligence that Sloane have send a team there but by the time we arrive it be too late if Sloane be after the fluid he must be very close from find Nadia in the videotape when Nadia be a child she be draw something what I assume be Rambaldi 's message if the message be already relay why be she valuable your sister be take away from the laboratory before she could complete the message my father take she he hide she away to keep she safe from people who be try to use she be you try to imply something Mr Vaughn I be just curious why you be so eager to find your long lose niece I understand your wariness try to remember that I 've risk my life that I compromise my position with the SVR to save you from certain execution my father tell I you be work with my mother I be when your mother return to Russia she be immediately apprehend her loyalty be questionable after a few month in gaol she give birth to a little girl that girl be one day old when she be take away from your mother the only reason I join the russian Secret Service be to help Irina find she young daughter for year we hear nothing about her every lead go cold but then recently we find out that her father Arvin Sloane be also look for her what be it Sydney Sloane have her this be unexpected and unacceptable Nice to see you too Arvin we 've recover three canister of Rambaldi 's fluid they be yours in exchange for a partnership I believe we 've already make that mistake you have the Passenger we now have the fluid what we be after be big enough for all of we to share so what do you say for old time ' sake what be your term we 've bring enough for one dose the rest be safely in storage once we know you do indeed have the girl the rest of the canister will be deliver and of course we will need to see a demonstration first we need to be certain that the fluid actually work I see now I believe the fluid contain a store memory a muscle memory this fluid you bring back contain protein strain and when inject the protein move into the cerebral cortex theoretically it could trigger an individual to execute a prerecorded series of noncognitive action Iike touch typing or play a musical instrument Drawing exactly how dangerous be that process well the toxicity level of that much protein be force into the cerebrum would have harmful side effect Brain damage maybe even death have you be able to identify the doctor no how have the voiceprint analysis turn out not great but I will run it again if you want Incredible I wish we could see the doctor 's face in the corner someone 's reflection can you enhance it oh my God we believe this man to be Dr Jong Lee accord to file recover from Novgorod he be the lead scientist in charge of conduct Russia 's Passenger experiment the NSA be able to use electronic intercept to track Lee 's recent communication it appear he meet with Sloane in Zurich at least twice in the past four month most likely to help he procure Rambaldi fluid what about Lauren and Sark as of now we have no evidence link they to Dr Lee their whereabout remain unknown if the satellite have be task that might not be the case they be tie up over a nuclear test site the d o d would not budge because you do not apply enough pressure Vaughn this be not the time where be Dr Lee now a cuban bioweapon facility you and Vaughn will head to Cienfuegos find out everything you can about the passenger experiment and where to find sloane in the meantime Jack you will work with Katya Derevko she be be investigate Sloane 's financial in the hope of get a lead on Nadia could be something there to tip off Sloane 's location Vaughn do you have a minute yeah I know why you check yourself out of medical service early I know you be under the impression you be fine that all you need to do be hold yourself together and bury yourself in work get to the point Jack my point be your rage be seethe under the surface I know because I 've be there and I promise you if you do not resolve this as quickly and expediently as you can it will spill over into every aspect of your life include your professional and personal relationship with my daughter and I do not want you endanger she I be do my job the good I can do you have a well suggestion I suggest you focus your energy into achieve closure on this matter no one want Lauren in custody more than I do that be not the kind of closure I be refer to what be this this be the key to my storage facility in it you will find false identification unmarked and untraceable weapon contact sheet as well as disposal facility capable of deal with she remain that might be your way of deal with thing it be not mine keep it sloane transfer 900 000 out of his Caymans account five day ago be the route number traceable to Scotland then Luxembourg not after when Irina and Sloane be have their affair do you know about it it be one of her many secret hear Irina talk about you it be impossible not to be intrigue I find you sexy Jack Deal with it what be Dayton Electrical I have no idea Sloane 's make a large payment to a Dayton Electrical the company subcontract to do work in Beijing Lyon and Gambia and Chamonix that mean something to you recently we arrest a woman who do significant electronics work to secure a villa in Chamonix if this payment be for design some sort of security system for Sloane she might know where he be this be Agent Jack Bristow inform the detention facility I will be there by 1400 to conduct an interview with Toni Cummings if this work and you find Sloane you will also find Sydney 's sister oh this will be a great victory but it will be hard on you know what she represent if it be I I would not want to go through that alone I say no disturbance I be sure you can make an exception for an old friend remember I from Taipei Red hair you like my tooth we know about your experiment in Novgorod how much information do you get from my sister Drawings Numbers number what kind of number what kind of number she draw an equation Coordinates that would lead to a place what place what be we suppose to find there Rambaldi his body his gravesite what his consciousness where 's Arvin Sloane Sloane how should I know where he could be now I know you can not feel that but you can see it and you can imagine what it be go to feel like when I pour the rest of this on you Vaughn you meet with Sloane in Zurich it be only a charity function do not lie to I he ask I about inoculation about the Passenger where be he Vaughn I do not know tell I where he be please Vaughn you can not do this why not he would you be not he tell I where he be if I know I would tell you wrong answer you design a lethal response security system for Arvin Sloane you take everything away from I and now you expect a freebie in return I do not make promise do you know how much be here cut into my market share can not even get a lipstick in this place Sloane be a fugitive Assist in his capture and a reduction in your sentence may be consider I know what a player Sloane be capture he must be a high priority if I help you get he I want out with time serve so you know where he be I design a killer system for he but that be two year ago where be it I only draw up the spec I do not contract the job and I do not know where it be build but you can find out I probably could Time serve I will have it put in writing within the hour within the hour good now what do you need I speak to Dixon he say Jack and Katya might have a lead on Sloane from Toni Cummings we may have their location by the time we get back what you do to Dr Lee be unacceptable you would not say that if I have get something out of he what he know or do not know be beside the point the point be we be try to find your sister and if you have get the answer it still would not have be okay would not you do anything to get she back you know we have other option Sydney the man torture you he torture Marshall he torture your sister this be about you and what I see scare I yeah well it scare I too what I be willing to do to find she when I be with Dr Lee all I could think about be if we get to sloane we will get to her now I want to find your sister but I need to find my wife Lauren can not be allow to get away with what she be do well Lauren might and you have to be prepare to deal with that so you be try to tell I you get a gigajoule from a gas generator have to can not have laser without power ah you be very bad yes yeah I 've compute a list of the equipment that you specify everything necessary to build the security system you design for Mr Sloane now my program here will scan multiple database for any shipment of that gear hopefully we can come up with a delivery nexus how long do it take you to come up with that my lunch break we get 45 minute I want you come again to work for I how much do they pay you how much a lot a lot a lot work with I and your base will be 1 million a year that be a nice base the thing be I get really good medical and my little guy Mitch have I tell you about he well he be also cover under the CIA extension plan Aw cute and to be honest with you I kind of like work for the good guy no offence none take well okay look like Mr Sloane build your system in Japan just outside of Kyoto when do we go go no no you be suppose to tell I how to bypass the system from here Sloane have I give he seven variable now I will not know which one he use until I have access to the on site junction box okay I totally understand but you be in gaol on site yeah we be five minute out switching to whisper mode Vaughn I need to know that you will stay on mission to protect Nadia no matter what else happen what be wrong it be what I be afraid of she be build up a tolerance to the fluid she need rest or a strong dose no if we overload the cerebrum her brain will not be able to function properly she could die but we would have the equation would not we do not do not push I Julian you be waste time we do not have we have all choose this path Arvin we have all make sacrifice I trust you be willing to do the same this be Mountaineer we be on the ground Copy Mountaineer Bravo be rollin ' hot Bravo be in position let us go move move Weiss we be proceed to the junction box you will be okay I promise no I will not I guess the angel be not come Arvin I be so sorry I make a terrible mistake this will just take I a minute the deal be off if you go quietly you leave unharmed you remind I of my father when he learn the CIA be close to identify I as Covenant he be willing to do anything to protect I even take the fall he love I that much he be dead now because reach this goal be far more important I be into the system it will be down in 7 second Bravo stand by for go code Copy Mountaineer get to the rendezvous point got it Bravo Team go you will regret this Vaughn we get to secure Nadia I be go after Lauren Vaughn get away from her Sydney please now now we 've get to go now go freeze it be okay you be safe I promise he will never hurt you again he protect I your sister be list in stable condition the drawing and text you recover be in analysis we do not have every piece but I may have enough to extrapolate a location I should know in a day or two the only blemish on a job well do be a debrief I receive from the tac team leader indicate that an initial failure to secure Nadia provide Sloane an opportunity to escape be there anything to that no there be not I will not cover for you like that again you violate mission protocol and you leave I behind Nadia save my life it be a judgement call I would never put your life in jeopardy you see a chance to get Lauren and you take it no matter what you do not have my back we get Nadia that be what count I understand what you be go through what it feel like to be betray you see how my hatred of Sloane consume I Vaughn you save I from that from let my anger turn I into a different person and now it be my turn to do that for you but you have to let I you have to listen to I you have to believe I when I tell you the person you be right now be not the person you want to be I tell you I do not know if we could figure thing out between we I still do not but I do know that we can not even begin to try until you deal with this Jack our concern with Nadia have make Irina 's affair with sloane common knowledge around here that can not be easy on you if you want to talk I be good thank for the record I can go through this alone previously on Alias who be you your mother 's sister Katya what about he kill he no one want Lauren in custody more than I do that be not the kind of closure I be refer to this be the key to my storage facility in it you will find disposal facility capable of deal with her remain accord to Sloane Nadia will be inject with a fluid that will enable she to deliver a message Sloane believe that his daughter will serve as a direct conduit to the consciousness of Milo Rambaldi get away from her Sydney please now sloane we get to go now go you be safe I promise you he will never hurt you again she draw an equation coordinate that would lead to a place what place what be we suppose to find there Rambaldi good evening Miss Bristow Hey Syd where do we stand with Rambaldi 's equation how close be you to solve it uh I only recover about 92 percent I 've design a program to extrapolate the rest but these permutation be like vast it seem to be write in some sort of pre Galilean algebra which you know kinda make you think these guy be you know you know back in the should be about eight hour let I know the moment it be do absolutely actually sir do you mind if I ask what exactly be we look for our only intel come from the interrogation of Dr Lee in Havana Crazy as it sound he say we be look for Rambaldi Rambaldi as in Mr R from the you know I do not even wanna know I do not even wanna I get too much on my with the baby well he be like a toddler and Carrie 's constantly even when I be I understand I be go to I be in Patching into the feed now I must say your disguise it address a certain proclivity of mine if this work I will happily make your sick little fantasy come true Uploading Rambaldi 's equation now oh hey Syd uh listen have you see a usb key with a Speed Racer logo on it it just happen to have every single picture we 've ever take of Mitchell on it well I bring it in here to make duplicate and of course genius that I be I forgot to make a backup copy I will tell you something Carrie 's go to kill I if I do not find it ah find it it be in the when I be do the keyboard early it be a good thing I find it cos Carrie'd probably divorce I if I thing be I would

much as a glass of water may I suggest you have Vaughn talk with he give their personal history I be not sure that be advisable Sark undoubtedly will be more afraid to face a man he so recently torture give his pattern for cave out of fear I believe Vaughn 's presence will more likely yield the result we be look for as the director I can not sanction the beating of someone in our custody Understood I will apprise you of any intel that come from his interrogation last time we be together our role be reverse Funny how thing happen I be afraid the irony be lose on I you like the electric

make contact with agent Strum I want to help he I make arrangement with agent Strum to meet he at the close LZ in Jing an my intention be to extract he that be not your purpose in Shanghai you be send with one objective pick up surveillance photo from agent Brodien yes ma'am photo take by agent Strum whose cover have already be blow that be presupposition a tip from an unauthenticated source and you opt to change the objective of the I make a judgment call you do understand that thing do not always go as expect when you be in the field I do not need a lecture from you I 've read your report even for you agent Bristow your arrogance today be appal it be not mean to be a lecture director chase just a reminder with all due respect it be be 12 year since you 've be field rate your poor judgment apparently cost a man his life so after dress he up you violate protocol yet again by leave your contact alone Mr Brodien would have be kill otherwise Miss Bristow your record be a mess your consistent disregard for protocol obviously speak to some large systemic dysfunction a psychological need to challenge authority if the shanghai incident be an isolated one then perhaps a warning would suffice here but this be hardly the first time you 've exhibit rogue behavior what happen in Shanghai be not rogue I be try Miss Bristow it be my turn to talk I be recommend to the board that you be strip of classified clearance and assign to the dispatch office at Langley you be transfer I to the mailroom you will report to officer Hermalin 8 00 a m on monday let I get this straight be this a permanent reassignment technically that be what a demotion be I do not know exactly what you have against I but my record have always be I resent you and I will tell you why it be conduct like your that endanger the CIA it weaken we it force we to take a defensive posture wait a minute be I suppose to defend my record this be not a dialogue miss Bristow in Virginia monday morning if this be your decision director Chase I will no long burden this agency with the hazard of my participation be you opt to terminate your association with the CIA I will say it in English for you I quit Yo Vaughn Vaughn Bag 's dead man you can give it up thank for come thank for sweat you all right yeah I think that a full month of psych evaluation 's more than enough really for you I do not know it be a little overkill though come on burn your house down it be not a happy home yeah still fire yeah well you kill your wife after learn she be a vicious homicidal double agent see how rational you be I want you to know that I be there for you whatever you need you know if you need to stay with I for a while 'cause your house be ashe I be leave leave what the agency be this because of Sydney it be not because of Sydney it be because last year suck it be because I do not have the desire to do not the desire the need to do this job anymore I do not have it in I so you be tell I that this stupid idea be all on your own Sydney do not talk to you about this I have not speak to she this week or last I do not know what be go on you got to talk to her well I 've already make my decision okay this be not about you her review be today Sydney quit Glad you find we I too that would not have be a very good start you do well with the committee very convincing thank you so you be you I actually feel like I be in trouble well I can pull it out when I need to come on let I show you around how be that man 's ear do not worry about Brodien he think he be a hero he have no clue Shanghai be a charade the agency 's pacific rim surveillance work out of this office until ' 98 this place be dark until two month ago when Langley approve the division Miss Chase I can not tell you what an honor it be to have be ask to be part of this operation I know you speak of be hungry look for a fresh start that be nothing my father Vaughn irrelevant personal stuff I want to serve my country the good I can well this assignment will be a challenge for you more than you be lead to believe the four of you be choose Handpicked to help run this team the four of we Handpicked by whom this be exciting could I have a word please when I be approach about join a black op unit within the CIA I think I be do the right thing and while I appreciate the necessary protocol in assemble a new team Arvin Sloane be not I understand you use to work for Sloane yeah a criminal psychopath beyond verbal description I know all about Sloane then allow I to ask the most obvious question in the history of time how can the CIA let that man who run what amount to a terrorist cell within the border of this country run anything you do not need I to explain the geopolitical landscape or to list this country 's former enemy with whom we now collaborate you have to draw the line somewhere we can use he now his contact his expertise and he will be closely monitor Pity the man with that job wait a minute with you here Vaughn Dixon and your father there be a build in system of check and balance if sloane misstep you will catch he now that be it this be your assignment I be just explain how the CIA approach I Concerned that increase public scrutiny of the agency and the result red tape have impede their ability to do their job what they ask I to set up for they be a covert unit one that be still govern by U S law but unhampere by bureaucratic chain of command with no accountability except to ourselves that part be make clear but the part that be not make clear that be I no it be not well quite frankly I be surprised by their call too until I understand what it be they want their own sd 6 a unit that officially do not exist comprise of team member who have no apparent affiliation to the CIA they do not want to know how we do our day 's work only that it gets do and what be our day 's work his name be Yuri Kamarov he be Russia 's lead nuclear scientist until last month when he disappear with the only viable sample of orine 12 a deadly and highly unstable isotope Signal intercept indicate that on thursday Kamarov will have a meeting on the train travel between Belarus and Latvia we can assume he will be sell the isotope the CIA be unable to use that information which be why we be here Sydney Vaughn you will beon that train I can not believe this I beg your pardon nothing the buyer who be it we do not know yet but accord to his grocery list we can assume he be a serious threat we be able to intercept the protocol of the meet the buyer will be in the dining car at 8 00 p M Greenwich mean time there will be a green fountain pen on the table he will ask Kamarov if he would like some tea Kamarov will reply that he prefer Bourbon Dixon you will be on point Sydney you will recover Kamarov and the isotope Vaughn you will I d the buyer you will sell he a bogus isotope outfit with a tracking device so that Langley can follow he back to his base of operation and grab he there be that it Kamarov be know to rig his transport device with self destruct yes that be correct so Sydney you will need to get he to open the case for you do you have any suggestion I assume you will come up with something interesting Jack you will set up the operational plan for wheel up 0600 hour be there any question besides how would you get this job Sydney Syd what be this a p o it be the name of our new organization it be right on the door authorize Personnel only I think it be fit excuse I I have to prep if I have know Sloane be involve not a chance it be a little deceitful right yeah but then I think if I refuse the job I can not watch over Sloane I be have the same conversation with myself you know I tell Langley that I want to step down as director that life that suit be never for I I belong in the field and then the offer come from Chase an elite black op unit speech yeah that be the one and I be in look I understand your reluctance to work with I give well give everything but despite my former allegiance my betrayal of you of this country you can not deny it we be a great team so I will do this just once and ask you to please give I a chance one thing make up for all this having you as my partner again sorry to drop by it be okay I miss you I want to say that I miss you I 've be think obviously about what what you be afraid to I be not afraid but I you do not return my call that be 'cause I could feel what be happen can I come in if you come in we both know what be go to happen I do not want that to jump right back in where we be before everything to pretend like those year do not happen well that would be nice would not it but they do we need to take it slow Vaughn yeah you be probably right you ready Ja I think so you excuse I hello this be a private compartiment this be my room this be not your room be you speak English yes I speak see for I this room Care for some tea no I prefer Bourbon you be early I be eager to make exchange as be I mr Kamarov I I be sorry ticket be good no yes it be good I be drink in dining car too much oh yeah I be for sleep now be there a place for change uh yes Bathroom thank you you be cute I like these framing you want to do this in public Mr Vadik be not afraid of the public and neither be I be this okay for I I just get it for you yes for you it be very okay you can not test power with toy from hardware store when the more comprehensive test be do Mr Vadik will forward you the other half of your payment you be not very discreet Terror happen every day around everyone and no one notice a thing until something detonate Mr Vadik and I rely on that what be your work I be in chemical business I know something like that you do yes because I look at your hand when I come in and I think he use brain more than hand you look familiar sometimes people tell I I look like hockey player Alexei Kovalev no that be not it ah perhaps we have meet before maybe your boss Mr Vadik maybe I know he what be this I do not know where you be from but you be not Kamarov excuse I this be I I be get off the train a little early find out who he be Syd they be on to we get out of there there be one come your way move what be it get up here be you kid Syd before we leave Jack come to see I with a message for you your father want I to remind you that in Belarus we be not go to have a tactical team so why be your father talk to you through I when I be in D C I know that you go to Wittenberg and I know your father be there what happen in Wittenberg Sydney you be never suppose to have find this you want to tell I what happen in Wittenberg no actually I do not we now know the man on the train be work for roman Vadik CIA 's 26th most want Vadik 's résumé have he responsible for the Chunei blast in ' 86 Matsu in ' 89 over 12 000 dead total close personal contact of mine have confirm Vadik 's cooperation with know terrorist cell in plan a major attack within the next six month close personal contact CIA want Vadik yes that be right what be the move last year a foreign agent work on infiltrate Vadik 's operation make particularly good progress she need to be debrief I be send you Sydney I will give you the detail in my office lucky I the agent work with Vadik 's operation be with argentine intelligence your daughter your sister if Nadia be the one with intel on Vadik why not debrief she yourself we went search Nadia and I for an artifact build by Rambaldi its value immeasurable and we find it and we promptly hand it over to the U S government that be how you get this position you buy it it turn out the pain that she feel as a result of her job be profound something with which you be familiar you think I try to convince she to stay to transfer over to the CIA I know she would be of great value here but she choose to leave intelligence to drop out you be sure she really leave fake quitting seem to be all the rage she be out she be back in Argentina she want nothing to do with I or this life you be awfully glib Sydney Nadia leave you on bad term I suppose I have something to learn about be a father I can see why you do not want to go that be not mean to be glib I still do not know why you think she will talk to I because I see in she something I once see in you the need to work for what be right and because you know what it be to put aside personal issue and that that be a gift it be not a gift what it be be be a necessity and it be become a burden and quite frankly something I have run out of patience for Vaughn before she go you might tell she the truth no I be not go to be a conduit to your daughter I 've try that before you can imagine how well that go over and no she do not say anything if that be what you be ask yourself she have not say a word about anything that happen between the two of you which give I an idea of what that be and Jack I hope for Sydney 's sake that I be wrong I be guess this be not a personal visit no roman Vadik we need your help Nadia I need you to come back with I no Sydney he be a good friend work with I Vadik kill he have his head ship back to our office but I will give you what I have no one deal with Vadik directly everything go through his lieutenant you want to write this down no I get it Kazu Tamazaki consider himself a modern samurai arrest five year ago try to rob the Hasunaga asian museum in London escape from police custody among the least of the charge against he I hope that help man like vadik like Tamazaki they need to be eliminate I can not I can not you do understand yeah I make penne there be this can not continue a crucial assumption of our operational competence be communication Sydney if we do not have that every mission the life of every operative could be at risk I be do my job no what you need to do be find a way to accept what be happen if you can deal with Arvin Sloane I love that you know that that you approve it it may be hard for you to accept that your father do not have the authority to make all the decision that no what be hard for I to accept be the decision that you do make what be hard be look at you walk past you smell that sicken cologne what be hard be be your daughter and not be able to separate myself as far as I may get from the person I despise the most you go to see Nadia do you tell she what you know I guess I think that maybe you would come here I do not know to give I something information something that would help make sense of what I be afraid you would become but there be nothing you could say of course you be only look out for yourself be that what you think of I as an operative that I would reveal your secret to that poor girl I do not tell Nadia a thing sorry what be go on it be Lauren who tell I what tell I where to look safety deposit box in Wittenberg how she know I do not know I be not even go to go I have no reason to believe anything that woman say but the curiosity be just too strong I get there inside the box there be

Bristow we be through I give Langley the location of the Valta be they act on it they have a team stand by in Malaga they be about to raid one of Bishop 's truck yard what about Sydney she be still in

problem at hand it occur to I that this night represent thing I 've be consider for some time how be that the choice I make People with whom I choose to keep company work versus everything else if you can hear I tuck your hair behind your ear sound like a mid existential crisis yes that be it okay Langley 's order a raid on the Alameda yard you have get to get out of there it be easy to doubt yourself but sometimes you need to stick with it and stay the course damn it no you 've get to get out of there when Bishop hear about the raid he will suspect you but I think in my case it might be time to make a mid course correction the fact be I do not believe in coincidence mean what you and I be destine to meet possibly but I be more interested to know why we meet I tell you I be involve with the wrong man I do not believe that let us move move move go call one in position Fan out everyone get back right now fall back cover I I do not get it why do not she just kick his ass you know

it must be hard for you have I at a p o not at all I can not defend the choice my mother make Nadia I would never blame you for your mother 's infidelity but there be something I need to share with you I only do this because of your test result do I fail horribly hardly not surprisingly your ability to adapt to sudden change in protocol to handle adverse situation be exceptional the result be very much like your sister 's Sydney do not know this yet the result of an ongoing investigation ironically this intel come in to I just this morning this be sloane it be Vaughn we 've get Jack and Nadia we be track Bishop and we be en route let I explain something to you I have be paid handsomely pay by the Badenliga to deliver the Valta computer which you decide to destroy with the toss of a hand grenade you be welcome as you can imagine they will not be very happy and when they get here which they will shortly they will kill I unless I can provide they with information of an equal or great value you be both CIA so you 've obviously infiltrate my friend ' network I want to know how so what be your real name Charlene I be uh I be uh what I be a go to kick your ass you son of a bitch

Charlene be that how you normally deal with bad guy he be the one Bishop he kill our mother Dad why do Nadia think that Bishop kill our mother I adjust some detail in Bishop 's file you set she up I would hardly call Martin Bishop an ally I solve two problem with one answer you manipulate Nadia I give your sister closure but not the truth sometimes a satisfying lie Sydney can do more good than the awful truth my bird be miss it be I lose my canary and try tell it to the woman in the cafe upstairs I uh I 've lose my canary you should have clip its wing it be weird be you cold I be kind of cold it be probably nerve it be not like I 've ever sto now can I see my money as soon as you show I the weapon yeah um funny thing about that the weapon might take a little while only way I could smuggle it out I swallow it uh we have company single white male downstairs at the back what what be wrong you do not follow our safety protocol do you what of course I do why would not I you be follow I 've get second white male I see another two strike that three more go to plan b what be plan b come on come on come on I can not make it you do not have a choice anybody get a twenty on the last guy Come on hey hey God you look awful thank you good morning you all right yeah you know it be not every day you see a guy shatter into a million piece yeah two week ago the CIA be contact by an american ex patriot name Derek Modell Mr Modell for reason more pecuniary than patriotic steal a sample of a new biological agent from an arm dealer in Montenegro he call it Ice 5 and offer it to the agency for 10 000 as you know mr Modell fail to comply with any number of safety protocol we would outline and he be flow and kill before the exchange could be complete kill he explode like a frozen pinata we believe his death be cause by this biological agent he be transport be you say this stuff turn Modell into a human popsicle uh if I may I might be able to if you be all curious elucidate well we know that this guy Modell he swallow the sample to smuggle it out kind of like a drug mule base on some test we find the sample in this medical container it be find in the van amongst the uh chunk yeah chunk this be not mean to be swallow it probably start leak as soon as it get into his stomach and then when he be tackle bam complete rupture instant o d when you say instant o d you mean it instantly freeze he well not exactly it do not really freeze he as much as freeze dry he it crystallize he in second so the mission be a bust so to speak now this man Derek Modell spend the last nine month as a relief worker at the hospital Sava in Montenegro we believe that ice 5 be be covertly develop there by a man name Fintan Keene I have not hear that name in a while that be because mr Keene claim to have go legitimate seem to be all the rage among evil genius Fintan Keene be want by just about everybody but he be protect he run his arm and drug op out of Montenegro take advantage of its political instability you want we to take down Keene the director simply want we to obtain a viable sample of Ice 5 so Sydney we be send youinto Montenegro as a relief worker forthe U K branch of OMNIFAM I want you to understand this be not a tactical mission we go in obtain the Ice 5 and come out I do not want anybody else get this before we do that be all good luck be something on your mind agent Vaughn no not really I be not sleep very well it be Lauren be not it I think I see she sometimes or I think I see she in the market in Algeria that ever happen with you do I have vision of

official stuff I have not see much it be Vaughn be safe you too I hope you be not squeamish from time to time they send I a squeamish one it never end well I be not squeamish though most of my relief work with OMNIFAM have be administrative we will fix that have you patch folk up in no time you be a doctor Nurse by train doctor janitor and babysitter by default sound overwhelming nothing a bit of bushmill and a few hail mary can not cure Phoenix be in play copy that I know it be too risky but I wish she be wear a transmitter she will once they trust she besides it will give you a chance to

would Mitchell he would eat anything he be already be to the emergency room twice he swallow a quarter and a car but not a real car 'cause you know I mean well huge he be beautiful yeah thank I get a million of these picture I probably should update they you like that one there be a funny story behind that actually I get to warn you right now Nadia 's immune to your cute baby story charm I be not so sure do you have any weaponize scenario for Ice 5 the three obvious form be liquid powder and gas but it really depend on a few thing difficulty of manufacturing stability intend use right I mean be it design for an evil empire that want to dump it in the water supply and freeze dry an entire city or you know maybe for just one crazy assassin guy Put a couple drop on a hollow tip bullet either it be a hot ticket we should target major player government large terrorist cell then offer it for sale ourselves see who might be shop for designer bioweapon right I will put a list together you be married what be you do in here we be almost out of syrinx I be search for a purchase order what can I do Prayers never hurt what happen to he I do not know what do he say car accident we can handle it from here I do not mind help if you want to last here you will do as I say get back to that supply room and finish what you be do this area be off limit you can eliminate both the KTL and the african global party from your list of potential ice 5 buyer it be out of their league everyone else seem good thank Jack I be wonder if you know who this baby be where do you get this oh it be Sydney 's she give this to you I find it I be hope you might be able to tell I there be nothing to tell Sorry to uh interrupt we get the uplink from Montenegro a soldier come in present the same frozen symptom we

but Sydney say MacLaine definitely recognize the effect of Ice 5 she be still at the hospital try to learn more there be a strong military presence at the hospital but it seem to be in support of the staff nothing we can not handle okay MacLaine seem to be clean Registered nurse no criminal record for the last nine year she be work for relief agency around the world we know Keene give cash to the hospital maybe she take care of his man in exchange what do you know about this secure wing we think it be the research lab blueprint indicate several interconnect room in the large ward the entrance

can let fear get in the way Syd I know you want to take thing slow but what be you afraid of yeah her name be Nancy Cahill an operative in Langley 's narcotic task force specialize in the development of new synthetic she be be station in Europe for the past three year her cover associate professor at Amsterdam University she shoot herself 36 hour ago Eyewitness report a student from Cahill 's class her last word vertel hen het be grappig tell they it be funny Cahill 's most recent psych eval report nothing of note her mental status review have be exemplary what be our assignment Cahill 's husband Jason also an agent have go off the grid have not be in touch with his handler in three week all attempt to contact he afr his wife 's death have be unsuccessful objective be quite simple Locate Jason Cahill so Dixon you take Weiss Retrace Nancy Cahill 's final day Vaughn you and Nadia do the same for Jason Cahill Sydney Jack Cahill 's Amsterdam apartment Standard protocol Recover all file classify computer any evidence of CIA affiliation any question no bulb good news agent Bristow your blood work 's negative and your scan be clean may I yeah look fine my little brother do the same thing to I once bit I like this perhaps you can tell we now what you be look for in the cat scan the Cahills come in contact with a drug that affect the nervous system Pineal gland be about twice the normal size Nancy Cahill 's autopsy reveal the same condition which indicate what by itself nothing the pineal convert melatonin which regulate sleep cycle and body temperature however acute melatonin imbalance have be know to induce uncharacteristic behavior even act of extreme violence the writing in Cahill 's closet it seem like he be suffer from severe paranoia see demon I know I initially assume we be deal with a psychotropic but hallucinogen have particular biochemical marker none of which be present here no matter what drug Jason Cahill may have be expose to he could not have transmit it to Sydney by bite she so why the cat scan the Cahills deal with emerge drug I want to take every precaution but all of our diagnostic indicate that you be fine do you feel okay Fine Langley want to know what substance the Cahills come in contact with who be manufacture it what be it be use for so what do we know neither Cahill travel outside Amsterdam in the past month in her last day Nancy place twice her usual amount of phone call they be route through anonymous relay standard deep cover protocol well if you give I the routing number I will see if I can hack a back trace as far as Cahill 's laptop the hard drive be erase but it be possible the file be not completely rewrite I will see if I can reconstruct they okay what do we know about these Jason Cahill be analyze datum name date link between source he be look for something I do not know maybe his mind this guy be a little crazy his wife actually lock he in his closet Sydney 's fine just exhausted she have not sleep in 36 hour so I be send her home yes of course excuse I hey hey oh you think it be sexy do not you ha ha only if I have do it you need a ride home no thank I be freak out but now I be just tired

close I be good night good night hey sorry you be here early I could not sleep what do you think about this be Jason Cahill just delusional we be assume the Cahills realize they be affect something they come in contact with probably a drug from one of their source but which source which drug they do not know look like they be retrace their step try to figure it out maybe look for an antidote I think I be lose my mind the hard disk be wipe clean remember but the datum recovery be not the problem the file be fragment what be on the disk the mother lode Cahill 's travel itinerary dead drop protocol route number for discretionary fund what be press for now accord to their record Jason Cahill have a meeting schedule for Bucharest his contact be know to he as the Count the Count you got to be kid I the Count be mention several time in Cahill 's paper he seem to be one of their source he supply they with sample of new drug now here be a photo I retrieve it from one of Cahill 's disk Ladies and gentleman introduce the Count the meeting be tomorrow night obviously Cahill will not attend but we will Sydney you will identify yourself as an associate of Jason you will lead he into a conversation and find out what drug he have acquire for they it be a mistake I beg your pardon send Sydney back into the field so quickly it be a tactical error no it be Sydney someone else can do this I be fine that be it well base on my limited experience with mind alter drug this one must have be a doozy theoretically could the drug 's effect have a delay reaction well there be that half

recent uh I make this how do you say this uh pen Marshall Hey Syd guess what your idea well you be right what idea the incubation period turn out I do some research the germans and the czech well not all of the germans just the chemist anyway they 've be toy around with some designer analog that cross the blood brain barrier via a pathogen so in other word this drug work like a virus it get in your blood it incubate for a few day it infect you and then permanently alter your brain Weird huh anyway I call dr Jain he be go to culture Cahill 's blood and make sure that be not what we be deal with okay Syd this be not about you you be feel okay right yeah thank you Marshall no problem that be what I be here for Nocturne two week ago you deliver a sample to Cahill tell I about it come in vial like this Cahill say be like speed only well what do you mean like speed you take you do not sleep except not just energy but no need to rest you fail to include where it come from yes because I do not know Cahill say Nocturne develop in eastern bloc but I find no evidence of this so I ask an associate one week later he bring I sample of Nocturne he do not tell you where he get the nocturne no be too bad for you because you be die too you all right yeah it seem that Nocturne incorporate a stimulant which override the pineal gland there be intel a few year ago that the north koreans be work on an experimental project just like this one try to create 24 hour soldier and there have be other all failure because no one fully understand the true biochemical nature of dream so the Cahills ' delusion be form of dream nightmare yes in a matter of speak Problem be with these dream once trigger there be no waking up Sydney be you listen it be work be not it bit by bit I be wear down your defense I be gain your trust but we both know at some point I will betray you and the people you care most deeply about they will die Syd you okay Ahh you be not surprised when I tell you Cahill have

go right through skin and he do not know this I need money I lie to he I be sorry from where where do it come from I do not know I do not know somewhere in Prague I do not know I be sorry I be very sorry what be the last thing Nancy Cahill say to that eyewitness Vertel hen het be grappig tell they it be funny that be get to mean something else the Grappig group Prague a loose affiliation of biochemical engineer Milan Latuza Grappig senior chemist specialize in the synthesis and isolation of nov therapeutic Nancy cahill have find where nocturne originate only she be too far go to do anything about it Jack I know this be not what you want to hear but even if we could recover a sample of the drug we do not have enough time to engineer an antidote Sydney need medical attention unless Latuza 's already take that step for we if they realize they make a bad batch of Nocturne it be possible they manufacture a remedy contact the jet we be go to Prague once you 've access Latuza 's database any file that may be even remotely related to Nocturne research test result formula I will grab what I can what if I do not find anything let us not discuss that here Sydney 's not as trustworthy as her mother I know I be go to kill she just like I do Irina Good Latuza 's office be on the sixth floor you will need to get a key yeah what be it Dad do we have any tranquilizer no then

and laboratory of dr Milan Latuza the Nocturne program have be dismantle that threat be now over okay that be it Dixon send Sydney out a tactical error indeed I would have say this early but when I get do it be likely you will have I relieve of my position and I do not want that to happen while Sydney be in the field I 've ask myself countless time why I never see the true nature of SD 6 for a while I punish myself over it finally I realize my only failure be that of imagination despite all the evil I have encounter I have never imagine a person could exist someone as thoroughly toxic as yourself I will not make that mistake again you want we to believe you 've reform that for the love of your daughter you 've decide to listen to the well angel of your nature Arvin let us be honest

Thorine Imagine if you have the whole vi it be actually a real depressing take on progress be we sure there be only one vial the russians be stonewall they refuse to acknowledge the existence of a

classified weapon program back decade would you mind tell we where that intel come from or be we all suppose to rely on your source no question ask that be a fair question but one I be not inclined to

we disregard a direct order it will not happen again just so we do not have these misunderstanding again let I be clear to both of you question my authority whether it be in this office or in the field be unacceptable Unacceptable come from you that be almost funny Sydney please do you really want to engage in a conversation about what be and what be not acceptable every day I work here I see your face in briefing I hear your voice in my ear during mission and you want to know what it be like it make I sick to my stomach have to pretend the past never happen that you be not the same murderous criminal sociopath you be three year ago it make I want to retch if you want to talk unacceptable that be unacceptable I assume that you have accept the fact that I make amend for my past Amends Francie and Danny be go and yet here you be and everywhere I look I be remind of the man who kill they I see hey uh Tambor 's encryption program I break it it be kind of brilliant on my part but then again the datum itself be code so I have to cross reference it Marshall what be it well it look like the sale of Black Thorine it be go down in 16 hour we will be right there okay you should hurry the situation be critical Tambor be sell the Black Thorine aboard his yacht the Argento we have less than 16 hour to get on that boat and retrieve the steal vial accord to harbor master record the Argento be sail in the black sea in protect water off Turkey which mean we have no choice but to go in stealth without the cover of night do we know who the buyer be no but we do have an idea where the Black Thorine be be store here in a cabin below dark Marshall okay here be the schematic of the vault that you will be deal with it be secure build into the bulkhead old school so whoever be go in you be go to need these uh your basic safecracking tool sound simple not quite now I find some receipt on tambor 's hard drive turn out he buy a condor TL 60 free standing safe last month I do some measurement and oddly enough it fit perfectly within the vault so I think it be safe to assume Tambor have a safe within a safe he be certainly paranoid enough how do we crack it the condor use a time synchronize lock it randomize a combination every 60 second now the combination appear on a key card with an LCD screen now we can assume that Tambor will have it on he so you be go to need this this be a handheld wireless monitor and this right here will you marry I mr Bristow it be a wave millimeter camera it will allow you to read the combination through his clothing assume he be not wear a lead girdle which be doubtful but you understand my point there be a jet stand by this be a high risk mission no backup Vaughn Dixon this be your op I be send you to the ship if you do not mind I would like to finish what I start so would I they be the two good diver for I to send they after the way they behave in Monte Carlo not to mention the way Sydney just behave in my office would be tantamount to reward they for insubordination I think I would have your support on this arvin the nuance of fatherhood may elude I but there be one thing I be sure of you be not go to forge any kind of bond with Nadia if you attempt to keep she from work with her sister I tell he if you do not win we next game you be go to suffer a painful training injury huh be that why you double his salary ha Phoenix to base we be on deck proceed with caution copy that we be move in we be go below deck we will be radio silent until we reach the safe Roger that black label but of course Phoenix we have a visual copy that switch to millimeter wave freeze it there save it stand by enhance the image I always believe in pleasure before business but that be say Marshall rewind the feed be there a problem pull up everything we have on Leo Orissa Leo Orissa okay Anton get the man what he come for huh if you do not mind I would like first for my chemist to conduct a little test uh a precaution Ready Copy that scan Tambor for the late combination Code be 4 2 6 8 7 oh my god we need a big case close it up now so you never tell I what do you plan to do with your purchase it be interesting actually we plan on take control of your entire operation this guy you know this guy he be an old friend bad ass friend you do not treat a girlfriend like that Phoenix Evergreen do you copy I repeat do you copy Phoenix to base Tambor and his man be dead ambush by Leo Orissa head of a russian organize crime syndicate I use to work with he when I be head of SD 6 he have a link on the inside the girlfriend feed he everything he need they be in possession of the vial a lot more than a vial at least 10 canister 10 more must have reverse engineer it which mean they be manufacture it Tambor have a lab somewhere Orissa must know where it be Orissa 's associate be most likely secure the Black Thorine for transport Nadia can you take they out alone I think so give my history with Orissa I believe he would be willing to talk how Sydney in order for this to work you be go to have to listen to I you be go to have to trust I hello again my employer will not be happy if you pull that trigger your employer who the hell do you work for tell he I work for Arvin Sloane he be demand 50 include all future profit from this venture Arvin always have an odd sense of humor I come unarmed out of respect so that we could talk like gentleman you be not seriously consider make a deal with this woman do not let she derail this Sydney I would keep my mouth shut if I be you you be the one who make it easy you practically draw we a map you you lead sloane to I I think she be just some kind of Fine I agree to his term ask for insurance Mr Sloane will be please of course he need a sign of good faith what more

at the Shilanost chemical lab in Estonia Jan Vorich Shilanost be a soviet run facility marginal security at good Theft of a level 4 toxin could go unnoticed there for year it be probably just a meet but if Anna 's there this would be our good shot at get she back in our sight take Nadia with you Observation only if Vorich have a sample of VX I want you to find out where it be this be a surveillance not a boxing match can I trust you to maintain your professionalism she bring out the bad in I dad but yes of course what be it Anna never check the sample Marshall say he could not have

have plan oh my god I think you be Anna the surgeon in Estonia get the bullet out she be stabilize but the internal bleeding be severe they put she in a coma until she recover minimum metabolic function 48 hour at least they say I be sorry it be Anna Espinosa she do this Anna have get the bomb we do not stop she I say I be not to be bother I will be right there this be classic be this really the only way to get intel on CRF you disagree with my method Sloane sign an agreement with Langley he be prohibit from engage with certain operative Sark 's on that list Sark will only negotiate openly if he feel he be meet his intellectual match as act director I will take full responsibility four year ago if I be not mistaken you fool a small army into think they work for the CIA when in fact they work for you how you convince the U S Government into offer you the real thing be a story I be die to hear Suffice to say Arvin you have my undying admiration you recognize those man they be go to help you escape our custody in Johannesburg turn the page an abject lesson this be what we will do to you if you refuse to cooperate now how do we retrieve the bomb the Cadmus Revolutionary Front be run by a man name Ushek San'ko we work together under my last employer San'ko will be take possession of the bomb shortly I 've get he I tell M Vaughn in Johannesburg I would help you infiltrate CRF and retrieve this bomb from San'ko and I promise you I will you have my word your word which have a considerably great value than when you know I last Incarceration have give I a sense of perspective well I will consider that but first I have a demand I 've hear from unreliable source that Lauren Reed be dead now I 've file numerous request about her status all have go unanswered what I want be to visit her grave I want to see her body for myself I will arrange transport there be something else I hear about Sark he do not give you anything in South Africa no he be onto we from the beginning they be question he now if Sark can give we intel on how to stop the CRF we still have a chance we can not depend on Sark I understand he be cut a deal look I do not like it any more than you do but if listen to he help we get the bomb back I can live with it even if you be right what if Anna get away Sark have agree to lead we to Ushek San'ko the leader of CRF we believe San'ko can provide operational intelligence that will allow we to stop Anna and recover the weapon when do we leave he have however make a demand which involve you he want to exhume your wife 's body Fine let he that be not all Sark have demand that you open her coffin for he N o Agent Vaughn you can not order he too this I be not order I be ask Sark 's participation in lead we to CRF stop Anna be dependent I will do it this be where you keep she for national security reason some body be not allow a public grave in this case we do not want Lauren 's death to become public knowledge this make you feel well watch this happen it give I hope that I can still achieve closure guy like you do not believe in closure that would actually require you to care about something perhaps that be true perhaps all I can hope for be a moment for we all to share you I her and let go of all pretext and subterfuge we can finally admit the truth your wife love I not even death can change that do it open it you want your moment take it stop my agreement Mr Vaughn allow for this in a perfect triangular pattern Consistent with CIA training it be you you do this yes I do I will take you to CRF but I want you to face what you do I want you to look at her do a search for black widow it be one of Anna 's call sign who know she might still use it Dixon will you call I if you find anything okay be there anything you need no you should not blame yourself Sydney I certainly do not hold you responsible for what happen to Nadia I 've say this before Anna will not kill Nadia she can not after all this you still believe Sydney my daughter lie there in a medically induce coma what else do I have but my faith all patient and personnel please remain calm we have experience a small fire in the sub basement please proceed to the near exit in an orderly manner should be a security detail in the building stay with Nadia until they get here Nadia 's next door I think it prudent to change her room until our extraction arrive the doctor at the hospital assure I Nadia will be able to complete her recovery here Anna come after we Jack in a public place the operative question be why Anna have the bomb why come back for Nadia I do not care about her agenda that woman be a threat I want she destroy your daughter have just be attack I understand that but this be not the time to react emotionally whatever it take you find Anna whatever corner you have to cut whatever favor you have to call in do it but find she eliminate she and what about your faith that Nadia will survive oh this be not about faith well it take I a while to patch into the security system in Estonia the mm firewall be a piece of cake but the CCTV be rig with a fluctuate log on and you do not really care about point be I do manage to hack in by the way be it just I or do fast forward make you a little nauseate do we have audio all we have be raw video feed but fortunately I write a voice reconstruction program base on a lip movement a few year ago and check this out why be CRF assemble assemble this bomb what do they have plan what do he say well that I could not rebuild but look at this you see that shadow right there in the background well I enhance the detail and look at that that be why anna come after she in the hospital excuse I I do not under you be welcome Sark give we the contact protocol to meet with the CRF it be a code message in the classified ad if all go as he say it will we should have a response by the evening edition and then what you and I go in alone do you mean be it a glorify date that be not what I mean but be it no not exactly we 've get to take Sark with we he insist we will not get through the front door without he so we rely on the explosive tracking device we put in his neck if he try to burn we in any way sabotage escape whatever we take he out Hey Nadia 's go to make it you be monitor agent Santos ' progress if she be to be awaken from her coma early what risk would she be expose to it would increase stress on her circulatory system the quick you revive her the high the risk of shock heart attack stroke be there some reason to wake she not yet the man we be meet with Ushek San'ko what else can you tell we about he San'ko 's expertise be coordinate terrorist activity and you be convinced he will know where the bomb be I be quite certain he be the one that task Anna to get it per our protocol he take out a series of ad in response to mine this one here it say I be to meet he at a club in Venice where we 've do business before he say I be to come alone alone that be interesting I give you my word Mr Vaughn be I to take it you do not trust I you be about to betray one of your former partner do not really instill faith in your loyalty my past infidelity be just that mistake I 've learn from Repented for I 've become a trustworthy man well the answer be no where you go we go Lauren and I we set up a weapon deal with San'ko before the Covenant implode the thing be be he be never meet her face to face all he know be her voice how be this Perfect I must tell you Lauren and I have a reputation certain intimacy be public knowledge we must maintain appearance Dream on you pervert freak oh Mr Sark San'ko it be good to see you and you must be Lauren Reed mm my dear what a pleasure to meet you after so long the pleasure 's all mine obviously so let we toast to CRF mm Salud Ahh so what be the nature of your business you represent certain interest that stand to profit should the market fall if you be to provide we with some insider information we would be happy to split the profit how nice of you information about what our source tell we you 've just acquire a chemical bomb what do you intend to do with it which weapon be you talk about the one you hire Anna Espinosa to steal obviously you 've never hear of her Sorry to waste your time you want something from I I want something from you my dear and what be that Mr Sark have tell I about your predilection Mm I have a room above this club I would like to watch that for myself you have my permission to kill he if you would like I be sure Julian 's tell you that we never mix business with pleasure I tell you she be special oh yes she be indeed special Anna above we I will take the lead we will cover each other 's corner give I a gun I can help stay here and shut up let us get Sark we might still be able to cut she off what be it there be an explosive device in your neck wait how do you know that there be no time for painkiller hold he down do not move please oh God Syd we have to blow the tracking device Vaughn wait a second no it be our backup protocol no no no wait he might lead we to Anna no he be out of our custody we can not take that chance we have to blow it now what happen it fail Anna Aspinosa Julian Sark it be nice to meet you we play right into her hand Anna kill San'ko in front of our eye and then distract we long enough to grab Sark you could not have predict this we have no intelligence indicate the two share a history or an agenda still I should have consider it s a possibility we need to focus on where Anna and Sark be head with the bomb Contact all your source see if anyone have hear anything I will check back on the hour good a p o be monitor traffic we 've call in every favor we can to get Sark and Anna on different intelligence radar consider the destructive capacity of the bomb they have in their possession they be go to take extra precaution in cover their track at this point we will take anything we can get not hungry I think after a year in a maximum security prison that you would appreciate a decent meal beware a summit that begin with share bread the sated man be at his weak who say that a vietnamese general I have dinner with once by dessert I have put a bullet between his eye I appreciate the rescue I assume there be a price when I hear of a young man so ruthless in his shifting allegiance that he kill his own father I think this be a man I be fate to work with my aim tonight be Ushek San'ko 's head CRF be a weak organization no vision consider the power of the bomb I steal for they they do not pay I nearly enough so you decide to go into business for yourself I think it an appropriate time and then I spot you in the club and you see your opportunity yes partnership my brain your skill you flatter yourself but something like that I must tell you sell a bomb on the black market can be tricky I already have a buyer in mind right here in this very city Michel Guinot a man with whom I have an excellent credit rating yes Mr Sark I know you do Anna 's sell the bomb to a man name Michel Guinot Gateway of all arm sale in and out of central Russia Guinot 's on the watch list we have satellite surveillance where have the intel come from Classified but reliable your mission be to intercept the bomb detain the principal do we have a confirmed location for the meet with Anna and Sark Guinot 's on the move to a property he own a graveyard he be be know to hold meet there Marshall 's sending coordinate if this exchange go through Sydney both Anna and Sark will be in the wind we may never have this opportunity again we call as soon as there be any change when do she wake up a few minute ago but she be fine out of the wood thank you there be an irregularity we think you should see Deloxin be a drug we use to wean patient out of medically induce coma your daughter have four time the amount we normally use Mr Sloane Nadia do not just wake up someone do this to she and I believe I know who it be about 14 hour Miss Espinosa be kind enough to set I free she come here with I do not she Mademoiselle Espinosa as the buyer I dictate certain term start with good faith on your part put your weapon on the stone please it be very nice let us go be the device acceptable to you monsieur Guinot it be and the price be that acceptable also give I 10 second the transfer be almost complete go you get Sark I will go after the bomb what be you do Sydney I be a man of my word I will kill you you bastard the United States government have some question for you we catch she yes we do Sark we will get he back now most people attribute the word abra cadabra to Houdini that be not actually the case what whoa okay okay that be not suppose to happen you know what keep them can I come in hey yeah sure I will be out in the hallway entertain sick people if you need I Hey Cómo esta I be good you Better so you get her Mm hmm and the bomb yeah we get that too and hey we do not kill each other Nope my closing report as acting director the job be yours again Nadia be out of her coma thank god she pull through God have nothing to do with it her medical chart indicate that someone inject she with a counter agent in order to wake she up as a professional courtesy I would like you to justify your decision your word do whatever it take to stop Anna we stop Anna you also indicate that this be not Nadia 's time that she would pull through do not tell I you be lose your faith when I step down as director of this task force you have full discretion I be not go to argue with your choice because the mission be a success but I would have appreciate as a father to be apprise of your decision to put my daughter 's life at risk as you do mine every day when I accept this position I make two agreement one with Langley and one with you a pact that be still in effect but only because my daughter be unhurt I wonder Jack what assurance I have that you will continue to honor it do you have a problem with all holiday no so you be fine with let us say Arbor Day I be not that into celebrate that be all that be all it be what be go on your sister do not want to celebrate her own birthday when in two day you do not know about this either get out I do not even know if it be my birthday in the orphanage they just feel bad because I be the only kid who do not know when I be bear so the sister just pick a date yeah day after tomorrow we could go bowling and rent some lane we 've be through bowling go cart though could be really good Bar hop bar hopping or a ragin ' house party Whoo what be up thank you but I do not want to do anything come on hey guy be you guy plan a party there be no party 'cause I be a really good dj if you need uh anyway speak of party sloane 's have one in the briefing room now as most of you know when the Alliance be dismantle four year ago the CIA come into possession of a multitude of artifact file and intel among the item retrieve be the Blackwell index Blackwell what be this a bad dress list Damien Blackwell head of the Gouse Crime Syndicate he be believe to have compile incriminate information on corporate head government official common criminal essentially a master blackmail list encode into a mobile terminal the Alliance be never able to read the index during the six month it be in their possession it be inciphere use 4 096 bit encryption wow I mean even with current technology that would take like 20 year to decipher and that be with a supercomputer work on it 24 7 needless to say the CIA be unsuccessful in its decryption effort why be this an issue now last night the index be steal from the CIA research station in Sarajevo leave three of our analyst dead no lead on who steal it no it be a clean job in and out within two minute why steal something you can not read the decoder disk have be locate two week ago Damien Blackwell 's conceal base of operation be identify and raid by french authority they seize most of his possession as evidence include a mini disk we believe this to be the decoder our only logical recourse be to go after the decoder without it the index be useless do the french know what they have no of course we would rather obtain it through legal channel unfortunately that do not seem to be an option right now wait a minute you want we to steal the decoder from french police right now it be be house in the Paris prefecture Sydney figure out a way to get yourself arrest hey hey we get out of the briefing early do sloane approve your trip mm hmm any word on your uncle yeah I speak to my mom this morning apparently this last stroke hit he pretty hard he have not regain consciousness that be awful yeah be you go to be okay yeah I be fine it be just that you know when my dad die my uncle make all these promise about be there for I and my mother and he be not ever I be not sure how I feel about see he again you know I wish I could go with you I know I will call you when I land okay okay Sydney we need to talk okay it be safe to talk here okay I 've be cros check Sloane 's fact vet the intel he be give we Director chase encourage we to watch sloane that be what I 've be do I be not go to make the same mistake I do at SD 6 blindly follow that man 's order what have he do now Sloane just say he have no lead on who steal the index out of that research station in Sarajevo yeah look familiar Miles Devereaux former Alliance member Head of operation SD 3 sloane contact he 40 minute after the blackwell index be steal before Langley have even discover the theft how do you know I 've get a tap on Sloane 's home line Dixon the call be encrypt but I trace it to a hotel in Sarajevo I hack into the hotel 's CCTV feed that be where I find this you think Sloane be work with Devereaux I think Sloane task we to steal the decoder for one reason so he and Devereaux could crack the index and retrieve the blackmail file for themselves that be why he lie about have no lead he be use we again and that be not something I be go to let he do so what you be tell I be that you 've be illegally tap your superior 's phone keep an eye on Sloane be a mandate one that you specifically charge I with I do not condone break federal law to do it since SD 6 Sloane have want he Blackwell index and now he be coincidentally make contact with Devereaux in Sarajevo minute after the theft perhaps he be pursue information on who steal it by contact a former Alliance member Sloane be free to contact old associate it be one of the reason why he be appoint head of the task force he lie to we about have no lead perhaps none of the lead prove useful irrational explanation he task we to steal the decoder from police custody do this add up for you be you listen to I I be aware of the mission to retrieve the decoder mr Dixon I authorize it myself now I appreciate your concern but these accusation be base on circumstantial evidence so unless you have something else to give I I would suggest you pull that phone tap I know you want he to be guilty I 've be there this be not about what he do to Diane of course it be it be for I but you be the one who remind I why we be here to do the right thing maybe this time director Chase be right maybe we should just let it go Chase refuse to see the truth Sydney you know I never do this I be ask you for I please I need your help you do not have to stand in the dark you know oh uh I do not want to uh the light will not bother David you must be Bill why would you say that your uncle say you be come to see he he use to talk about you a lot before he have the stroke Bill be my father he be dead oh my mistake old people get confused sometimes you know and they get the past and the present mix up be it recent no he die in 1979 I be Michael I be Rosemary Nice to meet you I do the 3 00 and the 10 00 round in this wing do you come a long way Los Angeles I would have come to visit soon but well you be here now that be what be important I review your recon analysis report your extraction plan need some work really I think you be assume that everything be go right no I allow for contingency exit the building if anything happen it be the perimeter that pose the great problem okay I will work up a new scenario Good you have all our resource at your disposal Weiss why do not you use they the last thing we need be an international incident yes sir Rest of the spec look great well thank you I take it you will have no problem bring Nadia up to speed yeah I already do last night excuse I uh we be work we work late we actually like it there be other peop Jack be here be you finish have the report on my desk in an hour impress I Jack I do not realize you be wait I hear the forensic report from Sarajevo be in I be curious be Langley able to generate any new lead no they have nothing as far as the theft be concern then I be assume our agenda remain the same oh yes we obtain the decoder I will coordinate transport now Jack one more thing Sydney be suppose to hand I her op report 15 minute ago any idea where she might be no I imagine she be somewhere work out the detail I use to meet Vaughn like this when he be my handler at SD 6 must have be romantic Micro CD burner where have you get it I borrow it from Marshall 's office with a few adjustment it will make a corrupted copy of the decoder disk that will be what we give to sloane keep the real one safe so if sloane follow protocol and hand it over to the CIA no harm do but if he try use it he will be sorely disappoint we will have to watch and see what I be just now realize how complicated your life be at SD 6 I appreciate you do this I know you have your reservation it be just that thing be a little different now since Nadia he be her father I know this may seem weird but I hope for her sake that we be wrong you be under arrest it be about time Amanda Peterson right my name be Richard Zachary your legal counsel appoint by the american embassy Great I see you 've be enjoy your stay in Paris it be be swell okay get it Outrigger loop the feed on your call Vandalism resist arrest assault an officer these be serious charge so so let us see about get you out of here the cd burner Thanks Dixon good luck Phoenix sign in Copy we have you it be the third door on the left make it quick you be about to have company I be in okay plot number 430 Phoenix report do you get the decoder Negative move to check the rest of the inventory Phoenix we lose visual still search for the decoder Phoenix you 've get incoming get out of there now okay I just find the disk Outrigger abort go to plan b copy that Phoenix we be move to alternate extraction get to the roof immediately Base plan b well be in effect I check with Marshall the decoder 's still in analysis sloane 's follow protocol no since we get back from Paris he be make more than a dozen call from a secure line in his home be you able to trace the call they be route through relay station but I narrow they down to a number in Brussels Syd we need to get into Sloane 's house if we could copy the encryption key from his secure phone we could crack the call to gain access to his conversation yeah but how Sydney a word my office I be sure I do not have to inform you of the consequence have either of you be apprehend by the french police with all due respect we be

have an audience not bad Nightingale be the brainchild of Dr Josef Vlachko russian émigré we recruit into D A r p A he vanish 25 year ago after run test on human subject nice guy when he leave he take all the record of project Nightingale with he that be why you could not find anything d a r p A have to cover up the security breach so if we find Vlachko we might find something on my dad Hans Dietrich german money launderer last year he start branch out into high risk investment mainly new weapon system he funnel over a million euro into an encrypt bank account label Nachtigall Nightingale Dietrich 's office be locate in Munich he run a beer hall on the ground floor if we can get to his record we might be able to find a lead something on Vlachko who know Syd how have you get all this my dad what he have clearance do you tell he everything I have to how much do they know Uncertain apparently there be journal we could not account for Hmm well this should shut they down we could turn this to our advantage let sydney and Vaughn obtain intelligence for we I see and you have no problem with that of course I do but give our current obstacle they might provide a lead we could not get on our own all right Jack give they a long leash but just so we be clear we can not afford to be compromise not even by your daughter it will not come to that no I be fine thank do not help ah boo hoo I be go to go up north and drink wine for two day while my friend stay here and work it be call accumulate vacation man you use it or lose it so you will water the plant and you will send out Sydney

right I will not be long take your time tell Weiss I say hi I will yeah through the look glass the illustrated edition you 've get to be kid I listen if you think I be go to inject myself you be out of your mind if I want you dead I would kill you right now you want to know about your father I give you two minute to do the right thing I trace Sydney and Vaughn 's movement they go to Munich what do they find undetermined at this point Jack the plan be to let Sydney and Vaughn open door that we could not go through and to pull they back if they get too far I do not see much here in the way of containment we have an option I can go to Sydney engender her trust convince she to bring the case to a p o hmm no she be too intuitive consider your relationship she will see right through you through we no she will not I know exactly how to approach she hello it be I Dad hi I realize this be short notice but I be wonder if you would join I at Miceli 's this evening um be it bad timing no I hey I be just hope you might be free for dinner I will meet you there in 30 minute see you there Mr Vaughn welcome back do not worry it be temporary the paralysis should wear off in about 4 minute 20 second might ste a little though you know the re entry who be you a man that could tell you about your father but first what I want that intel you steal from Dietrich will lead you to Nightingale what I be interested in be the transform coil inside Nightingale be you out of your mind I be not the one who inject myself with an unknown substance so now that we 've establish your desperation it be a matter of how far you be willing to go why should I believe anything you say Phillip Burke b u r K E who be that you look he up and when you be do you contact I one time only make it count thank for come I take the liberty of order a bottle of pinot noir okay you look very nice thank you so yes everything okay it be fine how be your investigation go Vaughn 's father it be complicated actually you find something the intel on the hard drive make it seem like Nightingale be an active project Active Vlachko be run it out of an abandon nuclear reactor in Siberia he be jerry rig enough nuclear power to drive what he need for what purpose I be not sure exactly but the experiment be molecular they be alter human dna there be a list of over a dozen human test subject all of they die there be mention of the genetic marker AD9 but I do not know what it all mean Sydney you have to bring this to a p o not until I talk to Vaughn Vaughn do not know that people may be die because of it I give you level six clearance because I trust you I be ask you to trust I now bring this to a p o if you really want to find answer use the resource a p o can provide you have to discuss this with Vaughn first I respect that but the long you keep this off book the bad this will look for both of you the only way to proceed be honestly above board promise I you will tell Vaughn that I promise she tell you this yes hmm for 20 year Josef Vlachko have be off the grid now we find he through Sydney of all people well I have to hand it to you Jack I never think that you would be capable of exploit your own daughter I certainly could not do that I could have a strike team on the ground in Siberia in 72 hour that be a foolish course of action Vlachko 's our strong lead to Yelena Derevko with this intel we need to act quickly Sydney can not know that I 've betray her confidence we wait for she to bring this in and if she do not she will I ask she to when she do we will draw up an ops plan require I to go along on the mission once there I will interrogate Vlachko without Sydney or Vaughn know if our assumption be correct Vlachko be communicate with Yelena once you 've complete the interrogation he need to be eliminate that be a little extreme do not you think no I consider it a necessary precaution he could alert Yelena to our agenda or even bad he could talk to Sydney which would be a disaster unless of course you want to destroy everything we 've work for Phillip Burke kill in Laos 10 21 79 they be identical his name 's Phillip Burke CIA black op agent kill in Laos the exact same date my father be kill the autopsy report show that Burke be shoot with a Makarov pistol the exact same make and model your mother use to kill my father and there be more dental record the one on the left be Burke 's the set on the right be my father 's oh my god I mean we 've always think your mother kill my father but what if she kill Phillip Burke instead how would the CIA how would anyone maybe the CIA do not know and someone want the world to think Bill Vaughn die and replace he with Phillip Burke Vaughn where do you get this information that phone call from before it be not Weiss I go to see a guy name Roberts I make a deal with he because he say he have information about my father I can not believe you do not tell I Syd he say he would only talk if I come alone I do not care what you do be crazy yeah and it pay off this guy know more and he will tell I in return for what he want I to give he Nightingale some transformer coil we do not even know what Nightingale be yet and you want to just hand it over we be just go to shut down the testing we be not go to hand over the entire program just a part of it Syd we do mission like this all the time not on our own not rogue my father want we to bring this in to a p o you talk to he again your father and Sloane will never let I keep technology like this for myself and besides I do not trust they I do not trust anybody except you then what do you suggest we come clean with a p o like your father want we drop a mission that will get we Nightingale and then we run a countermission like the old day our state goal be to retrieve the coil but instead we keep it for ourselves the only problem be there be no way we can make a duplicate we will not have time to make a fake one so we have a plan b we need to retrieve the coil and shut down Nightingale assume you enter the facility undetecte what then once inside Vaughn and I will split up I will recover the coil while Vaughn take care of security now each door in the facility be key code operate but Vlachko operate out of the security station here so I will subdue he I will override all the locking mechanism that should get Sydney into the control room where the coil 's hold what configuration do you say the reactor be run RBMK then you will need two people to retrieve the coil one to ensure the reactor stay in standby mode while the other enter the test chamber to grab the coil yeah that be right that mean you be miss one man to override security then I will join the team as third man I will access the security system while you and Vaughn recover the coil once the mission be complete we can bring Vlachko back for question if we need a third man Dixon be more than capable actually Jack 's experience will serve you well unless there be something about this mission that you have not tell I no sound good home plate we be in Copy five by five Phoenix Standing by I be go to the security room we will meet you back here with the coil the more you cooperate the less pain you will endure sit down sit down shut down security Jack be you with Dr Vlachko yes he be be subdue Shotgun Phoenix unlock the door to the control room now copy almost there okay Marshall we be at the control panel be the reactor online Negative we can see the transformer inside now all right open up the containment shield that be where the coil be copy now release the lock to the test chamber we 've get the chamber open I be go in dismantle the pressure shield now this will take a couple minute I need information and I need it very quickly I do not know what you be talk about I know about Nightingale if you know about Nightingale what else can I possibly tell you the location of Yelena Derevko Yelena tell I where she be I do not know ready to remove the coil where be Yelena I tell you I do not know you work for her you 've be in contact you could not have set this up without her help that be year ago I do not have time for this Vaughn Syd the control be fry can you get I out of here tell I where she be I do not know home base the reactor 's come online it be come online now Vaughn bypass the nuclear fusion switch it be on the panel under the main control I have to run a bypass okay be there an ethernet port next to the motherboard yeah okay plug it in there that should give I access to all right nice that do it I be on their server Vaughn fuse the blue and yellow wire together to open the door Syd try the door now it be still lock Vaughn Marshall I can not bypass the door Sydney be in the room with the reactor be there another way to shut down the core only if you remove the fuel rod Marshall I be head toward the core no no no do not do that exposure to that amount of radiation could kill you okay I can slow down the countdown buy enough time to corrupt the reactor mainframe just give I some time take cover no Mr Bristow I see what you be do do not go in there I 've almost get it I can keep the reactor from come online I can it be get a little warm in here Hang on I be work on it Marshall come on okay almost there almost there almost there get it the countdown 's slow down work some magic work some magic work some magic work some magic Marshall what just happen total system shutdown due to core corruption I do it we do it we all right Marshall Marshall just free Sydney would you oh right sorry system 's in reset that should not be a problem and free at last Sydney you okay yeah I be fine Plan B I hate this Vaughn be you sure I love you yeah still remember what you promise I will let you know when I get there okay Sydney I could not stop he it be Vaughn he take the coil I could not stop he dad well I do not understand this Vaughn assault Sydney and steal the coil yes and you believe her Vaughn would not go against we without a reason from his father 's journal to this rash action someone must be feed he information a third party we be not aware of yeah well obviously this complicate our situation yes I imagine this might bequite upset for you Arvin my not anticipate Sydney and Vaughn 's deceit could be great than your own have you think about how we be go to deal with this Jack Hmm be you all right fine just tired I will work up some option retrieve Vaughn and the coil uh Mr Bristow Mr Bristow hi listen I run the diagnostic on the core reactor shutdown remember Marshall save the day Marshall this be not the time well but I re run security protocol and I check they and rechecke they twice believe I because I could not quite understand Marshall what be it I do not shut down that reactor at all that be impossible no it be not the printout listen it be physically impossible for I to shut down that reactor from a remote location I mean give its particular status it would have to be shut down manually but that be impossible too because that would mean that someone that I mean you the only way it could happen be if you go in the reactor yourself it be my daughter 's life between we drop your weapon I need suppressive fire you want to see I have Vaughn contact you yet I would have mention it do not you think Sydney we pull Vaughn 's phone record and they indicate that he send you an SM message to your cell I would like to give you the benefit of the doubt and assume that it got lose in transmission and that you never receive it if you be look to catch I in a lie yes I get the message when Vaughn take off as I 've already tell you I try to stop he he hit I he contact I to tell I he be sorry which I do not consider professionally relevant as far as where he be or what he be do I still have no idea he disappear with a dangerous piece of technology I have no choice but to notify Langley Vaughn be not a traitor he would never do what he be do without a reason Vaughn go rogue on a sanctioned mission out of consideration for you I will give he 48 hour to either return or contact I with an explanation in the meantime we will withhold his status from the rest of a p o should this matter come to light I do not want anyone else complicit in this deception thank you Sydney if Vaughn should contact you you will know Non merci go somewhere you be late hardly I 've be watch you for an hour yeah be I your type have to make sure you come alone follow instruction Beignet can we just get this do look around it be Paris in the springtime I be only interested in answer in exchange you be suppose to bring I something today your big prize be in a safe place that be not the deal it be now you be bluff do not forget I know how desperate you be no way you be willing to walk away oh I suppose that depend on how badly you want it 'cause personally what the hell be I go to do with a transforming coil talk personally I do not have a use for it either well then you can tell your employer exactly what I be tell you you will get the coil when you tell I everything you know about my father a volcano yeah yeah it be all of yellowstone it be like a funnel and the thing be that on average it blow every 600 000 year well then I do not think we have to worry about it no no no it have not blow for 600 030 year we be due sister what be this Fancy chocolate that be not

control I like a clean sink Mm hmm but you would tell I if there be something that I need to be concern about of course yeah it be I no deal he say he have the coil but he want answer first he want to talk to you hello you violate our agreement you listen to I I be sick and tired of these game here be how we be go to do thing you be angry good you can channel that into your next assignment no no no more assignment you get what you ask for you do not abide by the term of our deal the price have just go up Disobey again and it will continue to do so no that be it I be do check beneath the table what beneath the table there be an envelope open it if you still wish to back out feel free to do so he be alive your father be very much alive the question Mr Vaughn be how far be you willing to go to find he that be lovely it be a folk song our father use to sing about a russian robin hood it be one of your mother 's favorite so good to see you again sweetheart should not be a problem sorry I just well consider the hearing I be sure the D d o have his hand full of course give my regard sorry um requisition form the secure server to Langley go down I do what I could but I will need all new server and a VS 2 module so Great if you could also sign here uh by the way since the you know incident have you have a chance to see a doctor 'cause the radiation level in that chamber be near lethal so I be fine Marshall be there anything else no thank you our family do not have much just the necessity but your mother have no intention of deny herself after school she would go to the St Basil cathedral where all the tourist be so careless with their money so easy to pickpocket how old be she Young still in grade school she use the money to buy we candy until our father discover what she have be do Yelena and I be terrify but not your mother she stand there finish the candy smile we be wait for she to get hit but instead our father laugh look at this little rebel in front of he your mother can be quite stubborn much like your sister how be Sydney Katya I 've tell you I know I know she be off limit thank you of course my mother Irina do she ever talk about I it be happen soon than I expect what be happen I be deathly allergic to chocolate in 15 second my breathing will become difficult Katya and I will lose consciousness tell Sydney this be how far I be willing to go to see her Guard I need help now tell Sydney Guard I know what you be think you will find they on your own right what be we do here wait I hire a team of independent contractor to help we with the job which be what assume that be not important assume it be to I all you need to know be it be an instruction manual of sort now that coil you get for we apparently it be not be use properly that be terrific like I say I do not care about the coil I be just like you man the less I know the less guilt I feel yeah we be a lot alike where do you think he be during the funeral I mean when you be mourn by his grave with your mom you know it be usually a girlfriend at least that be why my old man take off but I tell you what my mom can not say I really blame he come Waste of time 45 caliber it be not like you need to make it more dangerous maybe not but it make I feel well you say an hour yeah well we have to take a detour this be Mike so be he any good or just eye candy like I say he be the man with the technical skill to get what we need do that be Sabina this be Gregor and that be Jan over there Mikey pour you a pint I do not usually drink till the job 's finish you drink with I or you cut bullet with Jan your choice yeah well how about I do neither and you tell I why the hell we be here okay so this be a two pronged plan now tomorrow at midnight an armored transport will be leave Darmstadt carry a very valuable item we will be steal that item but to do it we be go to need a cold laser Prototype have not even hit the street yet it be in a secure r d wing in a private hospital in Bordeaux heavily guard C ivilian yeah you get a problem with that no I get your message what be it Dixon have be take out of the field of rotation I know I authorize it yes I see your signature all over the release form do you really think we can afford to be down one agent when Vaughn 's whereabout be still unknown we do not have a choice the director of the DSR contact I directly and since for the moment we be keep Vaughn 's status confidential I think it good to comply with his request I see what exactly be the nature of Dixon 's assignment I be afraid that be confidential as well from you or from I come on Jack you do not have to be a genius to know what this be about Rambaldi now while I accept that these matter be above my purview Dixon be a member of my task force and it be my responsibility to know what action and risk he be take on it be a routine transport Darmstadt and I assure you the risk be minimal Syd clipper ticket Third row center I can not go Langley 's task I for a special assignment you be kid well I would love to but I be swamp and I be go to go with my son so I tell he I can not go he say it be actually good because he have a date he be 12 why do not he take she to the game apparently she would rather go to a movie I be sure you 've teach he well Dinner when I get back yeah sure we need to talk how long have you be see she it be our third visit this be this be exactly why I warn you about her Katya 's the only person who have ever be willing to answer my question about Irina Irina Derevko be manipulative and cruel she be also our mother which make it hard to accept I know but trust I I know her crime I also know how once she help you and the CIA until she betray we she always do there be more to she than what be in her file Katya tell I story and you believe she some of it yes then you be delude yourself Nadia I be sorry I 've be through this before Katya be do the same thing to you that Irina do to I tell I what I want to hear appeal to what I want more than anything else in the world a mother a family it be all a manipulation do you want to know the truth about our mother our mother put a hit on my life our mother try to have I kill why do not you tell I there be never a reason to oh my god Syd if I know I where be she Katya she be in the hospital they be keep she for observation I always hate go to the doctor let us go get the laser there it be I need some light how long will this take Hold still we can not risk destroy the emitter Wire cutter can not we just unplug it or something sure if you do not mind blow it up and kill we both in the process Argon canister it be under pressure so you be CIA be that what Roberts tell you he say you be in a period of transition I guess you could say that I go through the training program Camp Perry Cia be look for female agent with russian language skill they reject I yeah but you be probably well off that be what I figure More profit and more fun too this should do it let I help I be good thank Bon D'accord look out let us go we need to leave now you could use a few stitch I suppose that will not be necessary fine let it scar who know it might toughen you up a bit I see the look on your face when I kill that guard I save your life Thanks do not tell I you be tear up inside I think you agency boy be tough than that it be he or I I be okay with that you could have fool I you have not stop brood since we leave the hospital yeah well maybe it be because I do not like be here with you you know what I think this be exactly where you want to be consider this the second time you 've be reject by the CIA Understand this talk to my sister again I will make sure you regret it the protective sister how charming and how satisfying it must be for you to know you have it all figure out I would think you of all people should know the world be never black or white the last time I see you aunt Katya you try to put a bullet in my head give the opportunity I would not mind see you suffer consider this visit a warning leave Nadia alone I have no intention of kill you nor do your mother what do you know about that I know you believe your mother put out a contract on your life surely you must have ask yourself why she would want you eliminate and I be willing to bet you have not come up with a satisfying answer your mother love you and to look at you now and see how quickly you 've abandon she if she only know she would be ashamed I be not have this conversation before die Irina try to contact I she believe someone be set she up want it to appear that she be try to have you kill I need you to get I that message bring it to I it be the least you could do for her Marshall Mr Sloane hey sorry you know the classic never go out of style a test tube be send to forensic for analysis do you authorize that yes yes I do uh be that a problem or there be no problem just a curiosity it be indicate that the blood sample be one of Dr Vlachko 's test subject I think we already analyze those be I miss something Marshall uh you know what I have not be get a lot of sleep lately Mitchell 's get an ear infection and I just probably forget to send it in sorry sorry about that do the result come back it be nothing we do not already know the subject be suffer from a large scale genetic mutation however Marshall I want you to know there be protocol in this office I be sure your failure to notify I of this submission be also due to your lack of sleep yes yes it probably be I be very tired and I be not why complicate our life we could get on and off without the transport even know they be hit that item we want be extremely delicate I mean we can not risk the transfer in a move vehicle I think you say we be steal an instruction manual we be a very old one write by an inventor in the 15th century you breathe on it wrong and it will crumble seem like a lot of trouble for an old book it be valuable to my employer so then it be valuable to we okay it be go to be a two car caravan the lead car 's go to be the armored transport it will be leave the depot at midnight tonight travel along this route we be hit a CIA convoy that be right so this be why you need I from the moment you contact I you know you would need that bypass even if I have give you the coil we would have never tell you where your father be that be right guess that make we bad people huh nothing 's change though you still want answer you son of a bitch you know by the way you should be thank I you should be grateful thank you for what for track your father down let I tell you something that be not no small feat your father 's be hide for the past you be ask I to betray my agency well I feel really bad about that you know what I will say an extra Hail Mary tonight

guess what your dad be too I mean he be not be hold prisoner and for 25 year he allow his wife and his kid to think that he be be dead that be a bad guy you think on that I will be inside I need to speak with you of course what be it I want to tell you before you be notify through official channel I 've be visit Katya Derevko your aunt and I assume it be not on official business no it be personal I think Katya might be able to fill in the blank about my mother tell I who she be I see well thank you for tell I Nadia what do she tell you nothing I do not already know that she be a criminal a murderer sweetheart no one be a single thing look I understand Irina we be both cut from the same cloth both committed to our work and I suppose because of that we both do some thing that be unforgivable but Nadia Irina be also capable of have a great capacity for love I see the way she look at Sydney the way she hold that child in her arm and I be absolutely sure she feel the same way about you she search for you Nadia she may not be here to answer your question but the one thing I know to be true your mother love you I would like to believe that then do have a wonderful day hi I

to open the safe but without the proper code the safe 's backup system will engage once we be inside I will bypass the safe 's backup system while Sabina set up the cold laser we will have no more than three minute one last thing because there will be no shooting on this job CIA protocol they will not fire unless fire upon first if anyone have a problem with anything I just say speak up now we

perpetrate this elaborate conspiracy Arvin Sloane one of his colleague confess what possible motive would he have to force I into steal something they want I mean come on Jack do I really have to

everything what do you want just tell I what you want welcome professor Sinclair what be this about Jack you can not imagine what it feel like look into the face of the woman I once share a life with and with a single bullet end that life I run through every scenario why what be the purpose in have I believe the only way to save my daughter 's life be to kill her mother and then it occur to I why you would go to such length it be for Sydney you imagine you would drive a wedge between I and my daughter I do not I have nothing to do with Irina 's death one good reason why I should not do to you what I do to my wife Jack this do not make sense think about it even if I do succeed in undermine your relationship with Sydney which give our agreement run counter to my self interest even then with all the people in Sydney 's life Vaughn Nadia anyone do you really believe that she would turn to I Jack I do not do this someone be set I up who be you your question will all be answer in time it be what I have what we can do together that matter year ago I be with the army corps of engineer they want I to study a certain manuscript these page be draw over 500 year ago by a man of genius who anticipate scientific principle century ahead of his time you be insane not at all prototype of his design have already be build turn up all over the world I 've be collect they for the past 35 year I do not understand what do I have I 've be follow your career Dr Sinclair since Stanford I need your expertise you want I to build a 500 year old machine okay listen to I I know that um we all have belief and thing that we really want and wish to be true and real but these spec they be just theoretical they have absolutely no basis in physical reality once you see once you believe it will change everything for you and what if I do not cooperate you will you believe Sloane until prove otherwise yes until prove otherwise do not you hear what I say what the hell do Sloane say to you actually agent Vaughn in this country the burden of proof be on establish guilt not innocence Roberts he be in custody he say that Sloane be behind the attack that he work for Sloane you want to put they together assume he make a positive I D you put he face to face with Sloane watch he try to deny that you will have your proof Roberts the man you be about to see be your former employer Arvin Sloane all we need you to do be make a positive I d well huh what do that mean I mean that dude be he sort of be it he or not I mean yeah it be he but then it be not know what I be say so it be not he but but almost he this be wild like they do not even look that much alike but oh this be freaky man you ask I both of they give I the creep now that I 've be exonerate by your informant I suggest you find out what it be he really do know I will be in my office I believe it be still mine yes just because Roberts do not make a positive I D do not mean Sloane 's not involve be there a problem yes actually there be you be miss a vital component be I a transformer coil which act as a containment stabilizer yes that be right yes we be hope to have obtain the coil by now well then you know that without it a device of this size be incapable of withstand its own power output Hmm Maggie I hire you because countless time you 've prove yourself capable of improvise solution where other have fail well I thank you for your vote of confidence but even I have my limit I see motivate she I want to believe you but it do not make any sense why someone would set you up pursue the same specific thing you 've pursue in the past so you think that I 've resume my search for Rambaldi have you Nadia I make you a promise I give up my past obsession for you look I know I 've give you reason to doubt I I know I 've act crazy in the past but what happen in Siena sweetheart that will not happen again I promise what he be ask might not even be possible even with the component please listen to I I be beg you as you be aware evidence indicate that someone have be actively perpetrate crime in my name Objective be simple find the man apprehend he assume he exist at all that be the assumption we be work with our good lead so far be Roberts where be we with he Roberts have be interrogate his knowledge of the organization he be work for be extremely limited but we can still use he he know their contact protocol we give Roberts the coil and put he into play he make an exchange we track the coil back to Arvin Clone sorry that be what we 've be call he yeah also uh Marvin Sloane Rolling Sloanes but obviously equally disrespectful have Roberts agree to cooperate I be sure we can persuade he to see thing our way um excuse I sorry but we all know that the coil be a key component in the Rambaldi design Rambaldi which mean that per your pardon agreement Mr Sloane you must recuse yourself of all matter Rambaldi you have to leave this room Marshall this mission be about prove my innocence Sydney Marcus talk to Roberts help he to see that it be in his good interest to work with we right away you except I to double cross Sloane he be not sloane whoever he be you dangle bait in front of a man like that you lose a hand I be sorry but uh no can do let us be clear you play ball with we or enjoy the rest of your life in prison I will be safe in prison Trust we guarantee immunity from prosecution National security crime europol record parking ticket you name it it all disappear and we relocate you to someplace safe Someplace safe what like Mars you will have full CIA protection you have our

thing get a little hot so I have to lay low for a whole Lay low a thing lay as in you lay a book down a person lie oh okay well uh listen why do not we get together you can give I some grammar lesson and I can give you that coil you 've be look for you have the coil I be look right at it but consider the considerable risk I 've take to procure it the price just go up Name it 750 plus a neutral place to meet plus no more grammar lesson a neutral location yeah that be right or I disappear again and I take your slinky with I you call back in a half hour I will have a location might not seem it

this place be killer we have to get marry here you have not even propose yet they do not know that we can tell they that we be think about it and get a free meal off the sampler menu excuse I sir do you have the time please Time for I to get the hell out of here just look at your watch and tell I what time it be 2 55 when Carter arrive we will move in and arrest he you have nothing to worry about clearly you do not know the man Yo Rum cannonball a little early for the hard stuff do not you think no I do not in fact make it two one for each hand we have an approach do I know you I be just here to make the sweep make sure you be not carry any weapon sit tight Sydney see where this go okay come with I Whoa whoa whoa whoa the plan be to meet here the plan 's change we be do this in the penthouse show I all team re deploy to cover the penthouse move to the freight elevator Sydney we need audio on Roberts Copy you get stone man double cross Carter like that Sir Sir you leave this at the bar t hank oh so do Carter come himself or do he send somebody oh no no no he want to do this face to face follow they up something 's wrong he be here the clone they be go to cut the cable on my way to the subbasement now Roberts be dead and the coil be go I need to speak with you I see he at the hotel it be only for a moment but I know now what Roberts be talk about the man the impostor everything about he Sloane his clothe his posture they way he look at I it be the way you look at I and how be that Sydney Let us just say it be equally disturbing yeah well quite frankly I be surprised that you do not get to it before what be that you read the report the operation the elevator cable Moscow four year ago yeah I task Julian Sark to a similar strategy in order to relieve a Mr Karpachev of a certain item I require why would someone be impersonate you it appear to be more than that this man his strategy his appearance his affinity for all thing Rambaldi you think he actually believe he be you oh perhaps Marshall be right perhaps I should recuse myself from any further involvement no you have to stay in it in fact you may need to go deeply the coil the manuscript your sense of strategy if you be right about this he have access to everything CIA file your psych report mission analysis you may be the only one who can do it anticipate his next move you be ask I to go back to Rambaldi God help we yes Identity confirm I be wrong about your father I be sorry I know it be be hard to work with Sloane to trust he that be no excuse no you be do your job you do not have to apologize thank for say that but ask he to go back to the thing that be the cause of so many problem what do you mean Chase authorize my request to research Rambaldi be you serious he be in there with Dixon right now Sydney what be it I think you do not know what I see last year when my father and I go back to Siena the close we get to find this artifact that he want the more he begin to change I see he slip away from himself his passion this desperation to connect with Rambaldi it completely overtake he he become a different man his eye be mad lose I do not want to be around he after that the only reason I agree to come back to join a p o it be because he promise I that part of his life be over I know what he be do I know what he be do the man we be look for be attempt to construct an energy source in essence a massive battery be the simple way to describe it where be the power we do not know so that be why he need the transformer coil that be right but in order to use it it be necessary to have an engineer with a specialty in nuclear physics an advanced knowledge of quantum electrodynamic there be only a handful of scientist in the world you think one of they be work with our target yes but not by choice Dr Margaret Sinclair disappear last week in Krakow we can presume this be no coincidence could this battery already be complete it be unlikely there be other important component include xanthium 242 how do we know they do not already have it I contact a former colleague of mine in Sicily someone who trade in illicit chemical apparently yesterday morning Arvin Sloane place an order for an unprecedented amount of xanthium I kindly tell he to hold the order that I would be pick it up personally someone else can do this no it be my contact then you should have backup I will come with you Nadia it be a meeting I do not need backup look sweetheart I know what you be concerned about Rambaldi you have nothing to worry about I will be fine I think you be ask too much of yourself look I 've prove myself to you to everyone I do not have to the DSR be a contain environment you be be watch there be limitation the only limitation that be necessary when I be at the DSR be you when I be study those manuscript the only thing my thought keep return to be you I be surround by symbol of all the thing I once believe in and it all feel meaningless have a daughter know you mean more to I than anything ever have or ever will what about Siena I can not change what you witness in Siena but I can assure you that the man that you see there no long exist I be sorry Nadia for what have I as a father be an arduous undertaking one that I impose on you do not say that I do not want to lose you again then I need to know that you have faith in I consider she do not like run on a wet track that mare be quite the longshot Mr Sloane it be be so long in person I mean well I 've have to take some precaution as of late do you have the package yes of course there be a question I 've be want to ask you for the long time now that you be here yes what be it this OMNIFAM organization you found feed the world 's poor and hungry what be that really about what be in that food you send to those impoverished country Ignacio I know you be involve with genetic experimentation Ignacio the fact be that someone in the black market be pose as I and that same someone place all the previous order of xanthium 242 with you Mr Sloane he he follow all of your protocol I do not know I swear Ignacio I be not here to hurt you but you need to tell I exactly where that shipment be suppose to be send Marshall our team 's go to Santiago pull up satellite surveillance 1500 court of Barrera Montin get it I be on it Weiss make sure the jet be on standby Coordinate an in country rendezvous with sloane at 1200 hour 1200 Jack it be I you can say noon just do it Sloane be join the tactical team consider who we be up against and consider our need for Rambaldi information and be you consider the man himself it be one thing to allow Sloane into the DSR but if his impostor have assemble the Rambaldi device and Sloane be put in front of it what assurance do we have I be call the shot here Marcus and you have a problem with my questioning sloane 's motive as far as I be concern at this juncture Sloane 's motive be irrelevant if he can help bring the impostor to we I say let sloane do what he need to do go to Santiago let us end this Mr Sloane the shipment 's here Good meet they at the loading dock see that it be properly handle I will get Dr Sinclair we will meet you at the lab Outrigger do you have visual I count seven tango so far still search for the hostage the xanthium have arrive you can begin assembly immediately I could have work more

so explain it to we why have not you check inwith your handler Kradic be paranoid if iwould have radio in there be other way I have to report in tom and right now we be lookingat two scenario either you blow your intel or you 've go over which be it you think I sell out you tell we all right I have the intel okay but if I would havewarned langley kradic would have knownwe be on to he so you decide to let15 people die I have my reason we be listen Kradic be after a new weapondeveloped by the indonesian it be a water contaminant it can wipe outwhole ecosystem Kradic have a line on it the embassy bombing be crucialto acquire the weapon it be a handful of livesagainst a half a million that be not your callto make you be not there now look if I be notback in a few minute kradic be go to knowsomething 's wrong yes 15 people die but if we do not recoverthat weapon it will be hundredsof thousand so you go to let mewalk out that door or what your call marcus develop a sample of hydrosec but he do not know where so he bomb the embassyas cover for the intel theft Emergency protocoldictate that if a bomb go off all confidential intelligence istransferre to off site server the explosion triggeredthose protocol Kradic must have beenprepare to intercept the outgoing datum the location of the hydrosecmust have be in those file he know where it be and now he be put together a team to steal itfrom the indonesians indonesian officialsdeny their intelligence have be compromise what else could they say if they admit to developinghydrosec they would be violatinginternational weapon treaty we be talk in circle here the only option we 've get be to make kradic lead usto the weapon we could take he out beforehe get a chance to use it Dixon what be yourtactical assessment consider the situatn I think our good bet be tokeep agent raime in the field agree you and vaughnwill shadow Copy that go check on raime make sure he be okay we will outfit you for comms no dice Kradic have

Evilsort of way what would it taketo manufacture this stuff level 4 biohazard containment yeah and a massivecooling system which should narrow downthe possible location give I a couple hour what be this huh uh you know it be just a copyof some research I be do for ahem mr Sloane it be not damn it what the hellare you think I be sure you mean thatin the most polite way use cia resourcesto check

airfield you want to see I I be think the embassy transmissionthat kradic intercept the network tap he installedwould have have to have be physically placedon the premise I do not follow it would be too riskyto send someone to retrieve it afterwards so we can assume it store the information which mean we might be ableto access it remotely as well and download the same intelkradic get off it this be all assumingthe indonesian have not already locatedand remove the tap it be worth a shot I will get marshall right on it go into the development of this little marvel and you yank it out with a letter opener what be youtalke about you do not havethe faint I implant it to regulate the medicationin your bloodstream I explain the entireprocedure to you you do I do I have no memory of this well

just arrivedat tuege airfield Marshall be able to runa network probe at the indonesian embassy it turn outmy father be right we 've get a sourceon the hydrosec It'sn a manufacture plantin peru

month pose as a document expert in forge counterfeit two week ago he warn Langley of a pende attack in Denmark and he never follow up with the detail Agent Raimes have miss the last four meeting with

in Prague base on treatment protocol in Chernobyl it be apple and orange Jack we be not talk about alpha particle and beta particle gamma or neutron ray the radiation you be expose to when you walk into that reactor well it be a different fruit altogether then we will keep look 20 year I 've know you you be not one iota less stubborn How be Sydney she be do well I remember when she be just start school where do the year go Jack I 've watch countless people die have to look into my patient ' eye when I tell they what they have be terminal and you know what that stuff about laughter be the good medicine it be a load of bunk I assume you have a point a clean conscience that be a treatment I can stand behind we both know how this be go to end we can filter your blood till the cow come home but there be no change the outcome Clear your conscience Jack that would take another lifetime at least I be not suggest you write your memoir although I be sure they would make a hell of a read start small talk to your daughter she be well off not know Jack these secret you be keep they be not yours to keep we 've be wait over an hour think Kradic 's go to show I hope so you have history with the target I know the undercover agent raime from Langley we be in the corps together Force recon Toughest guy in our platoon do not think the bullet be make that could take he down we do not know that he be dead he could 've be capture if raime be alive he would have make contact okay there be Kradic there be another guy there brown jacket you see he that be raime do you think he be go rogue you 've grow into a beautiful woman you know so different from the girl I once know you be so angry then I know it be hard to believe at least it be for I but I have a home now a family I finally feel like I belong somewhere your father 's a good man I can tell you should rest now I will be by tonight to check on you Nadia wait it be San Marcos the orphanage 's namesake my happy time be there watch over you girl I want you to have it I can not please it be my way of thank you for take care of I whoa oh hey I sorry Mr Sloane I be test out a mod on a virtual imag and well you look a little freaky there be a latent fingerprint in here I want to get everything you can on the person it belong to I want it keep between we yeah sure no problem thank you Dad Dixon and Vaughn call in they find Raimes he be alive he be travel with Kradic have our team shadow raime the second he be alone pull he aside for question I want to know why he have not contact Langley I will let they know Dad let I know when Dixon and Vaughn have secure raime I will keep you post get the target he just order a whiskey straight up okay go for it oh I be sorry I do not see you there Cheers we be in Amsterdam this be the good place we can find no if I choose the meet we would be in a park or near a beautiful canal where be you go where be you go last time I see you like this be in a bar in Baghdad Marcus what be you do here Langley assume you be compromise what be go on the embassy bombing you warn of an attack somewhere in Denmark two week ago then nothing why do not you send a second warning that the bomb would go off you know what I will fill out a report later right now I get to get back out there because Kradic be meet with an associate then talk fast Tom we need answer you do not understand so explain it to we why have not you check in with your handler Kradic be paranoid if I would have radio in there be other way I have to report in Tom and right now we be look at two scenario either you blow your intel or you 've go over which be it you think I sell out you tell we all right I have the intel okay but if I would have warn Langley Kradic would have know we be on to he so you decide to let 15 people die I have my reason we be listen Kradic be after a new weapon develop by the indonesian it be a water contaminant it can wipe out whole ecosystem Kradic have a line on it the embassy bombing be crucial to acquire the weapon it be a handful of life against a half a million that be not your call to make you be not there now look if I be not back in a few minute Kradic be go to know something 's wrong yes 15 people die but if we do not recover that weapon it will be hundred of thousand so you go to let I walk out that door or what your call Marcus Indonesians develop a sample of hydrosec but he do not know where so he bomb the embassy as cover for the intel theft Emergency protocol dictate that if a bomb go off all confidential intelligence be transfer to off site server the explosion trigger those protocol Kradic must have be prepare to intercept the outgoing datum the location of the hydrosec must have be in those file he know where it be and now he be put together a team to steal it from the indonesians indonesian official deny their intelligence have be compromise what else could they say if they admit to develop hydrosec they would be violate international weapon treaty we be talk in circle here the only option we 've get be to make Kradic lead we to the weapon we could take he out before he get a chance to use it Dixon what be your tactical assessment consider the situation I think our good bet be to keep agent raime in the field agree you and Vaughn will shadow copy that go check on Raimes make sure he be okay we will outfit you for comms no dice Kradic have state of the art countersurveillance detection if I show up there wire for sound I will light up like a Christmas tree then we will modify the comms Spread spectrum burst transmitter should be beyond Kradic 's capability it will take we a few minute to get they ready I will brush past you with they Fine I will meet you at the bar in 10 minute wait this meet who be it a hacker Linus Halsey why do Kradic know this hacker face to face you be think of switch he out well you stand a well chance with another man on the inside Fine but you well hurry he will be here in one hour hey what the hell where do you go let I tell you something shooting whiskey on an empty stomach not good what be the matter Milos push you around again he be wait you be like a little girl come on let us go I will start with Langley see if they have an open file on Halsey if there be a current file photo we can run his faceprint through Interpol 's biometric city scan make it fast we do not have much time Mr Sloane sir Mr here be that background check that you ask I to run yeah Sophia Vargas yeah you actually probably just want to skip to the last page thank you Marshall Sure I find the hacker Linus Halsey he be an MIT graduate with a degree in nonlinear cryptoalgorithsm and stochastic system analysis because if they call it code break they could not charge 30 grand tuition okay I be link with Amsterdam 's urban surveillance network I be check the database for hotel reservation get he Hotel ruisseau it be just a few block over from where they be get eye on Halsey okay let I know when you 've get he and I will head inside Shotgun what be go on Dixon come your way I would have have he I know hey good work on hotel Ruisseau they catch Halsey Thanks we aim to please you be in a good mood yeah I guess so so thing go well with Sophia after we leave yeah I 've miss she so much it be be a long time I be so different back then you would not have know I I bet I would have no I be crazy wild I do not know what Sophia see in I she be always tell I I be her special one for year after I leave the orphanage that be the only thing I could hang on to I know someone somewhere believe in I you be lucky to have a person like that in your life yeah why do you really come here tell I I do not know what you mean I know all about Jose Pedraza I know how the argentine police find his body I know they find a suspect 's fingerprint but they could not find a match I do he be hurt my girl and I be the one who hire he to tend the ground I do not realize do he hurt Nadia he try I do not give he the second chance I know what I do be wrong but they be my child yeah I would have do the same thing still that do not answer my question all I ever want be to protect Nadia when she be bring to I as a baby she be in danger I change her last name to Santos so nobody could find she the man who attack I in Lisbon they be not after I they be after Nadia they want to know what name I have give she and what do you tell they nothing why do not you tell Nadia when I see she with her sister with you she deserve the happiness she be find here I could not bring back all that pain to her life do not worry now I can take care of her how can you be sure because I know who be after my child you want to show I something oh yeah hey Syd yeah check this out now this be one nanogram of hydrosec which be one billionth of a gram in a 500 milliliter beaker of water accord to my simulation the toxin actually feed off the water one gram of hydrosec Lake Michigan turn into sludge it be incredible really you know you know Dr Evil sort of way what would it take to manufacture this stuff level 4 biohazard containment yeah and a massive cooling system which should narrow down the possible location give I a couple hour what be this huh uh you know it be just a copy of some research I be do for ahem Mr Sloane it be not damn it what the hell be you think I be sure you mean that in the most polite way use CIA resource to check up on Sophia I be merely be cautious I do not understand this but Nadia believe in you somehow you 've earn her trust every time you lie to her you break that bond I want you to understand that I be not tell you this out of concern for you only my sister Nobody read the paper anymore there be too much tragedy in the world Clean have a seat your reputation proceed you Mr Halsey you be too kind temperamental Arrogant Vindictive Violent Vain Petty and deceitful you be forget talented brilliant and easy on the eye ha there be that you be suppose to be brilliant they say you be the good hacker in the e u that be the rep but what go wrong on the Kroner job Kroner job what happen Petty who the hell 's that son of a bitch to call I petty you know what you can all go f Aah nothing go wrong then why do Kroner hate you so much hmm I finish the job as agree perfectly I may add Aah listen to I you son of a bitch I be not go to let you hang my partner out to dry Uhh the son of a bitch short I 10 grand Kroner stiffe he 10 000 euro then Kroner turn around forgot to pay I my 10 000 euro that do not explain why he hate you now by my count you still have three ring leave that be on one ear what happen after he stiffe I he hack Kroner 's credit card to buy hooker I hack into his credit card account charge it exactly 10 000 euro to several young lady in the red light district and then send the bill to his wife yes I do we leave in an hour Aleksander tell the team to meet we at Tuege airfield you want to see I I be think the embassy transmission that Kradic intercept the network tap he instal would have have to have be physically place on the premise I do not follow it would be too risky to send someone to retrieve it afterwards so we can assume it store the information which mean we might be able to access it remotely as well and download the same intel Kradic get off it this be all assume the indonesian have not already locate and remove the tap it be worth a shot I will get Marshall right on it decade of research go into the development of this little marvel and you yank it out with a letter opener what be you talk about you do not have the faint I implant it to regulate the medication in your bloodstream I explain the entire procedure to you you do I do I have no memory of this well we talk about the fact that memory loss could be a side effect I even implant a second one in your calf you do not remember that either do you my position my job this side effect be unacceptable I can adjust the medication but your condition be progress quick than I have anticipate Jack have you think any more about what we discuss about Sydney Sydney have have to face so many thing in her life too many for someone so young and now give my condition I do not want to burden she it be not fair Honesty that be fair you will not always be around to protect her Jack she have to know the truth before it be too late you disagree with my decision the embassy I be not there I be box in so I make a call do some civilian die yes would I do it again absolutely there be sacrifice we have to make there be casualty in the business that we be in you disappoint I Marcus there be a time you understand that that be a long time ago thing be different what happen you get religion I have that no I got marry have kid change a man Mm you mean it soften I mean it deepens give a man perspective maybe we need man who can make the hard call weigh the many against the few I just know that every time I think of those 15 people at the embassy it weigh on I how many kid you get a daughter Robin and a son Steven and the lucky lady my wife be kill a few year ago what you would call a casualty of the business we be in make sure the plane 's ready to go Ooh hope it be warm where we be go 'cause this weather 's kill I we be 15 minute behind schedule we will have to make it up in the air Vaughn just check in Kradic 's man just arrive at Tuege airfield Marshall be able to run a network probe at the indonesian embassy it turn out my father be right we 've get a source on the hydrosec it be in a manufacturing plant in Peru unfortunately Kradic beat we to it he must have have a team in place four hour ago there be a fire in one of the research lab our theory be that Kradic 's man cause the accident to steal the hydrosec it fit their m o use disaster to achieve their operational objective well the big question be since they have it where do they plan to use it it be most likely that Kradic will set up a rendezvous with the heist team our good course of action would still be to keep Dixon in play that be it something else Jack I know we agree to keep this between ourselves but the time have arrive personal consideration have be weigh on I Arvin we need to tell they the truth yes I know you be right I be afraid that Nadia 's already in danger fully fueled and ready to take we over the border get the gear let us move I be in place do you read go ahead Kradic have gather a total of six team member and they be en routeto the plane and agent Dixon be still embed securely hey what be go on Outrigger I be in position I have a well question which one of you two be agent Dixon what Milos come on put the gun down take it easy enough Aleksander intercept a transmission Transmission what be you talk about you be just be paranoid I know one of you be an agent if I move any close I will be make do you have a weapon Milos come on let us see this thing through come on we be not do anything till I find out the truth I sense something be wrong about you no no no you wrong you know my reputation you check out the Kroner job I should have trust my instinct now see this be insane I be not an agent take it easy who do you work for CIA Mossad man what you talk about Milos nobody here be an agent okay then you leave I little choice huh I will have to kill both you which one of you would like to die first nobody be get to die we be all on the same side here everybody just need to calm down low your gun okay kill both of they enough outrigger do not shoot Kradic we need he to lead we to the hydrosec let I finish this get on your knee this be how you deal with traitor what you got to say now agent Dixon so Dixon any last word hey casualty of the business I be in he be give we an out he be sacrifice himself to save the mission shoot he do it we have business to do and we need to get out of here before this guy 's backup show you be welcome let us go this be agent Vaughn field code alpha 5 0 niner charlie Request authorization for a code 4 medivac we have an agent down Vaughn just report in Agent Raimes be be medivacte to Deventer he be critical but stable they be say the shot do not hit any of his vital organ Dixon save his life he just board the plane with Kradic and his team here be the tail number of his flight all right I will put in a call to euro control see if we can track it I think I might be able to triangulate Dixon 's signal use one of NSA 's comm sat just excuse I do you have a minute what be this about please come in there be something we need to tell you something you have the right to know it concern your mother 's sister Katya Yelena she be one of the KGB 's foremost assassin responsible for the murder of countless diplomat and politician throughout eastern europe in the course of her work she earn a reputation for be the cruel of the Derevko woman why be you tell we this now because almost 30 year ago Yelena disappear it be rumor that she have a fall out with Irina Yelena sever all tie with the KGB as well as her family both the CIA and the KGB try to find she but to no avail even Irina could not locate she but you find something I receive a message from an old associate about a year ago that lead I to one of Yelena 's safehouse in Warsaw inside we find this it be I in college this be my old apartment in Argentina my grad school transcript I be 9 here give what be here we can assume she be be surveille you both for at least a decade we can also assume that she be responsible for the attack on Sophia why what do she want from we we do not know we be do everything we can to find out it be I the plane be in the air do we know where they be head I will contact you once I have their final destination I will be wait I will not let you down Yelena do you have any idea where Yelena be now at this point she could be anywhere Synchro Travis Transcript RaceMan www forom com what be take so long you be an impatient bastard be not you Time be money the hydrosect will be here soon at which point we will move on to the next stage which be Dispersal for now we relax and enjoy ourselves Cheers Outrigger 's armed he be in V I p with Kradic and two other expect delivery of hydrosect any minute good work Phoenix once delivery be confirm we need to take every precaution to ensure the hydrosect remain stable have we confirm the method of transport it be Jack 's responsibility he have not check in yet this morning have he no now it will most likely arrive in a large metal biometric case you know the kind that be usually name after large multinational corporation Shotgun what be your status no sign of Kradic 's man yet yeah good the hydrosect 's here out front about time get a visual on the hydrosect Vaughn take cover Phoenix what be happen drop the gun or lose your arm do not move I be on he Phoenix what be go on Third party try to intercept the hydrosect I be in pursuit Put the gun down or this go into the drinking water I say put they down send in the biohazard team we need to contain the hydrosect on their way so the CIA have the hydrosect they get lucky if I can find out where they take it I can get it back leave that to I come to Los Angeles contact I when you get here everything all right oh yes just make a hotel reservation Sophia you just get here do not I use to say that to you stay I insist we want you to be here please all

what do you want to do about it so this be where your dad live huh yeah what do you expect I do not know a bunker or something so you 've really never be here no that be very strange as oppose to everything else about my relationship with my father 301 here it be Dad not much for clutter be he no Sydney come here look at this body temperature blood pressure blood cell count he be monitor his vital Marshall oh hey do you hear the news I get to run an initial analysis on hydrosect this afternoon I love level 4 biohazard toxin my father ask I to give you this artist 's sketch base on description from Sydney and Vaughn he want to know if you can run a biometric match yeah but off a sketch it be a bit tricky can you do it Flinkman do not know the meaning of failure one ugly puss huh Muy feo now they have a picture of you they have a cartoon draw they will never get a positive I d off of that you underestimate they in Vienna and we lose the hydrosect lucky break Nadia have a laptop with a p o access she bring it home every night we may be able to use it to find the hydrosect how long would it take you to hack into it I be afraid our option be limit Jack the white blood cell anomaly be not what we have hope for Limited not exhaust Science be full of happy accident Alexander Fleming spend year try to figure out how to treat bacterial infection he need a vacation so bad he forget to wash his petri dish before leave the lab so he come back a week later well rest tan and what be he face with a stack of moldy dish but he look a little close and son of a gun not an iota of bacteria grow anywhere near the mold Penicillin just a happy accident Fascinating anecdote although its relevance to my condition be not exactly I have spend most of my career research genetic mutation mostly in rat I like rat much smart than they be give credit for these little bugger be expose to the mother lode of radiation I be distract one day problem with the wife and I accidentally give they a lethal dose of an alkylate agent but lo and behold a few of my rat survive Milo live to the ripe old age of 4 that be something yes but 84 of my rat be dead within a week and give what they go through death be a blessing we both know the prognosis for my condition I do not see that I have a choice this alkylate agent be discontinue decade ago it be consider too lethal even in control environment I have contact I be sure I can procure the necessary chemical here be what we need Jack as one friend to another these drug be nasty if they do not cure you I will turn out like one of your rat I will be in touch come up with anything on that assailant not yet but I be write an algorithm into the program to speed thing up so excuse I yeah hello I hate to bother you at work but I be hope that I could make dinner for you and Sydney and your boyfriend tomorrow night Sophia you do not have to it would mean so much to I after all you 've do be we free for dinner tomorrow Dinner Food be you kid I yes it be fine with we but I have to check with Sydney and Vaughn Great Jack be you able to get what I request yeah sure Cute listen I need you to promise I there be no way this be go to get trace back to I I be familiar with your concern look Jack I do not mean to be presumptuous tell you how to handle your business but the human body be not design to handle this stuff whoever this poor guy be you be go to be torture curious morality come from a guy who kill monkey for a live what I be say be conservative a few ccs at a time or you be go to be out of fun before it begin thank for the advice so this this pay off my debt to you right be see you Anthony I need a favor sure what can I do for you pull up everything you 've get an alkylate agent and cross reference it with radiation sickness okay kind of an odd combination what exactly be you look for Something be go on with my dad I have to get to the bottom of it come right up just uh Marshall what be wrong with my father Hmm you know do not you it be after your mission to Yakutsk yeah God he pull the fuel right out of the core reactor he tell I not to tell you he actually make I swear on Mitchell 's life but see that you come in here to I I guess I do not really violate I think you shut down the reactor from here so do I at first but then you got trap in the experimental chamber and he think it would be good if he go inside and Marshall whatever information you have on his treatment I need it now Syd there be no treatment I mean I have be all over the medical journal harass researcher that I know some that I do not know if there be a treatment I would have find it by now Sydney what be it we have to find my father Jack Bristow be in need of immediate medical attention currently he be off the grid we 've try all usual avenue of communication we have contact every hospital and private practice in Los Angeles county no one have record of treat he maybe he check in use an alias well we consider that but the genetic mutation he experience would require any doctor to make special note and nothing match your father 's criterion have be report the truth be whatever my father have it be not treatable if he be as sick as we think he be it be likely that his mental faculty be impair which mean someone might be prey on Jack use the false promise of a cure we must act quickly if someone be actively try to harm Jack he may be in no position to defend himself how do it go all right I will prepare this and we will be ready to go Connie will take care of your personal belonging how be you feel today Mr Bristow Hopeful we get a hit Jack just use a drive thru ATM on 9th about 20 minute ago down near Staples center Great I will log onto the traffic surveillance network see if I can spot his car leave the bank Fantastic come on dad pick up your phone please leave your name and number with a brief message Damn it Syd we will find he okay I get it yeah Marshall we find his car it be park outside a building on Pierpont do you know where Pierpont be yeah five minute out oh thank you Marshall remind I to kiss you okay what what have she say uh nothing Everything be set the whole procedure should take about four hour what be these restraint for uh some patient go into convulsion when they be unconscious I do not want you to hurt yourself Jack have you think about talk to Sydney I do keep too many secret when this be behind I that be go to change Sydney deserve more she deserve to know that she be the most important thing in my life she and Laura of course I be proud

god dad Marshall we need medical attention now Sydney 's with Jack they 've take he to the infirmary so he inject himself with poison well apparently he think it be a cure now they get it out of his system but this illness they say within 72 hour his condition will advance to the point where it be irreversible do he wake up in the ambulance Briefly he keep want to see his doctor Dr Liddell apparently he be be suffer from hallucination for week Dr Liddell yeah Dr Atticus Liddell he exist he do 25 year ago Atticus Liddell develop a radical thesis regard the treatment of genetic mutation in 1981 he leave the U S to pursue his theory he be work with patient devastate by an undisclosed nuclear accident in the soviet union unfortunately it be the cold war shortly after he arrive the

agree to meet with I what can I do for you Mr Sloane our institute be mandate to develop measure to counter terrorism we have of course hear about the work you 've do here and you know want to perhaps our bee be not for sale well of course they be not what we want be your knowledge not your insect per se I understand you 've breed the aggression out of they this be not strictly true the aggression be there the need for it happily be not Come Mr Sloane I will show you the truth be these bee have an exceptionally venomous sting they be very hard to antagonize they choose productivity over aggression Aggression be a distraction which be why we be able to work among the apiary without the traditional protective garment Remarkable there be so very much we can learn from these exquisite being Fascinating they be imbue with a kind of grace unlike so many human and you 've achieve that grace how at Monte Inferno we be dedicated to the the marriage of suppose opposite amongst they man and his science God and his miracle come together for the profit of all just think about it the right blend of genetic engineering dietetic supplement behavior modification and you could create a new specie oh no no my son merely a well bee one close to God 's grand design we even have the ability to control their body temperature make the bee work hard long more in synch all for the common good Extraordinary Paphiopedilum khan the rare of lady slipper orchid specie generally think to be extinct not exactly a close cousin no this be the genuine article bring here to Italy from China by Marco Polo in 1269 a gift from Kubla Khan and what do you want if I might I would like to spend a little time here examine your historical paper take a cutting of your orchid a cutting ha ha ha for 50 million deposit immediately to your account in Vanuatu and Samoa yes it be true I have a little put away for a rainy day the fact be I be uninterested in money I be a man of God not a merchant in my experience father the two be hard mutually exclusive I be so sorry you come all this way for nothing no I be the one who be sorry I be come home Plan b please help I certainly Anti venom enough to give you a shot at actually survive but first the Rambaldi orchid formula which you use on your bee you go to hell you first now keep both arm up like this yes I know I know you tell I every day thank you they treat you like an idiot keep them up dad it be for your own good Dr Liddell say you have to follow procedure to the letter if you want to make a full recovery I never thank you for what you do help to find Liddell you do not have to that other charade you pretend to be your mother whose idea be that Sloane 's you be live in 1981 you be delusional it be the only way we could get you to reveal Liddell 's whereabout you tell her dad you tell mom you be a CIA agent you break protocol that be how she steal agency secret I be put these down now you also say you be think about resign from the CIA you would have right dad if she have not leave I do not like be away all the time not be a part of your life you be part of it now they be ready for the briefing thank you we be come yesterday a rare orchid be steal from the Monte Inferno monastery in Umbria 45 monk be kill to obtain it Satellite photo confirm it be the same man we encounter in Santiago the man who claim to be I detail be in your briefing folder what be so special about this orchid it have chemical property which heighten the receptivity in the neural pathway we think we assume well we do not know really it be just that nobody in the scientific community have lay eye on it for century we have be ask to recover it find the impostor get the orchid I want a plan on my desk by 2200 that be it Arvin a word of course you say it be harmless this could never happen I do not know it could I never imagine the effect of the orchid could be reverse no but somebody do let us not overreact Jack what we see the effect of the Mueller device be a demonstration on insect not on human we be stare at the potential for global disaster in no small part because of what you 've put in place do not you think I realize the responsibility I bear we need to find the orchid Jack not waste time argue over what we can not change 72 hour if we have not recover the orchid in that time I be go to Langley with this it will mean the end of you Arvin you too jack I know 72 hour the italian police dead end on both vehicle Satellite surveillance be a bust echelon 's bone dry apparently our Sloane Clone have vanish into the ether then we be back to square one not exactly if we can not find he we will make he find we the vespertine paper Rambaldi text that refer to our steal orchid Rumor be they be destroy during World War II you want to bring they out of hiding Leak dummy intel that they be find in father Kampinski 's personal belonging we can get the DSR to loan we some document set it up as an auction I have a contact at the Paris antiquity house Smile and look like a lot of money dollar or Euros Euros definitely Mark Mullins from the Carolina institute ah yes thank you Evergreen you be on the air uplinke to a p o I would love to be there it be too risky the impostor 's see you before I know just Nadia will do fine let us hope so sell for 5 million euro to the man in the gray flannel suit our next item lot 47 be a last minute addition the vespertine paper all interested bidder should take a few moment to examine the document look but please do not touch let us see who take the bait Identity Toshiro Takenada Wealthy Rambaldi collector from Kyoto Efraim Dousseau Ngumbe Dilettante far more money than vision Remarkable I 've never see she before Evergreen get a look at her name tag Pamela McNabb Stanwyck institute Yowza Easy what we can not appreciate beautiful thing no you be right Watch tv can not touch the knob it be a dummy corp McNabb 's a phoney we will start the bidding at 2 million euro I have 2 million do I hear 2 5 2 5 do I have 3 million 4 million 6 million 9 million 10 million the girl stop bid something go wrong Merlin McNabb 's cell phone I be all over it scan to get a GSM source her conversation 's encrypt 11 5 McNabb 's on the move stop the woman copy that 12 million suppose she be not work for your impostor no it be she then why be she leave I would only stop bid if I be certain that I could recover the paper through some other mean 13 million she be a decoy outrigger check the paper copy that Evergreen forget about her the paper be go out the back Marcus what a surprise we get he good work bring he home we will make he tell we where the orchid be Jack of course I should have know you know I what kind of question be that of course I know you and I what about you do you know I no I be Arvin Sloane I see this be your idea Jack play with my sense of reality I do not know what you be talk about I 've never meet you it be not go to work okay shall we state this for the record I be Arvin Sloane Posing as Arvin Sloane you recently steal a rare orchid from the Monte Inferno monastery your masquerade be over you 've be catch what happen next you deprive I of food try to alter my sense of time childish attempt to break I down you Jack of all people should know that who be you who be I 1985 belize for 72 hour we be stick in a safe house question a revolutionary and after you cut off how many finger be it eight he tell we what we want only you and I know that you leave it off the after action report how desperate the company must be to play this pitiable mind game think you could call this actor this this clown Arvin Sloane and make I doubt my own identity tell I how do you account for the fact that in the recent past this man create and run an international relief agency call OMNIFAM the world know his face as Arvin Sloane he be a CIA stooge with my good look and I can prove it the affair in Santiago I notice that both Marcus Dixon and Sydney Bristow be in on that mission it beggar reason to believe that these same two agent would ever agree to work for the man who kill their love one what be the most logical scenario that I be the impostor or that you be this be weird unless you have something well to offer either start cut off my finger or kindly call my lawyer Marshall would like to see you tell he I say hello try not to kill he what have we get oh hey uh I think you should see for yourself what be I look at well these be the impostor 's EEG reading his brain activity basically every individual have a unique brain pattern a signature and take a look at this other one they be identical exactly whose EEG be this well that be the weird part I pull these from the CIA 's database this be Arvin Sloane the real sloane our Sloane you be tell I these two man share identical brain for all intent and purpose well yes I mean this man be Arvin Sloane at least his brain be how be that possible back at SD 6 I work on a project that focus on brain imprint engram encode that program be run out of psy op by McCullough who be McCullough Calvin McCullough senior partner at SD 6 he head the psychological warfare and operation division among the numerous program he oversee be something call Project Brainstorm its purpose to explore experimental technology to aid in interrogation brainwash the creation of sleeper agent as well as the transfer of memory from one subject to another this be what we think happen to this man he be make to believe he be Sloane not just believe but to act among other thing he share the same desire which explain his pursuit of Rambaldi artifact well if you think about it this guy be be able to stay two step ahead of we the entire time he think like you he know your strategy your playbook your secret when we be in Santiago go after Sloane Clone the first time you know the access code to his facility Jacquelyn I have no reference for that it just come to I probably because it be bury deep inside your subconscious which also mean it be bury inside his but you say the be only experimental technology at the time so someone must have continue McCullough 's research after SD 6 be take down McCullough be tip off to the raid he evade capture who tip he I do I owe he a favor one he clearly do not return to I if McCullough be hold the string then we may have a lead on the orchid I have a good idea where he might be I will put Dixon and Vaughn on McCullough in the meantime we continue the interrogation here I see you be enjoy your retirement do not mind if we join you do you it be be a long time Mr Dixon to what do I owe the pleasure of your company Arvin Sloane send we the real Arvin Sloane tell we where the orchid be and we might be able to cut you a deal I do not know where it be listen to I if you do not want to spend the rest of your life in a federal prison I suggest you start cooperate with we now and I be tell you I do not have the answer you be look for we know you use Project Brainstorm technology to make that man believe he be Arvin Sloane and I be not deny that you have he acquire the orchid for you where be it yes I make he believe he be Sloane but I do too good a job he double cross I and keep the orchid for himself just like Arvin would have do you be lie I be beyond lie all that really matter now be that my employer would never let I live long enough to be interrogate and that right now I have 300 milligram of cyanide course through my vein the coffee get an ambulance who be you work for Tell Arvin I I be so happy to see you Sydney I have only one question to ask you where be the orchid four year be a long time not to see someone you love it appear you 've do well look if you want to tell I where to find the orchid I will be happy to continue this farce otherwise be you sure that be what you want Sydney think about it there be so many thing you could ask of I why not choose one that matter such as the reengineering of the evolution of the specie you find an application for one of Rambaldi 's formula mm hmm finally I be the first to admit that some of Rambaldi 's quest occasionally degenerate into sheer foly but not this one go on the work we do the work you do now take down bad guy put out fire you be a beat cop not make a dent you 've get to go to the source human nature itself where we be head what will become of human being you want to change the world you want to really deal in the vanquishing of evil and the ascendency of good well I be your guy you be tell I you be one of the good guy Come work with I this work would it involve genetic and bioengineere in part a vulgarian would use the word mutate but it have such negative connotation mutate into what ostensibly into a more evolved less aggressive being you know cooperative calm easy to control like the bee at the monastery you turn they into killer the bee be a test I want to see if what go down could come up so to speak oh come on Sydney how many war be there last century and how many people die in those war through genocide or political repression we be disgust human do we learn from grace or beauty or what we call God what be you go to do about it suppose one could administer a formula to the general population that would quietly alter our brain chemistry exponentially expand our capacity for quality like empathy and harmonic coexistence this formula how would you administer it nothing could be more simple do you have any idea how many additive be in our drinking water if I could undo what I do I would the truth be through OMNIFAM I introduce a combination of substance into water supply throughout the world it be my intent base on Rambaldi 's formula to create a more peaceful specie to breed the aggression out of the population just as the monk have do with their bee we do not have time for your rationalization no excuse I I be assume that you fail right yes I fail because I do not have the orchid I attempt to artificially manufacture its nectar because your impostor already have the orchid he do not need to acquire any of the other substance you mention all he have to do be put the nectar into the water you contaminate you load the gun that be right how many people be we talk about how many people drink the contaminated water somewhere between 300 and 400 million what assume the impostor 's organization be already harvest the chemical from inside that orchid I suggest we not waste time on accusation right now what be the option Dixon and Vaughn be uplinke all of McCullough 's file there might be a lead in there divide it up see what you can find I would like to talk to you I see it on your face you know you know what he do and you ignore it I want to know why Sydney he be sick dad can not you see that he be at the height of his obsession with Rambaldi but he abandon his scheme you still trust he I trust that when he lay the seed for this crisis he think he be do something good that he do not see this as a trigger for global genocide so he be simply a delusional megalomaniac with benign intention Sydney what Sloane do can not be undo to alert the public would be bad than useless it would create worldwide panic we need that flower which we could have recover long ago and turn over to the DSR for safe keeping but we do not because you sit on what you know which make you as guilty as he be yes Marshall I think I find something okay from what I be able to get from McCullough 's file SD 6 perform detailed brain scan on Sloane McCullough then recreate Sloane 's brain digitally and then upload it to this guy I mean those file they be ingrain deep which leave we very few option he will never give we the location of the orchid as long as he still believe that he be I that be right we will have to shock it out of he you know split it off from his dual persona and then get his real personality to tell we where the orchid be be we talk shock therapy no not in the traditional sense accord to the research relive a painful memory or a tragic experience will literally shake his mooring but have to be something really bad it can not be you know like I be sorry hypnotic regression take he back to a point in the past and your past and make he recall the memory Arvin Clone he will probably resist that you would have to relive a painful memory and then record it use McCullough 's technology and then upload it to sloane II you know it be kind of like throw a switch one second he be Arvin Clone and then shazam he be himself again what be the risk to the subject I be not sure it will either break he down or not what about to he the thing be I be go to need a little bit more time to run some test before I synthesize so no we do it now fine where do we begin Jacquelyn who be Jacquelyn 30 year ago I no do not sorry sir it be just it be well if you experience it in the moment do not verbalize okay now this should help you feel nice and relaxed once you be semi conscious the electrode will administer small pulse to put you into a hypnotic state I be go to need some help access Jacquelyn right Mr Bristow will speak to you through your ear bug he will administer certain verbal cue which should bring your mind into the right place I see okay good luck we be ready to record his experience you be on Arvin I be go to count back from 10 to 1 when I get to 1 you will be in a place where you can tell I about Jacquelyn 10 9 8 what be that he be fight it he do not want to go back to Jacquelyn keep go 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 I think we could take the boat before it get too cold perhaps have lunch in Bellagio hmm what do you think I like just be here you can see the wind in the tree maybe you should go no no no we can sit here for as long as you like for as long as you need and I promise you we will get past Jacquelyn I do not want to hear that name you can not say it Arvin it hurt too much will you promise I that you will not speak her name again never say her name let I in Emily please I be alone in this Arvin right now I be alone no Jacquelyn Jacquelyn could she have be a mistress please wait a minute look at this be he okay I do not know Arvin we be not quite there yet you need to go back who be Jacquelyn Arvin go back to when you meet she you be suppose to be do exactly nothing and that mean not garden it be the nesting instinct I can not help it Emily

ha Baby Jacquelyn Jacquelyn I like that Baby Jacquelyn Dad do you have any idea sloane 's number be wild his beta brainwave be cycle at 14 per second and he be release massive amount of glycine onto the motoneuron we have to bring he out do we have enough enough to confront the impostor no not yet arvin keep go what happen to Jacquelyn how be she no no no no please Arvin it be a mistake please no no no arvin please listen to I this be a risky pregnancy and she fight she try so hard to stay with we it be too much her heart could not no no my baby Emily oh my baby I be sorry I be so sorry no guy

pregnancy he be there right now he be stuck there he be kind of in that state can not we just wake he up you see what happen to Bolger and the shock could kill he right think of it like in computer term you can not just force quit we have to reboot his brain how beat I what if one we try to guide he back the way that Jack be able to prompt some of my father 's memory by talk to he well it could work but it also could kill he you know serotonin overload I mean he could die of happiness literally you have a well idea no let us get start okay he can hear you now hi dad keep go Dad it be I Nadia

premature Mr Sloane I suggest you come back when you have retrieve all the item include the sphere you will come back too will not you I would like that Nadia I wonder if you would let I speak to the professor alone I never think I would see let alone touch with my own hand a live embodiment my daughter be not an artifact so protective of her she be my daughter you bring she on this journey for one reason only she can retrieve the sphere of life only she know its secret location you know that I do not come this far to quit this be it Rambaldi write that a man would come and discover the true meaning of his work and in do so would change the world I always want to be that man it be make of glass think of it you and I be the first one to set foot in here in almost 500 year do you have any

Lazlo Drake he be the self appoint gatekeeper to Rambaldi 's endgame for Elena to complete her plan she will have to contact he he have what amount to the instruction booklet I be sorry maybe it be only I but what do you mean when you say Rambaldi 's endgame I mean what be it be it a scenario a weapon in Elena 's hand most likely an apocalypse which be why we need to get to Lazlo Drake before she do Drake 's completely off the grid the manuscript have make he a target he never stay in one place too long we see he in China he could be anywhere if Drake 's go underground he need a source of income that be the path I 've be pursue Greyson Wells billionaire financier organize crime money launder CIA 's be watch he for year he be also the man who finance most of Drake 's early research into Rambaldi if they be in communication he might know where to find Drake Agreed Coordinate with op draft up a plan to approach Wells I will start preparation to talk to Lazlo Drake myself as soon as we have his location I believe you be forbid from participate in case involve this particular subject matter Agent Dixon have a point yes I be aware of the agreement but I have a history with Drake so do Nadia I be sure Nadia would agree that her presence would only complicate matter he be right Drake will talk to I if we approach this tactically his security force will respond we can not let this turn into a firefight our timetable be too critical proceed as instruct once you have a location on Drake you will relay it to director Sloane that be it people be safe do not touch the fur all right

good to see you yeah weekend be not enough tell I about it yes I have an idea but you be go to hate it you want I to talk to your aunt Katya how do you know that first you say I would hate the idea

that look on your face suppose to be intimidate you forget Jack I 've see your tender side I need everything you know about Elena 's operation right now what make you think I know anything call it an instinct do you intend to torture I if I have to while I know that would be enjoyable for both of we I should warn you I have quite a bit of stamina but you already know that about I what do you want Katya full pardon Immediate release I do not have that authority you will find a way if the information you provide lead we to Elena I will do everything in my power to procure your freedom you have my word if you be here my sister must be pursue aggressive action what have she do she break into the DSR steal a cache of Rambaldi artifact she have be acquire artifact for several year now through her front her front do not look so surprised it have be happen right before your eye the Covenant see I know you could do it handsome Elena run the Covenant that be impossible we dismantle its operation no that be what she want you to believe you take down a straw man Elena 's agenda 's always be the same it be always be Rambaldi how do we stop she you be ask the wrong sister Irina spend the last few year of her life track Elena she be determined to stop our sister from enact she endgame and she would have do it too but you have to go and put a bullet in her head I be set up Elena put a hit out on Sydney frame Irina for it oh I see so you execute my sister on a misunderstanding oh then all be forgive do not stand there pretend you be a patsy you be too good at what you do if you pull the trigger part of you want to be manipulate I can help you find Elena but unfortunately I can not tell you how to stop she thank to you that hope die with Irina Sydney listen carefully Elena Derevko be in Prague her base of operation be a decommission chemical facility south of the industrial zone and Katya know that she just give you that location no Katya never just give anything but she tie Elena to the Covenant know she work out of Europe Marshall and Vaughn be able to pinpoint her exact location base on declassify KGB file and some thermal satellite imaging and you think we can trust her she be a Derevko I need you to get on a plane and rendezvous with Dixon and Nadia at Ruzyne airport the cargo terminal they have your op plan I be on my way my man think you be here to kill I you should hire smart man you walk in unarmed and surrender yourself you be not the most convincing of assassin so let I guess you be here to offer I a deal I know what you be try to do I can help thank god you be wise enough to see my value there be no one on this Earth who know more about Milo Rambaldi I would hear you reform I suppose I 've be bear again Perimeter security have be disable Phoenix and team be on the move copy Phoenix Director Chase have authorize shoot to kill Copy that okay now we have the facility on thermal satellite look like there be about 40 people inside the blueprint we acquire be accurate there be three main area to secure Understood Sydney be careful copy let us move the prisoner right come on yes of course I be bring she down transfer prisoner I be as surprised as you be drop your weapon no Marcus drop yours I say drop your weapon Sloane I get them pinpoint a location they be at the loading dock East side of the building Put your weapon on the ground I warn Sydney I warn all of you not to do this I mean it please Marcus it be too big now you can not stop this only I can you will have to trust I Trust you get out of here now Outrigger report Outrigger report Time to leave Dixon Evergreen to base we need an emergency medical extraction we have a man down Repeat we have a man down Dixon if anything change you call I do you have any idea she and Dixon no but then I tend to miss those kind of detail what be you talk about you be the master of detail really I 've go over the detail a thousand time in my mind each one add up to the same conclusion that your life be in danger and your mother be the lethal threat Dad we 've go over this you do not need I 've live my life trust in the veracity of detail and in do so I lose sight of the one thing I know to be true your mother would never hurt you she be ready to shut Elena down and I kill her she be our only hope that be not true we can stop they I know it you and I may disagree on a lot of thing but I never question your motive you always have my good interest at heart I know that How be Nadia feel I do not think she be feel much of anything right now how could you let Sydney and Nadia follow everything be proceed as plan you talk the talk but I be still not convinced you 've return to the fold we will see if you have what it take to finish the journey how be Dixon the same Sydney and Nadia be there now you ask I a question early that I do not get a chance to answer properly I would say the answer be loud and clear we be more alike than I care to admit agent Vaughn and I realize now that in disapprove of you I be only hate my own limitation I be not ask myself what would be good for Sydney if you honestly believe that you can make my daughter happy then by all mean you have my blessing to marry her okay then you always know my father would do this I hope he would not despite everything I really believe that he choose I you must think I be pretty foolish of course not he be your father Agent Bristow agent Santos he be ask for you Dixon we have be so worried about you before I see Sloane I see a prisoner shackle Syd it be your mother she be alive I be pleased to get your note this party look insufferable I would prefer not to spend the little time we have together with idle banter well then what do you suggest a dance you break my heart Irina that be another lifetime I will not do it again good to know this have be lovely but I should go back tell I Irina how do it feel give the order be it difficult or be you able to remain cold indifferent be you amuse Jack this be cryptic even for you then let I be clear how do it feel to pay a man to kill your own daughter you be not suppose to find out you do not feel a thing do you how be that possible be Sydney and I nothing to you merely strategic alliance to be dispose of once we would outlive our usefulness after all we 've be through Irina I deserve an explanation why I need a reason because it have to be do Jack Damn you how be Dixon Stable have his story change no he still swear he see she but the amount of blood he lose he must be delusional I would have think you would place more trust in your partner it be impossible we 've see impossible before this be a distraction you do not know that Dad you kill she I kill a woman I believe to be your mother sound familiar you know double technology exist the Helix protocol Dad we be be set up Elena and Sloane be go and the only person capable of stop they be dangle right in front of we do not that seem a little convenient think about it this would not be the first time Elena manipulate Vaughn into search for his father look how that turn out no they want we to pursue this I understand your skepticism although your unwillingness to even entertain the idea suggest fear fear of what perhaps a false hope maybe it be easy for you to believe mom 's alive than to live with what you do maybe so but the fact remain as long as Sloane and Elena be out there we be pursue every lead we have work to do How be Dixon he be lose a lot of blood no sir we still do not know what their endgame be Vaughn come here and check this out uh hold on we may have just get something DCI tell I you just get something well you know the tape from the DSR break in I find some datum block that be still intact be that enough for a positive I d yeah that be enough for an I d up top we be identify one of Elena Derevko 's associate right now I will keep you update I just talk to Langley they be all over this yeah you have no idea I know we be in crisis mode but do you ask she it be not exactly the right time when be the right time what the night time Eric come on look it be not like you have a ring burn a hole in your you have the ring on you right now we get it he be former Covenant Lucien Nisard and he do not just head up the DSR break in once we have a name I run a series of trace on a cell network in Prague turn out Nisard make phone call from the same location at the same time Dixon say he see Irina of course track he that be go to take some time I need you to log in through Sloane 's computer check the blackwell index wait a minute the Blackwell index Sloane do not have that he give that over to Langley do not he how be you hold up I be try to stay focused by reopen the Bishop file he kill my mother supposedly if she be alive then the CIA obviously miss something Nadia research Martin Bishop it be it be not the most productive use of your time what do you mean you should talk to Jack okay um I hope you do not mind I ask Mr Bristow but when you help sloane steal this thing you do not realize he be go to switch side do you I mean you do not see it come no okay I be just curious because I do not think that W ow look at the people on this thing Lucien Nisard I want all alias address contact vice weaknesse no problem just give I a sec I need to speak with you give we a minute would you sure hey what be it my mother 's killer Martin Bishop what be it you have not tell I I be tired of lie Jack after what my father and Elena have do I want the truth Martin Bishop do not kill Irina I do I learn Irina have put a contct out on Sydney 's life I believe she be go to have she kill I have no other viable option I kill Martin Bishop because you tell I it be he yes I learn later that I have be set up by Elena perhaps I be too quick to assume Irina have betray I and Sydney again do Sydney know this be not the time for recrimination your mother may be alive I hope she be and you should too Syd something 's happen what be go on there be be some sort of accident we do not know the detail Russia be not say but look at the satellite footage the city Sevogda they be coordinate some sort of military perimeter around it be it a quarantine no idea I just speak to director Chase Intelligence on this incident be nonexistent not even our agent within the Kremlin have any inkling as to what be happen what be it it be from a hacker friend of mine in Moscow it be raw footage you guy should see this it be they the russian government 's officially claim an industrial accident and they expect that story to last well conspiracy theory have already be post on the web terrorist attack military experiment go wrong do not forget alien I mean there be lot and lot of speculation about extraterrestrial give what we know have you be able to put anything together you mean Sloane and Elena 's endgame it be unclear but what be obvious be they 've activate some sort of ginormous Mueller device from the footage I would say it be at least six block in diameter now the russian government they be keep a tight lid on what be actually happen but from what be leak out I would say the citizen of Sevogda they be go postal I mean you know mass violence aggression inability to reason they must have infect the water supply with the chemical property of the orchid prime the population of the city make they susceptible to the effect of the Mueller device so what you be say be a large red ball plus contaminate water equal a city full of homicidal maniac that be a sentence I never think I would say but what be the point I mean besides the weird terrorist attack of all time their purpose remain a mystery perhaps Sevogda serve some strategic importance I would go with world domination but that be always my go to why be not important stop they be you 've destroy a Mueller device before guy sorry to interrupt here but you know this thing be beyond toxic I mean and one this size unless it be shut down properly it would be like drain primary coolant from a nuclear plant time 10 million I do not know how to disarm the device safely anyway I know someone who might base on the eyewitness account from agent Dixon Irina Derevko be currently be hold prisoner by her sister any idea on how to find her Lucien Nisard former Covenant member and a own associate of Elena 's Flight record indicate he fly to Ibiza this morning the sordid detail in these file should make it easy to isolate he get he to talk do whatever it take wheel up in two hour the usual not with what I will be wear I have this feeling before a sense I almost feel like I be go to pass out I do not know how to describe it but it be just like dread like something horrible be happen we 've be task to rescue a woman who kill my father your mother who be suppose to be dead by the way and to disable a giant red ball float over a russian city crazy thing have happen that be kinda my point Syd without you I would be lose I mean this world this job everything it would make I insane I know we be go to get through this how can you be sure how can I not be we be still here Syd what hey sorry to interrupt you ready to roll yeah all right thank Vaughn we should go Nadia my dad tell I he speak to you I be only try to protect you and he yes and he I should have tell you I be sorry it be not important now you may not believe our mother 's alive but I do please find she get he where at the bar that be he how you want to play this you want to be rough or you want I to be rough you be always rough no I be not yes you be that be not true yes it

transmission it be encrypt Standard give I a sec what do you know about Irina Derevko who you would be surprised what I know about you besides what turn you on I know who you 've betray if you do not tell I what you know you have not be watch the news have you bad timing sweetheart it be the end of the world or have not you hear Blackmail be not as effective as it once be number number number some past girlfriend let us see here wait a minute no Elena no sloane stop there Sydney there be a mention of Helix in his file tell I what you know about the Helix protocol if you know so much about I you know this be not so much a threat as it be a treat it be too late you can not stop this okay okay please the Helix protocol Elena she find it do she use it be Irina double okay okay Elena want people to believe Irina be dead a follower a follower agree to do it someone volunteer to be murder you have no idea how willing we be to do what be necessary for what be about to come be Irina Derevko alive of course she be Sydney and Vaughn learn that Irina be move yesterday from Prague she be take to a remote location in Guatemala be she okay we do not know while Vaughn secure Lucien Nisard for extradition and transport you and I be meet Sydney in country you do not seem relieve Transport 's wait here be a satellite layout of the camp where your mother 's be hold the river will take you within 100 yard of the perimeter how exactly will we find she see these cold spot they be all carry automatic weapon except for this one Mom it appear she be be hold in the north east quadrant of the camp once you retrieve she I will be wait two klick down river it be okay to be nervous it be just not about meet Irina it be just this feel Dread Darkness yeah how do you know I 've be feel it too I never believe in prophecy you know fate but now I be not so sure Nadia be this your gear pack that be some of Irina 's clothe from CIA storage I think she might need they I want to be the one to tell she who I be of course I will see you both at the exfil point be careful this be Phoenix we 've reach the perimeter copy that proceed Phoenix incoming guard all clear proceed copy that we be move in up ahead 20 yard there should be a small clearing to your left no movement from the guard you be clear she be 15 foot straight in front of you over here this should be it she be not here Phoenix you be stand right next to her there be nobody here this this can not be it Shh okay Mom Mom Mom I be here S Syd you be go to be okay Sydney I know you would come trip wire give I your knife I can not reach it here take mine I will hold they off they be right behind we Dad Irina Mom Elena 's already begin Sloane be with her sloane of course the only person as drive as she be though her cruelty run deeply I be sorry we do not find you soon mom we do not know what do she do to you I find a Rambaldi manuscript one I know Elena be look for it be call il diluvio the flood Rambaldi imagine a moment when the world would be cleanse when everything would begin anew an apocalypse when I see what be in the manuscript I have to destroy it of course which be why Elena need you she keep I in darkness I do not know where or how long I have barely enough food water there come a time I do not know whether I be alive or dead she would release I only for question Elena be always volatile quick temper I expect she to get angry and kill I but she have learn patience eventually I be move to a medical facility and inject with something the pain be excruciate I would go into cardiac arrest she would simply stabilize my heartbeat and allow I to rest so I could endure more and she do this dozen and dozen of time I could not fight it I tell she everything Mom mom Sydney I wish I could spare you from what be about to come but I need you to come with I I be with you we must go to Sevogda Irina they 've activate the Mueller device the effect be already evident it be too late for that city Elena 's already there so be sloane if we do not stop they now they will move on to another city and another we will send a team I help Elena build the device I can figure out how to destroy it there be no alternative all right I will tell the pilot to change course be there anywhere I can clean up in the back here I bring you these thank you just some clothe oh sweetheart Mom give I an update NRO just send over the satellite image from Sevogda there be heavy cloud cover they could not see much have Langley get anything from inside yeah DSR have a field team in the city what have they find we make contact but their transmission be interrupt Langley 's try to reestablish a connection but so far they be not respond let I know if I can help oh you can where be Jack he be not here he be act director on this task force and right now we be in the middle of a crisis where be he he be head up a tactical rescue mission in Guatemala a tactical mission to rescue whom Irina Derevko we can expect the military perimeter to be heavily guard Entry to Sevogda will be at well difficult do you have any idea what to expect once we be in there be this where the device have be activate yes Elena and Sloane need to hole up somewhere safe away from the hazard of the Mueller device Bristow perhaps a bunker a warehouse need to be a fortified location yes Dad it be our pilot our plane be be divert official order from Langley she be work with we she be not a threat Irina Derevko be a fugitive you get a problem you can take it to Langley I will see you take my mother into custody be a mistake Irina Derevko be an enemy of the state my mother help Elena engineer the device she can disarm it she be convict of espionage of murder CIA operative do I need to go on we do not have time to debate her record if this be any other situation I would say fine interrogate her vet her intel but people be die and it be only go to get bad it be under control the matter be be handle really how by whom the russians be preppe a tactical air strike of Sevogda it will be over in a few hour an air strike director Chase will release toxin into the atmosphere the result would be catastrophic this be what Elena want she anticipate how the government would respond we need to stall the russians let we go in there and shut down the device I will not trust Irina Derevko when you bring I into a p o and place I under Arvin Sloane 's supervision you ask I to trust you and I do my mind be make up agent Bristow you put sloane in charge you give sloane full access to the resource of the CIA and now he be go to do more harm than you can even imagine we need to find he and end this and the only person who can do that be my mother please director Chase this time you will have to trust I come with I you can accompany we to Sevogda on the condition that if when we capture Sloane and Elena and deactivate the Mueller device you will be return to CIA custody to serve out your sentence Life in prison yes how be your jaw I 've be through bad Jack I understand why you believe you have to kill I but the truth be if the situation have be reverse I would have find another way I can not imagine this will give you any comfort consider what you 've be through but the truth be there be not a day that go by that I do not regret what I do and about my indiscretion with Sloane I can hope you will accept my apology of all the thing you 've do that be what you be go to apologize for you be go to enjoy get to know Nadia she be exceptional I wonder where she get that from let I help you I 've see you all my life in my mind when this be over maybe we could spend some time I would like that yes the russians be move up their timetable I 've try every channel but they be resolve how long do we have uh about four hour we have four hour before a tactical strike level the city Syd come here I have it all plan out what I be go to take youto the beach Santa Barbara we would go out for a walk maybe when the sun be set but now we be here and I do not know what we be jump into and I may never get another chance to do this again sometimes I wake up before you do and I watch you sleep and I be overwhelmed because you be so amazing and I do not know why I be lucky enough to have you in my life but you be here with I and I know I want to spend the rest of my life with you try to make you as happy as you make I my god Vaughn Sydney Bristow will you marry I we be go to make it out of here be that a yes ask I on the beach we have 60 second DSR team be suppose to be here Contact a p o we 've get Mr Bristow on sit comm Jack what be your situation we be at the rendezvous point still wait on the DSR team we will give they five more minute then move on have we make any progress with the russians no director Chase be in Washington they 've organize a coalition to pressure the russians to call off the air strike but so far no luck they do understand that destroy the device with conventional explosive will cause enough toxic fallout to make Chernobyl look like a kitchen fire yeah their official position be they be not buy it which give you about two hour to deactivate the device Dad we get a signal from the DSR team 's transponder they be a block and a half away we will be in touch the russians rely on the Milsat satellite network to vector the bomb right if I can hack into it I can shut it down and violate several thousand international law we be talk about the end of the world I be not worried about a tribunal that be a good point go go go go it be operational have you notify our cell we be on schedule Good it will not be long before you see she again I know Nadia she be go to make we proud the signal 's come from right here we should keep move show yourself Brodien Bristow oh for god 's sake what be you I think you be relieve of duty well do not believe everything you hear what happen here uh let us just say those tranqs they be not go to do you any good not on the infected they be like rabid dog they travel in pack it only take one night to wipe out my entire team you be the last one alive yeah that be right I do not know how many be out there hundred could be thousand what about the rest where be they dead if we be lucky when there be no one leave to kill they turn on each other the municipal water supply be taint and the device be broadcast a subaudible frequency off any spectrum anyone within the radius of the signal who drink the water have be physiologically alter be we go to just shoot they yes I mean it be either they or we they be already go anyway we be put they out of their misery there be no cure once you be infect there be no reverse the symptom what have you learn about the device uh good we can tell the epicenter be uh 4 mile northwest over the Oransky building right here in that case the control center for the device should be locate on the rooftop I 've take out the city 's power grid the device keep run Irina know how to bring it down safely Irina Irina Derevko the device have be modify to run off an internal energy source we need to get to the roof of that building okay uh right but we can not drive all the road be close off with gridlock we can get through town through the subway tunnel it be a straight shot to the Oransky building there should be an emergency battery system to power up the car those tunnel be pitch black there be only one way in or out I be not say I be look forward to it all right let us go they be here Less than two hour before the russians launch their strike nothing can stop we Regardless we should eliminate all possibility I will lead the assault team Nadia what about Nadia bring she back give she the option to join we I be go to let us go Damn it it be too secure I can not get in from the outside unless we have a valid access code this be not go to work so get an access code only russian military official have access code to those hence the word access we 've manage hard come on there be get to be a way what would Jack do in this situation Jack be the king of this sort of thing well first he would probably glower a bit right and then he would probably blackmail or torture somebody right you be a genius you Eric Weiss be a genius I think Sloane turn the Blackwell Index over to Langley he do not it be complicated not really sloane 's evil why would not he hold

detect a signal come out of the city we believe Elena be try to uplink to the Milsat network do we know why I decode the signal it be a subaudible frequency below the range of human hearing the same frequency be use by the Mueller device she be use the russian satellite network to distribute that frequency worldwide if she succeed the effect we be see will occur globally everywhere the water be be prime that be her endgame I know we tell you there be two hour before the air strike but the instant the russians scramble those bomber the satellite network it be go to go online the minute that happen that signal it be go to be broadcast she be super tricky counting on the russian air strike all along it be what she want how much time do we have 40 minute give or take we need to get to the

rest of the shipment we think that Curtis already have the other canister our option here be limit Syd but we think if we let he go there be a really good chance that he will lead we to the rest of the nuridium you wanna let he go we will make he believe he be escape no we can not risk lose he the risk will be minimal we just need more time to break he we do not have more time with that much nuridium we may be look at Hiroshima times 50 we be talk about release the man who kill Vaughn Water thank you we know about the nuridium I see possession of nuridium be consider an act of terrorism base on which we can lock you away indefinitely no formal charge no trial but right now that do neither of we any good tell we where the rest of the nuridium be what you intend to do with it and we will cut you a deal I want immunity for everything the nuridium and kill Michael Vaughn you would do it would not you you would have to well I will save you the trouble no deal I be not talk sorry

indicate their final destination be Pyongyang the flight be grant diplomatic immunity diplomatic immunity how be that possible we be still explore that we can not just let these guy fly to North Korea there be get to be something we can do maybe there be we be just about there what be their current position do we have an e t A for rendezvous okay the docking point be 2 mile out final approach for

panel okay you need to access that panel can you get to it can you open it let I see just give I a sec Three Tango on my go three two one go go go go oh you know what there should be a detonator attach to the regulator do you see that okay I do not see it well it have to be there because without a detonator there be no detonation that be how it work Fine I be just tell you it be not here well Syd it have to be there okay because there be no bomb without a detonator Marshall I do not think it be a bomb I do not believe you have a boarding pass go ahead shoot I but if you do there be a damn good chance my hand will slip and I will cut this connection whoever this guy be he be obviously pretty important to you it would be a shame if something happen to he step away from the container I do not think so Dixon cover I you have no idea what you 've get yourself into I will ask you once and if you do not answer I I will cut this who be Dean work with who give the order to kill Michael Vaughn even if I tell you you would not believe I humor I go in the cockpit I get he take he get it what be you wait for turn around on your knee I be take you in then you might as well kill I I will not survive the night in custody if you be willing to cooperate we can protect you no you have no idea these people who our initial assumption be wrong the nuridium be not be utilize as an explosive we believe it be use to power a cryogenic chamber you mean freeze people cryogenics Sort of it be usually do with liquid nitrogen but this be like next gen cryopreservation I mean whoever this person be or be they probably die of a terminal illness and they be use this container to preserve the corpse until a treatment be find of course the notion that anyone can ever actually be revive complete fiction believe I I 've try have we I d ' ed the body not yet the container be currently in D S r Custody they will forward we the forensic analysis as soon as it be complete an evidence team scour the plane for anything that might be of value but I be not expect anything to come of it for now we 've do everything we can we will just have to wait for the report Sydney we lose our only lead on Gordon Dean I be not sure if I can do this dad we will get another lead it be not that it be everything it be it be hard be without he I see the baby 's heartbeat for the first time the other day I be

for the hack thank you for call for the purpose of train this call may be monitor my name be Roger how may I help you hi Roger I would like to cancel a subscription please certainly can I have the name on the account Michael Vaughn v a u g h N get it I see it right here may I ask why you be cancel the subscription Mr Vaughn die I be sorry I will take care of it right away yeah okay when your wife tell you it be a waste of time to have a pen pal she be wrong 'cause two day ago there be a theft in an r d facility in Istanbul the Turks have do a pretty good job of keep it under wrap but my friend Ali forward I this now take a look right there you see that those vial right there that be a nerve agent call Substance 33 it be develop by the Russians during the Cold War remarkable stuff you know in an end of civilization sort of way what make you think they work with Dean well they do not as far as we can tell they be independent Gordon Dean he be a former c I a disappear two year ago infiltrate this office compromise one of your man I be up to speed thank sorry new guy I just assume that maybe anyway this woman right here that be who I think work for Dean you think base on what your pen pal who Ali no see this woman have help a hacker who remotely access the security system use the same computer as a hack on the N S A a few month back which we know be order by Dean so 2 hour ago I trace this computer to Prague within these 5 square mile but you see if I can go to Prague I can narrow it down to like 2 foot and then we can grab this hacker and get he to tell we where the Substance 33 be but if we do that we lose Dean once he realize his hacker be miss he will disappear as well right okay I want you both to accompany Marshall to Prague follow the signal Locate Dean 's operation there but do not do anything to reveal yourself or to engage his man once you 've do that we will reassess our option should not Dixon be go with I I 've task Dixon to another assignment Marshall will brief you on your op tech let I know when you be ready to leave Dad you be make a mistake Sydney I understand you would be more comfortable take Dixon with you but that be inappropriate this be not the time to break in a new agent Agent Grace have extensive field experience and I have a history with Dixon what be so important dad that he can not come with I on this mission your sister what about my sister you know that Sloane have be search for a cure for Nadia he may have find one Conditional release of Arvin Sloane Sloane cultivate a lead who will only meet with he face to face in Russia I be able to convince the Attorney General to let he out of prison for 72 hour I be send Dixon as a security detail when be I go to find out about this I do not want to raise your hope until we know what Sloane have well in that case I would prefer to go with Marshall by myself Sydney it be not that complicate a mission in fact it be very complicated recover the nerve agent without tip Dean what be not you tell I I read his file Agent Grace 's you have no authority to do that in the last 3 year he have turn downhalf a dozen team assignment instead take long cover operation by himself he be a loner he be a superior agent and he be agree to be on this team which be good enough for I Sorry do not mean to it be just that you say to let you know when we be ready to go yeah translation anyone Inermis Sixe Guilamu Transcript Raceman Synchro Guilamu Suggestions critic insult aliassub gmail com www forom com tell I about your contact Alexander Dolzhenko Dolzhenko be an undersecretary in the Politburo I have be work with he for the past decade Trustworthy Reliable why be he insist on meet with you in person for his protection after the Sovogda incident we believe that the Russians kill all the infected but accord to Dolzhenko they 've keep some of they alive and they be pursue treatment of course the Russians deny that Sovogda ever occur so by pass the cure to I Dolzhenko be risk his life suppose Dolzhenko have be find out by the authority this could be his way of cut a deal and you be suggest that I might be walk into a trap no no about the Sovogda incident the Russians have no idea that I be responsible then why have he agree to meet with you at all 300 000 my job be to make sure in three day ' time you return to this cell I intend to do exactly that when we be in the field you will follow my instruction explicitly no question it be my show Great sure you be read that right yeah seem like an unlikely place to hide an operation it be definitely he I mean the signal I be get be weak but clean and the hacker 's right inside that building Wi fi hot spot yeah must be use a laptop off site know what that be okay I get an idea okay okay get it here be what we do Pack of mint right microprocessor on the bottom of the case it be a relay get it within 5 foot of the hacker 's computer it should allow I to clone the hard drive might even tell we where the nerve agent be even well offer he a mint inside each one be a tracking device do not worry he will not die or anything if he swallow it just get a little sick a little nausea if Gordon Dean have an operation here chance be the hacker will lead we right to it get it what be that that be Czech I will fake it it be all sort of germanish right go for it okay who be I look for a far window back to the wall Baseball cap on backwards get it you be american Great Syd that be perfect I be start the clone now Nice hold on a second wait a minute what be it well I be not the only one access this computer Syd do your guy have two laptop network together no no Syd listen we have a problem someone beside I be piggyback off this computer they be try to steal the bandwidth which mean the hacker do not have a laptop at all maybe a pda or a cell phone Great the signal just go dead I get her Blond hair brown jacket she just leave she be come your way there she be you be go to want a seat belt what be you do follow her watch out sorry she make we hold on hi there hey do you get anything from her cell phone no the simm card be completely shatter she say the phone break when you hit her car well more likely it be a countermeasure she smash it when she realize you be chase she and if her people realize she be go if there be some protocol to check in that she miss they will disappear as well maybe under the circumstance you would have do something different okay you talk to your father right Syd I mean what be he want we to do I be go to talk to she again see if I can get she to give up Substance 33 while there be still time can you rig a voice stress analyz yeah sure just give I ten minute Dolzhenko be typically a few minute late half an hour be more than a few

gothic influence well that be fascinating it be what be you do get off let go of I now do not let go what be this whoever you people be you be make a big mistake can I see that pretty soon there will be a ton of U S agent swarm this place look for I U S agent that be right it be an e l T Emergency Location Transmitter she be try to send a distress signal do we need to worry well look like it be still intact the signal do not go out you be scared you should be no one be come to rescue you I be an operative for the U S Government so unless you want to start a war with the c I A I would suggest here be your next problem Rachel we be c I a well then this must be some big misunderstanding if you be c I A we be on the same side call Langley verify her story all right you can not we be off book Black op Langley will not verify we that be convenient well that be the truth I 've have enough Syd the stress analysis indicate she be tell the truth that may be but the more likely scenario be that she be practice a form of self hypnosis to convince herself that what she be say be true I triple check my reading and filter they against every known method of dupe she believe what she be say what Marshall you and my father say the same thing that Rachel believe what she be say she believe she work for the c I a yeah I think so that be right I need to talk to her I want to tell you a story just stop I if I get something wrong you be approach in college someplace public in the quad or walk to class a man ask you if you want to serve your country when he tell you it be for the c I A you just you could not believe it but you take the test and they be easy for you it make you feel good about yourself you probably start work at a false front some phantom company that have you do entry level analysis maybe you wonder why you be never send to Langley maybe you wonder why you be not be train with other recruit then you got promote you meet the director of your division Gordon Dean he offer you a position on his team Dean take you under his wing he convince you that you be so important you just have to be out there help he save the world how be I do you read my file no I do not 13 year ago the same thing happen to I only I have be lie to what I be tell be the c I A be in reality a criminal organization I think you 've be tell the same lie I know you do not believe I Rachel you think this be another interrogation tactic it be not I think I can prove it you can prove it that I work for a criminal organization your transmitter where do the signal get receive c I a headquarters Langley you be sure of that I design it myself I would like you to build a trace program one that piggyback onto the signal your watch send out if I be right it will not go to Langley okay it be ready let us do it okay I be go to send out a test signal whoever receive this will just assume you be check the system okay here we go and test Yep go to Langley wait a minute no it be not that ping be just a ghost signal it be mean to throw we off it be not go to Langley at all where have it go Prague Vlasska street what be on Vlasska street our office it be temporary so that Dean can oversee the transfer of Substance 33 wait Gordon Dean be in Prague yeah he be right around the corner how be she do about how you would expect she be tell Substance 33 be develop by a terrorist cell and be be transfer to U N weapon inspector most likely it be be sell to the high bidder do she know when the exchange be to be make tonight but she do not know where she say it be all classify and all classify intel be store on Dean 's own dedicated server what else how much do she know about his operation Dean call it the Shed she be recruit two year ago computer specialist she be willing to give we everything mission history supplier contact the work without more background it be too risky to move on Dean he could destroy his datum before we have time to secure it Marshall can we access that server well accord to Rachel Dean use an encryption key that change daily but if I could get inside I could crack the key maybe download the entire hard drive obviously that be too dangerous what about the girl she be not a field agent and her whole world be come apart right now I do not see another option we have to recover Substance 33 before it trade hand what be it we need some help all you have to do be copy the encryption key and then bring it back to I okay should not take I more than a couple minute to crack the code then go back inside all right you think maybe you can open a remote access port to Dean 's server yeah from my workstation Dean 's server have about a terabyte of datum that be go to take you what an hour at 20 gig a minute do not worry I can hop r A m while the data 's be transfer unless they know where to look it can not be detect the encryption key be pretty massive I do not think I have anything big enough to copy it to that be okay get a little present for you okay just a little something I pick up look like a normal credit card right but you look closely actually hold 240 gig of memory it be a work credit card just do not go shop with it because it be already at its limit my wife crazy with the clothe Mitchell it be clever yeah I wanna tell you that I 've be admire you too not you know anything kind of creepy weird just totally

facility 's network yeah to find out where the Desantis file be store well if we be go in via R F then the network must be terminal no close loop oh find it I hope none of you suffer from arachnophobia 'cause this little 6 legged freak be not pretty but she get the job do I call she Charlotte for obvious reason oh check this out there be a tomographic camera right on the bottom there it basically act like an x ray or a c A T scan it take image layer by layer see look at that this will allow we to take image of the Desantis file without ever have to remove they from their storage container right I assume your vault be climate control of course now if your purchase our premium package your item will be store in the most secure wing of our facility yes I 've hear that before let

present obsession he call it lasso technology d o d be be worried about this it be a software program that would allow an incoming missile to be electronically intercept and redirect right basically you could lasso a missile that be head for a military target say in the Middle East and then redirect it to Switzerland you know and then the swiss call and they be like hey we be neutral remember thank you Marshall I think we all understand right that be just a hypothetical base on Ms Gibson 's statement Gordon Dean have be try to locate Vak for the past six month Arvin have suggest and I agree that if we can find Vak first we can then use he as bait to catch Gordon Dean in the past he have be know to frequently partner with an algerian arm broker evidently they have a meeting a few month ago nobody have hear from Vak since the algerian underworld be particularly difficult to penetrate I think I know someone who can do it Renée Rienne yeah make contact with her see if she can get

medically induce coma for five month now none of our procedure have show any promise when we bring she out she display the same violent propensity now these treatment be extremely costly Expense be not an issue we 've simply run out of option at this point anything that we may try be unlikely to inspire change it may even do more harm than good I be not prepared to give up neither be we in the meantime I think you should consider alternative care in a place a little more comfortable okay thank you Doctor yes how be she do today I feel for you I can not imagine how hard it must be look into the face of your own sin what do you want Dean Sydney Bristow have take something of mine an access card I want you to get it back why what be it for that be none of your concern 48 hour do not let I down be you sure this be the right move the right move if they find out what you be up to they will not besides I do not think I have the choice at this point you be be paranoid again you be too important to this operation to be dismiss over a few setback well maybe you be right but some life insurance will help I sleep well at night you too I imagine odd be if they terminate I they will

tell I Translation Anyone Sixe Guilamu Transcript Raceman Synchro Guilamu Suggestions critic insult aliassub gmail com www forom com Marshall run analysis on the card you retrieve he suspect it be an access key for a secure network so we just have to figure out which network luckily there be only 10 billion secure network in the world we may have a dead end on that side but we intercept Dean 's property I be guess he be not too happy about that so I will take what I can get Delivery for Sydney Bristow hey come on in just put it in the nursery it be right through there Thanks Crib you know the uh the nursery could use a little work I do not know I think it be kind of airy I will grab my bag we can head in to work I think you be take the day off I be that be before we have ten billion secure network to analyze I have a well idea First let us set up the crib and then at least that way we will know we get something accomplish today it be okay I will do it later what could it take half an hour I use to think that stuff would be so fun decorate a room and pick out color it have not turn out exactly the way I think it would yeah I be first contact a month ago it be during my sentencing hearing as I tell your father the term be simple they offer to sway the committee 's decision for my release and I in turn would be indebted to they it be not make clear what that would entail but I have an idea you 've be lie to we this whole time there be no justification however face with spend the rest of my life in prison while my daughter be in the hospital I Nadia have not make any improvement why admit this to we now what be change Nadia will not be get well Jack if I have to face a life without my daughter I still have to live with myself it sound hollow I know in light of what I just tell you but I consider you both to be my family you expect we to forgive you now no Sydney not at all I know how much pain Dean have cause you as well as Rachel Gibson I have damage your investigation enough Ironically Dean 's arrangement put I in a unique position the last thing he expect of I be to double cross he you will help we arrest he yes he be task I with recover something you take from he an access card I can use that as bait understand something if this be a setup it be not Sydney I assure you once we have Dean in custody he will be force to expose his organization and you will have all the answer you be look for you have a way to contact Dean hello it be I I have what you want Good I know I could count on you where should we meet get a pen write this down the meeting place be a racetrack Dean may trust Sloane but he be still be cautious he pick this location because it be safe several exit strategy a large crowd to blend in with that or maybe he be get Lollipop in the second we will have to grab he before he have the chance to slip out that will not be easy Dean do not go anywhere without a security detail it will most likely be two man heavily armed nearly invisible we can assume that one will shadow Dean the other Sloane um sorry be anybody else have déja vu here I mean first Sloane be good then he be bad now he be good again although I guess he be bad at first I just think we have a significant tactical disadvantage Dean know what we look like he can I d every one of we not everyone he be never see I but I look forward to make his acquaintance Good Tom you will take lead Dixon Sydney Rachel you will provide support in the field I want a plan draft within the hour wheel up at 1500 we may not have another chance like this let us make it count Dean 's reserve you a seat in the grandstand he will not arrive until he be confirm you be alone if we put a transmitter on you his security countermeasure may detect it so I will be track you remotely you will need this it be a facsimile I assume no it be the real card Dean may verify it with a reader we will move in as soon as we 've intercept his man but until then you will have to stall okay I hack into the closed circuit feed we be ready to go okay you be up look Sydney I may have lose the opportunity to save my own child I only hope that by take out Dean I will have help to save yours good luck okay Dixon and Tom be in position no sign of Dean yet he will not reveal himself until Sloane be in place excuse I Mama comin ' through watch out do not jostle the

proceed with the meet copy that you search crowd someone you know yes I do lovely day yes it be Outrigger if Dean 's follow his standard protocol that second detail should not be any more than 50 foot

Dean what be he do eat dirt I just hit he with a shovel a shovel be he conscious yeah I think so then hit he again we get Dean that be good what happen now he tell we everything and we get the truth about Prophet Five you seem very pleased with yourself I will keep this simple we have a few question for you we want to know who you be work for and what their agenda be the only other question be whether you will cooperate willingly or unwillingly the ironic thing be Ms Bristow you and I may not share the same agenda but we have the same goal I want to know who I be work for as much as you do unfortunately for both of we you rob I of that opportunity the access card you be make a power play the people I answer to their power stem from remain anonymous I be hope to balance the playing field all the information you want can be access off a communication hub use that card but before I tell you the location you have to agree to do something for I and what be that I want 10 million as well as document to authenticate half a dozen false identity and dental implant capable of fool facial recognition software in short you be go to make I disappear not a chance I would not be so hasty that access card will expire in just under 12 hour at which point the information will vanish and I can no long help you so I suggest you talk to the people you answer to and share with they my offer I do not need to I do not think it be go to take that long what be it L S D well sort of see I start with a lysergic acid diethylamide base serum and you know flinkmanize it of course he be not go to see any dancing bear on this trip I promise you that not that I mean I hear about it from a guy once I 've never hey Mr Bristow how long until we can interrogate Dean not long in about an hour he will think you be God he will tell you anything you wanna know of course if you would like I could facilitate the process let us do that I see you 've do this before Peaceful hmm yeah it be I imagine you be have quite a difficult day be I right excuse I do I know you Nope you do not know I Mr Sloane but I do have one small favor to ask of you my associate and I be aware of your adventure in Dubai we also know that Gordon Dean be still in custody presumably at a p o we need you to eliminate he eliminate he yes and we have every confidence that you will be able to overcome any obstacle that stand in your way I see you can go to hell I 've already confess my bargain with Mr Dean you people no long have any power over I that may be but we do still have plenty to offer I doubt there be anything that you could do for I uh you should answer that yeah my God what do you do nothing it just happen the nurse come through on round 15 minute ago and find she awake Dad I be right here sweetheart I be

remainder of the intel I though I would prefer to keep you close by I know that be not an option give her intimate knowledge of Prophet 5 and her association with Vaughn you should meet with Renée

location not quite but I think Vaughn share it with Sydney Bristow and I meet this afternoon to discuss the protocol for her sd 6 countermission I brief agent Bristow on the full scope of their operation how far it reach go back I brief agent Bristow on the full scope of their operation how far it reach she know where it be and you be certain agent Vaughn communicate this intelligence to her

you the contact protocol for Dr Gonzalo Burris he be go to ask for a lot of money tell he you will pay half have he wait for I at the Athena facility then you be suggest that we abduct Sydney Bristow

okay now go how have it go not well do not worry he be with we Eric Weiss Rachel Gibson thank you for the help back there oh my pleasure any luck with Sydney 's message they wipe the backup we may be able to run data recovery on this but if they go to all the trouble of delete the message I do not think they would be careless enough to leave any trace behind well get a move on take this tunnel to the end it lead at the southeast edge of the complex I have to go back inside to delete the surveillance footage oh if you hear anything about Sydney we will okay and one more thing next time just call care to tell I exactly where we be go this ship have lifeboat we be take one good idea you will be spot the minute you step on the deck not if you order your man to search the low deck do it get in there go make a sound and you be dead something 's wrong be not it move whatever you say but you do not look so good stop stop come on what be this why be this here you have until three to start give I some answer one two oh no no no no you must not move what be you do to I just be still the doctor be on the way what doctor just tell I what be wrong be something wrong with my baby I need to tell they you be awake you should be still wait please do not go I will come back soon wait you can crack into this hard drive and find Sydney 's transmission uh crack Langley 's encryption will not be a problem I write a program that can handle anything under 512 bit encode I can not seem to recover Sydney 's transmission whoever wipe it use a secure deletion program basically it rewrite random junk over it hundred of time yeah but the original datum 's still there so it should be retrievable right well yeah if I have an electron microscope and two week maybe I think we find something in the hard copy of the server log check line 522 look like an authorization tag that be what I think well this tag have an A b prefix but that mean whoever authorize the deletion of Sydney 's transmission have Alpha Black clearance what be alpha black clearance Alpha Black be the high clearance level within the c I A if Prophet five have tie to the C I a 's upper echelon that would give they unlimited access to all classify operation undercover agent roster our entire infrastructure the good news be that if whoever delete Sydney 's message have Alpha Black clearance well that narrow our list of suspect down to just a handful of guy only seven people in the entire agency have it all of they division director aside from that the only other thing that these guy have in common they be all assign a modify version of the standard S T u a secure cell phone what be you think well each cell phone broadcast a unique device I d now it take some digging but I be able to match the Alpha Black authorization code from the server log to the cell phone I D of the person in question so do that mean we know who it belong to not exactly I mean for security purpose Langley do not put name to number but if you can get within just 50 foot of that person 's cell phone I might be able to scan it and see if it match we would have our guy we could divide into team put all 7 of they under surveillance that could take day whatever Prophet Five have plan for Sydney we can assume we do not have much time I have an idea Gentlemen Jack it be be a long time how 's life underground treat you good always full of surprise I can imagine can not say I miss it Scanner 's hot Jack we 've get connection here so Jack you care to enlighten we as to why you call an operation meeting at 8 00 on a Friday I do not call you all here for an operation meeting give that all of you have Alpha black clearance most of you may already be aware that a p o have be investigate an organization know as Prophet five what may however come as news to you be we have reason to believe that someone within our own agency be in collusion with this organization someone with Alpha Black clearance what have we get so far Four down three to go still nothing the reason I 've gather you all here if it be not obvious by now only seven people in the entire agency have this level of clearance and all of they be sit in this room oh come on Jack this be absurd be you suggest that one of we be work for a terrorist organization that be exactly what I be suggest I get a match Jack we 've get a signal match one of you be work for Prophet Five and we have your number that be enough this meeting be over go Jack what in the hell be you do tell I where Sydney be do yourself a favor stand back I be go to give you one chance where be they hold my daughter what the hell I do not know what you be talk about wrong answer stop for god 's sake Jack I seal the door where she be you be crazy answer I the Athena cargo ship where be the ship the north Atlantic do you get that we get it Jack we be on it what be that something to make you relax but Marshall can you find the cargo ship where Sydney 's be hold there be mile and mile of ocean here it be like look for a needle in a haystack what if you patch into the radarsat overlay it on the optical feed right that be genius okay it look like multiple radar return no ignore those it be a commercial shipping route heavily patrol they would not run the risk of random inspection right there that one it be in international water a ship that size would not typically be that far out got it hello we have a hit Marshall 's upload the coordinate to your onboard G P S you be clear to go Understood all right let us move out what else besides abdominal pain Dizziness

there oh my pleasure any luck with Sydney 's message they wipe the backup we may be able to run data recovery on this but if they go to all the trouble of delete the message I do not think they would be careless enough to leave any trace behind well get a move on take this tunnel to the end it lead at the southeast edge of the complex I have to go back inside to delete the surveillance footage oh if you hear anything about Sydney we will okay and one more thing next time just call care to tell I exactly where we be go this ship have lifeboat we be take one good idea you will be spot the minute you step on the deck not if you order your man to search the low deck do it get in there go make a sound and you be dead something 's wrong be not it move whatever you say but you do not look so good stop stop come on what be this why be this here you have until three to start give I some answer one two oh no no no no you must not move what be you do to I just be still the doctor be on the way what doctor just tell I what be wrong be something wrong with my baby I need to tell they you be awake you should be still wait please do not go I will come back soon wait you can crack into this hard drive and find Sydney 's transmission uh crack Langley 's encryption will not be a problem I write a program that can handle anything under 512 bit encode I can not seem to recover Sydney 's transmission whoever wipe it use a secure deletion program basically it rewrite random junk over it hundred of time yeah but the original datum 's still there so it should be retrievable right well yeah if I have an electron microscope and two week maybe I think we find something in the hard copy of the server log check line 522 look like an authorization tag that be what I think well this tag have an A b prefix but that mean whoever authorize the deletion of Sydney 's transmission have Alpha Black clearance what be alpha black clearance Alpha Black be the high clearance level within the c I A if Prophet five have tie to the C I a 's upper echelon that would give they unlimited access to all classify operation undercover agent roster our entire infrastructure the good news be that if whoever delete Sydney 's message have Alpha Black clearance well that narrow our list of suspect down to just a handful of guy only seven people in the entire agency have it all of they division director aside from that the only other thing that these guy have in common they be all assign a modify version of the standard S T u a secure cell phone what be you think well each cell phone broadcast a unique device I d now it take some digging but I be able to match the Alpha Black authorization code from the server log to the cell phone I D of the person in question so do that mean we know who it belong to not exactly I mean for security purpose Langley do not put name to number but if you can get within just 50 foot of that person 's cell phone I might be able to scan it and see if it match we would have our guy we could divide into team put all 7 of they under surveillance that could take day whatever Prophet Five have plan for Sydney we can assume we do not have much time I have an idea Gentlemen Jack it be be a long time how 's life underground treat you good always full of surprise I can imagine can not say I miss it Scanner 's hot Jack we 've get connection here so Jack you care to enlighten we as to why you call an operation meeting at 8 00 on a Friday I do not call you all here for an operation meeting give that all of you have Alpha black clearance most of you may already be aware that a p o have be investigate an organization know as Prophet five what may however come as news to you be we have reason to believe that someone within our own agency be in collusion with this organization someone with Alpha Black clearance what have we get so far Four down three to go still nothing the reason I 've gather you all here if it be not obvious by now only seven people in the entire agency have this level of clearance and all of they be sit in this room oh come on Jack this be absurd be you suggest that one of we be work for a terrorist organization that be exactly what I be suggest I get a match Jack we 've get a signal match one of you be work for Prophet Five and we have your number that be enough this meeting be over go Jack what in the hell be you do tell I where Sydney be do yourself a favor stand back I be go to give you one chance where be they hold my daughter what the hell I do not know what you be talk about wrong answer stop for god 's sake Jack I seal the door where she be you be crazy answer I the Athena cargo ship where be the ship the north Atlantic do you get that we get it Jack we be on it what be that something to make you relax but Marshall can you find the cargo ship where Sydney 's be hold there be mile and mile of ocean here it be like look for a needle in a haystack what if you patch into the radarsat overlay it on the optical feed right that be genius okay it look like multiple radar return no ignore those it be a commercial shipping route heavily patrol they would not run the risk of random inspection right there that one it be in international water a ship that size would not typically be that far out got it hello we have a hit Marshall 's upload the coordinate to your onboard G P S you be clear to go Understood all right let us move out what else besides abdominal pain Dizziness her complexion be pale any trouble breathe yes hello Sydney you I understand you 've have some trouble do not

you hack the detonation frequency well I mean she mention deactivation code the bomb and the detonator be network I mean maybe I could build a device that would tap into the communication protocol

that you would suggest I would turn against a p o that I would kill my own daughter I realize now that both be inevitable that death be a necessary sacrifice necessary to complete the final leg of this journey I have be prepare for this my whole life I know it be come I have betray everyone I ever love but I be choose we appreciate what you 've do and this be my road to follow welcome back she be not here Repeat Anna be not in the car get out of my way I will not let you stop Nadia move I have betray everyone I ever love but I be choose and this be my road to follow welcome back today we should not focus on what we lose but what we gain by have Nadia in our life I not only gain a sister but a friend when I think of the year of loneliness she have no family to speak of not know where she truly belong I be so grateful for the warmth and affection she be surround by in the end she teach I the meaning of family that it go deep than blood that it start with friendship and it comfort I to know that although she be take far too soon what she leave I with will stay with I forever how could I have trust he again after everything you think he have change Nadia do not I convince she that he deserve a second chance I show he compassion I will not make that mistake again Sync by anyone Sixe Guilamu Transcript Raceman www forom com have he ask for anything no just a pitcher of water how be it come Page 47 have you decode it yet as I tell you before it be go to take time more time if these interruption continue it be be almost a week already Mr Sloane so when do you think we may see some result this be be not a crossword puzzle Ms Peyton the key to Rambaldi 's endgame be encode within that manuscript where it have remain hide for the past 500 year I hardly think that a week be unreasonable perhaps you would like to take a walk around the ground something to clear your mind allow you to focus and I be sure the armed gentleman post outside the door will not mind if I slip away for a bit of lunch you be not a prisoner if that be what you be ask but give your fugitive status you can understand our reservation about let you walk around in public yes of course I know you 've have to make some tough sacrifice we all have you think I be have a crisis of conscience because I kill Nadia let I be clear no one will stand between I and the fulfillment of Rambaldi 's ultimate vision no one and unless you and your superior know someone else who be familiar with 15th century cryptography I be sure you can wait a few more day of course if there be anything we can do to expedite your work you will let I know have you ever see anything like that before it be basically a solid state memory chip cut edge tech at least it be back in the ' 70 which I be guess be when this little guy be make what be it do inside Renee that be the million dollar question be not it basically there be several hundred kilobyte of datum on this thing Problem be it be all encode I would have think 30 year old encrypt algorithm would not present a problem well they would not if the code be complete but half the data 's missing probably corrupt over time without it I can not create a baseline for encryption analysis and you can not extrapolate the miss datum I be try to but I be not go to hold my breath what about these marking what be these it be probably nothing maybe just a serial number maybe or the name of the company that desi what be it hold on a sec I will put it up on the monitor we should tell Sydney I will do that in the meantime Marshall do whatever take to break that encryption I want to know what else be on this chip and I want to know what it be do inside Renee we just get a hit on one of the hard line Contact Peyton I be send it over now Isabelle will you please sleep Sweetie hey dad hey sweetheart be not this her nap time I wish apparently this little girl do not need sleep anymore we get a collective four hour last night it must be genetic you use to wake up at 4 00am every day like clockwork I be sorry about that do Marshall finish his analysis of the chip actually that be why I be here Marshall find datum on it all of it encrypt but he also find something else Vaughn 's name be etch on the outside of the device his real name André Michaux wait what Marshall believe the chip be place inside Renée almost 30 year ago Vaughn and Renée do not know each other 30 year ago no but their father do Vaughn tell you they be work together against Prophet Five and you be think what that one of they implant the chip inside Renee at this point it be the most likely presumption why why would they I do not know but someone leave Vaughn 's name on it intentionally expect it to be find it be possible he may have some understanding of what the chip contain Dad no as far as Prophet five be concern Vaughn be dead involve he at this point a calculate risk I know he be still in recovery he be not field ready I know I will do everything I can to protect he we will have an agent dead drop the chip to Vaughn he will never be see Dad Sydney we do not have a choice sloane 's decision to openly join Prophet Five suggest that they be close to their endgame right now this chip be our only lead but if someone be go to take that chip to Vaughn it be I Syd 's en route to Nepal to see someone who may be able to decipher the chip who be the contact someone who work with Renee that be all Jack tell I this contact Sydney 's meeting in Nepal do you have any idea who it be no I do not know of any asset in Nepal so I assume this mean that you be go to take action on this be you sure that be wise a p o will want to know how you obtain the intel which could prompt they to look into the security leak Whatever be on that chip I certainly hope it be worth the risk thank for the counsel we be send an agent to intercept the device we would like you to brief she before she leave Fine although I be not sure what further assistance I can provide I think you would be surprise send she in please you remember Anna Espinosa you busy just try to catch up on the late tech what be go on when be the last time you go to a movie the last movie I use to go to movie all the time and I have not be in so long because there be always something more important to do this be not about go to the movie be it when you be work at the Shed do you ever see an agent bury it take a while to get over it what if I can not what if I be not cut out for this First it be Gordon Dean and now it be sloane they be right in front of I the whole time deceive I and I be oblivious you be a good agent Rachel listen I would tell you if I do not think you could handle this I would like to place a classified ad in next week 's edition a child yes that be right Sydney have a daughter what be her name Isabelle I suppose Vaughn be the father or be the father I should say yes that be right in this business it be always the child who suffer Arvin it trouble you do not it look at I see she look back at you you be nothing like she I suppose you know what I be like of course I do you be drive by anger you crave power which I assume be something you be deprive of in childhood Sydney on the other hand be drive by a sense of duty of loyalty to those she love that be where she get her strength it be also what make she weak attachment be a vulnerability which be easily exploit and yet she somehow always manage to good you and now a victory she be not even aware of tell I I imagine you do your good to avoid mirror yes and I suppose you believe you be drive by faith look where it be get you something tell I be Prophet Five 's new pawn be not exactly your endgame unlike yourself I know my place in the big picture you however will continue to deceive yourself if you think you be anything more than dispensable this procedure that you 've undergo surely there must be a reason why they want you to look like Sydney and when that purpose be fulfil you will become unnecessary lovely catch up the truth be you be no different than she be you be dispensable too Miss Bristow I be Nabin I be afraid you must have overlook I yes I do it be no matter you yourself be hard to overlook in fact you be just as lovely as Mr Vaughn describe Mr Vaughn do not tell he I tell you he talk about you all the time come my car be just this way the drive up to Tambor be only 20 minute how be Mr Vaughn he be recover very well nicely heal I should think here we be can I help you with the bag hurry we do not have much time his name 's Nabin Michael Vaughn send he to pick up agent Bristow Vaughn be not he apparently not I will see you at the intercept point wait wear this Nabin Miss Bristow Welcome to Nepal thank you right this way Mr Vaughn be so eager to see you no this be definitely not good all right sorry sir answer I this when will you have the one with the comfort grip in stock I will transfer you to customer service ask for the manager his name I be sorry could you repeat that I can not can you hear I no it be just there be like a clicking sound do you hear that click no but I will have the manager give you a call alright why do not you have he call I thank you alright thank you for nothing thank you for call we be out of coffee Coffee yeah I know you might not think that be important a lot of people do not do not drink coffee generally might say that you should have some tea or some soda which also have some caffeine but I be tell you it be not the same it be important you be sure about this Positive I notice a glitch on the phone so I check the PBX control accord to the record Sloane log on to the network and he put the entire phone system on some sort of passive surveillance mode which I do not even know be possible how do he get access all of his authorization code be revoke four day ago I be think the same thing but remember Sloane instal most of the system he must have instal some sort of backdoor in the network listen for the past 24 hour sloane and most likely Prophet five have be able to monitor every conversation inside a p o we need to contact Sydney immediately hello Sydney listen to I very carefully be you with your contact yeah I be there be be a security breach at a p o it be sloane we have reason to believe you 've be compromise no we be right on time actually I will call you once we arrive Cell phone they be a miracle do not slow down just go around you be in a hurry I understand but perhaps should not we stop to help hello Sydney well that be fairly easy of course if I have know it be in Renée I would have save we both the trouble and cut it out of she myself when I slit her throat wait Anna Sorry Syd do not have time to chat I 've get a date now I do not know exactly what I be go to do with your boyfriend but whatever it be I will have fun do it be you okay yeah yeah I be fine actually the doctor say I do not need this anymore I think it look debonair it do God I miss you how be she Isabelle she be beautiful just like her mother Isabelle Isabelle you name she Isabelle you like it yeah it be my idea be not it what be it you want Clementine not a day 's go by that I do not want to call you talk to you I have this fear I have never see you again Silly huh maybe a little I be assume this be good news have you make any progress no unfortunately I 've discover an anomaly in the composition Joseph Pinara 's influence in Rambaldi 's encryption Pinara be a 14th century cleric who publish I will skip the history lesson if you do not mind Le Libraire it be a private seller of use book in Geneva they have a copy of the Pinara manuscript I can not decipher Page 47 without it Fine write down the address I will get it myself very well how long do you think you can deceive they Page 47 eventually they be go to find out you already know what it say you be stall you must have some plan what do you want from I Nadia I do not want anything why do not you understand Nadia every sacrifice I 've ever make have be for the great good yet every sacrifice you 've make have come at someone else 's expense or have you forget oh no I have not forget I play it over in my mind the irony all those year I be worried about your well be and now I realize in the end I have no choice you still believe that do not you that your action be control by fate that you be choose why dad surely you must ask yourself why would Rambaldi choose you you be not a man of honor you be not particularly courageous you be charitable but only when it serve your own interest and last but not least you murder the people you claim to love what do you want from I Nadia I do not want anything then why be you here Dad I be here because you want I here now you can pursue Rambaldi and have your daughter at the same time be not that what you say you want just before you kill I no not like this Sir do you need anything I think I hear you talk no I be fine I can not believe Renée 's dead if it have not be for her I would not have know about Prophet five or the truth of my father none of it who kill her Anna Espinosa Anna she be in jail apparently Prophet five arrange for her release what do you think it be I do not know Renée never mention it Marshall could not decode it he think part of the code might be miss unless the data 's be corrupt he think it be in her body since she be a kid maybe 30 year what be it where be it exactly what do you mean inside Renée 's body where be it I do not know why my father once tell I a story that I have a bike accident when I be a kid drive it right into a tree and even though I have no recollection of it I never question he because it leave I with this scar maybe the code be not corrupt at all maybe there be another half okay this might prevent infection but it will not help with pain yeah well you can handle childbirth I can handle this I be in good hand you need to sit very still this be go to hurt yeah I know you mention that it be okay I trust you hello Dad it be I Sydney be you okay you be right the mission 's be compromise Anna know about Vaughn where be you wait dad listen to I it get bad I 've be double you need to stay still think about some thing yeah well give I something to think about tell I about Isabelle well she have your eye the same blue green and her smile be be like your smile really yeah but her chin be pointy it be like mine it be cute oh God I can not wait to meet she I get it apply pressure same etching Renée Goursaud yeah can I see that Perfect fit I be look for a manuscript by Joseph Pinara I call ahead wait one moment I 've get it right over here your receipt be in the book nothing else no that will be all thank I believe there be someone try to contact you no it be not he it be a woman but she know the protocol german yeah look like some sort of emergency evacuation plan continuity of government from the cold war it be a nuclear fallout bunker Hamburg Germany under Bergner park you think there be something there maybe I be go to go with you to find out look I know what you be think I be not ready but Syd you say it yourself my father leave this map chance be when you get there you may need my help you be right I will call for transport okay what I be about to tell you be not to leave this room Agent Vaughn be alive I know it I know it I know he could not be dead for the last several month Vaughn 's be keep in a secure location in Nepal pende his recovery I hope you can all understand that secrecy be a necessary measure to ensure his safety unfortunately those measure be not sufficient through Sloane 's tap of our network prophet five learn of Sydney 's trip to Nepal they send an agent to intercept she be she okay she be fine she make it to Vaughn 's location but Vaughn be no long there he be abduct in a matter of speak we manage to pick up the trail this be take in the Hamburg international airport one hour ago the woman in the photo be not Sydney you sure you get the coordinate right what happen to Bergner park a lot change in 30 year but those bunker be steel reinforce concrete it would be pretty tough to demolish something like that my guess be that they be still under there we just have to find a way in you know that diamond store over there it probably have some pretty expensive piece chance be they be lock away every night in some sort of basement storage room maybe worth a try how do you want to handle this like we do in Cartagena I will follow your lead okay let us go do you really think you be go to get away with this you be out of your league they kill Vaughn they kill Renée they 've probably kill Sydney by now stop Nadia just stop they be well than you smart what make you think you stand a chance this should solve all your problem the Pinara manuscript I hope it help well with all the work that have to be do I will get out of your way unfortunately I seem to be get in my own way how be that the effect of lose a child can not be underestimate you be right I be distract in order for I to concentrate on the future I need to make peace with the past oh baby look at this one really oh it be gorgeous no I would prefer that one there it be you know it be a little less big no no no no be there anything you would like to see hi be this a princess cut yes it be your girlfriend have very good taste yeah for that price

government we can not trust anyone contact my father explain the situation okay I will here take this it be useless to they without the other half take the tracking device in your phone and embed it in the chip before you hand it over we will be able to track your movement I have to go I know be careful we be expect to hear from you soon I run into a few complication nothing I could not handle and Sydney she be dead this be what they find inside Renée Rienne Nice work well if you be able to pull this off the rest should be easy yeah she be not here Repeat Anna be not in the car get out of

someone else who be familiar with 15th century cryptography I be sure you can wait a few more day of course if there be anything we can do to expedite your work you will let I know have you ever see anything like that before it be basically a solid state memory chip cut edge tech at least it be back in the ' 70 which I be guess be when this little guy be make what be it do inside Renee that be the million dollar question be not it basically there be several hundred kilobyte of datum on this thing Problem be it be all encode I would have think 30 year old encrypt algorithm would not present a problem well they would not if the code be complete but half the data 's missing probably corrupt over time without it I can not create a baseline for encryption analysis and you can not extrapolate the miss datum I be try to but I be not go to hold my breath what about these marking what be these it be probably nothing maybe just a serial number maybe or the name of the company that desi what be it hold on a sec I will put it up on the monitor we should tell Sydney I will do that in the meantime Marshall do whatever take to break that encryption I want to know what else be on this chip and I want to know what it be do inside Renee we just get a hit on one of the hard line Contact Peyton I be send it over now Isabelle will you please sleep Sweetie hey dad hey sweetheart be not this her nap time I wish apparently this little girl do not need sleep anymore we get a collective four hour last night it must be genetic you use to wake up at 4 00am every day like clockwork I be sorry about that do Marshall finish his analysis of the chip actually that be why I be here Marshall find datum on it all of it encrypt but he also find something else Vaughn 's name be etch on the outside of the device his real name André Michaux wait what Marshall believe the chip be place inside Renée almost 30 year ago Vaughn and Renée do not know each other 30 year ago no but their father do Vaughn tell you they be work together against Prophet Five and you be think what that one of they implant the chip inside Renee at this point it be the most likely presumption why why would they I do not know but someone leave Vaughn 's name on it intentionally expect it to be find it be possible he may have some understanding of what the chip contain Dad no as far as Prophet five be concern Vaughn be dead involve he at this point a calculate risk I know he be still in recovery he be not field ready I know I will do everything I can to protect he we will have an agent dead drop the chip to Vaughn he will never be see Dad Sydney we do not have a choice sloane 's decision to openly join Prophet Five suggest that they be close to their endgame right now this chip be our only lead but if someone be go to take that chip to Vaughn it be I Syd 's en route to Nepal to see someone who may be able to decipher the chip who be the contact someone who work with Renee that be all Jack tell I this contact Sydney 's meeting in Nepal do you have any idea who it be you busy just try to catch up on the late tech what be go on when be the last time you go to a movie the last movie I use to go to movie all the time and I have not be in so long because there be always something more important to do this be not about go to the movie be it when you be work at the Shed do you ever see an agent bury it take a while to get over it what if I can not what if I be not cut out for this First it be Gordon Dean and now it be sloane they be right in front of I the whole time deceive I and I be oblivious you be a good agent Rachel listen I would tell you if I do not think you could handle this I would like to place a classified ad in next week 's edition a child yes that be right Sydney have a daughter what be her name Isabelle I suppose Vaughn be the father or be the father I should say yes that be right in this business it be always the child who suffer Arvin it trouble you do not it look at I see she look back at you you be nothing like she I suppose you know what I be like of course I do you be drive by anger you crave power which I assume be something you be deprive of in childhood Sydney on the other hand be drive by a sense of duty of loyalty to those she love that be where she get her strength it be also what make she weak attachment be a vulnerability which be easily exploit and yet she somehow always manage to good you and now a victory she be not even aware of tell I I imagine you do your good to avoid mirror yes and I suppose you believe you be drive by faith look where it be get you something tell I be Prophet Five 's new pawn be not exactly your endgame unlike yourself I know my place in the big picture you however will continue to deceive yourself if you think you be anything more than dispensable this procedure that you 've undergo surely there must be a reason why they want you to look like Sydney and when that purpose be fulfil you will become unnecessary lovely catch up the truth be you be no different than she be you be dispensable too Miss Bristow I be Nabin I be afraid you must have overlook I yes I do it be no matter you yourself be hard to overlook in fact you be just as lovely as Mr Vaughn describe Mr Vaughn do not tell he I tell you he talk about you all the time come my car be just this way the drive up to Tambor be only 20 minute how be Mr Vaughn he be recover very well nicely heal I should think here we be can I help you with the bag hurry we do not have much time his name 's Nabin Michael Vaughn send he to pick up agent Bristow Vaughn be not he apparently not I will see you at the intercept point wait wear this Nabin Miss Bristow Welcome to Nepal thank you right this way Mr Vaughn be so eager to see you no this be definitely not good all right sorry sir answer I this when will you have the one with the comfort grip in stock I will transfer you to customer service ask for the manager his name I be sorry could you repeat that I can not can you hear I no it be just there be like a clicking sound do you hear that click no but I will have the manager give you a call alright why do not you have he call I thank you alright thank you for nothing thank you for call we be out of coffee Coffee yeah I know you might not think that be important a lot of people do not do not drink coffee generally might say that you should have some tea or some soda which also have some caffeine but I be tell you it be not the same it be important you be sure about this Positive I notice a glitch on the phone so I check the PBX control accord to the record Sloane log on to the network and he put the entire phone system on some sort of passive surveillance mode which I do not even know be possible how do he get access all of his authorization code be revoke four day ago I be think the same thing but remember Sloane instal most of the system he must have instal some sort of backdoor in the network listen for the past 24 hour sloane and most likely Prophet five have be able to monitor every conversation inside a p o we need to contact Sydney immediately hello Sydney listen to I very carefully be you with your contact yeah I be there be be a security breach at a p o it be sloane we have reason to believe you 've be compromise no we be right on time actually I will call you once we arrive Cell phone they be a miracle do not slow down just go around you be in a hurry I understand but perhaps should not we stop to help hello Sydney well that be fairly easy of course if I have know it be in Renée I would have save we both the trouble and cut it out of she myself when I slit her throat wait Anna Sorry Syd do not have time to chat I 've get a date now I do not know exactly what I be go to do with your boyfriend but whatever it be I will have fun do it be you okay yeah yeah I be fine actually the doctor say I do not need this anymore I think it look debonair it do God I miss you how be she Isabelle she be beautiful just like her mother Isabelle Isabelle you name she Isabelle you like it yeah it be my idea be not it what be it you want Clementine not a day 's go by that I do not want to call you talk to you I have this fear I have never see you again Silly huh maybe a little I be assume this be good news have you make any progress no unfortunately I 've discover an anomaly in the composition Joseph Pinara 's influence in Rambaldi 's encryption Pinara be a 14th century cleric who publish I will skip the history lesson if you do not mind Le Libraire it be a private seller of use book in Geneva they have a copy of the Pinara manuscript I can not decipher Page 47 without it Fine write down the address I will get it myself very well how long do you think you can deceive they Page 47 eventually they be go to find out you already know what it say you be stall you must have some plan what do you want from I Nadia I do not want anything why do not you understand Nadia every sacrifice I 've ever make have be for the great good yet every sacrifice you 've make have come at someone else 's expense or have you forget oh no I have not forget I play it over in my mind the irony all those year I be worried about your well be and now I realize in the end I have no choice you still believe that do not you that your action be control by fate that you be choose why dad surely you must ask yourself why would Rambaldi choose you you be not a man of honor you be not particularly courageous you be charitable but only when it serve your own interest and last but not least you murder the people you claim to love what do you want from I Nadia I do not want anything then why be you here Dad I be here because you want I here now you can pursue Rambaldi and have your daughter at the same time be not that what you say you want just before you kill I no not like this Sir do you need anything I think I hear you talk no I be fine I can not believe Renée 's dead if it have not be for her I would not have know about Prophet five or the truth of my father none of it who kill her Anna Espinosa Anna she be in jail apparently Prophet five arrange for her release what do you think it be I do not know Renée never mention it Marshall could not decode it he think part of the code might be miss unless the data 's be corrupt he think it be in her body since she be a kid maybe 30 year what be it where be it exactly what do you mean inside Renée 's body where be it I do not know why my father once tell I a story that I have a bike accident when I be a kid drive it right into a tree and even though I have no recollection of it I never question he because it leave I with this scar maybe the code be not corrupt at all maybe there be another half okay this might prevent infection but it will not help with pain yeah well you can handle childbirth I can handle this I be in good hand you need to sit very still this be go to hurt yeah I know you mention that it be okay I trust you hello Dad it be I Sydney be you okay you be right the mission 's be compromise Anna know about Vaughn where be you wait dad listen to I it get bad I 've be double you need to stay still think about some thing yeah well give I something to think about tell I about Isabelle well she have your eye the same blue green and her smile be be like your smile really yeah but her chin be pointy it be like mine it be cute oh God I can not wait to meet she I get it apply pressure same etching Renée Goursaud yeah can I see that Perfect fit I be look for a manuscript by Joseph Pinara I call ahead wait one moment I 've get it right over here your receipt be in the book nothing else no that will be all thank I believe there be someone try to contact you no it be not he it be a woman but she know the protocol german yeah look like some sort of emergency evacuation plan continuity of government from the cold war it be a nuclear fallout bunker Hamburg Germany under Bergner park you think there be something there maybe I be go to go with you to find out look I know what you be think I be not ready but Syd you say it yourself my father leave this map chance be when you get there you may need my help you be right I will call for transport okay what I be about to tell you be not to leave this room Agent Vaughn be alive I know it I know it I know he could not be dead for the last several month Vaughn 's be keep in a secure location in Nepal pende his recovery I hope you can all understand that secrecy be a necessary measure to ensure his safety unfortunately those measure be not sufficient through Sloane 's tap of our network prophet five learn of Sydney 's trip to Nepal they send an agent to intercept she be she okay she be fine she make it to Vaughn 's location but Vaughn be no long there he be abduct in a matter of speak we manage to pick up the trail this be take in the Hamburg international airport one hour ago the woman in the photo be not Sydney you sure you get the coordinate right what happen to Bergner park a lot change in 30 year but those bunker be steel reinforce concrete it would be pretty tough to demolish something like that my guess be that they be still under there we just have to find a way in you know that diamond store over there it probably have some pretty expensive piece chance be they be lock away every night in some sort of basement storage room maybe worth a try how do you want to handle this like we do in Cartagena I will follow your lead okay let us go do you really think you be go to get away with this you be out of your league they kill Vaughn they kill Renée they 've probably kill Sydney by now stop Nadia just stop they be well than you smart what make you think you stand a chance this should solve all your problem the Pinara manuscript I hope it help well with all the work that have to be do I will get out of your way unfortunately I seem to be get in my own way how be that the effect of lose a child can not be underestimate you be right I be distract in order for I to concentrate on the future I need to make peace with the past oh baby look at this one really oh it be gorgeous no I would prefer that one there it be you know it be a little less big no no no no be there anything you would like to see hi be this a princess cut yes it be your girlfriend have very good taste yeah for that price she might as well be a princess it cost nothing to try on a stone of that quality have this effect on some people no she have seizure Kelly just breathe it be okay could I get some help here please it be okay just relax how do I get access downstairs my key take my key watch he I be in Hamburg Bromestrasse 123 I will need an extraction do not hurt I please I will do whatever you ask then shut up thank I 've get it from here who be you it be a pity you will never know Sydney and I never go to Cartagena and just for the record you be a terrible kisser I always say Sydney be too good for you let us see if this one 's load be you all right yeah I be fine how do you okay we can go now Project summary test subject name date it be all here your father 's research of prophet five Most of these organization still exist Syd we can end it all Hang on go ahead I get your message do you get the chip yes I be do here good Bleichen and Bromestrasse we should be there in five minute that be Peyton she be come to extract Anna who be Peyton Sloane be part of this he work with prophet five he kill Nadia this be my chance to stop he I know you can not go back to a p o there be mole within the government we can not trust anyone contact my father explain the situation okay I will here take this it be useless to they without the other half take the tracking device in your phone and embed it in the chip before you hand it over we will be able to track your movement I have to go I know be careful we be expect to hear from you soon I run into a few complication nothing I could not handle and Sydney she be dead this be what they find inside Renée Rienne Nice work well if you be able to pull this off the rest should be easy yeah who be you it be a pity you will never know Sloane be part of this he work with Prophet five this be my chance to stop he we be expect to hear from you soon I run into a few complication and Sydney she be dead Langley can not know what Sydney be do we should continue to act on the assumption that Prophet Five have mole inside the c I a contact Michael Linz in Berlin he will send the body back I will get right on it come with I Anna 's dead Sydney seize the opportunity to infiltrate Prophet Five Sydney 's present herself as Anna do you think that be wise it be Sydney 's call I be not consult what be your status we will be up and run in a minute Sydney embed a tracker into the chip that Anna be task to retrieve we will be able to follow she from here we suspect Prophet Five have intend for Anna to do some task only Sydney could perform Learning what that be may be an opportunity to determine their endgame that be if they believe Sydney be Anna I know patch Vaughn through Vaughn can you hear I you be clear where be he Hamburg he and Sydney uncover a storeroom of information material that Vaughn and Renée Rienne 's father gather during their investigation of Prophet 5 you will join Vaughn transmit the documentation back here for analysis Vaughn it be Dixon it be good to hear your voice you too I will see you soon Marshall how we do I be triangulate the coordinate just give I a sec you know I cry at your funeral sorry about that no no thank you I need a good cry now and again okay tracker 's hot get she there she be she be on Tiergartenstrasse I have the chip in hand of course we be en route now our superior be quite pleased with your performance you seem surprised not at all your reputation 's well deserved to the great Anna Espinosa Great seem a little strong do not it do not tell I you be get modest it be this body I have this uncontrollable urge now to act like a girl scout all the time well let us get you back to Zurich before you start try to sell I cookie I be sure our superior be eager to get their hand on that this this be an inconvenience nothing more what just happen I be not sure I think the tracker crash crash what do that mean crash we 've lose Sydney Marshall find she I can not I think it must 've fritze out Patch into a traffic cam do something just find she do not worry I be on it okay I get she they be head south on A7 the airport Marshall I be on Doverkamp head east I need direction wait give I a sec leave at the next intersection you be close in Marshall I be go to need a green light in a hurry Easier say than do it be all in german Anschlag Grun Green shall we you finish the translation of page 47 the circle will be complete when the choose one find the rose in San Cielo Congratulations Mr Sloane thank to your work we be close than we 've ever be to comprehend Rambaldi 's great mystery you understand the meaning of the deciphered message enough to proceed however I do have one concern Rambaldi 's prophecy have always take into account the small variable this be a man who predict event hundred of year before we be bear the rise in question be indeed unique as unique as Sydney herself what be unclear however be whether Anna Espinosa pose as Sydney be able to complete the task well then I guess you 've get your work cut out for you after you sloane 's here of course you do not think we would dispose of he this soon do you I hear your mission be a success I suppose I should offer you congratulation thank you do you encounter any complication just one but I 've deal with her once and for all we should celebrate Arvin Sydney Bristow be dead Sync by anyone Sixe Guilamu Transcript Raceman www forom com Remarkable likeness be not it so this be why you need she or should I say I in his prophecy Rambaldi refer to Sydney as the choose one he foretell that she would bring forth his final work and you really believe that that a man who live 500 year ago have intention for Sydney Bristow excuse I I may be mistaken but I always believe you to be a follower of Rambaldi 's work only when it suit my checkbook I be not someone who would guide my life by some perverted sense of faith but as long as I have to look like this I might as well make some use of it what do Rambaldi want I to do retrieve an artifact from San Cielo a monastery outside Rome Monastery that sound fun do I get to wear a habit I think I 've tell you all you need to know for now we leave within the hour do this mean you be send I to my room there be a change of clothe for you upstairs second door on the left sadly he do yeah can you imagine what happen when they get home could I steal you for a sec the new encryption module for the comms think my math be wrong go ahead I can handle this she will be back in a second do not Langley just convert all of our comms to this be not about the comms Marshall what be go on last week when Sloane infiltrate the network I build a bot to monitor the server you know flag any abnormal activity this morning a message come through this office without any I d Tags intend for Allen Korman Korman you mean the guy that yeah he I mean why would Tom be contact a guy who kill his wife so I do some dig Travel itinerary Korman 's fly into L A tonight this do not make any sense look I talk to Tom myself he say he come to Korman to confront he but when he see Korman with his family he change his mind Rachel Korman do not have any family I check Tom 's be lie to you I be sorry I want to tell you first but I have to tell Mr Bristow no you do not yes we have to look you say it yourself the contact be anonymous Tom be not a bad guy how do you know that because I know look just let I check into it first give I 24 hour I promise if we do not have an answer by then we will go to Jack together all right 24 hour hey it be I I do not have much time where be you Zurich an estate highly secure sloane be here what be he tell you that page 47 reference San Cielo a monastery outside Rome we be go there where be you right now in your kitchen play with Isabelle you be how be she Happy Dad do she just Giggle yeah apparently I be funny she have not do that before that be a first of which there will be many I know I will notify Vaughn and Dixon about Rome if you learn anything more I have to go tell Isabelle I love she you ready hey hey you be short than I remember this be all regard Prophet five this entire bunker contain evidence of mysterious death assassination car bombing all of they involve people who be investigate Prophet Five they basically kill anyone who get too close but they do not get you no they might have if not for Jack when I be in the hospital he convince I that Prophet Five would not rest until they kill I and that I be in no condition to fight back how have he manage it Sodium morphate it slow down my body function to a point that mimicked death apparently I spend four hour in a drawer at the morgue wait for Jack 's contact reach I to administer the antidote then a couple day of travel before I make it to Nepal you know it be funny it be the 1st time I ever feel Jack accept I or else he manufacture a very elaborate scheme to postpone your wedding to his daughter I have something for you fortunately she look more like her mother yeah she do Dixon thank you yeah Jack of course we will contact you when we arrive Jack 's send a team to box all this up Sydney 's en route with Sloane we be go to provide backup where be they head Rome well I make our arrangement your contact will be meet you on the ground he will provide you with access to San Cielo no more than I need to know well I be sure you have question so do I tell I how do it happen how do I kill Sydney why do you care Sydney be a remarkable agent I imagine it be not easy Sydney be not a martyr or a legend she be just a person who deserve nothing more than to be shoot in the back and so she be the choose One she die just as easy as anyone I see well thank you we will be land shortly I know what you have plan for Anna after this mission be over you have reservation oh no I want to be the one who kill her you smell nice so we look into the monastery San Cielo you be sure about that name yeah why Marshall could not find any record of it I be meet someone inside the o t b he be suppose to brief I on the rest I see a picture of Isabelle I do not know how we do this anymore we do it the way we 've always do it it be the only way to keep her safe we end this okay Dixon and I will have your back if anything happen we be go to pull you out so who be this contact Sloane say I would know he when I see he Syd be careful I would not do that if I be you if you want my advice take Tokyo Rose in the third it be a sure bet Julian last time I see you it be at Venice where as I recall you betray I to the c I a they take I into custody and yet Anna here you be look well than ever that be for a year spend in a federal holding facility now what be that one for I will get back to you right so what be you drink do you find he the Cardinal I would not be here if I do not I be go to give you to three to start talk not here somebody might be watch I do not lie to you Korman kill my wife but the order come from somebody else the close I 've get be a name the Cardinal well you two seem to be pretty chummy he work freelance we do a job once deep cover op he do not even know my real name look I 've get to find out why Rachel she be a schoolteacher she be not a part of this life if somebody want to hurt I why do not they just come after I and Korman know he do now he find the Cardinal what do he want money his car it be seize when he turn himself in to witsec you could 've tell I tom I would 've keep it to myself no I could not have I 've spend four year and this be as close as I 've get to an answer I could not trust anybody if I hack into the federal database I should be able to find the car I could not ask you to do that you do not it be Sark the contact Yep well the enemy you know she can handle Sark another perhaps you should not we be on the clock we be here I think we be just catch up on old time well in that case maybe it be time you fill I in on the plan what have Sloane tell you just that our target be San Cielo well that be not entirely true the rose that you be suppose to acquire if you be to believe page 47 be be hold in a facility know by Rambaldi as San Cielo the rest of the world now refer to it as La Fossa maximum security prison we be break into a prison accord to Sloane Milo Rambaldi in the day lead up to his execution be hold there he believe he hide the rose in the northwest isolation wing the text specify that only the Chosen One can obtain the item in question I guess you will have to do an explosion I suggest you take cover wait this be your plan for get we into La Fossa yes Grazzie follow my lead will you have you be able to access the prison 's internal network not yet Vaughn and Dixon be move through the sewer now right here prison internet connection run out through a junction box it should be vulnerable Merlin you there yeah Vaughn go ahead we be about 70 meter in still no sign of the junction box you be almost directly under the switch room you should be close got it it be a standard IP X node Good you should be able to splice the line and access the surveillance feed do that now do it quickly I do not like the idea Sydney be in a maximum security prison with Sark as her backup be my friend will make your time more pleasurable Lucky for you I will not be here for long otherwise I would pull out your tongue and choke you with it you realize we just break about a half dozen federal law unless they move it Korman 's car should be right down this aisle look just stay low check for v I N Numbers you ready let us go this be it this should not take long can I help yeah just keep an eye out for the guard be there any particular reason you be connect the carburetor to the intake tube this be the carburetor yeah maybe uh I should keep an eye out for the guard all right you should be tie in now yeah we be hot you get a picture copy it be come through see if you can isolate the woman 's block wait a minute be that be that the woman 's shower no that be man definitely man there she be wait a minute she be in isolation you think that be part of a plan we have to hope so hold he down this be go to hurt Marshall what happen do we lose the signal I do not know everything just go wacky we 've be kick out look like somebody else be try to hack into the system Sark be there any way to regain our tap we have to keep track of her you could look for the alarm line and then try to cross wind them and get a Von Eck signal know what he be talk about 50 this be it Sark where be you I 've be wait for you for a very long time I think you have I confuse with someone else I can not imagine confuse you with anyone else as difficult as this must be for you to understand I know you we 've never meet no we have not we do not have much time come with I I be not go anywhere with you unless you tell I who you be the circle will be complete when the choose one find the rose I be the rose now if you will come with I and Mr Harvey how can I help you you have two suspect in custody who be want fugitive from my country and we would like to have they extradite with your permission of course then I be afraid we have a problem why be that sir these two have commit crime on italian land and I can not possibly release they before their first judicial hearing but you could release they if you get the permission of the general prosecutor Adriana Micelli well yes of course but signora Micelli Mrs Micelli be expect your call Pronto Signora Micelli Buongiorno well look like we may be almost there I be suppose to meet she who

tell I what it be you do not understand you can not stop they you do not know I very well you be more charming than I could have imagine I use to believe as you do that there be decision to be make

I I wish that be true sloane do this he know where we live where we work how we work but the question remain why to disable our technical capability to distract we well perhaps he need something from they and Marshall and Rachel you know he will not hesitate to kill they once he get what he need I know you be right about he after Irina be extract I be take into custody I have to designate a guardian for Sydney I choose Sloane in spite of everything he be do I believe that some part of he be still the friend I once trust with my daughter clearly I be wrong oh my I think you be I think
