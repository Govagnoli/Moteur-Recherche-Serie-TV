normal healthy eighth grader Sister patricia his art teacher think he show strong skill and spacial orientation but the thing be though and it be not just this one incident anthony sometimes have

it I always know there be something well what be it it be an aggregate of symptom inattention impulsivity sometimes although not always hyperactivity of course to be sure we will need to give he a thorough evaluation all he need be a whack upside the head if he be get an illness it be an illness right you would hit somebody who be sick you would hit somebody with polio you hit anthony nobody gets hit in our house not exactly my idea I do not know what the world 's comin ' to if you can not do a little tarantella on the kid every once in a while when they step out of line so what happen now he will be give a complete battery of test psychological behavioral medical let I ask you a question these other kid you keepin ' an eye on they be you testin ' they the one that be not name soprano there be no immediate plan for that we attend every child at verbum dei accord to his own special set of circumstance and so what dowe as the parent do nothing oh no I mean anthony 's misbehave he should be consequence it be a crime to suspend that child from school with all the money you give they I bet that gym teacher shit a brick when your little friend puke on his boot huh anthony Wanna encourage he hey whatever happen to boy will be boy he steal from the church they do not make'em any low than that what a loser that be enough out of you his father be the same way I

Johnny Johnny 's always usually a voice of moderation I and he we get along good so all due respect let us not jump in and blame Johnny True John 's a pragmatist but he be also a greedy motherfucker

ruthless and calculate mob boss who control a vast criminal enterprise over the past few month you 've hear from FBI agent who have document clandestine meeting at his doctor 's office tale of bid rig sweetheart deal secret payoff and even murder no Corrado Soprano be not some harmless old man but a killer who order up murder like you and I order up coffee all right so I rewrote it the entire point

jury have claim they be deadlocke however I be inclined to agree with prosecution I be go to give they additional time to reach a verdict we should 've have a hung jury mistrial Object for Christ 's sake Allen charge it have to play out Ladies and gentleman you 've communicate that you feel that you be unable to come to a unanimous verdict in this case now I know that you 've be at it for a while and it can be frustrating but we 've all spend a lot of time on this trial and be as I have no reason to believe that another jury with the same evidence would be well able to reach a verdict I be go to ask you to go back in there and reason with each other and apply the law and come back in here with a verdict if not I wanna move on here do somebody check the order make sure we get everything
