a while and then we need to tell your folk you be okay I do not ow don'T nothing be jump out at I you be the one who believe why because I think she be tell the truth ignore the file ignore all the preconception and let us look at the fact as if everything rebecca have tell we be the truth which would mean that the hospital miss something right from the start and then she be saddle with a psych diagnosis so the doctor would assume that her worsen symptom  be just sign of increasingly destructive behavior but that could also indicate a worsening of her real physical condition so then what be the miss illness that start it all well one that that make she feel stomach spasm and pain after she eat Associated with occasional joint pain and fever and come and go in cycle do they ever get a g I Camera study I do not see it in her record how would that help the camera could get to place in rebecca 's body that previous workup could not have see it be a relatively new procedure and if she have an occult form of an autoimmune disease affect deep sectionsof the intestine it would flare up during time of stress like during pregnancy which mean she would not absorb nutrient properly and explain why she say she be eat but the lab say she be not so they could 've miss it they definitely could 've miss it all right look I be play tug of war with the wheelchair okay but charlotte be strong than she look they take she back to the hospital Rebecca 's go she be go do you know what this girl 's mother will say if she find out I run another test without her consent what will she say if the test could save rebecca 's life her and the baby 's Y'all really want I to get fire do not you if youeed a win to get the hospital off your back for rebecca walking take full credit for the fix I do not care about the credit okay I do care about the credit but I care about help this girl more we will set up for the camera study all right something sylvie say have I wonder I speak to you in

do say no well I know there be issue with she carry her own grandchild and her age but Sharon seem to think I be not interested in Sharon 's reason Terri be my patient I be interested in what she would think and she would never ever want this how can you be so sure Terri hate her mother give that woman another child Terri 's child would 've be her bad nightmare I be twist the coil capture the clot a few more minute I will beable to pull it outta there return the blood flow in your brain back to normal can you keep she still please she be have uterine contraction well you be go to have to

the dye oh be not that a pretty sight no no okay all right do you think it be ever appropriate for a mother to be implant with the embryo of her daughter I be dread the choice between power berry and dragonfruit vitaminwater look okay mother act as surrogate for their daughter all the time if Sharon want a baby so badly let she adopt Sharon do not want any child she want their child she do not deserve it well I do not like it any more than you do but if I do not do it she be just well she just she just go to another doctor for implantation right I mean they be her property by law I be not say they should be she be 52 there be very few doctor who could successfully impregnate a woman her age if Naomi say no then the problem end here but be not get old woman pregnant part of the beauty of i V F they get to have Time have career and still be mom and what do that mean for their kid I mean can you imagine volunteer to be team mom in soccer in your 50 or go prom dress shopping in your 60 I do not know maybe the fact that Terri hate her mother make the decision for I I do not have to worry about age or grief she should not be a mother People become parent at different time in their life for different reason it be not always ideal but if this woman be willing to make a good faith effort to be the kind of parent she know she should 've be before why would we be against that be not

you new needle whenever you ask you have hep c this be to prevent the spread what do you do with the needle I trade they I do not share the dirty needle you trade my needle for more drug I do not want to be like this anymore okay I be try I be and I have not do well but I can I can I know I can as soon as I get out of here the bacteria be eat away at your heart Keith do you understand that the hepatitis be destroy your liver if you leave now you will die you mad at I you be a grown woman have sex with my brother but still you be a grown woman do you think that a responsible grow woman like I can also be the type of woman that go out with the good time guy be that what he be call himself yeah and I do not know can I here be my advice be careful listening to my brother thing do not tend to end well for the woman in his life and you be my friend what be you mad at he you know he come here and it change I he push I and I start act like a teenager I mean I be a competent woman and when he be here I feel like the little sister you know what I be not blame he but part of the reason why I ask Kevin to move in with I be because Archer keep badger I about our relationship not work and how I be date out of my element because Kevin 's a cop S W A t so I make a choice to prove he wrong and he be right and I hate that why do not you try and have a different relationship with he look at I and Sam marry divorced and then awkward and now we be actually talk to each other about our love live with other people you be and if Sam and I can get past all that surely you and Archer can I get to go she call 9 1 1 Sweetie I be sorry my daughter hate I I know that I have no idea what she tell you about I but I imagine it be not flatter well I could say that that be privilege but I do not think that would help either one of we to understand what be go on here so yes Terri have negative feeling that be why I be not sure what you be ask for be a good idea I do corporate litigation I be good at my work I love it and when I get pregnant everyone tell I do not worry it will be amazing it will change your life and it do but it be not amazing it be hard and exhausting and it do not make I feel anything like work ever do so Terri 's sense that you resent she it have some basis in fact I love my daughter very much but she she change my life from be in control and fulfil to feel constantly overwhelmed and inadequate but Sharon listen to yourself if motherhood for you be more burden than blessing why would you want to subject yourself to that again because I want it to be different this time but what make you assume it could be the pain I 've live with it every single day while she be alive not be what she need I keep think that at some point I would be able to make the relationship right I can not bring Terri back but I I can have the child that she want and give it love and and attention and the support that she would 've that she deserve that every child deserve I be capable of that Jane you be in labor I need to deliver the baby now it be early but I think it will be okay I need it be okay I be go to take care of the baby okay I be surprised you call look the baby be in distress and Jane 's not dilate but I can not wait I 've get to do a c section now but she be still on blood thinner fromour procedure I need to reverse themor she will bleed out that will put she at risk for another stroke the baby can not survive without surgery what if I do a c section with a spinal can you do an intraoperative e e g monitor the neuro status that sound like a good plan we be go to get you up to the o r Tim I already call he go ahead I want you to hear I out I tell you once Cooper no more talk and express it be do you know what it could be do it could be do and over and there would not even be that much mess you be not pregnant we do not live together there be no vacation plan and I do not have one thing at your house and god know you would not leave so much as a t shirt at mine but emotionally I be not ready to let go we be so not the cute couple in and out of each other 's pocket finish each other 's sentence but we be still a couple we be we and I love we and I be nowhere near ready to give up even if you be I be not give up well will not that be lonely will you sign a 51 50 for Keith embry he be a drug addict you can not lock up an addict and force they into treatment it be more than that he be live on the street he be get no job he be not eat he be get no clothe Grave disability okay you 've do your homework you think it be a bad idea I think it be well when people want treatment force treatment be problematic and with addict he will just lie to you but if he stay on the street he be go to die maybe but 72 hour in a psych facility be not go to change that 72 hour to evaluate then they can choose to do a 14 day hold and then 30 day do he have a support system a wife or kid he have a wife but no kid thank god that would be a disaster well kid can inspire thing in people that adult can not I mean if he would have kid I mean would not it make a difference if you would have kid I be past that window the sad truth be it be probably well that Anna and I do not have kid I be too selfish and I get angry so will you sign the 51 50 you know I think when you force something on someone that they do not want they will never fully commit so if he do not want this for himself he will just walk out the door the baby almost there Jane Hang in any bleed persistent ooze around the edge any change in her e e g no she be fine Bovie Jane I be go to take the baby out now Lap pad and have an intubation tray stand by what be wrong he be not breathe yet Laryngoscope and a suction catheter now he be aspirate meconium how much time do I have you 've get about 30 second okay come on come on stand by with a 3 0 endotracheal tube and a ventilator 20 second Addison Come on breathe he be okay he be go to be okay Jane I think I be wrong about Sharon use Terri 's embryo what about Terri well I be think about Terri grow up about how she must have feel and how kid intuitively know if their parent resent they but I be also think that that child only see one side and that if a parent understand their feeling and really want to change I actually think Sharon will be a different mom this time around and she be not just try to replace her daughter it be not guilt maybe the fact that she be committed to be a good mom maybe that be reason enough to give she a second chance Keith what the hell be you do I got to get outta here I be just I be go crazy I be sorry Pete but I just I get to man you need to stay I need you to get well Ellen need you to get well she still want her husband back I can not be that guy anymore you can I be not go to sit back and let you hurt yourself Keith you have a real chance to get clean I can not no wait you be go to be commit to the psychiatric ward of St Ambrose they have doctor here who specialize in treat addiction they can help you oh you son of a bitch you son of a bitch all right hold on a second if it be go to work he have to want it he can get there he be not beyond help he be not here we go wait wait please please wait what if I be make a mistake what if what if I can not do any well this time what if what if I be just destine to be a bad mother you be not destine to be anything you have a chance to be whatever you want and if the person you be before be not work you can change it and you can be the kind of mother that you think that that baby that Terri 's baby deserve and if you commit to that and you decide that it be what you want it will be amazing for both of you this be the chance you want right then take it he be beautiful breathing on his own you do good Jane you want I to hand you the baby I be glad you be here here you go hi baby Anxiety induce asthma what do you have for Sam I do not need anything yes he do Sonya be a problem we have not seal

last book you want a consult on you convene a panel the doctor say it be operable one think so three doctor say no they would have to tear through half of my brain to get this what about chemo Radiation Chemo be not prove effective with this kind of lesion and radiation would fry all brain tissue before it make a dent I would lose my sense of humor you can not just give up I be not give up

maybe Zihuatanejo what Zihuatanejo I be there six month ago for a book junket what be you talk about it be not tumor Neurocysticercosis Parasites Parasites I have parasite in my brain Forgot what it be like in the side of think just be I be here in a waiting room Bud gaz test confirm it a mass of a parasistic cyst I be call Derek he can take he out I mean I have not a tumor but it still in my third ventricle this does'nt change that but you think you have five year these lesion be warm sac in your brain they can burst at any moment and you could die or I can take any parasitic instead it to kill they they would might kill he they could also send your immune system into overdrive you end up with brain swell more seizure which would rupture the remain cyst do you realize how lucky you be last night that that do not happen on the other hand the drug could cure I all due respect to your ex husband even in Derek 's hand there be a 1 in 4 chance I be a vegetable or I could die on the table or I could die from complication you be a surgeon it be your instinct to cut not mine Addison he have a right to make his own decision come on Nai what you 've be sleep with he for a few week and now you be on his side it be his field and it be his life it be risky but drug can work I be sorry Derek may be your answer but he be not mine this be not your choice I deliver a baby today and I think I do something wrong and you want to tell I about it I just I place the vacuum too low I think I use too much force and she be get this like red mark and I be afraid there might be bleed in the brain what do Addison say that she be fine but she will not do a c T scan and she will not check and and now she be not even here you ask for a diagnosis and she give it now she be get to focus on her brother who be get every test under the sun which be great it be great but you know why can not the baby that I deliver get just one you know what I think I think that you want she to run a test to treat your anxiety and not the baby if Addison say the baby be healthy then accept it whatever you do work you okay can I trust you with something I can not believe it you pregnant I do not want anyone to know what about the father I mean do he know it be complicated well you do not owe I any explanation it could be pete or it could be Sheldon keep it local that be Cool look at that I do not

hard but Patty love you and this surgery she need it she need you we can not you be good people we be not I 've know you since your daughter be 6 hour old through the accident through rehab and all of that ruin we the bill they never end day after day we do not have the money our insurance be go I can talk to the hospital it be too much Cooper she be too much for we we can not do it anymore I know what you must think of we but we be do that be it you be do that lite girl be smart and strong and she survive a car accident and all the surgery and all the pain and for a kid like that I would walk over broken glass to help she you be do you do not deserve she look like you be good at your job I be not a doctor but yes I know a thing or two about pregnant woman so my cramp be not about the baby what be you talk about I have an alien be grow inside of I it be not the only thing grow inside you I mean keep this a secret not tell Pete or Sheldon the guilt the anxiety it grow and it will swallow you up it be not good for you or the baby okay you need to tell they I can not not now do not forget these when I be 7 I fall off my bike do you remember we be on the vineyard not just fall off we be

another woman I have a little girl who be schedule to have surgery at St Ambrose today I need it to happen the problem be her parent sign all the pre op form and all be good to go they abandon she this be what d C F sis for you call they take the kid and then she never get the surgery she be in an accident at 5 she limp she have back problem she crush her knee it need to be reconstruct it be consider elective surgery d C F S will not pay for it the parent be require to sign their child in period risk management require it and if we just assume that they do you waltz in here and expect I to violate hospital ethic to essentially commit fraud for you who will not even break Violet 's confidence for I you be mad at I I probably deserve it but there be a girl who be be sit alone in my office for eight hour wait for a surgery to change her life a surgery that she do not get unless we skip a step in the process and just let thing progress the way they be suppose to do not help I help her it be all right Violet just say it whatever it be just right Good just say it I be pregnant I know it be crazy it be wrong it be awful but I want to be clear that I have no expectation here I know neither of you want kid so you do not have to worry I actually do not know whose it be which be crazy I know but but whichever it turn out to be it be not your responsibility it be mine and there be nothing that you need to do Cooper have move in with I he be look after I it will all be take care of so now you know okay this be how you want to handle this you think that this be how either of we want to handle this divide and conquer be not that right Violet you do not want a conversation about this you 've decide what we want and how we feel and how we will react and what we will say so you just drop this bomb in front of both of we I do not want to say anything until you decide on your own without consult anyone anyone who might so I take it that you be go to keep it I be go to keep it

may not he be not your brother but he be good he know what he be do how long before the seizure cause permanent neurological damage there be no way to know but give the intensity and the duration I do not think we have a lot of time Time for what he want to use a general induce coma Put Archer 's brain to sleep it will stop the seizure cycle he may not come out of that he be not come out of statut either but the long we let these seizure go on then the big the chance that everything that make Archer Archer gets burn away I will do it this be go to help you Archie it will help you rest there we go he need the surgery to remove the parasite Archer do not want it he be very clear about that that be before this he go into status because the parasitic sack shift maybe we do not know that we do not have time to try the drug the drug be too risky if we start the drug immediately it be not fast enough it would take a week maybe ten day even that that be what they say I be as scared as you be of lose he but we have to respect his wish I be tired of respect he I want to save he I want to call Derek Archer say no and if you go down that road I will not accept that we be suppose to just stand by and watch he die it be my choice I be make it make the call come on I need you I know all about the five stage of grief I be try to figure out the five stage of shock I be piss Kind of I do not

lab result Dr Montgomery want to run another round of I never see the first round Sam be not respond to his med what do the preliminary lab result say about Jen 's condition they be inconclusive that

be Rachel she be stable I sedate she with benzo get she start on an atypical antipsychotic she will have to stop breast feeding which be not ideal but what if mine do not sleep she will sleep what if she do not then I will stay up with she while you sleep what if I go crazy what if I get postpartum psychosis and depression what if I try to hurt the baby or what I if I just have a terrible child seriously what if I be the one that give birth to the sociopath who try to burn the high school down or what if I just screw up in so many way that no amount of therapy can ever repair the damage that I do to that poor child stop Postpartum psychosis be very rare this be not normal what if mine do not sleep sorry I be afraid you will have to step out I be a physician and I be his girlfriend you be not his physician and as for girlfriend Washington state medical code do not consider that a legal role Fine can you just give I some idea of what you be do for Sam he be not respond to the med I be his wife Ex and I think you be this one 's girlfriend be you like this with everyone or be I just special Fine stay but no question Post op c t everything okay I do not know you know what be weird you who have never wear flannel a day in your life live in Seattle and have a semi incestuous relationship with your good friend 's almost sister I be go to say it be weird that I dislike Archer as much as I do and somehow this you and Archer thing give I hope Lexie that be the sister she be a good girl she be a nice girl well raise kind and understanding sane she be like you so if you can find happiness with Archer I be think maybe there be hope you really think this thing be real between you and this little girl I be afraid to hurt she you think Archer 's go to hurt I I hope not like I say you two give I hope give she another 40 off furosemide and get a repeat chest what do you get I 've be hope I I run a thousand test and I do not tell you the result cause I be hope I be wrong but the baby be severely anemic his heart 's fail most likely it be cause by a kell antigen incompatibility in the blood you give Jen during surgery it be cause a reaction that be destroy the baby 's blood I be I be so sorry do not be sorry just tell I how we can fix it in an ideal circumstance I would do an in utero blood transfusion but this be not an ideal circumstance Jen be deteriorate rapidly she could arrest at any minute and the priority have get to be the mother so what be you say I be say that we have to get the baby out the baby 's 24 week the odd of he survive but if I take he out she live if we do not we risk lose they both he be not ready he be too little he be not ready Jen I know that this be scary but I be go to do everything that my book say he can live if we get he to 26 week that be in two week so let I just I can stay in the hospital and be on oxygen and keep he in for two more week Jen your baby be in congestive heart failure so be you you do not have two more week you be not take he out he be too little he be too little would he survive if you take he out will he he absolutely could survive I 've deliver baby that be one to two day young even that've survive I 've also lose baby that be several week old it be just a risk I be not go to lie to you but I be go to do everything that I can to save he please tell I this be not happen there be absolutely nothing else you can do right there be no other option there be an in utero procedure wait what be that that be not an option here she be strong that be not an option here the risk be far too high I be sorry you have to do it you have to fix he it be your job to fix he Jen let I be clear if we do this and your heart condition worsen or you get another brain bleed both you and the baby could die that be not go to happen no it be not go to happen please just do the thing where you leave he in that be what I choose leave he in you corner I I come in and say we have to deliver that baby and then you ride in on a white horse offer some in utero procedure that you know nothing about be it go to kill she or be there a chance I do not know Derek those be odd I do not like to evaluate in front of a weeping mother clutch her belly evaluate it now run some test figure it out just keep that baby alive and I will keep she alive how do this happen she be she love this baby how do this happen how do I let it happen how do I miss it Postpartum depression be very insidious it sneak up on you so it can be trigger by sleep deprivation then the depression make it hard to sleep it be a vicious cycle and then when there be psychosis I be tired too I be so tired but I could not I could not how could she do this you can not understand because you be not in her body you can not experience it be not anything you miss Andrew you be the dad you be on the outside you be as close as you can be but you be on the outside and if she do not let you in she do not tell you what she be feel it be not your fault Rachel want to see Cindy she be asleep for a couple of hour but her milk let down and it wake she up what do I do now how be you I 've see you and Archer together we 've talk about your sex life we 've talk about my sex life I be okay with where we be it be fine Sam no I do not want it toe fine I want you believe that dr Bailey please give I some good news sorry no news I run everything again you have bronchospasm we start you on steroid and a bronchodilator we reintroduce the new inhaler we get you yesterday wait you give he a new inhaler be it an inhaler with a corn base propellant no how would I know that be it a problem I be allergic to corn base propellant do you tell I you be allergic to corn base propellant but I give you my inhaler to be refill and I specifically request that inhaler I order the generic he do not ask you for the generic we do not keep the brand name on the clinic shel I be do he a favor excuse I I say ha ha because I be right ha because it be an allergic reaction so ha to Mark and Addison and you if you believe they it be not a panic attack it be an asthmattack I be not pathetic I be a man I be a man with asthma so ha give I some dr Bailey so she be in no condition to have fetal surgery a surgery that will likely kill she only her surgeon have promise promise to keep she alive and you want I to say yes I think the good plan be to deliver the baby Derek I have an excellent record with preemie I nick her aneurysm I do not do that I never do that I do not know why I do it I do not know if it be because I be tired or sloppy Derek thing happen during surgery they happen to great surgeon who be not tired and sloppy they just happen not to I this be not your fault the transfusion do not work the blood do not match perfectly that happen if I have not have nick the aneurysm she would not require blood it be my fault it be if that baby die I can not live with that please Addison please okay I will do it how you do Jen if you be save my baby I be great Heart rate shoot up to 134 Jen be you panic I need you not to panic I be not I be not panic I just I just I can not really breathe her lung be fill up with fluid push another 80 of furosemide Bring in the crash cart she be in and out of a psychotic state until the medication be totally in she until she be treat she could hurt she she could snap her neck but she be not go to be alone with her she will be monitor the whole time well all it take be a minute she stop herself Violet she have a horrible impulse she do a horrible thing but she stop herself and come to we for help I know it be just she could 've kill she do we want to be the one who put she back in her mother 's arm and then something terrible happen and they think what be they think but you can not just cut

be not sure Private Practice S02E17 Wait and see I know this be impossibly hard and we do not have all the answer yet but your baby have something like a penis there be also a vaginal opening the baby 's heart and lung and brain be very healthy and that be important for you to understand but what be it we will run some genetic and hormonal test I consult with my collegue Dr Bennet she be an excellent endocrinologist we be go to get you answer well until then what do we tell people what be we what be we call he he be Mathew he be he be suppose to be he be suppose to be Mathew why do you go to Seattle I be sorry it be just it be run through my mind on a loop like a song I can not stop hum so I have to ask Seattle why do you go Archer 's surgery look Naomi like to pretend like she have it all together well she be an Ivy league educate doctor with the good shoe collection I 've ever see so she do have it all together usually but Archer get sick in fact she need a shoulder to lean on be it I think it be great you 've manage the impossible you 've maintain a good relationship with your ex it be just why I like you I like you too you be not a good guy yes I be I be wonder I run a couple 's therapy group and my co leader be down with a stomach bug and I think it be very important that we have a male and a female therapist you know Role model communication model and I wonder if you would like to fill in I know not such a great idea consider no no I I think it be good I like work with couple be you sure what time our conference room at one Lunch time okay see you then how be it the baby it be fine Good that be good that it be fine because I would really apreciate if we do not talk about this right now because I do not know if I can handle it I will see you later oh you 've get that look that it be impossible to decide for Violet look look I 've just give up I be go cool not cold just cool the hell of it with cold Therapy should be interesting you and Violet be in therapy no we be do therapy together it be a couple 's group you be lead it as a couple yes we be good luck with that you should have see the look on their face it be awfull like this be their fault be you okay no what what do we tell they well I wish I have a good answer but the baby do have 11 beta hydroxylase deficiency what be it it be an enzime deficiency that cause an over production of testosterone in the baby in utero that be why the baby have both male and female sex organ the caryotype be XX so the baby be a girl no it be not that simple yes genetically it be a girl but 30 of these case these kid orient towards male so we can not tell the parent what sex the baby be well they have to choose and then we can surgically correct the genitalia you just say there be a 30 margin for error Post op the healing be fast and it leave the genitelia functional all suporte with hormon therapy but what if they choose wrong and the baby orient the other way exactly we should not have they choose the gender now but not do surgery let they raise the baby as a boy or a girl and then when the baby become an adolescent he will make up its own mind that be the problem live in an it everyry sleep over every swim party or lockroom be go to be a cause for panic maybe it should be whatever it be and not what everybody want it to be while I be out I 've be miss all the fun half and half body part Inter sex baby Kinda like worm some people think gender be hardwired so what do we do it be not go to change the outcome I I find that freakish but I be a boy how be your first day back it be perfect now good morning dr King move in with I Cooper I know you care about Violet and the baby and I understand why you want to move in with she but you can still be there for both of they without live at her place Violet be afraid to be alone so I need to be there for her I be your girlfriend and I be here for you and live with Violet do not change that my patience only get so far he be a boy but it could also be a girl my god what be we suppose to do how do we decide well the odd say that your baby will most likely identify as a female so we can do corrective surgery and give the baby the appropriate genitalia you want to take my baby my son and cut off of his penis alternately you can choose the gender now raise the baby and then when he or she mature you reevaluate and hide this for his entire childhood what do we tell he how do we even begin to explain this to a little kid but that not everybody the same that be okay to be different it be not okay kid be cruel one kid see he in the bathroom everyone be talk and tease he and that that be what kid do that be not the life we want we need to make this right we need to put this behind we behind he or she and make it right what be the good way I like woman I like a lot of woman but I be not married to Naomi and she be not the mother of my child Naomi sit by your side while you have surgery she hold your hand you upstairs stick your tongue down her throat see she every day let her believe that you two have something together I think I be die you be you be ask I to lie for you you be make I feel dirty and cheap and I be 10 year old again tell Mother that I go out for ice cream with daddy when really I be sit in his office while he be screw his secretary down the hall I be too much of a snob to screw sretarie you think this be funny I think that you be one to talk I seem to remember something about you do your husband 's good friend behind his back that be once I slip once so you be like you be like an alcoholic you be on a program God grant I the serenity and all that crap you be so mean when you know that I be right you know what I be mean when I want you to mind your own business I will not keep your secret for yes you will Montgomerys look the other way when it be none of their business now there be a sight for sore eye I get patient line up for week wait for you to get back well that be I money in the bank I like money in the bank what I like your brother he be my golden boy you okay yeah I be fine I just I have to see you again this be the fourth time this week well I check your schedule I know you have an opening come on Pete just a quickie I feel like Paul do not share much of himself with I either he hardly want to have sex anymore I get home from work I be tired and you do not seem that interested but when I ask you what be go on you will not talk to I I want to know what be go on with you up here see there be your first mistake think much of anything go on for us guy up here you know what I think Greg I think we guy like woman to think that maybe we think it ourselves but part of that be that we do not look at ourselves do not ask ourselves what we be think or feel exactly I mean the truth be all of we have thing go on inside I mean right now everyone in this room Sheldon and I included have a thousand thing go on and the trick be to open yourself to that and to share it that be not to say of course that there be not piece you want to keep to yourself you do not want to lose yourself in a relationship but the beauty of good communication be that when you share share what you be think good or bad you both feel well maybe help each other Ryan and I use to have that back in high school when we meet we talk about everything and now all you want to talk about be the kid that be not true but I be there with they all day you do not want to know about that that be my world I know it be hard here in the group but talk it really will make thing well I love see you but this have get to stop I can not stay away whatever you do whenever you put your hand on I I swear it be magic it be not magic and it be not I 've be read up a lot on reiki therapy heal hand it be suppose to be incredible let us try it I be not a specialist at reiki I can not do that you can do whatever you want to I as a doctor I can not keep pretend this be okay come on just one more time it be be take care of if you could just file it that would be great you know what we have not be speak for two week I miss you do not treat I like the pervert next door if you live next door we would not be have the problem I want to get past this we need to get past this what be it go to take for you to forgive I I do not know I be work on it we walk past your wall of picture all those kid happy and sweet and normal and that be what our baby should be and surgery can do that Surgery can give your baby gender distinct genitalia yes and we can know we can stop say it Great so let let us do that can we do it soon I can book an o r for tomorrow Afterward we will supplement with estrogen she will be as healthy as possible no that be not what we want it be clear to we from the second we see his face he be he be Matthew but only 30 of these baby orient toward male you say you do not know we know he be our son you be go to give we our son I just see Ryan and Eleanor in the stairwell you mean Ryan and Sasha no I mean Ryan and Eleanor they be communicate lip to lip do they see you no they be too focused I can not believe this maybe it be a cry for help an affair in a stairwell after marriage counseling be a cry for help they have not be able to communicate in their own relationship so they do this awful thing where they could get catch because they want to force the communication only we can not tell on they it be not like they disclose this in session I do not think the waiver apply I be not suggest out they I be just say we get they to tell how be expose an affair go to improve communication so we let the secret keepestering till it poison every aspect of the group it will become the 800 pound gorilla in the room as therapist we need to acknowledge that gorilla and take step to deal with it we do not know what they feel about this we do not know what they think about it they could be in love this could be a onetime thing which be why we need to talk to they what I think as bad as this be get they to confess could be the break through the group need I be surprised that you change your mind about do the surgery well I can help they you know the Thompsons they be desperate to change their situation for they and for the baby and you make a very good case that surgery be the only way to really do that I do but a boy the odd be stack against that Gender 's not my choice it be theirs and they want he past this they want he well and I can help speak of well I be think of borrow Archer for a few day a weekend in Palm Springs you know sleep late get massage what do you think that be a good idea a trip with I no I mean just you know healthwise he he can go back to work but go to a spa be strenuous but I mean you know Archer I mean he be go to want to play golf tennis he will push himself you do not want I to go no I do it be just why rush it because I want to go away with my boyfriend like a woman like a woman with a lover Lover Lover I like that that be a lot well than boyfriend he be my lover what do you think Lover yeah it sound stupid it sound like a soap opera it be not what about paramour Arch come on we be go to be

gene you do not think I want to be well you do not think I want to be a good man in a storm I do not have it in I that be a cop out maybe it be but it be honest do you usually do this have we come in alone Sheldon 's never do this before well sometimes I find thing that be well serve outside the group what be go on I see you in the stairwell yesterday oh god it just happen after the first session Ryan and I we start talk and it be easy everything you say about communication that we could not do with our spouse the two of we could be you go to tell you can not do that can you you might think that keep this a secret be a good thing and that hold it in be well but I think it would be good for both of you to go home talk to your spouse and work together to try to figure this out you come to the group to work on your marriage to make thing well be that still what you want to work on your marriage we want to be together and if tell our spouse be the first step to a new life together we will do it instead of want to save their marriage they be just willing to walk away maybe it be a good thing I mean if it be not work why force it I do not know what be bad to be faithful in a loveless marriage or to cheat to find true love what be we talk about keep secret that be tough keep people 's secret that be why it be well not to I mean if if you care about that person you just tell them bottom line especially in a marriage the bond between a husband and wife be sacrosanct like the bond between a parent and a child how be the Thompson baby I be operate today the parent want a boy and I think it be important to respect that what about what that kid want he be a little young to make that decision I hope you make the right one be you hungry Frustrated Charlotte act like I be cheat on her I mean here I be try to be the good guy all I get be guilt I be I be really not the person you should talk to about this Cooper talk to her we need to talk stop treat I like I 've do something horrible like take care of my friend be cheat on you you do not know you do not know all I 've ever want to do be make you happy I can not do that if you be shut I out please you ready to do

if I can walk she through the attack then I can desensitize she to the memory but then you run the risk of retraumatize she which her body tell I be what be happen you should be careful with a trauma if she be internalize I 've see people get really sick so now you be gang up on I about everything I be do what be good for Jill be there bump along the way but in the end it be good that she know now

but I can not stand force she to do something that she do not want to do you really think you can help she I know it be hard watch she but I think if I operate there be a chance she will make it a chance you do not think she should have the surgery I do not wanna this be your decision I be ask you please I think even in the good case scenario it be month in a hospital constant drug therapy and intervention and this be not about a cure however consider the alternative wait a minute go on Dr Cooper I want to know what you think I think Annie have consider the alternative and even though it terrify we for her the alternative mean have a life a real life like other kid even if it be just for a little while you know play outside and maybe go surfing and instead of spend her life in that little room we have down the hall it mean celebrate her birthday somewhere other than here in the future we will be able to treat people with Annie 's condition much more effectively she do not have the perspective to understand that because she be still a kid you can not put a decision like this in her hand if the surgery work what will her quality of life be it be hard to know she will be limit in her activity you will need to keep her home mostly but with medication we can sustain her heart she will be alive for how long I want to take her home wait you be the one from the scrub room I do not realize 'cause of the hair I have this image of it in my head you know under the cap and you do not recognize I but red Red be good Red become you thank you look I be sorry I be I be have a day I get some bad news and then I 've get this patient another doctor have convince her parent to let she die which I think I know be the wrong decision anyway it be a a day you ever do that you ever worry over a patient absolutely I be worry over this pregnant woman right now Charlotte King be that your name no she be the chief of staff here right I know that you should talk to her if you believe your patient should live then you should fight for it and Charlotte I mean she be Charlotte but she she will help you fight thank you no problem I should go see Charlotte right of course if you see the man who assault you please identify he by state aloud his reference number take as much time as you need 5 you 've indicate suspect number 5 be you sure that be the man who attack you I be sure 5 all right miss Avery thank you for your cooperation you do it the face see it again it be it be okay he can not hurt you anymore I think it would be good I think it would help I remember what he do to I

sec Catheter be not come out today what Dr Barnes approach I he feel he can save Annie 's life and that you be let a minor make a decision about refuse treatment the family and I concur on this what be you do he have a valid claim he be go for a court order why be you talk to I like that like what like I be some strange I could 've let he sandbag you I do not I be give you a head up still like a stranger and you know I you know I would not be do this for she if I do not think it be right come on I be just do my job that do not make it right there be definitely flirt with the surgeon cute surgeon cute surgeon it feel to feel like I again can I steal some of those colored paper clip on your desk for an art project that Betsey 's do she be in a trance Resort porn look at this you can watch whale breach just right from your palapa when be you go this be not for I this be for Sam and Sonya you be plan a trip for your ex husband and his new girlfriend you realize how weird that sound of course I do it be ju look at this place somebody should be enjoy it without the surgery Annie die without the surgery Annie have a life at least for a little while there be a number of precedent that deal with the denial of medical treatment to child but they primarily involve the religious conviction of the parent this be not a religious thing judge it be about give our little girl what she really want look this be as painful a decision as anyone can face I understand why the bishop do not want to make it but by give in to what their child want and she be a child they be abdicate their parental responsibility do I get a say here I be sorry but you do not but it be my life but legally your parent be responsible for make decision about your medical care and you should know that state law prohibit you from act in any way that endanger Annie 's health you be go to force they to make Annie undergo the surgery that catheter stay in and the surgery be schedule for the first available date that be not fair that be not fair I have not see you in a while I lighten my surgical schedule I have some personal stuff Finishing or start start you I too I miss you I should not say that but I do miss you why should not you say that I just I do not know I should go back in there before the baby come out without I and I get sue still nothing only his face I can not remember anything else how be I suppose to testify against he if I can not remember anything about what happen the trial be a month away you have time you will remember and then what I can see what he do to I again and again because right now all I see be his face and I see it everywhere at the store on the boy who pack my grocery at the gym every guy in the corridor every time I go anywhere I see he and at night in my dream we can stop we can work on help you cope with where you be today I want to put he away I need this fear to go away I be go to insert the needle now you might feel a slight pinch wait before you do it I just need for you to talk to I about anything just to get my mind off this let us see we can talk about you know you say you be not have sex why not you be beautiful successful I be kind of in between guy right now anybody you get your eye on there be this one guy Cute very Details I be on bed rest and be deny sex I need some detail he be a good guy I do not know he that well or anything but you can just tell you know he be a good guy and I need a good guy any date I do not know he be it be like he want to ask I out but I do not know it be like there be something hold he back or go after he get yours and then tell I all about it if something happen you will be the first to know I hear the wave be 2 to 4 foot great shape one of the guy in the office surfs say it be great out there today maybe I do not know can not see it from here I know I be sorry when I think that one day I could be out there do it myself it be fun to think about but now come on Annie we both know the truth I be go to die in this hospital you sign off on the junction now you be tell I you just want I to let she die I be do my job I be follow the law but maybe Cooper 's right keep she alive be not the same as save her life I be sorry Annie can not go to school or go surf but be the chance to do that for a month or two be that worth give up the chance at live past 13 she be get nothing leave in her not even the will to fight you so maybe you should ask yourself who be you do this for she still have not do the amnio maybe you should just do that charm thing you people do you be charming I be think about it in psychological circle we call that a stall Jill have a very tough session today I be wonder if you could do something to help she relax do not touch I it be I it be Pete Focus on I look at I it be Pete take a deep breath you be here you be okay she be rest thank you have to stop she be traumatize by the attack she be afraid that if she do not finish what she start then this thing will keep haunt she so I be go to support she in that Jill be a wreck she be fall apart she be happy she have a life he come in and take a piece of it away her contentment her security and until she see this guy lock up and pay for what he do she be not go to move past it I hope you be right you be here late you know baby do not tell time besides you be here too do you think we push as doctor do you think we push too hard I do not know I mean I have this patient now she be pregnant and just just try to get she through it so she can have a healthy baby I push you know for patient like she because she need I to what about when they do not need you to be you okay I think I 've be push too hard I do not know just sit here with I do you realize that we do not even know each other 's name you be right I be Addison Montgomery I have to I have to go I have a patient Nice to meet you Betsey 's sick her school just call do you mind if I duck out for like an hour Heather can not get she that be fine go ahead what be you do do not this trip look perfect for who you do see what you be do I be help you be avoid Archer break your heart and now you be throw yourself into Sam 's life so you do not have to pick up and start yours do not take this the wrong way but when be the last time you go on a date Come on maybe if you spend all this time and effort you be spend on Sam and Sonya on yourself it might be more rewarding you here to force another procedure on she or I will not push the surgery anymore if she do not want it I will not push what about the judge I tell he I reevaluate my position I just want to help she so once it be out it be not easy to get back in if Annie be to have a problem we might not be able to get medication into her fast enough you do understand this be it you sure I be sure it be all right mom I promise it be all right Everything be go to be okay you will see I be go to see the ocean you be go to see the ocean Good news Amnio be

respect you be out of line what be wrong we be leave thank you what have you say to she so you believe Dr Allen 's diagnosis and treatment be appropriate under the circumstance More than appropriate Extraordinary Martin Weiser come into the e r with crush chest pain hypoxic barely responsive when the patient progress to full cardiopulmonary arrest Dr Allen do c p r and defibrillation exactly as indicate exactly as any doctor would do so in your expert opinion Dr Bennett be there mistake make here even when we do everything right and I believe Dr Allen do there be some patient we just can not save now that be not malpractice that be that be just life thank you Doctor I be sorry Dr Bennett I be Corinne Lee I be counsel for mr Weiser 's widow and his son every person be unique a good doctor need to know they to evaluate they individually not by the book the book can be wrong excuse I but be there a question somewhere here be you familiar with that quote Dr Bennett that be a quote from my book but do not it contradict what you be just say about mr Weiser 's care you quote textbook case and standard protocol but you be not there you do not actually see he be not that correct I stand behind everything I say about Dr Allen 's care so you do not mean what you write I do I spend a lot of time research and writing do that leave you much time for see actual patient I have a very active medical practice Oceanside Wellness Group there be a measle outbreak there do you follow the book on that one Objection Argumentative Dr Bennett be hold himself up as an expert I be entitle to question he on that claim overrule the measle outbreak a child die again argumentative Withdrawn be the note cyclist Ray Daniels a patient under your care yes he be he have a serious heart muscle disorder but you let he compete in a 100 mile bike race and he die as well do not he I tell he not to race but you treat he for a sport injury so that he could race see Ray be pigheade pigheade do you

I and well two year ago your patient have a hernia patch up it be just a quick 20 minute procedure they give he morphine for for the pain he be not my patient two year ago I know but morphine be overkill they would 've just give he a non steroidal anti inflammatory unless he be allergic to aspirin now the aspirin sensitivity would 've would 've be flag on the chart but it be not right I know it be not because see the page be blank now every other page be fill out meticulously this page be blank you you change out the page see that would explain why you could not revive he you give he aspirin and he be it be not just a heart attack I have a barely responsive patient with severe chest pain I be race against the clock by the time that file come down I be lose he I could not afford to wade through his whole medical history no doctor would 've have time probably not but you could 've testify to that I would 've back you up and I would 've lose everything jury do not care that we see aspirin sensitivity in what one out of every thousand patient they would just hear the word mistake and nothing else would get by do duncan know about this he would not have be able to put I on the stand to say something he know be not true Dr Bennett please you want I to lie for you I want you to speak fully and honestly about how I handle that code now I have to make a series of judgment call and I do what any good doctor would 've what you would 've you want I to lie they be not go to ask about that file I be good at what I do I save life please I be come I be suppose to Cooper 's not back yet you go to tell I the problem you be right I be jealous ' m not jealous like I want to be with he I be just jealous like I do not want to see he with anybody else which be crazy and unfair Crazy but it make sense give what you two have may have I know but it be Pete it be it be sleep with the temp Pete sleep with anything pete I be bad in a relationship Pete good people do bad thing bad people do bad thing I would kill for some whip cream People change when they be with the right person they can change I sleep with Archer Montgomery when thing be rocky with Cooper and I Coop know he forgive I of course he be go to forgive you he have a neurotic desire to rescue which make he susceptible to hostile dependency I confide in you to make a point about Pete and maybe you want a little catharsis you want a professional to tell you that it be okay it be not okay you think if I need absolution which I do not I would seek out someone who sleep with two man one floor apart and do not have the courage or the decency to figure out let alone tell they whose baby she be carry everybody be have sex everybody governor they get call girl girl sell their virginity on the internet not a celebrity in this town go out with their underpant on but it be my 12 year old patient who pay the price how be that fair I be go to bed I be keep this you savor the end of a good day or drown out a bad one the doctor that I be the expert witness for do something wrong so you have to testify to that the thing that he do the other side do not know about that be the irony they know that there be

pregnancy be make your heart work hard which be why Janine I think that you need to consider termination Janine at 20 week the baby can not survive and we need to relieve some of the pressure on your heart until we find a new one she kick she kick I she be alive in there please we can not take that kind of risk Janine I want this baby as much as you but we need to buy you more time you be not

well Bobby be a minor this be statutory rape she should not have sleep with her student all right absolutely not but he be go to be 18 in what like a month you speak to he it be consensual I mean he

either of they if I report this she be go to lose her job her credential he be go to end up humiliate he will be a rock star Mary Kay Letourneau hot that boy be 13 year old so by comparison Sam 's patient 's do nothing wrong what 17 year old have not want to sleep with one of his teacher Donna be in a position of power and she abuse that why assume a 17 year old be not mature enough to know what he want because he be be force to grow up too quickly to to make decision about his life that he be just not ready to make think about yourself at 17 I be mature all right Heather be not but thank you Naomi for the free therapy all right if this be Maya and a 35 year old male gym teacher well I would kill he but that be not the look I know that there be a double standard here but it be different when it be a girl it it be it should not be look I hate abuse but I do not think that be what we be deal with here Donna be not a criminal now as long as she do not see he again that be all we want be not it even if she get the new heart he will not look after her he be not go to take care of her you be talk about Phillip he send I in his place who do that even now he be in the lobby on his Blackberry this be his baby his wife he should be here for her you know there still be not a heart but Janine be at the top of the list I 've also get a call in to the head of U N o S Janine 's blood type o so be I it be the most common it should not be so hard that work in her favor but organ donation be a difficult process Supply can not meet the demand I want to do something if I could give she my heart we be go to find you one how long do Janine and the baby have to find a heart before they die 48 hour be not that someone else 's job I can not stop Nesting I see mess or clutter or thing out of place she seem nice Lisa and her kid be cute yeah I like they what what be wrong I just I hate it that you be maybe carry my baby and I do not tell she do you think you should you think I should not you be happy and I be all for full disclosure but do you think you should tell she something before there be anything to tell sorry Pete be you two in the middle of a just finish be those for I no for I from a patient she be in love with I her name be Anita I start treat she a few month ago she be painfully shy she want I to help she be more assertive with a coworker she have fall in love with you know she she do not know how to talk to he and as she realize how easy it be to talk to you she channel her love to you Classic transference clearly you do not have to say it like that like what like a woman could not fall in love with I unless it be a therapeutic mistake I do not say that I can be very charming you know I know well I be just say that that it happen that it be part of the process be you have your own feeling this be not about countertransference I mean grant my love life be at well complicated right now but I just want to talk to a colleague I guess go on record if nothing else but also to see if you have any secret I hate to fail I think you will not fail she be lucky to have you Sheldon and can you really blame her Dell I be go out for lunch so if my 2 00 get here before I do will you just put she in a room for I what else would I do later we be go to have a talk and I mean a come to Jesus talk you be not my mother Naomi you be not even my boss everybody 's patience be wear thin Dell what hey Naomi will not push this I will leave take the day get it together Dell I would just find out about Bill 's affair from his e mail there be lot of e mail from different woman and picture they be all so young and I be feel old and insecure and Bobby he just got ansferre into my class the way he look at I it just it just make I feel well he would find reason to stay after and I would help he with his homework when we want a break we would just start talk for hour I try to get he to focus on girl his own age he keep come back to I I know but you be the adult you should 've stop he I love he look I know it be wrong but when I think something be go to happen to he in the hospital this be a crime and we should be report it yeah bottom line you can not see he anymore if you do yeah do not okay I hate heart transplant you be basically wait for someone to die to save the person who you want to live it be horrible to have to sit and wait and sit and not be in control you can only do so much and if you 've get a baby a baby who could die you be content to just chalk it all up to fate then it be on I exactly we be the ultimate narcissist Life and death be all up to we no wonder so many doctor be insufferable be I I think you be one of the good one when they bring he in I recognize he and I page you it be Phillip Janine 's husband he be comatose no corneal reflex Type 2 diabetic Tox screen be negative what happen Glucose be initially less than 10 look like an insulin overdose e e g show no evidence of any brain activity he be brain dead oh my God do you think what he be an organ donor can I help you I be fine thank you I like the atmosphere open friendly comfortable what be you do here I tell you I be not interested I figure I would check out exactly what you be hold on to well that be not a very good idea so because of the other Dr Bennett I read his book do not worry as far as he know I be a patient I doubt he think that I be try to get you pregnant and you should go Lunch tomorrow you be push I be a man who know what he want be not you popular these day what the guy you be just talk to no he be just he be a patient so good night Sam good night I can not I can not breathe I can not think what be I go to do without Phillip Janine I know this be unthinkably hard and none of we could possibly imagine it it be awful but I need you to focus right now I need you to focus on the baby that you be carry the baby that you and Phillip create because if you do not do this you both could die my husband be dead and you want I to take his heart to save myself to save both of you I can not how could I Janine listen to I it be hard for anyone to fathom but the heart be a machine a heart be tissue that provide a

I do not it do not matter who bring it up okay because we be both go to hell what I feel guilty I feel awful which be why I should tell she you know this this will destroy her life but at least it will be honest and she deserve the truth we could be together think about that we could be together I covet you I covet you I be not the kind of guy who fight I just do not see the point to it and the time I 've try it you hurt your knuckle you do not really feel well it do not solve anything and I guess I be at heart just a pacifist 'cause I think fighting be stupid I think war be wrong and take up arm for some cause just lack nobility in today 's world so I be not the kinda guy who fight but I should 've fight for you I should 've fight for you Violet and I do not really know how else to say it except I want your kid whether it be mine or not and I want your body whether it be pregnant or not and I want your heart whether I have to fight for it or not and I should 've fight for it but I be confuse and angry and scare so I be fight now because I love you and I think we can be something I think we can be a family I be I be fat and overdue and tired and cranky no pete I be sorry this be not what I want Year ago I be stalk a man who want nothing to do with I and now I be turn two good man down do I hate myself be it I be it be I the problem do you think you be the problem oh that be very therapeutic make the patient answer her own question and now I be avoid it okay do you think one of they Pete or Sheldon do you think that could work you have to answer that one I do not know Cooper well Dr Turner hi no one be up front it be time for my appointment right I think your focus need to be on damage control First you want to mitigate pain and suffering so approach each woman separately about a settlement Offer to cover all medical expense and make a large lump sum payment in exchange for release all claim and sign a confidentiality agreement you need to show these woman that someone have pay for the mistake you need to fire Dell no Dell be like family and we do not even know that this be his fault you want to defend he Fine but I do not believe that this be you Dell be family but if save the practice mean cut he loose then be you fire I no but for now you be behind a desk phone and mail only but I have patient I be deliver Violet 's baby Dell it be it be just for now so I speak with Dr Wilder and we have some concern be it a boy or a girl your baby Katie your medication be a very important part of manage your delusional disorder it be important that you keep take it do she kick much I be sorry you be voice your concern and I be not answer I be take my med I do not want thing to go back to the way they be Dr Turner it be crazy I be crazy I be take my med and I be feel great can I touch it I do not think that be a good idea Ka the baby 's move oh it be a smart baby you can just tell be it a boy or a girl so you agree she be of her med yeah I think she be off her med I think she be lie about it I do not have any proof I would like to 51 50 her I just I I think she be on the edge I get a bad feeling about this you can not commit someone on a feeling but it really creep I out the way she be look at I Pete 's right you can not commit someone on a feeling what if the delusion be ampe up again what if she be just happy she be do grieve I know happiness when I see it what you know happiness when it be offer to you we be talk about Katie she may just be happy she be not happy I know happy I want to apologize for this morning do not no you do

Addison I insult she this morning after you leave I be feel insecure about you and I insult she I just hope she will still deliver our baby you do not do anything of course I be still go to deliver your baby Family be the most important thing and nothing should get in the way of that William I be I be so flattered by the offer but something happen today a very serious medical error and my practice be under fire so I be I be no long a good candidate the measure of a person be not the mistake they make it be how they respond to they I want you I guess I be just go to have to sell you a little hard may I get you another drink while you wait Noah be go to leave his wife for I and I stop he and I hate that I stop he and I hate myself for feel that way who would 've think that you would

will give you Betsey maybe I be not mean to be a mother maybe I be not mean to be happy I do not I do not believe that be true I think everybody be mean to be happy it be easy for you to say you be about to have a baby this be not what you want I know that Amelia but you could carry this child and give it up and then become a mother another way NaomI 's right there be other way my happiness it be right here it be right in front of I I can not fathom let it go I do not know maybe you and Sheldon be right maybe I do not know how to be happy for a long time I 've be at baseline just alive

Naomi if we be not go to replace she I think we should at least have a talk about buy out her share I be think the same thing and I come up with a figure I be think about make the suggestion today you know what even without add someone we could still have another surgeon at the practice you the nanny have a cold I do not want Lucas to get it not that bring a baby to a medical practice be a great way to stave off germ but I will keep he out of the way he will be fine have a good day oh it be you we miss you around here you okay she cry and she hold on to my leg and I hate it when she cry we be talk about Betsey right it be her first day at a new school she be go to be okay right I know I just get back to work but do you mind if I take off early check on her Sure whatever you need it be time my contraction be a few minute apart I be go into labor let us get you to a room welcome back he do not even look at I that be not true it feel like you do not look at I it be just ever since the rape it be okay to say it sometimes that can help I think if you could work on say it I do not want to keep bring it up she be you think if you do not bring it up I be go to forget it happen that be the thing it be there it happen and if you be not able to deal with what Collette go through then you and she be not go to be able to move forward together I will see you next week meet I by the elevator

clinic day at the shelter and I 've recruit Coop and Sam to come down there with I so you do not need I I just figure that I be see patient I be fine listen by the way since we be all here there be something we need to discuss since we decide not to replace Naomi we need to buy out her share what do we need to do we each need to put in 50 000 to the practice and then we will be equal partner 50 grand check okay check be perfect I could do mine come on guy it be an investment in our future sure whatever you need it be fine so if we can just get check by the end of the day I will get all the paperwork roll I will write mine right now we have tampon condom and a sample of birth control pill so we hitch here about a month ago from Portland I try out Seattle and Tacoma but I realize if you be go to be homeless you might as well be warm you know it would be great if you and Elliot could get checkup more often there be medi cal you need document and I D I could help you track down your document you know what it be okay we will make it how old be you 15 and there be no one no family well I get a mom she be out of the picture if I want to keep my baby I have to leave but we be good

can I take a look at you come on now when we get do you want to go to the park let I see here how long have he have this the rash a few day maybe it be not something serious be it we should probably get he back to the practice do an e k G now I be so sure it be time it will be you just you just have to wait your first patient back false alarm though I hear about Lucas that he be yours congratulation do you have a minute I need to get a CVS test do there see tiny aneurysm on his coronary artery blood vessel to his heart be inflame so it be kawasaki syndrome it explain the erythematous rash so this kid be homeless with a heart condition so we treat it with immunoglobulin it could help but it be not a definitive repair but it be the first line of treatment right what his mother can not even afford a place to live and now she be go to have a son that could continue to get sick I be worried I would like to do more like what I could fix it a bypass procedure I know you just do surgery wait it be an amazing surgery yes but there be a process you can not just jump back into surgery overnight the boy have a heart problem a heart problem that you and I both know nobody else will touch because there be no money in it you be jump the gun on this maybe I be but I look at she and she should be in school with Maya and she be not she be not she be alone and it be wrong can we run her social get an address try to try to call the mother we do not know the situation she may be a runaway but she could 've be abuse or molest we be not go to put she in danger but she be a kid on the street in over her head with a sick baby not everyone be rich with a perfect life what do that mean I do not it just mean we I do not know let us find the mom you guy what why be we here do something I be pregnant ty and there be you be pregnant so I be go to be a father this be great this be what we want I know it be be awful I 've be awful but it be like a new start baby we run a

we 've be try for so long to have a baby and this be not how I imagine it could happen but this could be our chance our chance you be think about have he after that pig do you r after he rape you there I say it he rape you and you want he inside you for another nine month Naomi ask I to come down upstairs for a consult do you mind watch Lucas I be sorry I be in the middle of a situation that husband just find out his wife be pregnant by her rapist I be way behind in patient note you have time Lucas will not be insult if you do a little work while he be visit if Violet ask I be here to consult on a case for you what be I an excuse for so I can leave the baby with her Come on I have to do something I figure if I bring Lucas to work she would be force to see he and maybe I do not know that force she to bond with the baby be go to be such a good idea I do not expect a miracle but maybe if she just get curious something to remind she that she have a son with I be I crazy trust I Chocolate cure almost everything this place be nice you 've do well it be nice it be a little quiet Quiet 's good Quiet be fine Quiet be professional but it be I do not know it be a little weird everyone be always hole up in their office work and I just kinda I feel like they treat I like the boss exactly you be on my turf you have turf Work be turf you 've get Violet you 've get Lucas I be out of the picture and I be deal with it but you be here at my work that be not part of my program I will ask you to leave please it be okay I will talk to you later Turf I be fine just work my way through the grieve process Denial never last very long with I the anger do but I be past it and frankly I be too busy with work to be depress and as far as acceptance go well screw acceptance but really I feel fine you want to eat some chocolate with I do you always stuff your feeling with food interesting I find the mother Danielle 's mother that be great I have get Sam and Violet 's check I can get yours too and get it in the account right now it be for the practice for our practice I need to get the check by by the end of the day do you need until later in the week a little later in the week a little later in the week what what Cooper not everyone have a 30 million trust fund forget it that be a lot of tube be they hurt he no the tube be not hurt he that be how he get his medicine he be never stay a night away from I and if I be not back at the shelter by 8 00 you can stay in there with he we will get you all set up I will speak to the nurse we will see what the med do I really think that surgery would be a well option not until the mom get here I call she the mom she be on her way be I an ass a callous oblivious ass what exactly be we talk about here Cooper call you an ass he yell at I about money that what what nothing it be just you be a rich kid you grow up with money you never have to worry about it the rest of we it be not so easy but we be all doctor I mean you back I on this because it be what we need to do for the practice and it just so happen that I could write the check so I be an ass you could be a little bit more sensitive Kind of like because you be this world class surgeon you do not see how tell I I can not operate on this kid might be cut my leg from underneath I I do not well you do what be go on right now Faucet drip be go on all night it be drive I bonker you decide to tear up my bathroom new marble counter hardwood floor recess lighting you sweep I off my foot and drag I here but do not expect I to live in a manhole bulldoze my bathroom to avoid go to work and deal with your problem be not cool this be so not cool what be you do home so early hangdog look we be two pea in a pod now there be dry rot that be a mess Receipts be on the table you can write I a check for what to pay for all this damn it you really should not have do this no contraction just like this morning but I feel it it be all right here and she be due my daughter a week overdue and I be about to pick she up from school it will happen when it be suppose to but what if something bad happen when I get home like she end up breeched or I have she in the tub and she drown your baby will be fine how can you be sure my husband be not around I have ton of question I need answer I pay for the midwife experience and you have not be around let us let us go over some of your question you just leave Lucas sit there he have not cry but he be awake do not you want to pick he up and play with he I be work I be at work work you be his mother Charlotte be take out her problem on my bathroom she need to be stop so I need to hide this here before I just can not let she destroy anything else why be we stare at the floor I 've be try for week to get the blood out of the wood and nothing work I 've try every brand that be my fifth bottle so if Charlotte be rape and end up get pregnant by her rapist and decide to keep the baby that would be a deal breaker for you do not hypothetically rape my girlfriend I do not the couple the woman that be rape want to keep she the rapist 's baby she want to keep the baby that be just crazy right I think I be go to tell she it be crazy I know it be not my job to make decision for people but it be not fair Pediatricians you get to diagnose you get to tell people what to do I be suppose to just sit back and let people figure it out help they figure it out right the point be it be wrong right right I think do you actually write Addison a check do you think it be work yeah maybe a little how could she look at this face and not melt she be not look I be out of idea be I not clear I realize you be not a train therapist but I would think that a doctor such as yourself would understand boundary this be my battle not yours we be not battle Sheldon Naomi 's my friend no my friend I call Naomi what no he get the girl he get the baby I get you you be my friend now get off our floor I will just I will see

we be perfect but but I be have a baby and you really think that you be up to put yourself through this maybe what you do not think I be I know you want to have a child but do you understand what life be go to be like see that baby every day every time you see it it be go to be like a recording play over and over in your mind so you will remember lie there feel helpless you will remember he stand over you and touch you you will remember scream your lung out scream until you be hoarse hope and pray that somebody will come and find you but nobody be come and then come the unbearable pain and then you feel yourself pass out but before you do you wonder if you will ever wake up again and part of you hope that you never will so all of that all of that will be stare at you every day do you really think that you can look at that oh my God oh my God oh my God one of the aneurysm must have rupture this do not make any sense that medicine that you give I you say it would work we want it to work the last thing we want to do be put you and Elliot through anything more than we have to but you can fix he there be a few thing we could do for Elliot one of which be bypass surgery that be where we take a vein that go around the damage vessel or we could insert a stent what be a stent that be experimental in kid his age we put a tiny tube in the vessel to keep it open they both sound good what be I suppose to do Bypass surgery it be the right treatment he need it and I will do it I will do the surgery that sound good I trust you you do the surgery can I see Elliot Sure I will take

to play python in the forest I be go to stand up very slowly now would you let go you really want I to no come on I be really late I want this Cooper I want to join the practice I have to go you feel sick now but you get on the stand and just look straight at the prosecutor only at he that be what I do okay you do not have to do this if you do not want to no I do I do I want to Violet Turner sorry I be late please raise your right hand do you solemnly swear to tell the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth Dr Turner it be customary to say I do I can not do this I can not do it Saison 03 Episode 05 strange bedfellow any word on the trial no not yet but Violet 's on the stand all day oh I hear back from Stan Parsons Ooh and he be happy where he be Stan really would 've fit in well here we could use another ortho guy yeah well we could use any doctor at this point look what if just keep an open mind here what if we just go with Charlotte you can not seriously think that she would fit in here she be skilled she be connect she be a specialty we do not have what happen why be you back she refuse to testify do you try to talk to she about it I try well she need support Cooper it be hard I know it be hard and I be support she but she will not talk to I about it she will not talk to I either and she will not talk to Pete so look like it be your turn if she will not talk to they she be not go to talk to I what the hell be you do here no they tell we that you would leave the practice they promise we that you would leave the practice you people lie to we Zoe you have this all wrong I do not work here anymore you screw up our implantation and then you force we to carry each other 's baby I be sorry just sit I have high blood pressure that be why you be here the appointment be for I our obstetrician think there might be something wrong with the baby which one Mine sorry the the baby that I be carry her son it get a little confusing sometimes Dr Carey say that we need a consult surgical and the only one he would recommend be you while you be here we will go ahead and get your blood pressure check Zoe why do not you come on back I be sorry that I blow up I I think I be okay with everything but it it be be hard my pregnancy Amelia 's pregnancy and then see Naomi again I just something be wrong be not it give I a second Dr Carey deflect all my question I will not do that oh my god what be it it be a teratoma it be a kind of tumor sometimes when the stem cell differentiate into cartilage bone or flesh they end up where they do not belong and in this case the tumor be large enough that it be take over the baby 's blood supply what I would like to do be operate try to separate the tumor from the fetus and will that fix it it be not that simple sometimes it work sometimes it do not work but without surgery the baby will die this be Amelia 's last embryo so I have to tell you that if I do the surgery I will need to perforate the uterus sometimes that can affect your ability to carry another child I know it be an awful choice you will want to talk it over with your husband with Amelia uh no Martin leave he never like it the have each other 's baby thing and he he do not understand the bond between Amelia and I it be it be like both baby belong to both of we I can not do it Martin will come back and we 've always want a big family I just can not then I would recommend terminate the pregnancy my god what will that do to Amelia and if we do nothing it be go to die in the womb then I think I should let it and get Amelia far along I can not have she think that I just give up I think that it be well for she to think that it be an act of god whenever it happen this be Amelia 's baby she have the right to know it be in my body and I be your patient you can not tell she without my permission you can not tell she you look like somebody shred you do you talk to Violet again no no I just remind I never ever to go upstairs again no I do not talk to Violet I do not know what to say to her you go to have another run at her Nope I be do I try I push I have no effect on her so if she want to let Katie walk Katie be not go to walk away from this no but the defense will line up expert who will say she be crazy be not she not guilty by reason of insanity be not guilty and Katie be guilty six month in a nut farm some med a little therapy after what she do that be unacceptable you do not know how long it be go to be she could be in there for year I get on the stand and tell they about the wound the blood the baby go think Violet be dead but unless Violet tell the jury what it be like unless they hear it from her but if Violet be go to be too traumatized then she will just keep be stick she will never be Violet and I will still have a son whose mother can not bring herself to care about he she be miss everything the little sound he make when he smile the way his eye try to take in the whole world at once it be just go to take time she can have as much as she want I be do Cooper put you up to this we be all concerned for you why do it matter if I testify or not why should I have to sit there and relive it why be I the only person who can make sure Katie gets punish it be not about Katie it be about you that be right it be about I so sit there for 8 10 hour a day on the stand with Katie stare at I that would be like live through it all over again be not you do that anyway and do not shrink always say it be good to talk well what do shrink know I know face she will be hard be on the same planet with she be hard we could all chip in and get her one of those guest trip to the space station one way we could probably get a discount if it be one way right Dr Turner there be someone here to see you who be it a Mr Kent he say to tell he be Katie 's father could you give we a second please all right Violet if you have a patient in this situation would you tell your patient to face it or to run away all right you see that chair I be go to be sit in it if you need help you look at I you blink and I will come ride to the rescue you can still blink can not you can you when Dr Wilder testify what he find to hear it be horrify I can not apologize to you enough you help she well if that be true we would not be sit here no she could not stop talk about you how you just know you know that all she want be to have her baby and be not sick anymore she tell I I be go to be so proud of her she say you will see dad I be go to be just like mom if that jury send she to prison she will disappear this illness will eat she alive why be you here Katie want to see you she want to talk to you she say you be the only person who understand Violet talk to you yeah I guess she be just ready but to you do you want to hear what she have to say or not she do not want to testify because she be terrify of face Katie that be the revelation we be interrupt Katie 's father show up why what do he want I do not know but when he leave she go and hide in the lady room you get a minute yeah just in one minute I be talk to Sam we be just in the middle of a it will only take a second I be a damn fine doctor with an establish patient base and as I make clear I have great idea for expand it I have the cash to buy in I be chief of staff at St Ambrose so I can steer you so many heart surgery you will beg for mercy why be you stall because I just do not think you be the right fit here you know we be all friend we respect each other we get along I guess that would be why Naomi and Pete could not get outta here fast enough we need someone who be great with patient someone who be great with staff someone 's who calm you want Naomi I do not want to be mean but I just do not like you good grief what do that have to do with anything excuse I I need to talk to you about Amelia and Zoe this place be a kindergarten if somebody be offer you something you need do not you just grab at it instead of whine about your delicate feeling what on god 's green earth do feeling have to do with anything it be good for you or it be not you agree with I Sure something need do you just do it otherwise what good be you it be Amelia 's baby ethically it do not matter it be in Zoe 's body Zoe 's my patient I can not breach confidentiality I hate this I hate that this baby be sick I hate that Zoe will not let I even try to fix it that I be lie to Amelia that Naomi 's catch up in this again we be all catch up in it if this baby die then the settlement go out the window it be base on these two woman bring these baby to term and then switch if that can not happen then we be face a malpractice suit so no lie to Amelia will only make it bad I know that I try to get Zoe to change her mind look Naomi know they do not even think it you see how hostile Zoe be do not bring Naomi in I just mean to ask she if litigation start again they smell that Naomi 's be involve they will go after her first they will go after her first so nobody know what Katie 's father say to Violet except Violet and she be not talk except to Sam and not about that I do not get a babysitter to talk about Violet what do you want to talk about anything but that we could talk about Charlotte my benefactor you upset because she pay your way I love be emasculate okay no Violet talk and no Charlotte talk you want to bet on the game if you lose do I collect from Charlotte if you could 've see her face who know Charlotte have feeling thank that help a lot you can not tell your friend 's girlfriend that you do not like she I know I try to dodge she but she back I into a corner and keep on tell I all the reason why we should hire she and we should hire her you do not actually like she I like her check I like that hire she would make Cooper happy I like that we would be move forward in at least one area and I like her specialty it could be good for business look we have a problem she be our solution all right fine let us just get it over with hey up here oh I be interrupt I be just leave really Amelia come to see I this afternoon I be surprised too give what happen this morning but she think there be something wrong with the baby and she think that you and Zoe be lie to she about it I know I be suppose to be out of this but she look like she be about ready to explode so be she right be you lie to her there be a problem that we can not tell you about okay how serious be it can it be correct this be ridiculous we be play 20 question they be Naomi 's patient like it or not we be all in this we either all sink or we all swim it be a sacrococcygeal teratoma and it be on the baby that Zoe 's carrying can not that be operate on I would like to try but Zoe say no well that can not be the end of it I know you do not want I involve not a good beginning of a sentence Amelia come to I and I have to do something Zoe 's mad but she be my patient and I do know she so get I into a room with she and maybe I can get she to change her mind you guy have to let I try thank you for come I be on my med I be myself I 've hear that so you want to see I how be you Dr Turner I be I be so sorry please tell I you know it be not I who do that to you please tell I you know that why so that I will know you understand that I be not a monster that be why you want to see I that and I want you to testify when Dr Wilder be on the stand the jury look at I like I be a monster and you think my testimony would counteract that I think if you testify the juror will know they will know that I be crazy that night and you will avoid prison I will not get help in prison I will slip I will be crazy again I do not ever want to be crazy again I be scared I be scared of that that person who do that it be it be not about avoid punishment it be just I need help I need someone on my side you gutte I like a pig you rip my baby out of my body you leave I there to bleed to death and now I should be on your side I should care about how sorry you be I should give a damn about what happen to you you make my life hell you make I crazy and now you want a free pass from I please Dr Turner please Dr Turner please thank you for agree to see I I know how angry you be and how much you blame I and rightfully so I do not want your apology Dr Montgomery say that you have something that you need to say to I so why do not you just say it Amelia come to see I you tell Amelia no I tell you I would not Amelia come to I she know you be hide something she know that there be something wrong with the baby so now you want to atone by talk I into something that I do not want to do when all this happen I do not want to talk you into keep the baby all I want be for you to see thing from all side it be not about I this be so you could feel as okay with what be go to happen as you possibly could give what we do to you give what I do to you what I do to you I be not the one who change your mind it be Amelia and it be you know that it be the good thing give the circumstance if the situation be the other way around would not you want to know do not you see it be the other way around this be my baby too they be both mine they be both hers if I tell she now tell she that I be go to end this pregnancy it will be bad for her her blood pressure she be already at risk for eclampsia I may lose both baby we will lose both or I could do the surgery at least try if you be go to choose not to have the surgery then you be go to have to let Addison end the pregnancy if you ever want to be pregnant again it be the safe choice and that mean tell Amelia okay I will tell she but you have to explain to she why the surgery can not be do you can not put that on I about Charlotte she be in a bitch of a mood when I get home last night

pretty fabulous be not it no that you would bring a cat for a visit it be very nice of you maybe you be a cat person after all I know you think you be pay I a compliment but I do not think so no oh actually I be hope it would flatter you enough that you would have coffee with I you be ask I out on a date as we walk to our terminally ill patient 's room I be an oncologist I be always walk to a terminally ill patient 's room I ask where I can when I can or I would never get to ask yes to coffee ah you know what can you just hold this for a minute sure hey milo hello milo there we go how be his hair Perfect okay bud I be sorry she be afraid of course she be afraid she be feel good she be feel well she do not want to lose that so how do we break through we do not that be it she be block out jimmy you think there be a big mystery about he and we just give she jell o she find a magic bullet pete and what about jimmy if you be right about he he could be dangerous if not then be it fair that he suddenly become nobody to her I wish I could forget I wish I could find everything bad that happen to I and yank it out I canN't she can I be not go to take that away from her you be the one that push she to get the e C T Violet and now she be damage she be well I do not buy that and if you be not go to get to the truth I will pete d Barbara we need to talk about jimmy be something wrong pete let she rest what be wrong be your memory now I know you 've be through a lot and you be feel well but e C T do not Pete e c T do not completely erase one person from your memory and leave everything else intact that be not the way it work Th then I do not understand if you be block jimmy out there might be a reason a real reason not an e C T Reason something he do something that that that you be bury something that that you 've bury so deeply during the past year that it might be hard to talk about if jimmy do something to you if you be scared we can help protect you you can tell we and no matter how bad it be no matter how awful we will make sure he never hurt you again I be sorry be there something funny about that no the idea that jimmy be dangerous you know he he be what nice you remember jimmy I I wake up feel well I smile and then I see jimmy walk through that door and I do not want to smile anymore I could not just tell he to go away after everything he be do but I remember you tell I that e C T can cause memory loss so I suddenly realize I could forget he and then I would not have to hurt his feeling would not it have be easy to just tell he you be you be engaged to he and for the life of I I I can not figure out why when I be depressed he he seem fine and he take care of I and I really appreciate that buafter the e C T it be like the light in my head go on and what be I think no wonder I be depressed for such a long time do not you think your father 's death might have have something to do with that yes of course he like jimmy so much he use to tell I all the time barbara jimmy he be such a nice boy he would not hurt a fly sometimes I Ugh I want he to hurt a fly you get it Jimmy 's that guy that guy at the bar that you go home with at 3 00 a m because the guy you really want to go home with go home with somebody else tell he it just seem cruel I want to spare he be not this well I just tell off a man in a wheelchair and it feel so good I

you and sam and this practice but God I be alone and I do not know if it be I or if I have some bad karma because I be a cheater but every man I meet it be either the wrong person or the wrong time even the oncologist Lillie 's oncologist he ask I out Brian reynolds he be cute yes I say yes but I can not nai I be a mess I be too screw up to date and this damn cat keep stare at I what the hell be you think hey dr King I be with a patient a real patient not like that guy you send I the one with the you meet he in a chat room my mom do not let I go into chat room your mom 's right unless you be supervisedy a grow up I be a grow up no he be not I be try to help do not I do not need your pity patient your hesitation have nothing to do with the second genetic lesion let us call this what it be yes et 's uh which be what you will not do the implantation because you think we be freak you be prejudiced against little people there be nothing I would rather do than give you what you want but not like this but it be the only way for we I understand what you want look at you how can you possibly understand what it be like to be laugh at to never fit in you be tall and beautiful and successful I be fat as a kid I I be fat I do not mean to suggest that it be comparable but everyone have their own scs to bear we all have our insecurity and and they be painful and Nd persistent and they be ours I do not want to compare painful anecdote with you I be just say be in some small way I do understand a small way oh you know it be really hard to avoid use word like big and small and short and tall we try to say thing nicely but you you know the fact of the matter be I be not just fat Fat be the nice word for what I be I be huge I be massive six summer of fat camp my whole adolescence be make fun of I have hear every single joke Lard o and fat ass and uh dumbo and elephant and in our group of friend a tall child will be luh or giant or godzilla Bue'if hs healthy he will survive it I do you do but I can not implant a sick embryo no matter what dr Fife promise you about future breakthrough I can not do it but what I can do be help you to have a healthy baby and whether he be tall or or medium or small when you hold he in your arm he will be yours and you will love he be not that all that really matter that be what I can give you be you dr Montgomery the hospital tell I I would find

I actually I think that I think that jimmy might have kill her father oh it be sad be not it the length we go to People Sad for jimmy oh poor nice jimmy we have to tell he this be not right you want

abnormality with the baby she be here today for a 3d ultrasound a follow up wow I know other have build up a cerebral spinal fluid doctor split on what to do here some say wait as long as possible to take the baby then clear once it be out and possibly rupture the mother 's uterus and that be the other camp they say deliver the baby now twenty three week be way too soon or terminate Eleanor and her husband do not know what to do so they call I and I call you to break the tie that be the husband hi Ronald this be the doctor I be tell you about hi Addison Montgomery thank you so much for come my wife and I a little freak a lot freak actually we look at the scan at the baby 's head and she be in there pray that you be not go to tell we to give up let us uh take a look and we will talk after okay this be my wife Eleanor Sync by rehelen correct by chamallow35 www addic7ed com well maybe this be my penance for push El I never think I would have a child until I meet Ron and then we just both think why not why not try for everything so it be a year of look for an egg donor three cycle of IVF now look just look what be we think Congenital hydrocephalus be not necessarily correlate with a mother 's age necessarily be the operative word it be a waste of time to feel guilty this be our baby this be our chance if Eleanor be to stay here and be monitor would it be safe for she to continue with the pregnancy I would not but there could be another option I might be able to do what be call an in utero intracranial septostomy Meaning I would go in through the uterus and into the baby 's brain create a hole between the ventricle that would drain some of the fluid and relieve the pressure Brain surgery while the baby be inside I be that safe he mean be it safe for a woman my age Maya I be leave now if you want a ride to school I will catch the bus all right sit near the emergency exit love you bye oh what the hell be that um clothe and makeup and you be just go to wait until I leave so you could go to school dress like that this be how all girl dress not this girl you have five second to get upstairs wash your face and put on something decent we will discuss how long you be ground later you be ruin my life what do you say excuse I what do you say nothing she be 60 year old Addison the risk of major surgery stroke arrhythmia get she off the ventilator they be all much high it be still the good option for the baby maybe but not for Eleanor if we try to string this out and bring it close to viability it be not just the baby that could be in trouble Pete I mean you see the scan she be get like a little time bomb in her uterus then we should advise they to terminate and try again and what be the odd of that happen they could use a surrogate or adopt you think somebody be go to give a 60 year old woman a baby you think Eleanor 's too old to a parent I think it be a little weird to introduce your prom date to your 80 year old mother that be one of the downside of get good at fertility treatment everyone think they should be able to have their own baby even at 60 I do not know maybe this child just be not mean to be not my b not our not Lucas a patient she be 60 and pregnant oh well if she be happy send her husband out for denture and diaper then more power to her yeah well the husband 's 30 even more power to her now wait a minute when Pete be date young woman you say it be disgusting do not bring I into this no I be just point out that Violet have a double standard there be a stigma attach to date old woman so I figure if a guy do he be in it for the right reason oh right Lunch uh Pete this be my father the captain nice to meet you yeah and uh this be uh oh hi sorry not at all see it be disgusting Come on let us go I almost kill your child today oh so today she be my child no you would 've have to bury her body in secret to keep I from go to jail okay what have she do she try to sneak out of the house dress up like some 25 year old I do not know what you remember when she use to put on your lipstick Sam she be not 4 and this be not sweet oh come on now Nai do not nai I she be try to pull one over on I and then when I call she on it she stomp away and slam the door in my house you say you almost kill she right I be not go to let our daughter turn into one of those snot nosed private school kid who just think that they can do whatever they want that be not Maya well apparently we do not know Maya well try not to get yourself all work up Sam she be hide thing from I which mean she do not trust I or she be do something that she know be wrong and you think this be more than she just put on some skimpy clothe I do not know I do not know but I be go to turn her room upside down until I figure out exactly what be go on well uh Ruthie look fine how be you do Great yeah you get these two little one and 4 other at home under what 8 and you be you be great huh I be very blessed do not mean you can not complain tell I you be exhausted oh I give up on sleep a long time ago I mean you get no time to yourself or it be uh Shimmon yeah it be your husband he be not interested oh uh okay well that uh that happen some man feel awkward with their wife during or sometimes even after pregnancy but it pass Dr Freedman I should not be talk to you about this it be not proper if there be a problem it be not proper and uh I do not think you can help I need your help if you know somebody be admire you specifically your ass would that just be flatter or would that get you arouse 'cause I think that would be arouse right yeah to know that somebody right near you be think about you sexually wait who be we talk about I or you W we be talk about y you right you ask I to help you with something oh yeah um a patient two month postpartum and she be concerned 'cause her husband be not interested in sex oh well could be depression stress performance anxiety unless it be vascular disease hyperthyroidism iatrogenic impotence forget where my office be Coop the one with all the marital aid and book you sneak in to look at during lunch no I be just refer a patient to Violet you should be refer to I because you be still mad and petty Pettiness aside there be no reason to jump to physiology I mean sex issue more often than not be root in emotional dysfunction yes actually we be find more and more that problem in the bedroom stem from hormonal imbalance nerve problem all kind of equipment failure ok you know what I would like to see she alone first I think we be one big team here at OWG or be that only when you want in on other people 's patient so how exactly do you see this work have an awkward lunch together every few day that it take you three vodka tonic to get through and I a half a bottle of wine at night to forget Addison please I enjoy see your office Violet 's ass or the whole thing I would like to see your house so we could sit there and stare at each other see who blink first without even a waiter to break the tension no you work on anything interesting I be just I be try Addison I might be do an in utero intracranial septostomy really Trick there be get a good angle on the foraman of monro right and then find the avascular plane of the septum yes yeah so would you go to the contralateral ventricle first Mom what be you do home I do not know who you be but you should leave yes ma'am Mom do not talk one two Mom what be you go to do three four Mom why be you count five I be try to calm myself down six seven it be not work Mom call your father tell he to come here now and save your life it be not the first time Shimmon have not be interested after we 've have a baby but it be last long this time and I start think do your husband f how often do you and your husband okay well other than the lack of interest have you notice anything else different about your husband well like what be he emotionally distant not at all Shimmon 's wonderful oh oh good well have you notice any physical change well he have not be sleep well so he be always up poke around the fridge with weird craving and well maybe I be imagine it but up here get a little flabby it be the couvade what be that well sometimes a woman 's pregnancy cause change in her partner 's hormone his testosterone gets convert to oestrogen it be a sympathetic reaction so his symptom mimic yours but it be easily treatable cognitive behavioral therapy Androgen supplementation either way we can help you get Shimmon charge right back up I be sorry maybe I be not be clear that be not what I want at all I love my husband I love be intimate with he but I can not have he charge back up I think you want help with your sex life we have six kid who I adore but if I have to raise or Shimmon have to provide for any more we can not use birth control but we can not have more kid so this couvade be there any way to keep it go permanently she want you to keep he tam and you be okay with that well people have meaningful relationship without hang sex and yet when they be not have it it be usually a sign that there be a problem be not it you ask I to help Cooper no actually I ask Violet to help and I do not think that what Rachel need right now be for you to bring she back in and start toss around word like oral and anal well personally I do not think Rachel need to give up sex at all I mean why should a woman who be feel something not act on it no matter how deeply she try to bury her feeling eventually they be go to come back right I think we need to convince she that it be okay to use birth control well I agree but I do not think she be go there I think we be miss a major part of this equation Sex guy involve or at least there be suppose to be you know he be right we should get Shimmon to help but if Rachel will not talk to a man would Shimmon talk to a woman well then even if the buildup of CSF be significant you can still get complete resolution ideally yes uh so I have a patient and um then I have to go to the hospital after that so thank you for lunch okay oh hello Dr Montgomery W captain Captain she be here ditch school on her back with some boy his name be Dink you tell I that you two be just friend wait a minute wait what what you you know about this dink uh not not much I I know that she like he and that he be in the band he be in a you tell I he be in the band you two be not have sex no so you say how be we suppose to trust you Maya when you go and you do something like this and you show such poor judgment so have a boyfriend count as poor judgment yes do I say you could have a boyfriend do I say you could talk to boy do I say you could even be around a boy okay l calm down all right let us just try to discuss this rationally that be fine with I Mom be the one

child what be bradycardia it mean that the baby 's heart rate have slow down nobody say anything about the heart it be a side effect of increase cranial pressure how dangerous be it your baby be not

this more often Anytime mm I be sorry I can not I can not you do not need to say anything it be just be a long time you know since I feel this way you know I 've be stick in my head for so long the idea that I have a body that I could be touch do you mind my scar not at all I can not look at it then do not it will fade and in the meantime let e a reminder that you go through something no one else quite understand and survive and that you you earn the right to do exactly what you want for a while whether it be this or anything else I be afraid Addison 's go to hate I you will be in good company do you think there be any way to explain it to she that she would understand emotional discussion be not our forte so I do not know that'sad it be I be always work travel when Addison have this or that go on no one event I miss loom large but in the aggregate I suppose I lose track of her of who she be anyway but you be here now try I guess I should just try hard well ybe if you see she more here in her element that might make it easy it might be good for both of you Maya 's be stupid well she be a teenager if you take her side in this I swear I will take my chocolate and I will leave I be not I be on your side Nai for what it be worth I mean honestly you would be hard press to find someone who know less about functional parent child relationship what be the captain that bad he say heant to spend time with I but he do not know how to spend time with I we talk about surgery he lecture and I pretend to not already know what he be tell I I should just send he home let he and Bizzy clank around in that empty house in wasp y silence yeah well sit around in your empty house you start to have doubt will you please tell I that I be do the right thing you be do the right thing Nai I do not mean to disturb you Naomi Captain how be you I come to ask a favor I be hope I could observe you perform the septostomy you want to watch I I 've never see you work I know your reputation of course but uh I would like to see it to see you okay if it be not an imposition just take yes as an answer look I work two job six day a week and Rachel be consume she make our home she juggle school and doctor and meal and birthday so many thing I lose track exactly so at a certain point whether it be 7 or 9 or 12 kid do you think you will want to stop the torah tell we to be fruitful and multiply fill the earth and subdue it we interpret that to mean that we can not do anything to try to prevent a pregnancy I love my wife and neither one of we want to give up you know what if we could find something that be not technically birth control uh we have choose to be faithful Dr Freedman who would we be fool People be unpredictable look Addison just when you think you know someone they go ahead and do something nice wait what my father he want to watch I do surgery I mean the man never make a single piano recital tennis match nothing my whole life and suddenly that be that be great

about birth control you should read the story of onan we be pretty down on anything that have to do with destruction of the seed well the pill do not technically destroy any seed you be right it it be all about interpretation depend upon how observant they be some Jews feel that if you 've have at least one boy and one girl you 've be fruitful enough other take a hard line so with the hard liner be there any kind of loophole be not there a mercy clause in Judaism for parent who have already fill up the minivan but still want to keep do those those mitzvah look rabbi have be debate these rule for

to have this surgery can you uh well I I think we would all like you to want it well I do not just tell they that I refuse a human bite she be deny it but she be get tooth mark and her liver 's tender she be get a yellowish pallor well it be certainly a unique way to transmit hep b and if the test confirm it we be go to have to find out who it be 'cause they be sick too in more way than one you think it be like a sexual predator who like bite young girl he be get her scared maybe it be abuse what about her mother Mean bite she I doubt that maybe it be some sort of s m thing she be 13 year old who go around bite 13 year old try vampire Funny I be serious do you not live in America do the word Twilight and New Moon mean nothing to you they be they be fictional not to teenage girl who think the bite of a vampire be a sign of eternal love how could you let some boy bite you I know that you should not be hang out with that Amber and Ashley and what be her name they do not do anything you have hepatitis you be in the hospital you be 13 year old Paige I think we be go to need to know the name of the boy because he may be sick too you will tell them who it be now Angie Angie how could I have miss this why do not you go and grab a cup of coffee and let we talk to her thank it be okay you do not understand he be my soul mate we be bind together for all of eternity we love each other well that be nice but it should not involve bite so hard that it draw blood yeah it be just a sign of what we be to each other and he be not sick so you do not need to do anything he might not be sick now but he be carry the disease and it could be damage his liver which be very serious if my mom know who he be she will never let I see he again so if I get he to come in will you promise not to tell my mom W she should know she can not so you promise or I be not tell you can not promise not to tell that kid bite she he draw blood he get her sick her lab be get bad I know but it be her

make she the promise we will get the kid in here I will see if he be sick we will figure it out from there you know we could always seal his coffin expose he to sunlight without the surgery she will die which be why you have to 51 50 her not have the surgery be just another way for she to attempt suicide well legally and ethically speak refuse treatment be not the same at all and she be depressed she be not crazy she try to kill herself and her baby that be not crazy no so she try to kill herself fail but get close enough that she might actually get her wish she agree to try antidepressant that might help though I think she probably only agree to it 'cause she be hope he will change his mind and come back well we can not wait for the antidepressant to work she will die we have to force the surgery no her depression make that a bad idea it double her risk of die on the table and it be dicey enough as it be all right then I will I will go find Michael get he to come here what you

we be go to talk about this later I do not even care if they come if it be go to be this big a deal enough about the wedding well if you be do she have an appointment you okay he look like his head be about to pop off do not tell anybody but around here it always look like your dad 's head 's about to pop off I guess I should be happy he be come at all I be sorry about your mom she be make I feel like I be do something wrong do you try talk to she again well you know I I know how hard this be I mean I member u know heather and her mo they never get past it but with your mom I think you should try again I do not think my dad would like it he be mad at she well it be your wedding maya do he really need all of that he weigh less than 2 pound so we need to keep he under the light to regulate his body temperature we be also try to correct a pretty serious electrolyte imbalance that be cause convulsion and exacerbate a cerebral hemorrhage his brain be bleed how can he have so many problem 25 week be just the cusp of viability Addison his abdomen be distend yeah we do an x ray he have necrotize enterocolitis I I do not know what that be it mean that not enough blood be get to his digestive tract his intestine be die be that somethin you can fix he would need surgery to try to resect his bowel and save some of the intestine Matthew so this surgery can we do it now uh that be up to dr Montgomery you need to understand that it would not be just one surgery there would be a whole series of surgery and in between he would need to eat through a feeding tube and breathe with the help of a ventilator he would be suffer and even if we do manage to keep he alive it be unlikely that we could give he any kind of normal life you need to consider if this be something that you want what be our alternative end his life yes that be not a life shuttle back and forth between the o r and nicu be keep alive by machine his system overload with drug he be their child and none of we can say we know what be go to happen odd be you be right I be right there have be case where severe enterocolitis resolve so you be on the side of miracle now I understand why they be and I be not go to fault they for it I be not fault they but that baby be suffer he be only a couple of hour old and you can already see it in his face you can hear it in his cry he be in pain Letting go be not give up it would be they put the baby 's good interest ahead of their own Naomi you know kid do not come with guarantee they come with problem these problem can not be solve a lot of problem can not be solve you just you learn to live with it no one should have to live with this no we be not go to tell the cole what to do they have to decide what they can live with but I would have to do the surgery so I need to decide what I can live with Corinne hey what be you what be you do here oh I tell maya I would pick she up she come in to do a prenatal appointment yeah I know I be take my daughter in law to be on a mini spa day massage facial and then a test run for her makeup and hair uh I I be just try to make this special for maya I think the wedding will be special enough well if we just go through the motion do you really think it will be I I know this be not what you or naomi want it be it be not what I want either but it be what be go to happen so I 've make peace with it as well I can and now I feel we should make this as positive an experience as we can for the kid so be maya here it be not a thing but the guy be a surgeon who be date charlotte that have nothing to do with the fact that he hit I up for a prescription he barely know I and he be ask I for narcotic that would slow he down impair his judgment well look look look I be on antidepressant sometimes it make it hard to focus which be not ideal when I be in therapy Sam 's on allergy med when he up his dose it knock he out you just have to hope that someone 's go to be responsible do do you have any reason to think that scott would not be nothing concrete but when he see that I be uncomfortable he back off fast and it feel practice well he I 've hear he be a good surgeon he seem like a good guy what you 've meet he oh she have he to the house do not she my god she give it up fast Cooper y what what be I wrong he have not actually be to the house he be just pick she up there but I do not think that they be yeah well you be just say that to be nice but she be bring he to maya 's wedding he be her plus one I have the list I have all the list caterer deejay florist I be knee deep in wedding and the sad part be I have never have one of my own that be sad but back to I no one tell I that plus one be an option Cooper the wedding be in two day if you be think of scare up some random hoochie oh no I be think about invite jordana sampson be she back in town Mm hmm cooper no she be not random and she be not a hoochie I know but she be exactly you do not take that personally do you be there a reason I should no no then I will not I either it be a professional disagreement yes so be you still good with yes I think so I do not know I tell sam this morning that I be see someone I think we be not go to no we be not it be just he come to my house last night I be not home I do not want to lie to he you do not tell he it be I no no you have not tell anyone have you like violet I I would not even know what to say because this mm hmm with we Mm hmm we be just just get through what we be get through Mm hmm we be just help each other Mm help each other feel good really really good want to see if that door lock Maya what be you do here I want you to come to my wedding even though you be not proud of I I kof course I love you do you think it would be well if I do not get marry yes I I I do not know it would not I be just try to do the right thing but I need you you need I long before this but somehow even though I try I be not there for you and so for I to sit down in front of god and everyone we know for a formal public reminder of how badly I screw up your life I that be not what my wedding be that be what it would be to I the whole time we be try to get pregnant Matthew keep tell I to visualize what it would be like when we be in the hospital when we be finally a family yeah after a while I I want to stop it be just too hard you know and it just feel like it be never go to happen but matthew he keep promise it would he call the baby our dream defer oh like the poem Langston hughe yeah we be english teacher can I can I hold he now oh we can not we can not take he out even for a minute I be sorry so how soon can we do this surgery I tell matthew at the rate the baby 's bowel function be deteriorate you would have to do the operation today right it be what they want for their child and I tell they if anybody can help they here it be you dr Montgomery please I will book an o r he be suppose to discharge ike almost two hour ago we keep page he I be really sorry I say dr Stt be probably busy sew someone 's brain back in well there might have be an emergency where he be sew somebody 's something back in still no I he should not have leave you hang I be really sorry all right you be all set to go I hope that follow up be the only thing that he be careless about I hear there be a problem with your patient no actually there be a problem with your boyfriend he ask I for oxy this morning now he be m I a and you be assume what he have a bad back well as his girlfriend I be sure you be very sympathetic but as chief of staff of the hospital where he work I think you should be concern about how he be treat it if it be his back if you want to make a formal complaint do it that be what I think hey hey you work on the toast try look sam about what I say we do not need to talk about it it be none of my business no sam Addison please not today okay I I c I can barely get through this what do you want to say I want to tell they stop you know and do not make this any bad I just try to give that speech a patient of pete 's give birth to a preemie 25 week just so many problem good case scenario it live in the nicu until I can not do any more surgery or give it any more drug be you and pete in sync you say it be pete 's patient right right it be but we be not in sync I be a about to go remove Most of the baby 's intestinal tract because the parent be hope for a miracle and pete do not want to take that away from they and I could not say no so I get to clear my schedule and head back to the hospital well I get that do thing you do not want to do I be suppose to make this big speech that make everybody feel good about the wedding pretend like everything be okay sometimes weave to pretend Eloping oh no noi'm just take the dress to get steam it be it be maya 's I figure yeah well you know it should be a pretty odd event you know uh cooper 's bring jordana sampson she be back oh wow I know Y you be not bring someone else be you a a plus one uh because among other thing I be the rsvp girl so um I be just uh make sure Nope just I you same I will seeou there hey you be suppose to discharge ike holden I have to come over here just so they could go home I be sorry I be sorry it be my my back it be kill I I I lay down I guess I just go out come on I know what you be think you think because I ask you for a a courtesy prescription what you think now I be I be a drug addict who crash out here tell I you have not take anything I I take one oxy I do not have any other surgery schedule as long as you be not cut someone open anything short of that it be okay that you show up here like this listen I be really sorry that it bother you that I be see your ex girlfriend it bother I that you could not do your job right now and you be still here I have never have a single problem in this hospital or any other you want that to change be you threaten I I think you should go talk to my colleague violet turner she have a lot of experience treat people with addiction you want I to see a shrink convince she you do not have a problem I will lay off and if I do not we will let this hospital sort it out you know somehow I think charlotte 's already decide about I maybe but I have not how be it go Addison Addison there be no clear margin the entire bowel be involve there be nothing leave I can save be there anything you can do I can close he up but he survive the surgery yes he survive but then there must be something you can do your baby do not have a function digestive system so before I could do anything I would have to put a central line in through his stomach to feed he and how long would he have to have that permanently and although I be able to stop the cerebral bleed we have to assume that there be at least moderate brain damage but you do not know that for sure no I do not know that for sure but it be more than likely the case just like the long we keep he on a respirator the more likely it be that he will have retinal failure or that he will go blind I be not say there be not miracle but at a certain point it be not fair to the baby to langston to keep wait for they what be the odd I want to know the odd of a baby like langston live outside the nicu Less than 1 but it could happen and it be our decision uh yeah it be but he be in pain and with so little to hope for I be sorry I be not comfortable perform another surgery be there other doctor that we can get to help we yes you could find someone se to put in a central line then that be what we will do will you please help we I be sorry I understand if you want to go a different way but I can not so be the be the drug something new the drug the drug be the occasional oxy that I take when my back flare up you know what here you go take them toss them eat them do whatever that tell you what you need to know uh well the fact that you be carry narcotic in your pocket tell I that you may have a more serious problem than you be admit it be funny how much you sound like your buddy cooper this have nothing to do with he this have everythg to do with he he resent my date charlotte he can not seriously call into question my judgment or my hand skill or anything else that matter so he be try to make I out to be some kind of junkie and you be help he I be just ask question try to understand and I be certainly not force you to stay here no cooper be you be free to leave I do that he make an issue of it with charlotte do that worry you charlotte know about this I be not an addict why be you so angry I do not know well maybe we can keep talk find out if there be something there I be a good doctor which be why you should also stop see patient until we get a handle on this whatever it be and how do I explain that to charlotte to the doctor who refer I the patient I already have schedule it will be easy than try to explain what happen if you hurt someone I can help you if you want I to okay hey hey I call you last night oh sorry no no no I just be worried about you after you walk out I be okay okay well for what it be worth I agree with you enough be enough yeah Addison no no no what not in my office I be just try to be a friend well just you know be a friend from there will this help hey sam you get a minute I want to talk to you about the wedding uh talk to violet no no it be not a violet thing not now no now sam look I I get that this be hard for you okay but it do not change the fact that maya 's go to get marry tomorrow and you sign the paper so that she could and now you be make she feel like crap about it I will be there at the wedding I will walk she down the aisle okay but show up and act like this I mean it be no well than what naomi be do and someone have to be there for she to be happy for her to to support she and if it be not either of I be try try hard oh hey where you go I be go to pick up maya and dink 's wedding ring it be just another thing that I can check off this list of errand I never think I would do for anybody hey uh before you go so should I be worried about scott or if I think he be dangerous I would report he that be all I be go to say what be you talk about I no no you be talk about scott look I be not go to say anything to either one of you and you should not unless of course you care about the health and safety of any of the patient he might treat at the hospital where he work cut they open which roughly translate mean please violate privilege to give I some dirt on my ex 's new man I I do not care about you and he I do care that he be probably smart enough not to trigger violet 's duty to report which mean he be go to have to hurt someone before anyone take action here I be I be not get in the middle of this you know who need therapy here you Cooper freedman yeah ike holden be my patient what happen and who be do the surgery Sam How 's maya do how do you think she be do she be getting marry tomorrow and you be not go to be there where be you go to be I be go to I be go to napa with william wow I do not expect you to understand of course I understand you think I do not want to do the same thing just run away from all this but I can not because someone have to be the adult here and you leave that to I I do not mean for this to be like this sam just like you be not go to mean for maya to start go to corinne with her problem or for corinne to be the one she

connect with a child as that cause you to place yourself in a maternal role which could be raise feelis of rejection for you as well you likely project pete into the role of your father Sam into the

you really want if you do not put yourself out there and go for it you really do give crappy advice no actually I be kinda brilliant application for the FDA approval for the next stage of my a L S study Naomi usually review the datum before we submit it but with she go and leave you in charge it be your job now oh thank look like a fun read be in charge be not my idea of fun I mean I be glad that William finally tell she about his a L S but I do not know she be go to run off to Switzerland to be with he any word from they I hear from Naomi a few day ago I guess he have not see any improvement do Naomi say when uh they be plan on come back no then move that to the top of the pile so they have a reason to it be a little out of my wheelhouse do not you think actually they be not all that different from horny teenager they get too much time on their hand minimal supervision almost zero regard for the consequence of reckless sexual behavior Grannies go wild it be a real problem Cooper S t Ds be spread through the elder care community like a brush fire the woman can not get pregnant the man be all hop up on p d e 5 inhibitor everybody 's screw everybody else Nobody be take any precaution as much fun as that sound it be old people Charlotte I be a pediatrician I need a man a male oh the male resident be often uncomfortable broach sexual matter with female medical staff why I I be come to you as a physician a fellow partner of this medical practice Put away your fear of age spot help I out Kayla 's repeat e e g show diffuse slow consistent with a permanent vegetative state Surgery will not help Kayla be not a viable candidate I be sorry Eddie there must must be something else you can at least try she can not just stay like this I be afraid I can not help what about cannulate the aqueduct of Sylvius pass a stent to drain the fluid buildup Dr Shepherd her C S F study show a slowing of flow not a complete obstruction it could work you know how to wake she no she do not she be refer to an experimental procedure that have show very little success and in your wife 's case it will not work I assist in two of the procedure now be not the time to bring it up so do it or do not but do not say that it can not work Addison Amelia this procedure be a bad idea Eddie if she think that it can work then we sh she be a teaching fellow who be not qualified to make this call I graduate top of my class at Harvard I do my residency at Johns Hopkins I have do dozen of procedure in the third ventricle I be more than qualified that be why you hire I well clearly I make a mistake you be fire Dr Shepherd and it go without say that just because the risk of pregnancy be go the risk of contract sexually transmit disease be not in fact in a place of this size where many of you be so so lucky to be enjoy considerable leisure time uh e exactly yeah in a situation like this transmission rate can be very high which be why if you be go to have intercourse we would like to urge you to flash back to high school and start use condom again alternatively um there there be many way to be intimate and safe short of of actual penetration can anyone name a way to get pleasure without penetration I just feel so awful for the husband you know he be he be go to have to watch her wither away hook up to a feeding tube when it do not have to be that way it be a crime I mean it be a crime of medical omission in fairness even Derek say that this be not doable I e mail the scan and he say it be a no go Derek be just like Ginsberg I mean if he have not see it it be not so this be just new this be a cut edge surgical procedure the university of Wisconsin do a study on a series of 11 patient I 've see it I mean I could do it I be just say I train for it you do realize we be talk about a woman with three baby inside she and you realize that Kayla have a husband and two child Addie what do you think I th Lucas cry oh could we pause for a moment please here I will get it I will get he yeah yeah I should get outta here and go pick up Vanessa Amelia Vanessa his girlfriend yeah Chuckles thank you uh all right I will see you guy later see you have fun have fun okay so you and Sam what be with the tension there be no tension I be sit right here I mean you barely look at he there be a thing with you and Sam with I and Sam and Naomi do not take it well and now I be with Pete and Sam be with Vanessa and it be fine it be very adult sound very messy no it be not actually it be great my life be work Addison I mean this be I you be talk to I catch you with my brother 's good friend and I keep your secret I mean you can talk to I you use to trust I I choose Pete I choose Pete he be great we be great and I can not have kid and Pete have Lucas so that be sort of this amazing ice on the cake except for the fact that Pete 's still in love with Lucas ' mother which be oh Addie so anyway cheer I miss you you know you be always a well sister than the one I have and you be way well than my brother be thing okay between you two he be the golden child clear throat everything be always okay with he that be painful at least they take some condom ah do you have any question or or want some more condom actually I do have a question for the gentleman if that be all right the gentleman of course I will be wait hello how c how can I help I do not really know how to say this uh it be somewhat embarrassing no I be I be I be a doctor I 've hear it all whisper Come okay well Nora and I we 've be date for several month she be a really lovely woman really lovely and our uh our intimate time have be very good except lately it be be difficult for I to oh you know as man get old it be uh it be very common for they to have difficulty as you say getting um try to no it be not that oh I be still able to perform oh good good good good it be just become uncomfortable my pelvis be sore it do not want to move the way it use to so I do not find myself get uh in the mood oh so I be hope you would have some pill to help with libido give your discomfort I think you should have a complete exam before we prescribe anything and you can do that I could make an appointment with you and you could check I out it be it be my associate 's specialty not mine but I can bring she up to speed on everything we talk about but you really you really should make an ap appointment to see she with a lady she be no lady Y'all keep I up till 3 00 this morning oh oh God I be sorry no I be just kid sorry Sam I be glad she be here I I too it be nice I forget how much I like have someone to talk to you can talk to I no I can not it Sam I can not Amelia uh Eddie want to hear more about the surgery so we start talk and one thing lead to another and uh and what and he ask I to do the surgery and I say yes I can do the surgery and save the baby I just need you in there to keep an eye on they and Sam to maintain the cardiovascular function this can work it be reckless how well how how would this work just for Eddie 's sake I want to know how this would work Mm hmm I would relieve the obstruction by place a stent in the aqueduct and then as the pressure drop the activity in the brain stem will return and kayla wake up and if it work what state will she be in will she be able to function I do not know but if we do not do it we will never know I be against this I be too two neurosurgeon say no to this one be your mentor the other be your brother Derek look at an e mail of a scan I mean he he do not even see the patient which ultimately do not matter because Eddie Lindy make a decision to save his wife he ask I to do it and I can do it now will you give I privilege here yes Addison Great I will get you an o r for tomorrow Addison what be you go to do to stop her nothing look I be wrong I make a bad call yeah well chuckle I admit that but we be both on the same side with this we both want to give those baby a chance what do you really think I can talk she out of it I could not talk you out of it I think you could try I think you could try talk to her Eddie want this Amelia be set and she just got sanction by the chief of staff you know she you know this be wrong so stop she have you review the application not yet overnight it to Naomi really you do not think she have enough on her plate why be you roll around here with this gigantic chip on your shoulder you should 've never tell I about William 's A L S you know I I get it you be upset that your study be not go fast enough I will read the application I will get this be not about the damn application I sleep with Naomi and then I tell she about William yeah yeah you tell Naomi Lowered voice that William have a L S why I do not know Chuckles I want more from she and I think it be the right thing to do or that she would be piss at he for withholding I do not know do not matter she be go prostate cancer I come in for loss of libido pain from arthritis Charlotte Discovery of prostate cancer be often an incidental finding you do not find it if you do not look and then it be too late what be the treatment in your case I recommend radiation therapy either external or with an implantable radioactive seed what about what about my Johnson will it still work after about half of all patient do experience erectile difficulty follow radiation and there be no alternative treatment well give your circumstance not that I recommend but there be thing we can do if impotence occur as a side effect of the radiation injection pump if I do not have the treatment how long do I have four maybe five year it be be lovely talk to you thank you for your time Mr Schmitt Cooper he be a man and you be talk about he lose his manhood I get that no you can not you be a woman you could not possibly know how something like that would make he feel and you be a man so of course you do yes that be right I mean be the guy even make the wrong decision Prostate cancer 's pretty slow grow he be 80 if he want to live the life he have leave on his own term and not have to talk to you about sex who be we to tell he no so I should just let he die oh come on that be not what I be say he be in extraordinarily good health and this cancer 's aggressive his gleason level be a 7 and if he be make it to 80 statistically he be get a good shot of make it to 100 now he be get a woman that he love that he want to be able to love he do not want to be emasculate Charlotte be it so hard for you to see that be we talk about Oscar or we talk about you excuse I Emasculation seem to be your catch phrase for I I be not talk about you but truth yeah you like to be tough than everyone else and that make some people pull away I think we be past this you bring it up I come to you for help well maybe that be not such a good idea clearly Dr Shepherd uh this be Angie and Simon McConnell they be the parent that Kayla 's surrogate for they want to meet you well I would I would shake your hand but Dr Montgomery tell we what be happen Eddie do not want to hear this but our baby be barely viable he be well aware we know this be horrible to ask after all that Kayla 's be through but please do not do this we be so close to have our family would you talk with I outside for a minute you think if I see the parent with their sad face what I be just go to back down look I be do the right thing not for the baby the risk be too high the Addison Montgomery I know would wade through fire for a patient she would not whine about the risk I mean she would go all super woman on I try to convince I to do the surgery what be it what you be settle in your personal life so now you be willing to settle with your patient too I be not settle Amelia you have feeling for someone else Pete have feeling for his kid 's mom you say it be great you do not seem great you have no idea what you be talk about you seem sad Addison and you should be okay what you be way out of line here you should want more More for yourself and more for Kayla I can not decide if it be bad if she choose William and he die or if she choose I and he live you do not want he to die right right 'cause then I get to compete with his ghost yeah but he live you got to compete with all that money it be lose lose either way right yes which be why we be here move on move on move on bring we back to Cooper 's dilemma would you rather have 10 to 15 year of life or four year of sex Sex Sex that be not the dilemma the dilemma be how do I continue work with Charlotte King maybe that be why we be here maybe it be you who need to move on no I already move on from Charlotte I just can not move away from she and her emasculate way right right 'cause offer standard medical treatment to a patient be clearly emasculate hey you know what you be not allow to defend she that be against the rule you guy have rule all guy have rule dude and he think Charlotte have the problem hey hey hey hey hey do not hey I this be what you guy do for fun huh Wheelchair beep what so what now you be leave I be move on wow that guy be a piece of work what I be just drink here you think it be my fault too I be not wrong so what you be try to say be that I overreact and I want to pick a fight I be just drink here oh man all right another round no I will pass re why I do not need to move on you be here late be I an emasculating bitch I assume this be not a trick question Chuckles be this a Cooper thing or my sex ed seminar turn up a patient with prostate cancer he be old think his life will be over without sex he will not even listen to treatment option and I think I could help he but he will not take my call Cooper think I do not understand man I think you know he be wrong we therapist be good at help people talk through their problem I do not like talk yeah well maybe that be your problem thing I tell you be privilege of course Addison 's patient the one in the coma I leave her husband alone in the room I know he might end thing why would you do it well he be there stare at a woman who would not wake up it seem so cruel I be back a surgery to save she three baby be at risk I be put my faith in some 20 year old kid because I because you want forgiveness I want to believe I do not do the wrong thing for the wrong reason well maybe you do the wrong thing for the right reason this thing with I and Cooper why do you push I back to he because it be what you want hey hey when do I become the man other man tell their problem to could you tell I that maybe the question be when do all the man I know become woman because really it be you know what Amelia be go to operate on Kayla okay and she think I be settle I be not settle be you mad yes I be mad I be mad you want to tell I what it be about you say I love you Violet to I you say it to I I what I say when you be sick and you have a fever but you know I be I be here babysitte play peekaboo with your kid you know and I you say I love

at the unit let us go be she go to be okay Sam you get this yeah Oscar apparently you 've speak to Dr King yes I tell she that you have the right to refuse medical treatment which be true thank you but I also think it be wrong Impotence be not an inevitable side effect of radiation she say I have a 50 50 chance of lose function and if you come down on the wrong side of that you still have a woman that love you but I will not be able to love she back well maybe not in the way that you can now but with the help of Dr King it be not the same well you be right it would be different but these
