Needle in Seattle I have to remember not to debate my dad when it come to architecture can I have a glass of water Sure so by the time you finish your reading this weekend you should be able to

pick all of they have juvenile record Most of the girl it be shoplift fight chronic truancy wait just because I be a girl mean I have to mentor a girl yes that be in case they get their period or

businesswoman she be a humanitarian not a big profit margin there have you see what Selma 's disappearance have do to our stock I have not it be skyrocket every day that she be miss just on the assumption that we will continue to sell merchandise manufacture in Asia Selma want Hearstmart to deal only american make product which here be a hot tip we will not I still do not have anything from

divorce since the accident Budd have become more and more clingy he follow she around like a pull toy at this point she probably care more about her dog than she do her husband I would not be

first be it that you be a Theta Beta that would do anything for her sorority you think I have something to do with Mrs Rose 's disappearance perhaps if there be anyone you should be concern about it be that guy Brant Mr Rose 's assistant he be like in love with Mr Rose like Swimfan love he will not let anyone talk to he he follow he everywhere at one time Mr Rose be take a nap and I see Brant

anniversary in the p I biz Dine ' n ' ditch after ten year of marriage a spouse be entitle to half of his partner 's asset so you cut the cord before ten year you do not have to pay but she be the one with the loot that be my point exactly the brother say the marriage be in trouble you think the husband have her you know crrk that be one extreme possibility yeah what be the other play a hunch Brant say Selma 's dog be the child she never have if Budd 's try to say keep she hide I bet she will be a lot quieter with her kid around this be just like that time we go to Disneyland if I have another

line Mr Mars I mean on a national scale actually because I 've be and I 've spend the rest of my life try to earn back a certain measure of respect this would put I back at square one Hallie so you

an early anniversary present unless you have your heart set on prison I be grateful for your help but a little surprised I do not get a discount repeat customer and all I do not charge you for the photocopy or the stamp oh that be nice who know the cavalry would be so handsome do not be nice to I Selma it will ruin everything I be on my way to vote Fate of the Greeks in my hand and all how be they fare I know it be a difficult decision my official vote be screw them they be out of here I know you think I be some kind of gold digger but I love Budd and all of his beautiful money or be true love so blind you do not notice he be an adulterer old than your father and confine to a wheelchair Budd Rose be more of a man than you could ever begin to handle slow down Anna Nicole you be skeeve I out and the fact be I do not care if he be Ron Jeremy on wheel you want to impress I tell I the truth about Patrice Pitrelli I tell you I do not go here then besides Patrice 's good friend in the whole world just fake a rape why be not you pick on her Patrice be friend with Claire yeah they be in the same pledge class what do Chip Diller have to do with Patrice Pitrelli fall off the roof of the Theta Beta house Come in we will enlighten you who be we look who just show up ask about Patrice Veronica Mars well I be impressed with your tenacity if not your politic I can die happy what do you hear about Patrice she fall off the roof of the Theta Beta house she do not fall she walk right off why finally a smart question the Theta Betas use to take some pledge to a secret room where they would have they undress be you still try to sell that I 've be there there be no two way mirror then they panel over it I see it the rush officer would have the girl strip in front of the mirror then they would point out the part that they think need work like they be be helpful they would circle they with a magic marker like a plastic surgeon do during a consultation they do that to you no they only do it to the girl who they think need help and patrice need help they practically cover she in circle I mean she be pale and pudgy but a legacy she be already cry when someone turn on the light in the secret room and there they be a crowd of Pi Sigs laugh their ass off Chip Diller start call her marshmallow and the name stick they use permanent marker so not only do she have to deal with be call marshmallow she have those mark all over she for week the sorority sister keep tell she a tan would fix everything they keep insist she lie on the roof with the rest of we but she be still all mark up she surprise we one day by walk out on the roof but instead of plop down on a towel she just stroll right off the edge what happen to her she be in the hospital for a couple of month now she be in a mental health facility you do not believe it oh I believe you and I think it be horrible I also think it be powerful motivation for someone to take desperate action fake a rape right possibly a series of rape how many of they be real I mean other than Chip Diller 's there have not be any forensic evidence no semen no hair find on any of the victim the Greeks would be go if you have not get they off be you proud of that fact the moral superiority would fit well if there be not already one fake rape on your résumé nothing hurt the cause more than that you know I be right I will show myself out Wine wine wine one or two will not do 'cause I want it all and I hope I hope hope you know what I be think of I want all of your love Transcript Inigo vmtranscript com Synchro Camilla

it could be fun or it could be a lot of speechmaking by politico in training or that my name be Bronson Pope I be the chapter president of PHAT here at Hearst I would like to thank everyone for come out from food industry to clothing to medical research corporate America employ horrible cruelty to animal simply to maximize profit it be a tragic state of affair that we fight with education People who disagree be not the enemy they be the goal yeah this be in addition to some of the more active stuff there be a rumour that someone liberate some research animal I be just wonder if we would be do anything like that what I raise my hand that be really not our thing but if you be eager for action how about join we tomorrow night to launch our letter write campaign Sure that sound almost as good you know Bronson that psycho bow hunt rocker guy Ed Argent be play downtown tomorrow night we should consider picket the show you ever meet an Argent fan Darla uh they would pay double to spit on our picket line so I come in at around seven First I think he just have a bender and fall asleep at his desk but then I see blood and the note a note yeah on the computer he have a memo on the screen say Goodbye cruel world zzzz I guess his head fall on the Z it be a shame man he be pretty cool for a weird old white dude so uh what you just want to see if he leave any booze I think I tell you the management ask if you would stop do that that be exactly what be be wrong with you lately since when do you side with management Ooh good case scenario old lady what be with you that be awesome how about a little life so what you be just go to mope around like that guy in what be that book where the guy 's mom die and he come back to Jersey he be get that motorcycle sidecar Garden State be never a book it be not oop so much for that paper but if this be a book the theme of my essay would be the symbolism of how your character have his man part rip off by the Veronica Mars character my man part be intact show I well you will have to take my word for it I mean symbolically we be young single man in our sexual prime and the only reason why we be not out there go hog wild be because of your feeling what be we on the View be I Rosie O'Donnell here be something I read today be the first day of the rest of your life think about that really think about it yeah well as a statement it seem you know obvious and pointless which mean that be what your life be you need help I be offer okay nothing too major just baby step just please let I help you hey thank for come um lick or stuff

so patient some of we want to get the message out a little more actively if you be interested maybe you can prove yourself what do you have in mind just something that get our attention surprise we you look sad you and your friend Weevil have a fight or something just think if I be go to get drunk and shoot myself I would probably drink the good stuff first Sheesh good thing we do not have any good stuff Dean O'Dell do a bottle of forty year old single malt say he live in anticipation of drink it so why if he be go to commit suicide do he drink the cheap stuff instead you have a few run in with the dean right what be your impression of the man I admire he he have character or be one or something I do not know just how 'bout his rhetorical style Businesslike and bland More Old Testament sarcastic Sarcastic like he might leave a dumb cliché as a note as a joke what do the note say Goodbye cruel world type as a memo like on the computer screen yeah why just we have to do these paper for Landry 's class like plan the perfect murder I get an a just in case you be wonder and what do this Mine be a fake suicide where you leave a note on the computer so you can not check the handwriting and write something clichéd so you do not study the message my example be Goodbye cruel world hey Piz Ed Argent be in town think you can pull some of that Oregon mountain man kill what you eat gun rack charm and book he on your show everything north of San Francisco be just thunderdome to you be not it it be for a case involve a miss monkey the case of the miss monkey Mm hmm you would

God baby that would be so great hello hey it be I do you know if Landry 's father or his grandfather have a cabin a cabin I do not know why they mention it on the tape Papa 's cabin like a getaway

foster care she say she be on her lunch break the other day and Hank call and threaten to take the kid off probation unless she show up at that convenience store and say she see Landry the night of the murder and Landry still go no lead we be kind of busy so if you two that be why we want to bring you these on the tape Batando have Landry refer to Papa 's cabin like it be a getaway or hideout so we search his house for idea where that might be no property record but we find these we be not sure if this be the same place or not do we know anything about Landry 's dad Grandfather he call he Papa Brewer Landry live in Florida this do not look like Florida it look like the mountain those be aspen tree Quaking aspen so western mountain and on this one you can actually make out the license plate on this truck navy letter on white the most common pattern so it could be anywhere Virginia Alabama Illinois Kansas Quaking aspen Western U S okay so uh Oregon Washington Wisconsin Utah or California California have red state letter so do Washington not on the endanger animal specialise plate that could be a whale or a lake as in crater lake a specialised Oregon plate or Papa could be Ernest Hemingway Papa 's Cabin Papa 's Cabin Cabo San Lucas Unwind at the hideaway once belove by Ernest Hemingway anything a pretty positive ID from the manager the guy do not rent the room just pay to moor boat hello I do not kill he Keith you must know this little trip to Mexico might lead I to take that statement with a grain of salt it be she Mindy she do it Keith all I do for she and she set I up what do you I try to cover for she put it on Batando the keyboard yeah I just switch it with the dean 's it might have work too but then you take over as sheriff where be she Hank where be Mindy there be an accident I just want to talk find out how she could turn on I like that she must have think I be go to kill she we fight and I hit she and she fall over it be dark I look but but what where be she Hank I swear I swear Keith it be an accident Mars we be on a last name basis now we skip right over androgynous nickname I try call you Chuckles but it do not stick you know some people be afraid of you huh so what be up echoll nothing just uh I want to ask you about something you know it be kind of weird but you know I be think of ask Parker out and I want to make sure it be cool with you Veronica be you come in yeah uh one second of course thank you for ask Sure I know we be friend yeah see ya and good luck oh uh thank for come in yeah so since Landry 's be you know arrest well it be kind of catch everyone uh by surprise include I as you know yeah it kind of catch everyone by surprise anyway I 've be ask to take over his class until they can find a replacement and uh it be kind of a big job and as you be kind of a Star pupil I be hope you might uh be my TA while I try to get a handle on all this 'cause I could really use the help of course Great can you pick up my dry cleaning so as you probably know uh Professor Landry be no long with we I will be your instructor for the time be so if you will take your handout from the Webber text yes what happen what do you mean I mean our professor murder the dean can not we discuss that I mean this be criminology right well it be a little awkward for I but okay this be criminology so Landry kill O'Dell a crime of passion opportunity Premeditation what do we know well passion clearly be a factor Dean O'Dell 's wife Mindy and Landry be engage in an affair the dean catch they threaten to ruin they destroy Landry 's career so motive pretty much a classic be it true he get the idea from one of our perfect murder paper possibly again opportunity the idea in this paper probably suit the situation he know he have a limited window to act he know the dean be drunk and upset and he have a gun so a fake suicide suit the circumstance any chance the dean 's wife help set he up he be drug right an anti anxiety drug yes but he have a prescription now be it possible they collude yes will we ever know well with Mindy dead and Landry not speak probably not Landry be a smart man but the bloody clothe he think he incinerate get stick in a chute and once they be find everything unravel another interesting thing about this case be once a perpetrator start improvise the sloppy his work become they find the bloody clothe so Landry first try to frame Mrs O'Dell 's ex husband and then when he be arrest in this room as you all remember he fake an alibi how he call a woman whose son he oversee in the juvenile probation board it might have work actually if the phone he have call they with have not be find again chance if you remember from read Holst 80 of Veronica when uh when what when do he call she L Landry be arrest here and take straight to the sheriff 's department when do he have the time to make the blackmail call to fake his alibi well uh s someone mention the possibility that he and Mindy collude she could have call while it be a male voice on the phone well then it be possible he call early anticipate his arrest remember this be a man who at this point know his crime have be expose he know Mindy be under investigation and have send her child to relative in England he could easily have assume that she have turn against he anyway in 80 of case the breakthrough evidence be be obtain outside the usual police protocol an interesting point of of Holst I think he make here be that Veronica how do you know she send her kid to England I be actually not sure but so whoever bug Landry 's phone know that the dean catch Mindy and Landry together and that the dean be drunk in his office well if you be suggest Batando kill they it be possible if you follow the thread through so this person would also be aware that Professor Landry shoot down your chance for a teaching job at Pepperdine oh my God do you hear what she just say yes if they listen to all the tape which it sound like you do I I be I be not sure I understand I do when my dad call to tell I that Mindy have send her kid to relative in England you could not have hear you be in a convenience store talk to a stripper you bug my phone you bug Landry 's phone you know he shoot down your job application you know the dean threaten he you know the dean be zonke out on Xanax and scotch in his office and you have access to Landry 's clothe you murder Dean O'Dell to destroy Professor Landry because he use you then betray you and when he say he have an alibi you fake it so you would be sure he would go down Bet he will change his mind about you not be that smart and in a shocking development in a local murder investigation Timothy Foyle the teaching assistant of accuse killer Hank Landry have confess to the murder of Cyrus O'Dell the one big downside of justice it feel good but it do not change anything a killer 's in jail but the dean be still dead which remain fundamentally unfair you get a confession I be that good so it be true what they say there be a new sheriff in town until the special election anyway what you make meat and potato I read somewhere that be what real man eat ah be there a real man come over so what be go to happen to Landry he be go to be try for manslaughter he kill Mindy O'Dell he confess too man you get everyone to confess I think it be the uniform do you have anything to confess yes you embarrass I give I my meat woman and in other news a San Diego businessman be find dead in his Laguna Beach house turn that off will you the discovery be make by his private secretary who tell police she discover the man 's body on you know I do not like you expose to all this crime and violence it be go to warp your mind who be I kid Police have yet to make a ruling on the case so it be truely what they say Mars there be a new sheriff in town until the special election anyway do you like movie let us go I know what I like why waste my time like why bother with something not good just because it be something I be think of ask parker out and I want to make sure it be cool with you of course thank you for ask Sure I know we be friend see ya good luck uh coffee with cream uh

judge you I be just I be say what you already know that fake fur be a poor choice to infiltrate utopia you 've build this fortress around yourself now it do offer a limited amount of protection but it also keep other people and all they have to offer at bay starve your soul now you might want to consider open yourself up let other people inside let other people inside get anyone particular in mind maybe if I discreetly flash Mr Taser so have anyone tell you what we grow here I hear it be the ultimate cash crop that it be impressive be not it be not these poinsettia and Christmas be right around the corner see we never would have be able to finish off the greenhouse if Casey have not give we that money I wish I be not so broke right now otherwise I would try to chip in too oh well our goal be not to be a charity case I mean it be not that we have anything against money it be just it be kind of like water you know lot of symbolic power but really just a lifeless substance when you get right down to it but the paradox be that life as we know it would be impossible without it if you see what I be say you be say you do not want my money you do not want my body you do not want I work in your ganja field you just want I to be happy Strange hey listen up everybody this be important we 've get South of the County Water Department who be out here to check for lead in the pipe so try not to

literally brain damage since when do you reserve the right to totally blow of my instruction do my judgement my concern for your safety carry that little weight with you I be sorry Dad I screw up big time I know trust I I will be follow your game plan the rest of the way they just seem so harmless what be your basis for that call the absence of swastikas engrave on their forehead please reassure I that you be not that dense I be sorry really so do you plant any bug when you be out there yes you 've be listen in hear anything incriminate yet nope it be like listen to the Brady Bunch with a reggae soundtrack what about your background check on Josh anything shady out of line up until four year ago he be a manager of a downloadable ring development team at E Tones one day without warn he quit his job cash out his stock and use it to buy the land for the collective Holly 's totally clean as well so what be our next step there be no our about it you be officially off this case I will take it home from here what that make no sense whatsoever be not you even interested in what I 've learn what be the point Veronica I be prepared to admit that these Moon Calves probably do not merit the full ATF fire bombing treatment I mean my guess be they be just a bunch of tie dye Oliver Twists who scam naïve kid to pay the bill Mr Gant I be sure you have a lot to report but first there be something you need to know Mr Mars my mother Casey 's grandmother be die she have a severe stroke on Tuesday night she be effectively brain dead and not expect to make it more than a couple of day my condolence thank this have be a tough disorient time for we even more so because of something else we 've just learn from her attorney what be that if she die the bulk of her fortune about eighty million dollar go to Casey well we be afraid he be simply go to hand it all over to that cult I appreciate that information and um I wish I could say that I find something that we could nail they on but that be not the case I mean not yet anyway at least you should know that I 've see no evidence that Casey be in danger I be sorry to contradict you Mr Mars but I have substantial experience with these group the soon we get he off that farm the well if you be current strategy be not work perhaps you should try something new any relevant experience you can share I will be happy to consider it what be your background anyway if you do not mind my ask Technically my field be smspi systematic manipulation of Social and Psychological Influence one vulgar term be deprogramme no kidding I 've hear of that how do that work anyway in simple term I control the element of a subject 's social and psychological environment to eradicate undesirable mode of behaviour I be then able to instil or re instil desirable one I be quite good at my work yeah I bet we just want Casey back home again soon this be a sensitive situation and we ask that you proceed accordingly of course not to sweat you v but when will we see the FBI Swarms Coke Compound headline the case be dead in the water we find diddly squat on the Moon Calves and I seriously doubt that there be anything to find plus my dad catch I out at the farm so now it be seriously off limit Dang as if that be not enough I be start to doubt the whole rationale for what we be do Casey noxious overbearing 09er butthead Casey have become a really sweet guy and I think this so call cult deserve most of the credit sound to I Veronica like you 've be drink the Kool aid I have not you well recognize thank you for be my own personal Springer audience should I check myself before I wreck myself all I be say be be you may be get a little soft right and I be hey Veronica listen I 've get to go visit my grandma in the hospital after school do

we can not just blow this off Veronica they be contribute to the delinquency of a minor it be a serious crime oh please Dad you 've be around these people do you honestly think they be corrupt anyone I think they be exactly what they seem to be a bunch of sweet naïve sixty throwback that be possibly true but definitely beside the point even if they be the utopian sweetheart you think they be we do not answer morally or otherwise to the Moon Calf Collective we answer to our client who pay we to do a job and that job be to find the information they want hey Veronica Casey tell I you be out at the farm last night I wish you could have stay a while it be so beautiful the moon be so bright you could almost read by it Holly there be something you need to know about right now the thing be I work

really not a lot to say not to say it do not exist but it be pretty tough to fleece people since generally they do not buy property sight unseen except in the case of a reit true but there be still multiple safeguard in place a local assessor for instance make sure that all property be sell for fair market value so even if you bribe the assessor you would have to find a really unsuspecting buyer I suppose you could borrow against an inflated property to buy more property and then inflate its value and so forth and so on like build a house of card yeah I suppose it might work until somebody sneeze sell your casablancas stock what Mr Casablancas be artificially drive up his company 's value how do you I have see the fabulous sandpiper hotel and there be nothing fabulous about it and it be

lately at all Come on now sugar bring it on bring it on yeah just remember I when we use to be friend a long time ago we use to be friend Transcript Raceman Synchro BLueBeRRy www forom com Jury duty on Christmas break no sing along no poignant message of universal love and hope just cellphone out watch eyeball jacket leave on and a commitment to the sacred ideal of drive through express justice all right lady and gentleman the soon we get this over with the soon we get back to our real life first order of business I believe be to elect a jury foreman do I hear any nomination or volunteer all right hear no nomination I have a proposal this strike I as a fairly open and shut case so would anyone object to let the young lady serve as our foreman be a nice chance for she to learn about civic responsibility and the justice system Great all in favor of miss Mars as foreman raise your hand absolutely yeah we 've do a ton of upgrading on the security front since you be here for example no key anymore we be use magnetic card like you get in hotel reprogram they every couple day no worry about lose or copy key say bud can you give I a spot a spot yeah spot I up here Ahh endorphin rush man you know Keith you really should have do more to push fitness when you be here yeah I be go to get to that but crime fighting keep get in the way anyway you be say magnetic card right and level one clearance for senior staff only there be no nighttime access without write permission from I so to paraphrase you be tell I the Neptune sheriff 's department be a lock down square away citadel of security that be a little flowery but you can pretty much catch my drift I run a tight ship Keith and you look good do it that be why they elect I Keith I be go to need unrestricted access to your staff at all time absolutely we be here to please well in that case I will need personal info for everyone who work here personnel file tax return security access level e mail address browser history all that no problem buddy just say how high oh I will so the question be whether there be any need to deliberate at all um as Foreman I do not see how a quick review of the fact could hurt Briefly all right our defendant be Robby McKinnon and Hunter Hayes both 21 year of age both from well know Neptune family they be charge with aggravate assault in a november 5th beating of Anissa Vilapando age 25 as the prosecution tell it Anissa miss her bus after get off work at the Elite Touch car wash in downtown Neptune and decide to hitchhike she be pick up by McKinnon and Hayes on the way Anissa and the boy smoke some marijuana their weed yes then she say they ask she to join they in a motel room so they could party some more with ecstasy also theirs they strike she as harmless so she accept once inside the room they allegedly ask she for sex her statement say they get so aggressive she become frightened and try to leave Hayes then supposedly pull out a gun and force she back inside where McKinnon punch and kick she Hayes put the gun on the bedside table climb on top of her Ms Vilapando say she fight back manage to grab Hayes ' gun and fire twice into the ceiling the boy run off and the police pick they up the next day base on her description and the video from the motel security camera Ms Vilapando also say after the beating she stagger out to the second floor balcony and throw the gun over the rail this gun be never find note so the defense case the defendant both claim she be no victim but rather a hooker who offer they a 3 way for 80 buck but before they could get down to business a young african american man apparently her pimp kick the door in fire two shot into the ceiling and order they out the boy tell police the pimp seem to feel Anissa owe he money they leave the motel but assume he be the one who beat she I would like to remind everyone that this girl be a know criminal she be convict of forgery at age 15 and she be still on parole for be an armed lookout during a liquor store robbery note so final fact after the attack Anissa call an ex boyfriend name Ankwan Simmons he say she ask for his help but when the cop arrive he be still on the line neither of the defendant have a criminal record nor any gun register to their name after the shot the motel manager wait a few minute and then walk toward the room he testify that he see a young black man with a gun run across a parking lot and leap over the 6 foot fence surround the motel boy get some serious up yo now we get to the defense 's ace in the hole Young master McKinnon and Hayes have a very credible witness on their side a mr Carnell Myles who identify himself as Anissa 's pimp Mr Myles turn himself in to police after hear that a man fit his description be spot flee the crime scene his story match the boy ' version to a t how have I do so be we ready for a vote I say we make this simple Jot down your vote on a piece of paper fold it up and stick it in the hat and there it be one quick lesson in civic responsibility for I and an only slightly shorten holiday for everyone our resident alpha male be right about one thing the case do feel thankfully pretty open and shut our vote be 11 innocent 1 guilty I guess we will all see each other first thing in the morning well it be like I say these room be monitor closely in compliance with new security upgrade such as magnetic key magnetic key senior staff only right you ever lose a card so if somebody find it it be no good we change the code but you still need a card right Inga have the code in her drawer she can just make a new card right there but only if you have uh level one level one clearance senior staff only got to hand it to you sack you stay on message like nobody 's business if not for the little perspiration problem you would make a great white house press secretary yeah so security 's wonderfully tight and none of the senior staff take the tape themselves I know we all have well thing to do than pull jury duty over the holiday and I feel your pain do your pain affect 200 000 stockholder I be suppose to meet outsourcing contractor in Bangalore Care to tell they why their c e o could not show and while you be at it tell the sport fan of Neptune why the mind of Madison Harwell be miss from the airwave as a divorce mother of two take unpaid leave from her crap waitress job could I please suggest we get on with it right we be I be just wonder if our holdout voter would identify he or herself as a courtesy to those whose life you 've put on hold no problem big shot I be the one trash your quarterly earning I respect your honesty so I will be straight with you too be the racial stuff affect your vote be it affect yours fine but can you give we one solid reason we should see this girl 's story as even remotely credible okay here be one a ho that work her ass off all day at a car wash before hit the street that be just something I never hear of okay let us discuss I be not go to insult your intelligence Keith Don be a fine politician but as a lawman and administrator security around here be a joke that be odd he tell I security here be quite impressive he think so he lock himself out pretty often listen someone must have figure what those tape would be worth on the open market and what no it be nothing I be an idiot I 've be so hang up on Aaron Echolls and all this evidence

help I I just think we need at least an hour of holiday grab a seat you know elf we might not be the rich family in town but we can afford normal size bird once a year or so Game hen they be just so cute plus this way we will not have to eat leftover on new year 's that be smart thinking come on what do they taste like I do not know dense little turkey thank for do all this honey thank the three

yeah be not that the same computer you get I two year ago on the outside yes but this old beast have a new heart pulse inside her I be talk 512 gigawatt of ram an 80 something or other hard drive you do not know what you be say do you no but your friend mac promise I that it be all very state of the art thank dad you rock why do not you take it for a test drive what be this two story from 1999 date about 2 month apart and the man picture in both story Carnell Myles the same guy who now identify himself as Anissa Vilapando 's pimp be there anyone in town who do not know which trial I be on maybe the fella can help out a sport impair girl this Carnell Myles guy I keep think I 've hear his name but he be not a musician or an actor or anything I would know do he use to play something Damn you know I think you be right Matrix Myles incredible cornerback at San Diego state he got draft by the Bengals so how do he end up a pimp first day at training camp he blow out his knee Miss Foreman any idea how this no cartilage have ex jock manage to leap over that wall Hey sack I be not find that list of the e mail address for everyone on staff that I ask you for it be in the flap the flap right what flap the packet I give you I put it in there well I see a flap but it be empty I put it in the flap okay so Robert McKinnon the sport agent be Robby McKinnon 's father what do that prove it prove diddly but it beg some interesting question about how carnell myle got involve in all this be you suggest that Robert McKinnon pay his former client to take the rap for his son it happen trust I what good would money do a man serve 20 year for assault 20 year Mi hijo you get some funny idea about how judge deal with pimp who slap their hooker around six month maybe and be my theory really any crazy than the other way of look at it what other way that a pimp trick 80 hooker show up out of the goodness of his heart to save two rich white boy from do time but there be still the gun nothing tie it to the defendant we all see it in the hand of the guy run from the motel the gun belong to Anissa this should be good we know she have a firearm rap Parole in those case forbid you to own a gun the boy attack she she pull the gun they flee but if she admit the gun be hers it be prison for sure she have to ditch the gun before the cop arrive but she be too beat up to do it herself so she get her friend to do it Ankwan Simmons whom she call after the attack and who be see flee the scene 12 minute later with a gun so aside from the theory you just yank out of your imagination what tie the gun to ms Vilapando Process of elimination the guy run from the motel be not Carnell Myles so it could not have be his if it belong to the boy Anissa would not have need to hide it their fingerprint would have be on it as well as hers but that still leave Anissa and the antigravity guy we see hop the fence so unless that guy be in the room the whole time which neither the defense nor the prosecution have propose the gun be Anissa 's Inga can I what be this it be an anonymous e mail I just get for an offer of 50 000 for the tape sack do you get an e mail like this uh yeah just today we all get they I tell the sheriff get I another copy of that e mail list not too shabby for a guy with a surgically fuse knee true that now take another look at this photo of ankwan simmons from a

when you try to do the right thing just look like I be try to weasel out of my evil deed no the weasel be this basketball guy God I just want he smash hey the paper 's from the library the last thing I need be the librarian turn on I too and Rashard 's cool it be not like he be not like Cool um be we think of the same word because I do not remember say Steve McQueen ever hit a homeless man in his hummer and frame someone else for it no he be get this uncle he be like his father manager and enforcer these guy all lie that be get to be because of he Uncle Rucker pay them off or scare them look he be come here U C L A be try to recruit he if I could just talk to Rashard alone we be friend I be sure he yeah he would say excuse I you be stand between I and my money Man be there anybody you do not think be corrupt deep down yes you and I do not want you suffer for it because jail it be no fun what be no fun um jail oh I think you be talk about Mr Wu 's game show quiz no I be talk about jail so Wallace I have not see much of you since Chicago how be it it be all right a bit complicated I leave you a couple message but when I do not hear back I figure yeah I be just take some time but we

someone like that in my life right now answer no what you need in your life right now be a good lawyer do you know a good lawyer I know a lawyer right got it thank so it be call self surrender at the negotiate time five day hence Wallace Fennel will turn himself in to the Neptune sheriff 's department who will oversee his transfer to the Chicago police what if I be not there then they will issue a warrant you will be arrest probably find guilty and end up marry to some enormous murderer name tiny my advice be punctual or prove your innocence or that suit yourself all right so that be good good what in the same way that Rashard be cool do you know what any word actually mean I mean if I be clear in the next five day I be back on the team in time for the Penn High game Penn High how can you even think of the game right now rival school big game of the year I can not help it I be male well here be a message from the female you be nuts so let us see what be up for bribe Rashard into be a

booster dinner Booster dinner can we get in no but she say it be not uncommon to find certain slightly skanky girl lurk outside in hope of meet the big recruit and give that these recruit be teen male often succeed that happen so you think when I apply to coll no but it do seem like our good bet to get you to see Rashard Veronica what you get my future in your hand do not drop it I believe the correct response be how can I be of service Sir can you dig up the Murray file I guess now we need to destroy it what they reconcile how Mystery of love would be my guess a million dollar sorry I bang the maid ring would be mine what what no I do not want to see the one where you can see his take a look in the top right corner it be Terrence Cook and Miss Dumass the journalism teacher who die in the bus crash when you meet Terrence the day the bus crash what be he like um nice he sign stuff for people the usual sport star thing he also have some gambling issue gambling issue like lose 50 buck

drive anyone who could afford another ride off the bus I be just say keep in mind honey you be not the only possible reason that bus crash it always be a weird coincidence the rich kid live the poor kid die but why would someone want to kill the poor kid despite dad 's good effort I still feel like I be the only target that make sense so the drive through guy Guy Guy Abrutti that be his name
