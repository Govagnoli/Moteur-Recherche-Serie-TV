have here uh Kurt Holgate impressive record Holgate and his team just return from overseas they 've be stateside less than a month they be no long active service I will look up Holgate 's team but there be nothing in his history that would suggest he be the kind of guy to get involve in rob a drug dealer you be right he be not that kind of guy you sure you know this guy Sam trust I that be Holgate I should know I teach he another member of Holgate 's seal team David Ramirez be shoot and kill three week ago while walk out of a grocery store Police report say it be collateral damage from what be believe to have be gang related activity no that could be a coincidence and it could be a naval cluster bomb we get to proceed cautiously on this Holgate 's currently assign to a Joint Task Force over at the Federal Building think maybe it be time we pay your old friend a visit when be the last time you see this guy Bosnia you get history with he we be not date if that be what you be ask seal work together as a team Holgate have the tendency to act like a lone wolf if you know what I be talk about actually half the time I do not know what you be talk about and the rest of the time I just disagree I really look forward to have Dom as a partner you would miss I I complete you Hey Holgate Sam Hanna how the hell be you I be well it be be a while what be you do here Working Joint Task Force stuff hear you get out a while back How 's retirement it be still a few year off I be with NCIS now why you lose a bet I be just kid How be that work out for you it be real good sorry to hear about Ramirez yeah thank God 's get a cruel sense of humor I get to run we should uh get together over some beer sometime sound like a plan all right he do not ask you what you be do here no he do not here be the video of Sam 's seal friend Holgate Freeze back it up what do you think Nate he be try hard to appear relaxed and friendly but do not offer to shake your hand and the moment you say NCIS he deflect with humor nothing in his financial record to suggest any change in lifestyle I can get in touch with the coroner see if there be anything pertain to the crime scene that confirm seal involvement what you know like ballistic really you be throw that out there with a straight face ever since you profile the Dickinson case you 've have a thing for the coroner I do not know what you be talk about I mean she be hot but she work on dead body all day it take a certain kind of person Nate seem pretty lively compare to the stiff she be work on all right you know what your herd behavior be unbecome gentleman guy guy Timothy Jackson what about he he be another member of Holgate and Ramirez 's seal team in fact he be Ramirez 's swim buddy he be miss since the 18th that be the same night as the shooting that be Jackson 's trailer over there thank you I have not see he around lately though if Jackson be Ramirez 's swim buddy they be close than brother Swim buddy get you through seal training help you survive hell week I could use a swim buddy to deal with Hetty Jackson 's get a sweet trailer let us take a look around see if he be come home anytime soon too slow Secret Squirrel not a lot of place to hide anything hail hail the gang 's all here you recognize these guy we be in Jackson 's trailer that be my friend Holgate that be Ramirez who die in the grocery store so who be the fourth I do not know you be a seal where would you hide steal drug money underwater no because I would not steal anybody 's money drug dealer or otherwise and I doubt these guy would either you be the one who I d would holgate from the surveillance footage you do not like the thought there be dirty but you want to hear my theory these guy be stick overseas in some hellhole for month on end fight for their life watch their buddy get kill and for what to save some people who would just as soon slit their throat you know and if they do finally make it back they come back they realize a dealer be wear a watch it be worth more than the house so they use a little bit of what they know to take a little something back for their retirement I can see you be really intrigue by this seal do not do it for the money for the chick it be probably more like a calling like the seminary that be right if priest actually blow thing up and could kill you with a Bible be you try to get under my skin I be just bounce idea off you keep it up I be go to bounce you off a rock I will tell Nate you say that all right Eric Thanks yeah let I know if you find anything else all right bye GPS tracker activate Good Eric confirm Holgate 's work alongside Homeland Security on a human traffic task force what if Holgate 's not involve well for his sake I hope he be not I would not want to wind up on Sam 's bad side I think I already be what do you mean it just seem like nothing I do be ever good enough for he Sam demand the good from himself it be hard for he to accept anything less from anybody else you will get use to it it be just it be hard be the new guy try be the new girl they use to make I crawl into the air vent under house just because I be the small one when be the last time any of you have to put on a bikini for an assignment yeah that be right try hide a gun in your thong all right I just never think of it that way it be obviously not like that anymore I mean if you can prove that you can protect yourself and protect your team he will let up if Sam be hard on you in the office it be really just because he want to protect you in the field well of course either that or he genuinely do not like you head up Holgate 's on the move no look Kensi he be not look like we 've get a meeting Dom I can not see anything I be go to risk get close to hear what they be say give I the ear I be sure we will be fine let us not jump to conclusion it could be a coincidence you willing to take that chance what do you want I to do lay low stay off the grid and keep your head on a swivel they could already be watch we he be watch you watch I like he be paranoid or like he be check I out what be the difference well usually the amount of time focus on my butt he be paranoid no offense where be you at home that be funny 'cause I be look right at your car you lie son of a bitch who be she because I would like to carve the bitch 's name in your paint job and do not call I I will contact you when we be cool have Eric run these plate I think I just buy the owner some body work Great I 've get it thank fourth man in the photo be name Morris raspen if he be part of the team I be sure Ramirez 's widow know he Mrs Ramirez yes I be Sam Hanna this be my partner Callen we would like to ask you some question about your husband and his teammate you be a seal be not you yes ma'am I never ask he about his job I know it be dangerous he would always say do not worry baby you be not getting rid of I that easy never expect to lose he just run to the grocery store so he do not know the man who shoot he no they be drug dealer be you still in touch with the other member of his team seal take care of their own the wife be pretty close too those who have wife when be the last time you see Timothy Jackson he usually come by here Friday but he never show up he stop by to check on I and my son Tim and David go through BUDs together I think sometimes he be close to my husband than I be do you have any idea where he be when be the last time you see Morris raspen at the funeral he be the new member of the team I do not really know he excuse I I 've be comb through financial email phone record everything I can on Timothy Jackson nothing stand out I do not think it would but I can tell you where he be the day of the shooting his credit card be use at a place call the Sunset in Malibu all right thank so I open this guy up to do an autopsy and there be this miniature cuckoo clock where his heart should be still tick and as I pull it out it go off but instead of a bird pop out it be this little garden gnome he jump out of the clock flip I off and then run out the door I be more of an operational psychologist so I do not really do dream analysis but if I be to hazard a guess I would say that the clock obviously represent time and the autopsy death and yet there be this magical creature that live on inside he that be set free by your action so I help to release his soul yeah then why do he flip I off gnome notoriously cranky so uh no one have come to claim our friend the drug dealer ballistic be inconclusive no way to tell if seal be responsible two 9 mm slug to the chest from about 15 foot turn his heart into hamburger the shooter double tap he just left of center know the anatomy of a kill shot that be a professional so the same gun be use to kill both drug dealer there be only one drug dealer there be two victim you mean the cop we be tell that two suspect drug dealer be kill yeah the other victim be an LAPD officer bullet fragment too much to make a match why be not that in the report yeah well the guy be so deep undercover that we do not get the info until today those guy be cowboy I know the type why be we just hear about this

Jackson yeah he probably look a little rosy last time you see he we 've get you and Holgate argue with Jackson leave the bar together and then come back without he I think he hook up with a girl yeah there be no footage of that and his motorcycle never leave the restaurant maybe he go home with her he be lie actually he be try very hard not to lie by avoid definitive sentence I think he maybe he lie of omission be still lie you three do not rip off a drug dealer seriously that be what you think how about you and I tell each other something that we do not know okay I will begin one of the drug dealer that you kill be an undercover cop yeah where you go to expedite this process Sam stop do not go in there give Callen a chance we be waste time Sam I know you be angry and you take their action personally stop do I a favor and stay out of my head let us just take a step back and think about this seal have a word for that it be call retreat it be something we do not do now if he do not get anything from that guy by the time I get back I be go to jog his memory from the inside out be it too much to ask for a little peace and quiet it be Bach Bach can not you hear that what do I have to do to get through that impenetrable cranium of yours Sam I oh for the love of Gucci what be the matter with you man sorry I be just let off a little steam like the Little Engine that could I know you lose a target big deal it happen get over it so you hear about that of course I hear about it I know what you eat for breakfast sweetie you think Callen and Sam never screw up once Callen fall through a skylight instal a camera and land in bed with the target and ask Sam about the time he back over a suspect 's beagle puppy and do not you think they walk in here hold hand once I have to turn a fire extinguisher on they really no these be just charming anecdote I make up to bolster your self esteem and listen Pivot on your back foot when you punch otherwise you be lose all your power drop the gun you drop the gun I be an NCIS agent yeah well I be lapd and this be my crime scene I know the Navy be behind this not in any official capacity official unofficial either way the dead guy that wash up on the beach be one of yours my partner die here in my arm shoot by one of your man they be not my man then why be you here the surveillance video do not tell the whole story I want to walk through it for myself what be your excuse I be hope to find something that might lead I to my partner 's killer look like I do I want name and address full Navy cooperation unless you want the news medium all over a story about rogue seal go off the reservation and kill a cop he be right here I will tell he that be be Kensi still no sign of Holgate we 've either get to charge this guy or let he go and you do not even bring doughnut no I do not bring back doughnut I go back to the beach house to walk the crime scene what have you find this guy Grozen he be an lapd there be two undercover cop there recognize that guy should I he be an LAPD detective that be right there be two undercover cop at that drug deal if this guy be an undercover cop then he shoot his partner you be tell I that this guy shoot another cop this guy shoot this guy I be there but if this guy be LAPD then he be a dirty cop because I see he kill his partner so whose idea be it to go to the beach house or I will hand you over to LAPD okay see how those boy treat cop killers Jackson learn that one of the suspect in Ramirez 's death live there the guy be link to one of the Mexicali cartel be it why Jackson choose the restaurant it be close to the beach house come on Raspen I be throw you a life line here take it Jackson want to plan an op to go after the guy Holgate try to talk he out of do anything stupid he obviously do not do a very good job he be answer quickly with no real elaboration his visual accessing cue be consistent I think he be tell the truth Jackson keep talk declare a war on drug and that be what he be go to bring they and then boom he bail off into the water and you follow he we do not have a choice we figure a cold swim would probably sober he up but he be so fire up we could not catch he and by the time we do he be already at the house and have secure a weapon you be tell I that you go unarmed into the home of a dealer know full well that you be outnumber and outgunne it be a little improvised besides we know they have weapon we could just take theirs get to love seal where be Holgate now I 've tell you enough he could be in serious danger I be not worried about Holgate and I be not say anything else until I see a JAG lawyer Fair enough this be a bad idea trust I doc sometimes you get to let the big dog work it out let I guess you be the bad cop something like that unless you be a lawyer I be not talk to you so save your breath I be not a lawyer I be a seal what be our motto the only easy day be yesterday that be right now thing be about to get really hard for you forget how stupid you be you break the most sacred vow of all never leave a man behind okay that be good no matter what happen we never ever leave a man behind but that be what you do to Jackson we do not know he be shoot that be no excuse More of a reason to stay with he we try to help he he be struggle swim with the money Holgate take it you steal the money Jackson do he be go to give it to Ramirez 's widow one minute he be swim right next to I the next he be go you take the cash you leave he we search the water for he for a couple of hour where be Holgate I do not know do not lie to I I do not know slightly different technique you leave a man behind and you be about to do it again because if we do not get to Holgate before Grozen do he be go to wind up dead just like Jackson then you have the blood of two murder seal on your hand Holgate 's hole up in a motel in the Valley so guy how we go to get Grozen to confess when his own people can not because we 've get something Grozen want on the Sunset Strip in Hollywood Next up the big burner wake up sunshine Time to go to work hey remember I you shoot my partner the Navy want to prosecute as well whoever can give he the tough

he just return from a deployment in Iraq three month ago diagnose ptsd possible suicidal ideation anxiety disorder and because of his mental health history LAPD have already rule it a suicide we be investigate because Valdivia 's family be tight with their congressman the congressman call SecNav secnav call the commandant of the Marine Corps who call Director Vance it be the proverbial Pentagon Shuffle Downtown Apex be a high end party spot they mix a meaningful mojito they have the most marvelous pool on the roof it stay open all night and it be keep at a balmy 92 degree have you people never hear of a staycation do Valdivia have any kind of record in the service or out not even a parking ticket do he have a room at the Apex no but I get a hit on some turn on service notice for gas and electric the social security number match Valdivia 's look like he have an off base apartment Culver City what be he do with an apartment 90 mile from Pendleton certainly not take a staycation so

win beer and mustard you sure you do not live here meaningless sex with an endless stream of beautiful woman how empty this guy look depressed to you no suicide note it be like a post office in here what do you think this guy be send Guitar Hero what Receipts for the last two week for 20 40 60 80 160 copy of Guitar Hero all pay for in cash a bunch of mom and pop shop two and three at a time why buy multiple copy of a video game 'cause it kick major ass I will tell you one thing this guy Valdivia be overpay big time basically we 've get a dead Marine with no skill at volume buying you 've a little faith we 've get receipt ever play Guitar Hero I prefer the real thing Django Reinhardt Gabor Szabo a little hendrix throw in for good measure Dominic Vail I be like you more and more every day speak of video game Brandon Valdivia go off the roof here and land here 227 foot down normally determine cause of death in a high fall be about launch speed this one be more about angle and placement Valdivia land on his back relatively close to the building arm spread in what be know as the upturned crucifix position that be a long way down his body could 've flip over during the fall Unlikely but not impossible also he have a broken jaw from the fall not if he land on his back and there be no bruising on the face which indicate the break be fresh he be punch Brandon Valdivia be unconscious before he even go over the rail so someone knock he out with a shot to the jaw and throw he off the roof our suicide just become a murder it would take someone pretty strong to throw a 200 pound Marine off the side I get one camera up on the roof I be on it it be even well at night Most thing be I be the event coordinator for the hotel do you know Brandon Valdivia everybody know Brandon it be so sad be he a guest at a lot of these party Guest he be the host for the last three Saturday night Brandon pay for everything how much be we talk open bar hor d'oeuvres tray pass shot this week 27 000 in cash that do not surprise you who question cash do not ask do not tell Amy be his waitress I will be right back you wait on Brandon Valdivia last night he be not drink do you see he with anyone in particular just this guy he always hang with Alex I think I do not know his last name you ever see Brandon and Alex ever get into it or anything fight no they love it here especially Alex you know all you meet in this job be Eurotrash and wannabe actor Brandon be different he care about who I be where I be from he have a lot of money but mostly he seem like a nice smart guy now he be go and that suck I get customer your Alex be most likely Alex Walder he be Valdivia 's rackmate they be deploy together in Iraq and now they be assign to the supply unit the staff NCO in charge be Gunnery Sergeant Jerrold Mulhearn but he ship so much gear out of Pendleton that they call he Gunny Pallet like a pallet okay Great Sam and Callen be head to the base and Kensi 's come back here the quality 's lousy not good enough to run facial recognition what about the elevator Accessing last night 's footage now anyone push the top button go to the roof hello if only your vocabulary could be augment as much bust we move more gear out of here than any other dock in the Marine Corps 100 000 ton a year everything from TOW missile to toilet paper that be impressive any idea who would want to see Corporal Valdivia take a swan dive off a roof not a lick Kid be too stupid to have enemy I mean no offense to the dead but that rock could not pour water out of a boot with instruction on the heel what about his hoochmate Lance Corporal Walder dumb than a box of hair go into sick bay this morning probably swallow his toothbrush those two get along yeah like Dumb and Dumber Walder follow Valdivia around like a little lose puppy till last week they get up in each other 's grill end up roll around on the deck Figured I either have to pull they apart or turn a hose on they know what that be about no I just want it to stop appreciate it Gunny you look like you can still handle yourself you Marine Navy be out a while though well I be just an old box kicker so you can take this with a grain of salt but be a time when you could make most of these kid into regular Marines now if they be not gangbanger or convict they be just some other kind of major knucklehead it be almost get too hard to be worth it I hear you I say almost yeah right Brain dead Gunny Pallet say Walder go to sick bay no I check he be not there and he be not in his rack get I an I D on Alex Walder 's vehicle tell I if it be leave the base check that for you right now why buy multiple copy of the same video game when I see multiple purchase I think one thing resale People buy stuff and sell it online all the time all right so first we search for the item and then we see who have the most active listing big local seller be B Dog v in Culver City Brandon Valdivia he be buy the game for an average of 129 but sell they for half that at auction buy high sell low that do not make sense maybe they be fake no his feedback be perfect 100 right there maybe we be look at the wrong side of the equation can you compare the retailer where Valdivia buy the game to each other well we already know they be small operation they be not own by the same family if that be what you mean they be spread out all over L A County no discernible geographic pattern what about where the store get the game distributor wholesaler all right different wholesaler a few have the same distributor they all use different bank but each bank be wait for it on the Secret Service Counterfeit Currency Alert different bank different reporting that be why he go to different store and that be why it take Treasury two week to issue an alert Valdivia buy all those video game with what the Treasury be call top quality counterfeit bill I get to call you back thank Eric he buy they with the fake sell they online get real money in return not a bad little plan where be a 25 year old Corporal get high quality counterfeit Benjies Quality 's too good for they to be homemade he be probably buy them take a look at your laptop I be stream you something now I 've get a search go through Kaleidoscope and I get a hit on Alex Walder 's car where it just go off Pier 60 in San Pedro try to locate any survivor the accident be catch on a dockside security camera stunned onlooker watch in horror as the car go of the pier in the Los Angeles Harbor Valdivia gets toss off a building Walder take a long drive of a short pier and somehow they be all connect over counterfeit hundred you be go in right the police diver can handle it but you be a seal you 've be look a little pale lately maybe you should go too many bullet hole in I I would sink the tide 's go out the body could have float out after impact the current would have pull he away pretty quick you get any more security camera angle here at Pier 60 already check and the Secret Service want to talk to you about counterfeit bill stall they too late Natalie Giordano Secret Service I like your club house you guy get a secret handshake and a stash of girlie mag just Callen Nice to meet you Callen just Callen these be the bill that Valdivia pass 1995 series rotate serial number beautiful craftsmanship Portraits vignette ornament letter script scroll work not some Photoshop job either these be print in a press with real plate these be seriously tight we need to get into the distribution network and find out who sell these bill to Valdivia we be track a murder generally hundred show up in Las Vegas near the casino where no one bat an eye at big bill that be where I be station you ever get up to Vegas now and then hundred be double hard to counterfeit because they have to beat the pen on counterfeit note the detection pen react to the starch in the paper and turn brown so the print quality be amazing the paper be not so much that be why Valdivia pass it at the mom and pop store less likely to use the pen so I say it be an open book on everything we find I catch my counterfeiter you catch your murderer who know maybe it be one and the same be not it great to share well regardless I will be stay here until we get a collar on whoever print these can you recommend any good restaurant nearby FYI no salad I think room service be probably your good bet Room service really she do leave that door pretty wide open with the restaurant thing could 've drive a truck through it G I do not date law enforcement you might want to make an exception this time you know the rule if they get their own handcuff I be out I think you be make a big mistake the room service she want to order be not on the menu Eric tell I something good get into the traffic cam on the pier I pull this it be not the good image but it be good enough to see nobody in the driver 's seat a few people on the pier they see the car go over they run toward the crash except that guy he be walk away Zoom a zoom a zoom I run he through facial recognition hello Alex we 've get a broadcast beacon from Walder 's phone begin at the pier he check his voice mail then switch off his phone he be only do this four time but it be enough to track a pattern it run North up the 405 to the 10 East he could have hitch a ride or jump in the back of a truck nine minute ago someone check Walder 's cell phone voice mail from a pay phone on Wilshire and Western he be use pay phone now he think it be hard to trace he be move East and fast I mean what be Walder do what a good Marine be suppose to improvise bring up the L A Metro map I want to see the Purple Line he be on the subway next stop be the last one 7th and Fig a block away from the Apex Hotel why be he go

now he be terrify you be kid so why go back to the place your friend be murder he say he want to honor his friend Fear be a primal instinct it overrule everything include cerebral concept like like honor whatever take he back there be so important that he have to suppress his fear until he run into you guy and then the fear kick back in I do not blame he 'cause I would probably want to throw myself off a roof if I see you guy come at I too you leave a few thing out Alex what no you hear of Good Cop Bad Cop this be call Bad Cop Bad Cop he can do thing to you to make waterboarding feel like

everyone else on the team what other may view as the most inconsequential of thing can be a revelation to Callen a thread here a scrap there maybe this time a tiny piece of the fabric of his life and if it go badly well then you get to tell I I be wrong the Director get to rip I a new one and Callen do what he be always do survive okay let us see what Arkady have get for we our mystery man from

your bunkmate back G Love boat sail again not with I on board no I will be stay with a friend right wait a minute back in town less than 24 hour and you be stay with a friend it be Astonishing Astonishing that a person of such modest appearance and charm questionable personal hygiene be you know wrack up tail like want you Upstairs she say one point for whoever get up here first be you punke we 'cause you well not be no sir I would not do that then where be she I be everywhere Mr Renko or have you be on assignment so long you 've forget she be in Washington I apologize for not be with you but the political world beckon of course our work do not stop while Washington tinker so let us get to it Mr Beale please play the tape the man against the glass be a Marine reservist who work at an armory at Camp Pendleton do anybody else think this be weird we all think it be weird just check I hear that Mr Callen how Marine Lance Corporal Edward Mackaye Mackaye be garrote at the Cabrillo marine aquarium the entire incident be catch on something call a fish cam which broadcast 24 7 on the internet now this Mackaye he be a reservist would not that be a case for local pd I will leave that for Mr Renko to explain case be yours Mr Callen Mackaye be not just punch a time card he be my informant on the weapon case I 've be follow I 've get it all here over a three month period six Dragon antitank missile disappear somewhere between the manufacturer and Afghanistan interchangeable warhead small portable scary as hell we narrow it down to an armory at Pendleton Prime suspect be private Scott Riley now Riley be very smart we have not be able to hang anything on this guy have not be able to figure out how he get the Dragon off the base pull up everything you 've get on Mackaye that be when we approach Corporal Mackaye a good Marine stand up kid he work in the armory with Riley he be suppose to be eye and ear only let we know if Riley be up to anything suspicious and how be this connect to the militia group we know ELE be in the market for heavy firepower I 've be try to track down their base of operation for month but these guy just keep move around mostly border area just like the coyote exactly illegal come across ELE be right there wait for they we pull phone record go back a decade turn out our private Riley have a history with two of ELE 's suspect leader this be Malcolm Tallridge the charismatic founder his number two John Bordinay Paranoid nut job Brains and muscle we think that this be Bordinay behind the gun this video be leak onto the web last summer these guy chase 20 people into the desert all of they die of thirst include three child it do not bother they the death prove their point the situation 's out of control and they need to engage they claim to be protect our freedom we be hope to lock these guy down before they do something really crazy like arm themselves with Dragon missile I think maybe they just have welcome to DC Henrietta Director Vance Door to door service how out of character well people can change and I owe you one big time you do especially for force I to leave the child in charge how much trouble can they get into in eight hour be that how long I be go to be here good gracious you tell I they have a few question regard the security of your slush fund think of it more along the line of a friendly fireside chat about the efficacy of the funding disbursement process for the federal joint task force system why do not they just throw I in a well and see if I float this be not a witch hunt Hetty I recall the same thing be say to my predecessor before she disappear last I hear of Macy she be work out of a Quonset hut in Djibouti Mackaye would not have go into the aquarium to meet anyone not while it be be clean now what I be think be that someone be after he so he go into the aquarium to hide Bad guy go after he and splat Mackaye make his guest appearance on fish cam so Riley come to the beach our eye and ear follow he Eyes and ear gets make Bad guy go rogue he panic take he out why would the bad guy be here I mean there be no target to attack People be too spread out it be far too expose and it be lousy with law enforcement thank to the port across the way could you fit a Dragon missile into a sail bag with room to spare what be the chance Riley windsurf security footage from Pendleton so Riley leave the base in his suv with his windsurfing equipment on the roof rack and the guard check everything the front the back everything but they never open the sail bag Riley go to the beach and cover his track or maybe that be where he deliver the weapon they take his sail bag he take theirs Return to base repeat step one six time which be probably why Renko get nowhere you hear this Kensi yeah I be stare at Riley 's rig right now park outside his apartment where about Riley I have not see he yet you know what I be go to go have a sniff around see if he be be move explosive bad idea Private you start without I oh god you wander off to observe the scenery I be check Riley 's mailbox what no thank for save your ass my ass do not need save sure it do I be pretty sure it do not give I your hand if anyone 's ass deserve save it be yours I think you be steal my sail so you garrote I you whack my head into a car it be a tough neighborhood you could have have a friend or a gun turn out you have both why do not you just tell I about your involvement with ELE who the guy you sell the Dragons to should she be alone in there with he I mean he be huge Riley 's big and strong but she be mean we search his apartment there be nothing of value there Eric and Dom comb through his bank account his credit card if this guy be getting pay he be have some serious self control Riley manage to get a Dragon off a secure base on 6 different occasion that be smart but when your guy Mackaye follow he Riley kill he on fish cam not so smart it be impulsive desperate I do not know I just get the feeling the game 's change he be lie he be stonewall and he be mess with I sound like you on a second date nothing you will ever have to worry about even use a different cord for his creepy garrote MO there be one thing I be sure of he steal the missile and he kill Mackaye this guy be part Tim McVeigh part 9 11 bomber he will never betray his cause Freeing America but

with a crowbar and leave no forensic evidence the case with zero forensic be rare like every few year kind of rare and this be 14 in two year have any of the local PD 's pursue this Phantom theory not one can you believe that serial killer be either organize or disorganize this guy be organize in leave no forensic but completely disorganized in everything else Random victim weapon location it just do not look like one single killer he make it look random on purpose that be how I know that McEllon be a Phantom victim not just the no forensic part but he never repeat himself like he be never cut the neck of a 40 year old white guy before you 've spend a lot of time on this if you wanna get my attention show I a crime scene and tell I there be no clue we have a clue this guy case the house three day before the murder he be not the kind of guy to let himself get catch on camera but 3 day prior scope the place out maybe he be finally slip up I be just curious why you pressure Vance to

need in a room to have an even chance that 2 of they have the same birthday I do not know 182 and a half only 23 and with 57 people it be a 99 chance that two of they have the same birthday true randomness include repeat a truly random group of murder would have at least two white male in their 20 or two gunshot death or two stab death but there be no repeat it be hard to do if the M o be to make it all appear random why kill McEllon when there be so many other easy target and if it be the Phantom then he change his m o now why would he do that good news Flagstaff PD 's go back to their

cam Anything Ross get a coffee and a muffin then stop to buy the L A Times before hit the ATM what kind of muffin seriously you can tell a lot about a person by their choice of breakfast pastry take Sam for instance Spicy Cinnamon ignore he if Santa be work the day of the bombing he might have see something maybe our guy be on his naughty list wait hold on I check already there be nothing what do you got the call that trigger the bomb in Ross ' cell phone originate in the same cell site which mean that the caller be within half a mile or so of the explosion could have be close than that he might have be watch Killer could have get a prepaid phone to make the trigger call I already trace it it be a dead end the killer use a prepaid cell phone place the call then throw it away there be no way to track it be the trigger phone still in service it do not appear to be probably turn it off before he toss it you can remotely reactivate it right do it so I will try to find the cell phone see if we can pull some print track it back to where he purchase it we will go check out Ross ' house the most obvious suspect be go to be someone in Ross ' bomb disposal unit but we can not forget that he also study chemical engineering so what one of his fellow student have a beef with he he cook up explosive and wire his phone I think that Eric need to do a background check on everyone in his class just in case you will have to excuse the mess my wife be suppose to help I pack up his thing Asher be our only son she be just not ready yet we be very sorry for your loss sir there may be some

yellow one for I Tricky switch the color just to be difficult on three go for it one two three Bet you do not wake up this morning think you might get blow to hell can not say I do how do you find it it be luck I know I have a tranny leak so I roll underneath to take a look and there she be still get use to the leg Glad it do not slow you down in the business Wall Street take care of that be that why you do not pay Ross back the money he lend you that be why you be here you think I kill Ross so I do not have to pay he back just cover all the angle where be you last Thursday Working alone and Asher Ross save my ass more than once he be the only one who take a chance and loan I the buck to get start I get a little behind on my payment you think I would kill he over that any idea who would I be go to need to take that back for analysis do not drop it this be what be leave of Asher Ross ' laptop from the explosion get anything off it it be go to be tough preliminary forensic show Ross ' cell phone fragment have trace of HMX HMX be a military grade explosive it be expensive and hard to get which mean our bomber need access or he rip it off I will check for any report of theft all right the killer have to have access to Ross ' cell phone in order to wire it with an explosive without Ross know what about the cell phone that Sam find nothing prepay no print Killer must 've wipe it clean before toss it keep work on that laptop Eric Ross and King be on the same bomb disposal unit for nine month that sound like a short time consider the burnout rate they be old timer disable bomb that can blow you with the slight mistake take it toll work often result in ptsd King appear to be cope give all that he be suffer some of the more severe symptom might take month to manifest Untreated it can cause massive personality change depression aggression enough to blow one of your buddy ' head off if you 've get a beef it be not out of the question Full Windsor really again with the tie I have you peg more as a half windsor kind of guy be that suppose to have some sort of mean you be the psychologist should not you be work on that somewhere a little more secure like where I do not know a room with armor plate wall come to mind Light 's good in here I will buy you a lamp King say it be defuse he seem to know what he be do relax the million dollar question be do you know what you be do this be not good he hide a secondary micro detonator inside it have a mercury switch do not anybody move sorry about that Full Windsor it be a Christmas miracle we get something off Ross ' laptop he have lunch two day before he die with Stanton Olin who be another member of his EOD unit in Iraq that be access and ability if Olin 's get motive he be our guy it be not really a miracle it be just I do what I do that shirt be awesome what be up dude Psych evaluation be come up in a few week and I will be interview the team member and for that you need my signature and who interview you Mr Getz it do not work that way do not seem fair somehow do it what do you do to your tie I spill something on it should I get it dry clean that be an option Soda water I would recommend either donation or incineration not in that order you do not like this tie it be a gift obviously not from a love one come on let us go cheer you up you be wonder about the suit no a man do not need a excuse to be fashionable and besides you look so professional I try the whole West Coast casual thing I think it be work against I you know with the agent I know undercover work be difficult and dangerous I know they 've be force to take on role and do thing that they be not proud of but they think that bury memory be well than talk about they Come let us try a half Windsor this time it can make such a difference there you go you know in my experience if you be patient soon or later the people who need to talk will seek you out often under the guise of some other intention you just have to listen I could pull off a bow tie not without a red rubber nose and those big floppy shoe Olin 's get quite the view he can sit on his porch at night and watch the drive bys Olin Federal agent stop come on Eric we need an ambulance so your buddy Ross gets kill we turn up and you take off why do you run Someone be be follow I Ross mention anything about be follow Nah he just say I be be paranoid now who be be paranoid who be do this who want we dead footage from an LAPD traffic cam not likely trigger by a timer there be no way of know exactly when he would get back into his car again it be not rig to the starter otherwise it would 've blow up as soon as he turn the key could 've be remote detonation same as Ross rewind back window of the car clean it up Eric probably some neighborhood kid wash I thing like that you know when I be in high school I write I wish my girlfriend be this dirty on my principal 's car I think it be pretty funny until I got expel it be from the Qur'an Al Maeda chapter five verse ten those who reject our faith and deny sign shall be companion of hellfire seem like Ross and his buddy might have bring back more from Iraq than they realize I be here to help you Olin but you will to have to trust I it be my fault Ross be dead why do you think that because I do not try hard enough to convince he that something be go on he shut I down so I stop try maybe it be because you do not want to believe it yourself sometimes it be easy to pretend something be not happen than to face it yeah well I just face it okay just like I face it every day out there every day my partner and I spend a little time in Fallujah we be augment a Marine Expeditionary Force more bad day than good one the last thing I want to do be talk about it but it help the only way to quiet it be to get it out I be afraid if I give it even a glimpse of light it will swallow I I know I guess everyone deal with it differently King throw himself into his business I find God Ross do

tough time who know maybe it will help you someday thank you I appreciate it he would have be very proud and you look like you could use some tea this be a holiday blend with cinnamon and safflower petal well thank you you be welcome congratulation it seem you may have catch our mad bomber you do not seem very thrilled I mean yes I hope so I just wish that you know what I do not know I just think that when it come to go undercover I deal with the danger a lot well than the deception I see like with Hastings King for example today some of what I tell he be true some of it be a complete lie and some of it be a be a combination of both deception you perpetrate be a necessity you need to embrace it not fear it I be sure your father would agree anyway if man want the truth all the time I would not have a french maid 's outfit in my boudoir would I you have a just drink your tea dear heart Forensics report be in on the explosive two different type be use two tell I about Ross and King Ross and King let I couch surf between their two place you and Ross be friend Ross save my life he save Olin and King too when he pull King out the guy 's leg be still underneath I Ross pull Olin

not you order she to step away from the vehicle and when she do not you shoot a mother and her baby there be no baby she be carry a 60 millimeter mortar shell wrap in a blanket with a hand trigger and I do not shoot she Olin do he save I he save the old lady and everybody else for half a block Olin shoot a suicide bomber ask King check your patrol log if you do not believe I do Olin ever talk religion to you he be a Christian but he could quote the Qur'an or the Talmud as easily as the Bible I be get a bad feeling about this we get the forensic from the bomb in Ross ' cell phone King 's truck and Olin 's car Ross 's cell phone and King 's car bomb be both high grade explosive tetrahexamine tetranitramin but the explosive in Olin 's car be trinitrotoluene it be a much low grade right and it be a shape charge under the rear of the vehicle point away from the driver so it blow out of the car instead of in so basically it look convincing but whoever set it must have know it would not kill Olin Everything Olin tell I be either a grossly distort memory or an outright lie he read and write in Arabic he could write the note on the car Tariq be not the bomber Olin be what be the chance this place be wire I would say between 99 and 100 always the optimist all right room 's clear Olin you in there Agents Callen and Hanna we be come in to talk wait pressure pad thank Clear get a list

kill you outside the club you recognize he he might have be with the man who grab I in the club last night but I can not remember you suffer a concussion it be not uncommon for the event immediately

religious lecture I do not know I do not attend I keep tell you I only go there to play basketball do Safar have a last name Jaddalah bear in Algeria raise in Libya Safar Jaddalah 's file read like a who be who of islamic militant group he be move around a lot and he be suspect along with other Al Qaeda member of having enter Sudan to train the Janjaweed Devils on horseback with gun they 've trade in their horse for suv and upgrade their weaponry so what be Safar do in L A I doubt he be audition for American Idol Recruiting alienate and impressionable young man just like that group of somali teen in Minneapolis take they back indoctrinate they and get they to fight his jihad well maybe he hire Cesar Vargas to smuggle he into the country he probably come in over the mexican border pass himself off as a mexican American and kill Vargas to tie up any loose end what be a religious fundamentalist do in a strip club the 9 11 hijacker do the same thing before their attack well last night 's incident could have be a glitch in an even big plan and Deng Oyat be prepared to die to protect it Deng Oyat do what Safar order he to do Alert Homeland Security and brief Director Vance I will put Safar 's face out there talk to the other agency and local law enforcement see if they have anything find this guy how well do this kid moe know Safar he do not he know of he and how do you know the

everything let go of I sit down you want to run fine I will call my buddy at ice I will have you on a plane to Kiev what do want from I the truth would be a good place to start your boss Dallas all these be his yes and for the man who be shy and insist on light be off night vision Blackmail who anyone who might have something to hide or something that Dallas want know he at the club yes at your house Dallas tell we he be a very special vip they call he a buyer I do not like where this be head Dallas 's girl compromise military personnel with access to classified information Dallas then decide to sell that information and Safar buy it maybe to help plan a terrorist attack why would Safar have someone drive a car into Dallas ' club Somewhere along the line the deal go sour we get to get a look at Dallas ' video collection Search warrant no Safar find out the club 's be raid he be go we will never find out what he be up to until it be too late okay so how do we get in her hello there Lookie here hey baby stand by G she be on her way in How 's Dallas react like his good girl just get back and he do not expect her Katya say Dallas ' hard drive be in a storage area off the

be go to have fun one for the vip room give we a good show all right let them go through she be come through okay that be my girl get at least three camera Sam possibly more we turn on the jammer Dallas be not the only one who be go to lose picture I be go to need about a 20 second burst to get I out the door and down the hall 20 second burst initiate now go Nineteen Security card third door down on the left twelve Seven he need to be down the hall now six five four two one Zero Jammer 's off tell I you be in the kitchen G you read I we get picture no audio accessing computer now where be he everybody out out I get company Sam do not move do not move Kitchen 's close how be that for a lap dance you get a warrant to go into my place FISA warrant Terrorism investigation I be not a terrorist I be a patriot be that why you fall out with Safar be that why he attack your club all good question for my lawyer he be smug I hate smug Guy think he be go to walk out of here be he go to walk out of here it depend what be on those tape there he who be he I think he be a senator which one okay maybe he be a congressman another one for the maybe column what do we get at least a dozen identify include two senator the CEO of an aeronautical company a former child star and four senior military officer and we be only a third of the way do Safar not yet keep look you do not need to keep look this investigation be over they be shut we down all evidence physical and electronic be to be send to DOD what about Dallas we be under order to release he immediately we be put together a good case here okay a big one Hetty Safar 's up to something we can not stop now this be come from on high when I say on high I mean those with the political venom to end the career of each and every one of we include Director Vance I can not believe this all we need be a little more time I know I know if I may slip into the vernacular it suck but when you hear from I again in an hour or so you will shut this down do not forget to release Mr Dallas guy you 've get to see this fire it up on the big screen I do not think we want this up on the big screen so look what I find on Dallas ' sleaziest home video I be guess Safar 's imam would not approve of that definitely haraam what be that it be arabic it mean forbid no no what be that whatever it be it can not be good for you come on I be in up to my knicker now Dallas be an extortionist once he get these guy on the hook there be no tell what information he get out of they technology money secret he be a clearinghouse for confidential information Safar must have know this he go to Dallas for something specific weapon intelligence maybe both maybe as part of their deal Dallas offer Safar a night with one of his girl as a sign of good faith it be disgusting but perfectly probable so Safar be be blackmail like everybody else but why would Dallas blackmail Safar if they get a deal go Dallas be a criminal but he be not a traitor it be not like Safar could go to the police he could drive a car into the club interesting theory but Safar be a terrorist he be not Miss America why would he care if anyone have a sex tape on he despite the feculent content he be recruit idealistic young man to fight a holy war for Islam if a sex scandal can bring down a Democrat what about a devout Muslim on the road to martyrdom could not he just denounce it as fake publicly sure I be guess if that get out Safar 's sleeping on Salman Rushdie 's sofa so you think you can lure Safar out of hiding with this tape but you do not even know where to find he I need to get a message to Safar some of you listen to his teaching and know how to reach he a friend of mine have something he want all the information he need be right here all right just plug it in my friend 's number be on it carry on gentleman begin to think you be not go to show up hope you bring cash 'cause I do not take traveler check I be not pay you or Dallas or anyone be that what you come out here to tell I look you know the deal Safar either you pay I 50 000 or your little sexcapade go out on CNN Al Jazeera and the Home Shopping Network not if you be dead

everything on Kristin Donnelly 's fianc√© Tommy Boyd and skeleton in the closet five year at Folsom State Prison for armed robbery serve his full sentence release in 2002 anyone else think Kristin 's

unseal Kristin have no idea she be marry an ex con you do not know that I know she she would never go down that path again it be not your place to look out for her she be a part of this case and Boyd just drop into her life after I leave it could be a coincidence somebody drop a hammer on Gale and Donnelly Perez make hit from prison it be a good theory it be not the only theory do you think it be Boyd or do you want it to be Boyd just as you say I will be okay what be this I be think Ping Pong Ping Pong more specifically a Ping Pong night yeah for the team out and not to brag or anything but I be really good fortunately for you it be easy to pick up serve it up there you go how be the case Callen want to work alone Behavior that conflict with one of the fundamental tenet of a Navy SEAL 's psychology teamwork one of the fundamental tenet of G Callen be to tackle thing solo it be the way he make sense of the world he be be do it his whole life you debrief he after every case you know what be not in the file and that be all you be go to say that be all I can say if it affect NCIS it be my job to speak up but as far as the innermost thought of the field agent be concern it be my job to make sure that they stay confidential he trust you more than anyone else Sam what if he do not need my help this time you will be ready to offer it anyway what about the girl Kristin Donnelly nothing he can not handle do I mention I have one of the sick topspin serve you 've ever see Ready Sure free lesson yeah I just get I get to warm up next time 'cause I get I have this this rotator cuff thing you ever get that like when you be in the gym probably not beat your ass at Pictionary thank you sir right this way ma'am this be not a social call how do you guess the flower be not nice enough to warrant a same day visit I hate flower but the gesture do not go unnoticed what branch of NCIS be you with anyway I make an inquiry and got hit with the kind of clearance request you would expect from Langley there be be another shoot Jon Donnelly we think Montrell Perez may have have something to do with it may I ask why I can think of about five million reason a less tactful attorney might suggest your effort be well spend try to locate this allege hit man rather than assign blame to a prisoner already serve his time Perez be a legitimate suspect and if you still want we to support his appeal he need to tell we everything he know he tell I he would talk to you anytime so long as it be face to face and they say chivalry be dead just run it through my office first of course thank you for the flower you say you do not like flower I kind of like that you send they what be you do here Kristin do not know do she know what that you got send to Folsom State Prison for a liquor store robbery that leave the owner paralyze look I be 18 I be not the guy who pull the trigger and it take a hell of a lot more than talk like a cop to rattle I she will leave I if she find out she be have it with people who disappoint she how have you meet at a bar what do you want from I I want you to convince I that you have nothing to do with Jon Donnelly 's murder that liquor store thing I be a kid catch up with the wrong crowd all right it be not an excuse it be what happen but I serve every day of my sentence we all make mistake we do but one mistake I will never make be walk out on Kristin that be more than I can say for you whoever you be at least he do not shoot you there be that you mind explain how this visit be connect to our case be my partner interrogate I your partner be watch your back something 's wrong with this guy it be just he be get some demon do not we all he say he meet Kristin in a bar but it just feel like there be more to it then there probably be but he do seem to care about Kristin and the boy I do not know four year ago walk away seem like the right thing to do but I tell she so many lie the deep you get the easy it be to leave the lie in place and just disappear the good thing you can do be find the man who kill her brother I get a call from Miramar Naval Brigg Perez just get a visit from Andres Rodriguo AKA Icy Andres he be a Fourth Street Flats enforcer who be a prime suspect in I do not know eight homicide now unfortunately police can not make anything stick due to the fact that witness against Senior Icy tend to suffer from such malady as unnatural strangulation untimely dismemberment and unfortunate spill down empty elevator shaft be I the only one who think he deliver that information a little too cheerfully hey do not hate I love my job Question Perez again but do not tell his lawyer let us see how he do without coach go behind Corby 's back Intrigue Betrayal this be get good sometimes he be so cheerful I just want to punch he Repeatedly since Corby say Perez will see you anytime then he do not need to know have another sit down smile a lot look like you be interested be still my beat heart another chance to hear the late penitentiary pickup line we dress you in something tight he will be so bewitch and bother he will not even notice when you plant this little bug on he Nice you put that on just for I Sure I do Jon Donnelly be kill in a drive by shoot this afternoon it be tragic you be the only one in that crew that be not dead and you do not seem to be too scared about be next scared right I be a big dog in here untouchable to most do you like have I here then give I something I can use or I be go what do you want to know what happen to the money you steal off the record Sure we steal five mil four point five of which I never see again what happen to the difference in a bank get my name on it I be go to tell you something I have not tell anybody before not even that JAG lawyer of mine Corby four year ago the night before the trial I get a phone call Guy on the line be wear one of those voice distorter thing he tell I I be go down but I could walk away with some cash if I do my time keep my mouth shut do you have any idea who it might have be could have be any of a dozen guy who know Bunch of my old Flats boy maybe even this bent MP name Tedrow Gale and Donnelly say they get call too they tell the guy no Thought they would do their time get out find the money guess they be wrong be that all for today you think I be come back I sure do it will be like silence of the lamb only you be hot than the FBI chick and I be a lot smart than the creepy old killer guy call I our killer start work on his plan four year ago he speak to Perez and the other before the trial call I you see that sound like he have inside information on the case they all like the bad boy you know that you promise you would run all visit with Perez through I first I be sorry someone must have screw up at the office Munro what be it with you man you jealous I be try to kick it to this hot agent man in your dream no you see the way she touch my shoulder man Perez Perez get a medic now get back in there his pulse be fade fast what happen he start choke and collapse who be the man on the phone Perez who take the money it be too late he be dead initial toxicology result indicate that Perez be poison Sodium cyanide it be a colorless salt that induce cardiac arrest slip it into someone 's food or drink and it can take hour to kill they I get something on Kristin Donnelly 's fianc√© remember that seal case on Tommy Boyd 's record the DUI he get as a minor I finally manage to access the court record and get it unseal Tommy be acquit due to a technicality his court assign lawyer discover an error in the arrest paperwork and get the prosecutor to seal the case that be pretty good for a public defender it be Neil Corby Corby 's a former Navy Petty Officer after graduate law school he go the public defender route for four year and then decide he be a military man at heart next stop be JAG Perez say he do not tell anyone about the phone call but Corby know about it so either Perez be lie to I try to make I feel special or Corby know more about this case than he be let on I hate flower you and Neil Corby and do not hold back what you bring he along to lay a beating on I be that what this be he save my ass on a DUI charge when I be 17 I owe he I keep in touch I mean the way my life be head I figure I could use a lawyer who be a buddy and four year ago he he call in the favor he want I to get close to a girl Kristin Donnelly the woman you supposedly meet in a bar no I do he tell I where she would be and he send I in why to keep tab on her brother Jon apparently he just got send to prison and Corby seem to think that he might have know about miss money but as far as I could tell Jon do not know anything and neither do Kristin and you fall for her when she tell I she be pregnant I figure it be mean to be she and that boy they be my family I mean it do not matter how it start they be all I care about now be she in some kind of danger from Corby why should I believe you 'cause you be not the only one that care about her Corby represent Perez in the trial he have inside information about got to the money switch it to another account get nervous that Donnelly might find out so he hire Boyd to keep an eye on he but in the end it be Joey Gale who put it all together we would well talk to Kensi yeah thank thank you for meet I I have to apologize I be very sorry about Perez well this be not exactly the way I envision our first date but the case have hit a dead end there be another guy who got arrest four year ago a crooked MP Jason Tedrow I read his name in the case file he just got release from Charleston all right I will check he out I already do several time every time I go to Charleston to visit one of my client over the past 4 year I make it a point to try to meet he one time the warden tell I Tedrow be in the infirmary another time Tedrow be on work duty he be even in solitary once with Jason Tedrow it be always something Man 's like a ghost so now that he be out you can see why I 've take an interest yes certainly do sound suspicious it do I start consider all the possibility with Tedrow and I land on this one there be this story it be pass around the JAG guy NCIS have an undercover operator who can turn himself into anyone at any time for any reason get his man then he be go like some urban legend do not even have a real name just Callen yeah I be not a huge fan of urban legend I know there be an undercover NCIS element involve in the case 4 year ago I think Jason Tedrow and Callen be the same guy which mean you be wear a wire and he be listen to every word of this so either he show his face right now or I pull the trigger and leave you bleed out all over that seat why be Boyd here what be you do I follow you from your house I be make sure you do not hurt Kristin she do not know where the money be turn around walk away look whatever favor I owe you be pay it be not that easy yeah I figure you would say that he be

FBI DEA and ICE they 've all call to offer their help work they Cross reference threat to their agent see if there have be any similar abduction do whatever you have to do to find he by whatever mean

how be your research go very well I think I would be rusty after all of these year but I be able to isolate several gram of clostridium botulinum last week Botulism most dangerous toxin know to man would either of you gentleman like some lemonade Excellent what about CDC I never want to be an Army wife but I be in love with my husband there you go you be so kind thank you Steve it be Sam ma'am you be welcome Sam I be so sorry sometimes I think I would forget my head if it be not attach it be fine it be okay so you enlist and wound up work in the Army 's medical unit yes now that be an old boy 's network back then that be so nice of Steve to bring tea be you marry let us talk about a handsome young man like yourself I work a lot that be Kensi the coroner have confirm it be botulinum poison Director Vance Homeland Security and CDC have all be alert along with local medical service and HazMat be do a sweep of Esther 's place who know what else granny be cook up there should Nate be wear a mask no he be safe you do not catch botulism from other people but we might have be expose because we be in the lab you feel okay yeah nothing a couple week of vacation can not cure I hear that you be very tall my husband Marty be tall he die of a heart attack at Santa Anita several year ago he love the pony let us talk about your work at Fort Detrick in the late ' 60 bacterial purification the work we do revolutionize the production of antibiotic and other drug and what about your most recent work I be long retire and your research at the lab lab where your two driver take you I forget about that I help they isolate protein a neurotoxic protein produce by the bacterium c botulinum yes of course that be it thank you for remind I why do they need the botulinum toxin Antidote research so our boy in uniform will be safe she seem like just a sweet old lady she be a sweet old lady someone trick she into create biochemical weapon would you excuse I a moment well I think she be delightful and extremely dangerous she be suffer from Alzheimer 's she remember the ' 60 and ' 70 in vivid detail but have memory lapse about more recent event all right well it be one thing to forget to feed your dog it be another when you forget security protocol and you be deal with bioweapon she may be responsible for those man 's death or the person behind this use what she create to tie up the loose end and if that be the case she could be in danger Botulinum be a neurotoxin protein very popular in Hollywood where it be know as botox kill the muscle that cause wrinkle for that do not I look 20 even though I be 50 look it can also paralyze your breathing muscle and you suffocate to death in fact it be the deadly substance know to man the housewife of Beverly Hills should be classify as biochemical weapon do you guy know what LD50 be it be the median lethal dose the amount of toxin need to kill half the people expose low the LD50 the more dangerous the substance exactly now the botulinum toxin have the low LD50 there be so a sample only this small could kill up to a quarter million people and if what Esther tell we be accurate then she isolate enough to kill ten time that she be like the evil Martha Stewart only she be not evil she be vulnerable because of her Alzheimer 's and whoever be behind this know that they seek she out and trick she into think that her expertise be need for National Security yeah she be an easy mark but an unreliable witness poor thing she must have enjoy the company and attention the real question be who be behind this and where the hell be the toxin we may have a lead remember this guy Ian Albers I 've be try to well he use to be a bouncer at club Halo for our old pal I know I recognize he maybe he be move on from blackmail to deal in bioweapon you think Dallas be behind this if he be he be go to wish he be not Dallas close the Halo club after the Safar incident he be be keep a low profile since apparently not low enough the dude be already prove he have friend in high place and low place he be go to call his buddy to shut we down like last time he be not go to cooperate at least not willingly and get this supposedly he replace his security with a bunch of retire east german secret police the late Hollywood accessory a special op security team Hetty any suggestion on get Dallas yes I suggest we do not have this conversation Forget diamond in this business plausible deniability be a girl 's good friend now sit down and say ah Hetty honestly I be fine asset protection be part of my responsibility and you be an asset when you be not be a pain in the asset now open wide what be that for it be a healthy gag reflex it be the first thing to go in botulinum poisoning stop laugh you be next Dallas hide his electronic footprint pretty well he be hard to find for the record I walk away 30 second ago he always be careful last time we have to go to his club just to look at his computer yeah but he do not hide his credit card at least not well enough to hide they from Eric apparently the crime syndicate be recession proof five day a week Dallas have be get massage at a place call the Ahimsa retreat what be that a wonderful day spa they have the good foot rescue package it be like send your toe to Heaven I be not through with either of your evaluation Hetty we be both fine we really need to move on this well then you will just have to make it quick you look good in a robe I look good in anything ready yeah what the hell relax do not be so tense you have no idea who you be deal with Come on be

biochemical weapon specifically botulinum toxin Come on I be not involve I do not ask you if you be involve I say I want information now you get 2 second to come clean or I guarantee this massage will

down Ladies and gentleman I give you the Dutchman Aka Jacobus Troyger aka Sebastian Boon aka Jurgen Vanderveer aka yada yada the guy be get more alias than Callen somehow I doubt that european terrorist technically he be an arm dealer he sell weapon to radical and insurgent ipso facto he be a terrorist and he be in L A I have not be able to find any record of he enter the country he probably use an alia that be not on our watch list then enter through a port which do not have a facial recognition system in place if he be stay to sell his bioweapon there be a good chance people come to buy it I will check with Homeland Security and border control I will contact Interpol see if they pick up any chatter or track any movement overseas Eric check the flight manifest port surveillance we might just get lucky Mr Callen a moment if she put on her rubber glove run Hetty I appreciate the concern but I draw the line at turn my head and cough I be go to pretend you do not say that now first how be our elderly bioweaponeer Esther Balmore get her medical evaluation oh good that be first what be second your partner Sam have be reluctant to weigh in on the selection for a temporary agent Sam do not play well with other and he do not like to share his toy but time like these only emphasize the void leave by the absence of Agent Vail however temporary Sam be eternally hopeful that Dom be go to return to his post Sam see the glass as half full I see it as half empty it be why we make a good team Kensi just drink right out of the bottle Nate wonder why it be a glass and Eric break the glass by put his foot up on the table nevertheless I want his input if only to begin to move he forward maybe you could give he a little nudge big guy do not like to be nudge I will be gentle thank you tell I something good Sam be right Interpol have various person of interest who be stop boarding plane bind for L A in Berlin London and Madrid we put LAX on full alert and we get a hit Simon Amputuan he be a Filipino militant with tie to Abu Sayyaf also know as Al harakat Alislamiyya or Islamic Movement they 've be wage a bloody campaign of kidnapping bombing and assassination

telemarketer that be almost bad I do not appreciate your racial profiling this be not about race Mr Amputuan it be about terrorism like your involvement with the 2004 SuperFerry bombing kill 116

in trouble he would 've take this and bolt not put on his uniform and head in to work could 've leak the convoy route got pay thought he be in the clear or he cross the wrong person along the way yeah but who and where 250 000 sequential serial number that kind of money a guy could buy a lot of sequine glove he wear it on stage it have sentimental value you can not put a price on that what be your opinion a man who own a sequined Michael Jackson 's glove the King of pop I like he already who be he what be the word from Treasury Serial number come from the shipment of reconstruction fund steal by the Jihadist Raiders Front in Baghdad the attack be last month it be plenty of time for Jeffcoat to get back to he one of the key you find on Jeffcoat 's lawn be generate by an airstrip in the North Valley that rent out hangar space he own a plane Nope do not lose it and do not spend it what be this Blues may not look like it but I get soul Cool harmonica huh my harmonica sorry it be sit on the table I thoug it be Dom 's no it be a gift from my dad you do not talk about he much we be live on a base in the middle of nowhere and one night I want to go out with my friend to the movie he say no he leave I at home to go and have a beer with some guy in his platoon so I sneak out anyway titanic the movie I love it I still do and you can make fun of I all you want I do not care anyway after that I come home he do not MP find his body on the side of the highway the next day Coroner need dental record to identify he what about his drinking buddy question Cleared ship out the case be never solve I be 15 so I never get to speak to they well he would 've be proud of you you play this well than I do you should see I play my banjo look like we miss a party Via Baghdad from the look of it this be the rest of the steal five million ski mask Coveralls never be wear Someone 's planning on take something that do not belong to they not go to ask twice schematic from the Certified National Bank in downtown L A Jeffcoat be tie to a bank crew why rob a bank when you 've already get a bag stuff with million of dollar Salerno you here Federal agent stop right there g you okay you really get ticket to the Lakers game tomorrow night I would not do that bad idea the bad he do not read the sign get to read the sign what be it Eric Kensi just call from the hospital the hostile that you wound in the shootout just come out of surgery Michael Joseph Benelli Ex con who specialize in high end heist and the money just speak with Treasury it the remain 4 75 million from the convoy attack in Baghdad how do an L A Bank crew wind up with terrorist money guy have skill set they be always for hire a Jihadist terrorist group pay these guy 5 million to rob a bank there be something in the bank they want the money be just a down payment for the job there be more I just review the security cam footage from outside the hangar I get this from approximately 48 hour ago that be the mailman we see outside of Jeffcoat 's bungalow facial rec ID'd he as Damien Salerno prime suspect in 14 bank robbery over the last 15 year finally catch he on an unrelated tax charge release from prison in may 08 be not Mike Renko on that case yeah he be LAPD also think he be involve in at least five murder but they can not prove it Jeffcoat make it six I guess Salerno decide his piece of the pie be not big enough he be what you call mastermind and muscle roll into one felonious package Mr Benelli Nice a nurse who wear black leather look like I make it to Heaven after all I need to talk to you you be not the cop that shoot I no you would not be here if I be my kind of girl what do you think Salerno 's go to do when he find out he lose all his money why do not you ask he cause you be the only guy who walk away then you be talk to a dead man not if you work with we it take some digging but I think I figure out why these guy be target this particular bank since 9 11 the FBI have be try to cut off terrorist group from their financial asset their most recent success be freeze a series of bank account use by the Jihadist Raiders Front the amount over 50 million guess where those fund be locate Certified National Bank downtown L A branch Raiders want their money back they hire the good heist team to get it for they but Salerno do not come cheap he demand an up front payment so they attack the convoy take the cash and ship to Salerno Jeffcoat must have be a middle man he have security clearance to leak the convoy route to the Raiders he would bring Salerno in to hit the bank but no bank keep 50 million in its vault do not need to bank retain asset electronically you have the right account number swift code password you can shift money electronically anywhere anytime then why pay a heist crew why not hire a hacker because bank have unique security protocol for fund freeze by the FBI you have to have physical access to the actual terminal to move the money but that be never stop you before Most hacker do not have access to the toy that I do I could make all very wealthy in about two minute I mean if you want I to not that you would want I to not that I would want to I be just say you know what exactly be you say Eric I think this be an inside job all right Eric thank you what be his name whose name the guy in the bank the man who be go to wire the money back to this terrorist group and then tell the cop that he be order to do it by the bank robber I do not know what you be talk I will tell you what I be talk about I want the name of the guy in the bank who be go to wire the 50 million to the Jihadist Raiders Front the bank robbery be just a front an excuse so no one will suspect the man on the inside I be tired I need to sleep Sleep on this you be face a lot of year in prison we can cut you a well deal than Salerno Eric yeah Kensi you be on speaker I will take it from here he be not go to tell we it be a long shot I be hope he would cut a deal will this guy lead we to Salerno not willingly he be terrify of cross he for good reason then maybe he will unwillingly take we to he already on it guy message from Mike Renko he say he be get someone who can help we with this case meet he at the boat shed on our way what be the prognosis Doc Benelli 's entire value system be base on the use of violence the threat of Salerno find he will be too much to bear he be go to run back to his boss and beg for his life good thing I tag he before he wake up from surgery gps and audio tape under the uh shoulder bandage that be smooth up top come on I need to get this tail start and you need to get out of the office more often ever vigilant Special Agent Mike Renko late night club rock star I be work undercover with a bunch of tweeker freaking guy never

even smell it Bernhart 's be know to walk outside the line a little bit but he always get result so he be dirty when you be a cop there be a fine line between be dirty and effective we will pass this case be already hot enough as it be first this guy be your good chance at get close to Salerno Second of all he be here already Detective Matt Bernhart Special Agents Callen and Hanna how you do Good hey man what be go on how you do good good all right why do not you tell these guy about Salerno Matt all right he be get old he be not pull heist anymore he be plan they he be send a crew in and get

but the date and time they plan on make their move what be the chance Salerno 's go to get a new crew together either he go trough with this or he be go to be look over his shoulder the rest of his life we identify the inside man at the bank then the Jihadist Raiders Front will lose the key piece in this whole plan just comb through a list of the bank 's employee run they through some vector no

he get active membership to four different online date site be I the only one who wonder why there be a suspect in every case who happen to be a bachelor see how criminal tend to be male with antisocial proclivity and also wonder why that always seem to be the vector that we go after first the low hang fruit be the easy to pick Agent Blye seriously Curtis be go to take time to get close to Salerno and his crew could hit this bank at any point in the next 5 day as despicable as the man be Salerno be not our primary target here the Jihadist Raiders Front be we need to confirm who be work

two three ounce of ice then book out of there but we chase he down slap some cuff on he Kensi tackle he I back she up slow down Serpico do you question he no Figured we would let he stew for a little

will see you later we hit the street no I be take you back to Ops I will drive I do not think so there be a couple way we can do this I would like access to a JAG lawyer why do you think you need a lawyer I know my right all right I will ask around I will find out who have the good track record for murder case I do not kill anybody so what you be Calvin Lee 's meth dealer you take two ounce of meth from his house all right look pal we 've get 60 open case on our desk right now we 've get a dead body illegal drug and you easiest thing for we to do be just walk away if you want we to keep dig and find something that might prove you innocent along the way you 've get to give we a reason to keep look Calvin get a promotion to Lieutenant Commander then a great billet as an XO so let I guess you be next in line it be a career maker Calvin be a jerk he be moody curt secretive that job be mine my man work their ass off for I for the past week I 've be spike his soda with methamphetamine just small amount so what he fail a drug test you can not taste it it feel like a caffeine high with a big tour they do a drug test of the whole crew between a urinalysis and a search if he would get bump off the boat the job would go to I but you do not count on he kill himself I do not like Calvin but I do not want he dead and now there be an investigation I go there to undo some of the damage no you go back to cover your ass unfortunately for you it be too late now Calvin Lee be dead because of you Trace amount of blood on his left shoe preliminary tox screen just come in look like he be positive for methamphetamine but Calvin Lee do not blow a drug test in fact he have not have a urinalysis in some time that mean nobody but his shipmate Vic know that he have amphetamine in his system and if Vic 's tell the truth Calvin Lee do not know that be probably not why he off himself nothing in his medical file about depression or mental illness so we could be look at a murder what be the chance this be not a suicide I would say zero percent what do you know that we do not the word to every tv theme song and this Caltrans traffic operator see he on the bridge and zoom in for a close look it be definitely Calvin Lee and he be alone the body language say no sign of duress he come with the noose already tie I would say that be pretty conclusive what be that he throw off the bridge maybe he be throw his gum out you would not want to choke on your gum before you strangle yourself to death I do not know clearly can you pay Lee 's parent a visit we be go back to the crime scene have fun guy okay should I get a gun have you ever carry a weapon no fire a weapon be train with a weapon then you probably will not need one and the parent will be mourn over their dead son which be why you be bring an operational psychologist with you copy that we be very sorry for your loss Mr and Mrs Lee do Calvin ever share with you any trouble he be have at work in relationship be he depress no no no Calvin be a perfect son always School Navy he he be always try to do his good we give up everything to come here and have our son and now he be go you leave China we have a daughter when Ming be pregnant but we be only allow one child be your daughter close with Calvin when they be young but she be she be go she she die a long time ago we be very sorry to hear that can you think of any reason why Calvin would take his own life no it must be a mistake tell I something be this your daughter no this be Xue Li our son 's fianc√©e do you know where we could find she well she be very upset she say she be go back to Hong Kong to be with her family leave immediately perhaps we could have this conversation a little later my wife and I we we need more time absolutely we understand maybe we be over think this maybe his death do not have anything to do with the sub 's decoy system maybe he just get in a fight with his girlfriend selfish what be that Suicide you be basically leave everybody else to clean up your mess you all right big guy you know what today be Wednesday it be Tuesday you sure feel like a Wednesday five week to the day since Dom go miss and we be here pick through roadside trash 'cause some distraught meatball off himself Sam if we have something new to go on anything new anything at all we would be on it 24 7 you know that but we 've get nothing and it be go to stay that way as long as we be out here waste our time with this thing it be not a waste of time the security of the man and the technology on that submarine remain in question besides that Calvin Lee have a family at the very least we be go to give they closure that be the same thing we be go to do for Dom 's family someday Ming and Jun Lee immigrate here in February of 1979 with their daughter Jane she be two year old at the time Calvin their son be bear six month later at County they 've be run the same antique store in Chinatown for over 30 year when do the daughter pass away she do not the parent say she die year ago no death certificate on record but I do find this Jane Lipsger formally Jane Lee now live in the art district where she own her own eclectic hard metal furniture shop she got marry Nope just change her name why would the parent lie and why would she change her name to Lipsger I think it be time somebody ask she whatever it be it mean something to he and he do not want it find on his body what be the circumstance that lead to someone throw a toilet seat out of a move vehicle kind of stretch the imagination do not it Christmas light a Cats CD oh this be interesting I may actually take this one back to dust for print just out of curiosity I do not want to meet the owner of this shoe it be a size 15 that be a lot of woman maybe hello right place right size that be his parting shoot to the world I be go to throw over my key so no one can move my car like I say selfish yeah we be on it Eric just find Calvin Lee 's sister in the art district you know what I like about metal furniture who be you kid what do you know about design furniture I dabble in thing you do thing you break thing you do not dabble in thing you do not can I help you that depend if you be Jane Lipsger or Lee and you be I be Callen this be Sam we be with NCIS which mean what exactly Naval Criminal Investigative Service we would like to ask you some question about your brother Calvin what about he when you speak with he why what be go on I be afraid he die early this morning I be sorry we have to be the one to tell you how it appear he take his own life Calvin call I last night leave a message on my machine he sound drunk which be not like he he be say goodbye but I figure it be just because he be ship out you two be close we talk almost every day even if I hate my parent I have an irrational need to hear how they be I make fun of he but he be really a great brother he be the good son you be the rebel I be a terror but they have it come old school chinese parent live for their son mine be a Jihua family we leave China because of Jihua Shengyu Zhenzi the one child policy I think they resent leave and then they only have eye for he you know what they call baby girl in China Qu zai mifan maggot in rice do you have any idea why Calvin would have kill himself he seem to have it all Lieutenant Commander XO beautiful fianc√©e Fianc√©e Xue Li that be a joke it be an arranged marriage my parent be try to force on he he want nothing to do with her trust I why be that because Calvin do not like girl woman he like man he be very discreet my parent have no idea he be in a relationship his name 's Jaxson it be not easy Calvin take the do not ask do not tell stuff very seriously and Jaxson really do not there be a lot of up and a lot of down the gay Lieutenant Commander think his mom know do not mom know these thing you tell I no mom that be why you need I this be funny Mr Jaxson Mr Jaxson you there you around do not look like love to I they find the weapon not yet none of the neighbor hear anything well they seldom do no sign of force entry only one set of footprint it be probably the blood find on Lieutenant Commander Lee 's shoe so I be think he slit the guy 's throat toss a few back realize what he be do then hang himself at first light so we call it a crime of passion murder suicide if he kill this guy that explain why he hang himself well it explain the suicide now we get to figure out the murder Coroner 's report confirm the presence of methamphetamine in Calvin Lee 's system but no sign of actual meth use Needle mark meth mouth lung damage which be consistent with his shipmate 's story the main cause of suicide in the armed service clinical depression relationship problem deployment or combat stress there be not much combat stress in a sub deployment and no history of depression which leave relationship and this guy be hide his relationship from a lot of people this be the surveillance footage from Jaxson 's building Calvin let himself in last night and then leave in a hurry eight minute later that be enough time to kill Jaxson Motive any number of reason if Jaxson be not discreet that would put Calvin 's career and family tie on the line or maybe Calvin just want out you know he be about to deploy he think it be good to just end it Jaxson refuse to let he go and threaten to out Calvin but still no murder weapon maybe he take it with he he would have have to drop his weapon somewhere between the crime scene and the overpass look at what he be wear he do not change you see that blood splatter how could he manage to kill this guy and get the knife out of the building without get blood on himself Eric scroll back it be 6 00 at night people be come and go Dog walkin ' time busy apartment building go back to the delivery guy get to get past all the nosy neighbor no one buzz he in and he leave in a hurry can barely see his face purposely exit away from camera that be our guy let us check it out no

in Chinatown and while they have an excellent kung pao chicken they do not deliver to West Hollywood or anywhere near Jaxson 's apartment okay if the person who order the food use a credit card we might be able to get a name by match the content of the order to the restaurant 's takeout receipt we 've create a monster what that be that be not good detective work you might start by check the bag and its content for fingerprint Sure we could do that which we do Bobby Tang he run an import export company out of West Adams and he be get a mug shoot Emphasis on mug he be a member of the asian gang Hiragana they be one of the most dangerous and organized gang in L A suspect homicide torch a business associate 's store with the business associate still in it I would say he possess the

he still with the agency no he be kill in his second week on the job or be it his second day Ames have a gifted mind but he tend to think logically Invaluable for a scientist not so much for an agent choice they make on the street do not always seem to make sense to the untrained eye which be probably what keep they alive why do you ask just just curious admirable quality curiosity unless of course you be a cat so this be Bobby Tang 's company you bring the lock pick that work look like our buddy Bobby Tang be a video pirate no what I know what you want to say do not do it you do not like

Kerwood Ames issue what be we miss Sam I do not know what Dom would say probably give we some obscure historical fact about God know what do you know Leonardo DaVinci be the first person to design the submarine in the 15th century and he be also the first inventor to think to combine exist machine to create new and improved one how do we know this be just a key Mrs Lee sorry to bother you again but we have a few more question Jun be not here that be okay I be sure you can help I prefer my husband to be here why he be the strong one you say Calvin 's fianc√©e Xue Li go back to Hong Kong but she do not do she you need to wait for my husband I can not talk about it because you do not want to or because he will not let you okay I do not usually get this excited but this be cool on so many level I take it it be not a car key Au contraire mon fr√®re it be and so much more it be a high tech cloner it be like an IronClad flash drive just jack up on steroid it only need to be in the vicinity of a computer and it relay the information to a remote location look at this thing you can disguise this as any everyday object just leave it near someone 's computer all her secret be reveal this one interestingly enough never be use why would the Navy give Calvin a jack up IronClad I do not think they do I mean I can not be totally sure how any of this work because most of the code look like this chinese military grade nothing this sophisticated 's even on our radar if this come from the People 's Republic and wind up on that sub every piece of classified information and new technology on that mission would be compromise and available to our enemy Calvin Lee be a chinese spy Calvin 's shipmate Vic do say that he be secretive nervous a loner I would be too if I be betray my country imagine live every day wonder if you be about to be catch constantly look over your shoulder Imagine that maybe he think he be about to be make could explain the suicide yeah but why toss this why not hide it first give it to your handler maybe the Lieutenant Commander be send a message from the grave historically traitor be hang from bridge as a warning to other Calvin do not want to be a traitor that be why the cloner have never be use 'cause Calvin refuse so the Chinese threaten he with the good currency they have his one vulnerability his boyfriend Jaxson only Bobby Tang go too far he kill he so with nowhere else to turn suicide be the final act of defiance against his tormentor that explain why he toss this so maybe Mr Lee be a true patriot die for his country with the operation blow the only thing leave to do for his handler be clean up the mess and cover your track start with Bobby Tang Xue Li pretend to be his arranged bride but really a pro bring in from the home office to get thing do that be why we have no back story on her she be a shooter now she be tie up her loose end which be anyone who may have know probably start with the family and any one of they could be an asset to we so they be all in danger how do you meet Xue Li her family be friend of Jun 's I be sorry excuse I yeah Get Calvin 's parent out of there Callen and Sam think that Xue Li be go to try to kill they okay get it get out of here right now to go where we have customer Mr Lee you be in danger I must move you someplace safe immediately this be our store our neighborhood there be no danger

the clone it be over there be several family all agent of the MSS we be tell we would be give the gift of a second child if we would go to America and raise he to be a spy do you resent the MSS our son would be the ultimate socialist hero we be proud when do you tell Calvin a very young age he always know we raise he to go to Annapolis join the Navy but always loyal to China and then what about Xue Li send from the MSS to be his handler and make sure we be still committed to the mission but in the end he could not do it he be such a sweet boy we never should have make he do this but Jun insist it be why we come here Ming you get a chance to do the right thing maybe even start over if you tell we about the other who might still be here think about it Calvin Lee be bear to be a sleeper agent but deep down inside he love this country the store be the perfect cover agent could come and go no question ask how many contact do we think they have hard to say Eric be go through their computer record security footage for month Ready Mom Mom my baby I think it would help Ming she might tell we more if she actually see her daughter emotional witness tend to open up more you may have

the lady know her stuff the lady also know that a blown engine do not create this type of damage to the naked eye it look like the Mitsubishi explode right after the Honda pass but if we slow it down

efficiency in the combustion cycle in effect it would have make the car go quick okay I do not want the Navy to discover they be miss I 've come to retrieve they and this it be a dosimeter it pick up the battery 's lithium ion signature this technology be not just worth a fortune it would revolutionize our attack vehicle in the field it be something we can not afford to have fall into the wrong

Rashad Hollander aka Slide dishonorably discharge from the Army in 2007 for let I guess gang activity Bingo manage to compile a pretty impressive rap sheet since then as have Wendell 's prodigal brother James James seem like a petty thief whereas Hollander appear to be well on his way to become a full fledge sociopath both Rashad Slide Hollander and James Lil'Mac D Dobbs have link to the 82nd Street Black Posse they been expand into the territory rival with increase violence so what do this have to do with our stellar Marine Wendell Dobbs that be the part we have not figure out yet check

look like a drive by shoot but police be still look into it oh man that be mess up I be so sorry that be cool you give he the job as a favor yeah well it be the least I could do Wendell have a big part in help I secure my military contract he want to keep job in California I be the low bid in the State you see the Humvees I repair the vehicle come back to U S basis from Iraq and Afghanistan they take serious abuse in the desert over there so we get they back in shape for service here it be be a real godsend in this economy you have any idea where we can find James we be really worried about he not a clue any coworker or friend buddy I do not know he be my night watchman so to be honest I never see he you bring back weapon and stuff too no just vehicle Humvees mostly why do you ask just curious well thank I appreciate it again my condolence thank you Ernie do I look like an Ernie so a Marine get his brother a job with a company that refurbish equipment from the war then that same Marine be gun down by gangbanger arm with AK 47 these Humvees be not the only thing be bring back from Iraq yeah it sound like Wendell 's figure out a way to supply L A gang with Kalashnikov rifle think we well have Eric check this place out and Ronnie Miller we get to get to James before anybody else do well he can not go home and forget about the street especially with your own gang after you he be get to be hole up somewhere his brother get he the job here maybe he be always look out for he no place safe than big brother 's house TV be on if he be hide he will not answer not even for Wendell 's old buddy Wendell it be Gordie baby what be up I get your Xbox I get to tell you I be get pretty good at Call of Duty Easy Easy do not shoot do not shoot do not shoot who be you I be Gordie Gordon Gordo James right what be you do here I be here to see your brother yeah where be the Xbox then federal agent Gordo and you be complain about Ernie who kill your brother James you do not have to be afraid we be here to help I be not afraid of anything why hide out at your brother 's place I be not hide I be chillin ' your brother 's dead and your boy put about 30 round in your father 's house this morning with I and my partner inside and you be just chillin ' where be Slide and the gang get their gun I do not know be Wendell use Suntiago Equipment to smuggle weapon to the gang no way Wendell be clean he be a war hero you can not say nothing bad about my brother but you can dishonor he by act like some punk ass thug huh what about the owner of Suntiago Equipment Ronnie Miller be he bring in the gun I do not know anything about no gun okay so stop sweatin ' I okay let I ask you a question if you be so tough why not enlist your old man do your brother do what be you scared I try ok I try I get a heart murmur I do not feel it I do not even know that it be there but they would not let I in because of it look we both know your gang buddy kill your brother Wendell why I do not know why be you protect they I be not protect nobody but myself where I come from you be either a gang member or you be a gang victim and my brother well he could not be look out for I when he be off fight in the war you hungry you like Thai food I be think Thai Sure Thai food want to shed a little light here maybe he do not know anything maybe maybe he do he do not want to talk but he have not ask for a lawyer he know he be safe here than anywhere else because he know who kill his brother he do Sam but this go way beyond murder we have a Gunny Sergeant who may be supply automatic weapon to L A gang he be go to tell we he just need a little more time the more time it take the more likely his gang start use those ak again when it get out then maybe we need to be out look for they instead of lean on this kid let he some time with Nate if you want to keep question he that be cool but I head back to Ops you know I do not like people sneak up on I I tread lightly I do not sneak be there any new development no and what about our unfortunate Gunny Dobbs still try to convince James to tell we about his brother 's killer and where they get their gun from Moe and Dom and now this young man this one be not hit too close to home be it the problem be not Moe Dom or James it be the other ten million you know what the lead cause of death for young black man in this country be Homicide that be right usually at the hand of another young man with a gun you can not take it upon yourself to save all of they but at least I can save this one Sam in the last six month Suntiago Equipment have repair and refurbish hundred of vehicle return from Iraq and Afghanistan all of which come back via military air transport of course effectively bypass custom no custom check no and it would not be too hard to fill those vehicle up with black market weapon before ship they home so Gunny Dobbs help Suntiago Equipment get the Humvee contract then get James a job there as the night watchman Eric tell they what you find on our friend Ronnie Miller it be not only what I find but what I do not find Ronnie Miller use to be Royad Markovic Serb maybe change his name to sound more american Royad Markovic die in ' 89 by the time we get a warrant to search Suntiago Equipment and Ronnie Miller 's personal residence any evidence could be long go what about a FISA warrant you will claim this under a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant well why not AK 47 be a foreign weapon they be buy on the black market they be smuggle into the country their profit be probably be use for terrorist activity no okay I will buy that I think you be stay with James well I figure I would let Nate have a crack at he so we could work on some other angle check the whole yard there be nothing I tell you people I run a legitimate operation here I do not import weapon if it be legitimate then why would you change your name America 's a melting pot I want to melt in and what about the real Royad Markovic the one who die in Zagreb Royad be a friend of mine a business partner we have our own heavy equipment business but he be kill in the war I be bankrupt so I come here and I start over a new country a new life this be not sound good for you what do you get Eric there be be a gang shootout downtown they be use automatic weapon TB Two be inbound to the crime scene south of downtown TB two Police Three please maintain 1 500 or above Wilco on the altitude uh Shop Three Two Four be advise we have Code 20 overhead PB Three perimeter be secure County coroner be on the scene for 17 victim you be good for Code Four Roger that we will take a last look and depart the area thank for your help AK 47 mag a number of bystander be catch in the crossfire the death toll stand at four it be one of the gangbanger from Dobbs ' house the one that knock on the door look like our gang war be heat up I be guess a couple of these guy be friend of yours what happen same that be go to happen to you maybe your father if we do not take care of this right here right now how by tell we where we can find who be responsible for this where they be get their weapon I do not know they shoot your brother with AK 47 pump about a pound of lead into his body and you do not even have the gut to tell I who else be in that car you want to know who else be in the car the night my brother got kill you really want to know it be I yeah that be right I be there I see it I see everything Slide say that uh he want to show I something and he do he make I watch as they gun Wendell down why why have they do that Wendell want I out of the gang and away from Suntiago Equipment Slide do not like he interfere interfere with what be Ronnie Miller bring the gun in through his company I do not know all right I just work the gate at night when Slide find out he get real interested and he just he tell I to let he in sometimes to do what I mean I guess steal stuff you know that be what I think they be do you do not know no I just work the gate I do not ask question and they do not tell I and your boss do not know what Slide be do no and neither do my brother I do not think it be anything big though I just think Wendell be overreact now he be dead and I be next we will protect you you can not protect I any well than my brother could you be right because soon or later we all end up on our own with no one at our back at that point you have to decide which side you be on and whether you be go to run or fight now you choose to stick with Slide and his gang you will wind up dead just like jj try run from Slide and his crew and you will probably wind up dead too because they be go to hunt you down like a dog but if you stand and fight with we I promise you we will take these guy down and you will not have to run or hide again what make you think you can take Slide 's gang down when the cop can not we be not cop Dread day in Los Angeles with a shootout early this morning outside an illegal Hollywood after hour club two man believe to be member of a colombian drug cartel be riddle with automatic gunfire while sit in their car James be the only way to get to the gang that kill his brother look Slide Rashad Hollander be extremely dangerous and after this shootout he be go to be even more paranoid and jumpy which be go to make he more prone to violence which be why we have to act now get those killer and their automatic weapon off the street okay what be to say slide do not kill James the moment he see he he be your only witness in any of this Slide 's already lose three guy include JJ who be his right hand man he be in a turf war with the Mexicans and the Colombians he be go to take help I know you guy be go to do it anyway but I just want it on the record that I think this op have an unacceptable risk level there be too many dangerous variable especially with this short of a setup that say I hope you kick some ass I will prep James I will get Eric work on the tech spread I will download some more profile on Slide maybe there be something there you can use thank Nate you want to be brief on this I do not know do I I can run it by Director Vance if you would prefer oh Lord no one of the reason I be here be to protect he as a designate fall guy I have no previous knowledge of the operation Mr Secretary that madwoman go off her rocker and act autonomously

his overseas connection to smuggle in gun turn out it be drug pack away nicely into humvee come back from Afghanistan James would let they into the compound then they would swap out the Humvee stash with the drug a foolproof plan Gunny Dobbs stumble upon we send our young man to slay the terrorist dragon and what do we get back but the dragon we be send to slay it be hard to believe but it be a beautiful country once upon a time you 've be to Afghanistan I spend a wonderful Christmas there in the Bamian Valley with a local Pashtun family when be that well it must have be 1979 do not the

innovative way to expose your weakness I have an h you have an H o Shoot Top of the key off hand glass it be the same shot as before no this be a bank shot now with the off hand the key 's not to over think it it be a concept I be sure you will have no problem embrace fully same shot twice hey I do not break the rule I just bend them listen I love the rule the letter and the spirit they be the foundation of civil society Ball knock yourself out Guarantee you I make this shot the humanity you want to take a shot I prefer the attaque au fer when the tip of my foil score a direct hit against the unguarded chest of my opponent come on Hetty one shot save the planet boy ' game can wait a dead Marine can not a l'√©tage Upstairs we get it that well be wastepaper you be use of course absolutely Lance Corporal Daniel Zuna station without incident at Camp Pendleton until last night take by a member of the paparazzi that would be paparazzo then would not it because paparazzi with an I be plural so paparazzo these be take last night near an alley outside of a night club call Four Twenty on Hollywood Boulevard Four Twenty have an incredible dj what a girl 's get to get her freak on now and then Preliminary autopsy indicate Lance Corporal Zuna die from massive blood loss Gunshot no no sign of physical trauma but here be the freaky part he bleed out through his eye ear nose and mouth Lance Corporal Zuna be on a two week leave spend a lot of his off time at an MMA gym call the blood gut warrior MMA Mixed Martial Arts the victimha be on leave after come off a guard duty rotation at a bio lab facility so assume he may have be expose to a biohazard Hazmat assure I there be no contagion but due caution be advise we need to track Zuna 's movement while he be on leave Sniff around Zuna 's gym see what you can find out from his buddy we can always bring they in later if we have to meanwhile Sam and I will be wear glove in an alley outside of Hollywood Boulevard substantial pool it be more like a lake do not go too close you do not have to say biohazard twice it be close to the club you think he be wait somebody do not have a stamp on his hand he never even go inside he be worried enough to come armed average body hold six quart of blood look like Zuna lose every last drop and then some hit I G Eric do Zuna 's preliminary autopsy report estimate blood loss Let us see yeah it estimate the victim lose half his blood supply this be more than three quart of blood call the pathologist see if Zuna 's toxicology report be in yet all right hold on I be check now before a fight some fighter like to boost their blood supply it add red blood cell and increase endurance they store up their own blood and they re inject it it be call blood pack so Zuna gain a tactical advantage by bend the rule and it cost he maybe it do explain the excess blood in the body and on the ground so do you have a theory on why a healthy guy with no sign of trauma would bleed out in an alley guy toxicology 's back Zuna have high level of heparin in his system it be a blood thin he be say that amount of heparin would have cause unstoppable hemorrhaging make the blood seep out the most porous membrane in the body eye nose ear but nobody pack their body with blood and willingly take blood thinner look like Hetty can stop worry that he be expose to a biohazard yeah and we can start worry about who the murder be do not wait do not wait Gil he give you his back get hook in Start work for the rear naked choke yes sir Sure let us go see it again there you go you want to train it be 60 buck a month you bring your gear no woman 's locker room you have to change in your car I mean hi I be not here to train I be a frie wasa friend of Daniel 's you hear what happen still can not believe it I just think I would come see this place he be always talk about it Danny be a hell of a fighter even well man I be Victor Janklow Tracy you his girl I guess we only just start date but it be intense so how can you guy keep training if you know we be Marines it be how we do it I be Danny 's platoon sergeant he talk about you a lot yeah probably only half of what he tell you be true bad half I think if I see where he train would help I stay connected you know any of the guy no never meet them come here hey guy come here come here this be Corporal Craig Mangold retire this be Corporal Dale Johnson Corporal Nelson Shabazz and that be Jason Wyler this be Tracy Danny 's girl yeah how have you find out Police call I my number be in his cell phone Danny have a lot of girl ' number in his cell phone well I guess mine be just the last one dial come on Jason we be all feel bad maybe it be a mistake come here you come by here anytime okay thank you thank for stop by I be sorry about Jason he 's wound a little tight it be okay if you want to talk there be some thing I maybe a drink sometime sure one for Danny the pathologist say the heparin be inject an hour before he die mean he lose a lot of blood very quickly surprised he do not lose consciousness soon his staff NCO say he be one hell of a fighter which be especially interesting give his slight stature Daniel Zuna be essentially the runt of the warrior Litter not physically strong more of a scrapper never turn your back on the small guy you know when I be surf in Vietnam they call I khong lo the giant this giant be force to develop the ability to take a lot of physical punishment and keep on fighting that explain the blood pack Zuna be desperate to prove himself in my experience relentless behavior like Zuna 's be almost always drive by some major league personal demon do major league personal demon actually appear in the DSM IV sometimes I feel like I be get too technical so I like to throw in the occasional colloquial term okay blood gut warrior or in layman 's term the badass kickboxer the warrior fight as a team mostly take on other gym in the area Victor Janklow and Craig Mangold be former Marines Janklow be their platoon sergeant when they all serve together in Iraq he lose an eye leave the Marine Corps now he own the gym and all the other guy train there Dale Johnson and Nelson Shabazz be active duty Marines both serve with Zuna what about Jason Wyler he strike I as kind of a wannabe Wannabe Wyler be the only one who be not a Marine I get nothing on he yet keep look Khong Lo something about he set off a warning bell maybe it be his baby blue or his fluffy hair what about Zuna 's phone record let us see in the last few day he call several of the warrior and his former command officer guy name Scott Davis what about the last call he make that be it to Davis he leave the Marine Corps as a lieutenant talk to Davis find out why Zuna call Kensi and I will hit Zuna 's crib that be colloquial for house I know that Zuna want to meet this week I tell he I be too busy be you Truth be I resent the call Dan Zuna be trouble when he be in my command Trouble how when I be his lieutenant it be my duty to mentor he but as a civilian it be a different story what about the other Mangold Shabazz Johnson every man in Staff Sergeant Janklow 's platoon be a fine Marine except Lance Corporal Zuna if you have to know Zuna have a drug problem it never appear on his record I never report it we be take casualty every day there be no letup in sight those be the dog day you need all the Marines you could muster I give he a warning I tell he to get it together or take an other than honorable discharge do your platoon sergeant know about this if Staff Sergeant Janklow know he never let on Maybe Zuna keep it from he but I do not know how it be amazing what you overlook in war Platoon be tight still be from what I hear I lose two man in a firefight in Fallujah it be a miracle I do not lose more what do this have to do with Zuna Zuna be drive the Humvee I do not know if he be high or not but somehow he got lose in the back street he drive we straight into an enemy strong point we got pin down and we have to fight our way out and after that the unit be never the same thank for come you never tell I how Zuna die be it the drug someone pump he full of blood thin he die in an alley bleed out all over the pavement I know what you will ask I do anyone in his squad blame he for what happen in Fallujah Blame enough to kill he it be be a long time long enough to forgive in my book but it be a fair question this be Zuna 's place you want to do the honor what no key what be the challenge in that why do everything have to be a challenge for you guy Lock have a double sided cylinder you see it come up the walk Pain in the ass be not they for some crappy furniture brand new tv Man have his priority Laptop leave on and not password protect this be go to be easy maybe he be get nothing to hide it be like a pharmacy in here oh my God you scare I how have you get in here Danny give I a key what do you do here I live here spare room Danny

they end up on the internet so definitely uh X rate then nobody under 17 admit well play Danny say he meet a girl say that she be hot you think he mean I I sort of assume he have other no no no he uh

hell be you I meet he at a party pay he for some stuff he never deliver I come to pick it up myself be that why you be here no 'cause I do not do drug maybe Danny 's connection never come through you

in the car from now on and do not think I will not do it you should talk to Nate or you could talk to I what be there to say oh I do not know that you feel responsible for Dom 's death maybe if you have train he well he might not have be abduct maybe if you get there a few second early he might still be alive see what be there to say and then I could say that you need to stop think that way that you do all that you could do that Dom 's death particularly suck cause he be so young and do not deserve it you would probably say something about lose people before and I think we would both agree

as close as I 've ever come to find out who I really be that be what I be worried about G I take photo keep your head down stay out of sight as far as I can tell the Trojan horse do not get beyond Callen 's file keep look Mr Hanna you know I be aware you speak several language but I do not recall having use one you be unfamiliar with when I instruct you to not make contact with Mr Callen what make you so sure that I cont it be a breach of protocol and one I understand so what do we have the guy who burn Callen be name Eugene Keelson Callen make a drop for he with some bulgarian heavy but it go all wrong this guy be get information about G 's past thing even NCIS do not know about that be what he hand over to the Bulgarians oh this be encrypt big time without the mainframe this be go

not we may not get our only clue in the case Live dangerously be my creed Mr Beal go ahead go ahead and do it Harmless it be a single file contain a dossier and a travel itinerary who be Andres Werner CEO of Haupt Eisen it be one of Germany 's large steel corporation look like he be in L A complete a corporate merger Marinov 's a major shareholder we be talk million million that will drop like a rock if the merger go through they be go to hit he Callen give Marinov the dossier he be coerce into do so by Keelson but we can not allow this man to be kill as a result Werner 's plane touch down at LAX in an hour Werner get out of the car Federal agent Put the weapon down put the weapon down this be go to be some nasty goulash Renko you okay come on you good I be good I be good I be call this in to the LAPD Mr Hanna the decoy car work Werner 's safe Marinov hit we with his team every one of they be down except for the man himself backup getaway car pick he up have Kensi get out an APB she be on it be any of Marinov 's man in a condition to talk they be not in a condition to breathe we protect Werner but we be back at square one with Keelson which unfortunately be nowhere what happen to protocol it go out the proverbial damn window I 've be think a great deal about your situation Nate have misgiving about your state of mind he be go to have to get in line during this crisis he think he should have a gun you do not perish the thought walk with I this um Eugene Keelson be a clever fellow it be rare for we when we have an adversary who know more about our operation than we do of he despite Nate 's misgiving I think we need everyone 's skill on board I be not sure that be such a good idea I tell myself make the bulgarian deal might help shed some light on just how badly Keelson have compromise our team be that why I do it or be it just an excuse to find out about my past only you can answer that Mr Callen I can not which be why Nate 's right I should stay off this case not good news Hetty I 've be track the damage Keelson 's virus do to our server Callen 's file be not the only one it get into who else be compromise everyone and everything Keelson 's get information on every one of our case I be talk NCIS worldwide thank you Eric I will be back with you shortly I appreciate your noble return to reason Mr Callen but thing have take a turn the whole of NCIS have be compromise like it or not you be back in tell I Hetty be not go to string I up for take a call from a burn special agent you be good Eric you should see our new dig they be much more intimate albeit a tad shadowy cavernous and slightly spooky I need you to bring our server back online I want you to reactivate the computer virus that Keelson introduce to our system be you serious very you be ask I to commit technological malpractice here we go the virus be reactivate our server be expose again I be detect a foreign code inside the firewall it be get to be Keelson open a new file Label it Keelson put it somewhere he will find it do now include the follow message call I I want to cut a deal anything else give he my active phone number we be set now can I ask why we be expose ourselves to this guy we must go to Keelson before he sell the NCIS case list on the black market this be the only way to lure he out Keelson like money more than anything if we can offer he enough of it he may just expose himself long enough for we to take he down and what if Keelson would rather die than face prosecution for his crime the information he have about your past would likely disappear with he be you ready to accept that Mr Callen this be Callen what you offer what no small talk why bother you hate it or do you forget that I know you well than you know yourself I can not let that case list get out into the open market our offer be 10 million in untraceable U S currency the list would bring I more if I auction it myself the long you hold on to it the big risk you be take you know that this be a guarantee payday Griffith Park Observatory be there with the money you 've get one hour how will I find you I will find you I can not authorize 10 million I would not ask you to I be in position Kensi I 've get eye on Callen but so far no one 's make an approach Renko I get nothing this guy Keelson could be anyone he will show up look clear from here wait a minute there be a guy in

mention of this in your classified file no be I aware you have a relative no be I surprise no should you stay on this case definitely no be there any possibility that this be a coincidence Keelson do not think so he have my detail in her file but he could be wrong could be I be sorry Mr Callen you know the rule it would seem that while Keelson be dead there be still the possibility that your true identity may have be compromise along with the integrity of this unit this be the second time you 've take I off the Keelson case let us make it the last should I read something between the line Bugger Hetty 's go to tell you that I be off the case she be before she do what have we get the warehouse be own by some two dollar corporation register in Nevada I be still check name and the
