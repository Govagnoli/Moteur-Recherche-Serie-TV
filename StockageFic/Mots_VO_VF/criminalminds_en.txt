Criminal Minds 1x13 Poison Kinda scary huh what the tree they kinda look like those hooded creature in the movie do not they do you like the movie I tell you I do no no you say nyeh Nyeh be exactly halfway between yeah and nah that be the kind of answer I would tell my student be ambiguous be that your intent more or less man chuckle oh Bud I know it be tough on you but hey look think on the bright side you know every other week we get to stay up late eat junk food and go see movie your mom would never let you see in a million year what be you do then you do not see that deer no where it be go I must have wow it must have run away whatever Oooh ah what ah it be a flat we must have blow a tire driving on the shoulder I will be right back maybe we should call someone it be a flat tire it be you know despite what your mom say I be not completely useless I will be right back hello what be it Dad it be nothing it be just it be just the wind Eric get back in the car it be all right it be all right it be just I clumsy I it be all right hello who be there what be it Dad stay in the car get away what do you want get away from I get away get away get away get away hey hey hey Calm down inside there Calm down yeah I be go to need some backup just past exit 5 car on the shoulder of the road lone male in the driver 's seat under the influence of something wait there might be another one I be go to need an ambulance State trooper take this before the paramedic show up he be unconscious have four broken bone he be go to be in the hospital for a month I do not hurt my son you remember remove the tire iron from the trunk no no what be the last thing you remember I pick Eric up from school Friday for the weekend who would do this this happen two day ago in Beechwood New Jersey Mr Fisher have ingest lsd one afternoon and do not come down until 18 hour later lsd lysergic acid diethylamide ³Á¨¤¤G¤AÓi ° g¤ÛÃÄ the hospital report 6 other patient who ingest lsd in the last 24 hour the hospital call the CDC the CDC call we CDC Center for Disease Control so a bunch of people got spike what make it a BAU case they each receive 10 to 20 time the normal dose it be enough to kill a small child or cause a grow man to kill he with a tire iron of the seven victim there be one death and one coma this be from the hospital 's security footage the same night Fisher lose it these people do not get spike these people be poison roman philosopher Lucretius write what be food to one be to other bitter poison of the 7 victim Gail Norman be the only death she be 78 run out into the middle of the road and she be hit by a car she be DOA DOA Dead on Arrival the other potentially fatal case be 9 year old Brittany Canon she fall out of a tree house and fracture her skull she be in a coma and the doctor do not know if she be go to come out of it how do you wanna handle the press we still do not even know how these people got dose I think it would be irresponsible to issue a warning without specific it will just cause panic I do notify the local pd though to be discreet how be it possible that none of these people know how they got poison none of they remember anything about the day it happen these people be so mess up it be make it difficult for local pd to retrace the victim 's step so we need to go on precedent we know there be four type of poisoner who target multiple victim there be the true believer the political terrorist religious cult there be the extortionist the product tamperer hold the business hostage in exchange for money or the prankster usually a young offender who do not mean any harm and it be basically just a big practical joke and the avenger someone with a personal vendetta who choose poison as their weapon we need to find out as quickly as possible which type he be because with the exception of the prankster all these type commonly test their poison on a small scale before appear at a large attack then let us hope this one be just a prank I would suggest we split up the victim see if there be a pattern to the victimology Most of they be still in the hospital I will call local pd to meet we there I will check the lab report maybe there be a clue to the unsub 's motive in the specific nature of the poison he use I can not imagine anybody could want this to happen Detective Hanover Beechwood PD Agent Hotchner this be Agent Gideon thank for come down on such short notice Doctor say he may have permanent brain damage I 've never see anything like this well let us hope we can help he have you have a chance to review the victim 's file we be especially interested in talk to the boy 's father we would like to get a sense of why he turn violent while the lab analyze the specific nature of the LSD he be dose with we would like to get our own sense be it the drug itself or be there something else go on and hopefully that can give we a little bit of a window into the motive of the offender he be in the psych ward well we will keep it short Mr Fisher shrink or cop I be an FBI profiler so I guess I be a little of each I be Jason Gideon I can not imagine what you 've be through I understand you recently divorce your wife can you tell I why what do you wanna know be I angry about the divorce I mean be I so angry that I want to hurt my son to get back at she be that what you wanna know be you let I tell you something about my wife ok about what she do in my house in my bed with the investment banker next door do you wanna know what the bad part be my son Eric be angry with I she be the cheater and he be angry at I I what do you do do you want to hurt she of course and the kid I mean it be her kid right he take her side you wanna crush he too you wanna shut his obnoxious little mouth up for good no no he do not understand he take her side I be sure it be not the first time he be do that no Eric oh Eric why do this happen to you why Mr Fisher why why why Calm down why why come on come on come on well he be raw break and seriously piss off he do not hurt the son to get back at the mother not consciously no rage be real but understandable and he never apologize when he lose control he do not even say Eric I be sorry he say Eric why have this happen to you he never even confess to hurt the kid so the drug tap into the rage but do not cause it yeah that be my guess that be consistent with the information we just receive from the lab tox screen they do not find any trace of PCP or any other drug indicate the unsub be intentionally try to make people violent but they do find trace of rohypnol in all the victim a central nervous system depressant similar to valium only ten time more potent it be commonly know as a roofie or a date rape drug right and one of its side effect be amnesia which explain why none of the victim remember how they be poison we compare note on the victim we talk to so far there do not seem to be any pattern as to who got hit maybe the drug themselves could explain what type of offender we be deal with a lot of kid be use LSD and rohypnol these day Fisher be a high school teacher so it might be a prank after all yeah one that go horribly wrong yeah I be go to get a list of student from Fisher see you later Hotch okay we will be right there cop may have figure out where everybody be dose Uniforms be on a canvas Staff here remember see 4 out of the 7 victim here the day they report symptom please tell I your staff do not mention the canvas be about a poisoning they do not but I have to tell the owner be that the owner Nell Trucco I will be shock if this do not get leak now let us just hope nobody jump to the conclusion it be bio terrorism all right I be go to go talk to the cafe staff make sure they know to keep it quiet can you think of anyone who would do something like this high school kid hang around honestly I can not tell they apart you should talk to Danny Danny a busboy high school kid a lot of his friend come in here his girlfriend be here Saturday night be he here today he be suppose to come to work after school but he call in sick what be his last name ah Wallace I will have Elle check at the school you get a phone number for he Hotch I check the high school and Wallace 's house he be not there so now I be at his girlfriend 's house ok I will call you back doorbell ring Samantha yeah I be with the FBI can I talk to you for a minute where be your parent Working what do you want well you do not go to school today Samantha and neither do your boyfriend he be sick can I ask you something personal I think that something might have happen to you you wanna tell I about it I do not know I do not remember what do you remember he take I someplace on his motorcycle I I remember wake up but I be naked I be all beat up and he be there above I hold I down who be Danny phone ring I call the doctor early that could be her hello Samantha listen to I do not hang up can you hear I Elle whisper keep he talk Samantha what do you want someone be there who do you call why do you think someone 's here do not mess with I Samantha do not do it if you say anything click he hang up come with I you be go to call 911 and as soon as I leave you lock the door behind I do it he be near his girlfriend 's house Hillcrest at Maple ah I can not see the other cross street yeah rumble of motorcycle engine Danny Wallace stop FBI you put your hand on top of your head off the bike Hands on your head this be not what you have in mind when you skip school today be it Danny you wanna tell we about Saturday night Danny I do not do anything Samantha do not know what she be talk about a lot of people see you at the cafe together on Saturday night what do you decide to do Danny Dose the common milk so that nobody would know you just want to roofie your girlfriend that be not true Sex be an issue in your relationship she tell I about it she be not prepared to give it up so you decide to take it no she have bruise all over her body Danny you hit she well I do not mean to she be freak out punch I she be on something I be just try to help she I be just try to hold she down she be hit you but you still have sex with her no then what then it be after after we do it we fall asleep when she wake up she be see thing what thing look she be on something and if it be acid or something I 've take that you give that to someone without tell they it do not exactly set the mood Kid be right about that if he want to slip she a date rape drug why have he give she LSD too this boy seem too scared not to be tell we the truth so Samantha be just the 8th victim and the boyfriend work in the cafe be just a coincidence but even so there may be an explanation why the two drug lsd to hallucinate and rohypnol to forget forget what what they be hallucinate no how they got dose then the unsub 's cover his track it be much too organize for a high school prank and there still have not be any kind of ransom demand which rule out the extortionist or any visible political group or cult in the area which rule out the true believer and leave we with the avenger think we can give he a profile we believe whoever poison these people be motivate by revenge the randomness of the victimology average people in an average sized town all point to a local resident we know that people who poison for the purpose of revenge primarily act alone however he may have manipulate someone close to he to assist he the unsub usually dispose of these accomplice when they be of no further use to he the unsub be like a cautious deliberate and highly function male between the age of 35 and 50 he choose LSD for a reason LSD be about alter perception we think that this unsub be strike out because he feel that he be be inaccurately perceive by the community or a subset of it he feel that these attack will effect and alter a reality that he be catch in that he perceive to be unjust he be so self center he believe his victim will know the reason for the attack and who do it this individual be savvy enough to use rohypnol to obstruct our investigation erase the memory of the victim of how they be poison hold on if this guy believe that his victim know who he be why be he cover his track because these victim be not his primary target we know from precedent that this kind of offender the avenger test his weapon first this attack be a test run a test run for what we do not know yet what we do know be that this be not the first time that he be air his grievance while it be not likely that he have a criminal record it be possible that he have file criminal charge or pursue a civil action against his perceive adversary and now to measure the result of his test he be watch and he want to see the result of his test once he have they all those year of pen up rage will be release in the form of a large attack the profile indicate a lot of people could die we have a leak that be right Steve Neighbors become aware something be wrong when a local Beechwood restaurant close early from inside source we learn that representative of the CDC begin test food inside the restaurant if you be go to report the story name the restaurant unconfirmed we be tell that some of the food have be taint with hallucinogenic drug name the restaurant until we do confirm all of this we will not release the name of the restaurant we will only say it be a Beechwood area favorite this be Suzanne Whang report live from Beechwood back to you Steve they do not name the restaurant what be it call the local hospital make sure they know what be come excuse I where do your 911 call get route there be a county phone bank they contact first responder the fire department alert they too they be go to need additional personnel and any other backup you 've get auxilary cop you be go to have to call they but why because we be go to have a heck of a time just calm people down and we really do not need the confusion to interfere with our investigation do you want I to start make those call no no no no hey hey everybody please shut up for a minute tell I what this be all about phone ring Panic no I can not comment no we do not know for sure why those people be poison ok great thank you I just get off with the hospital they be swamp with over 50 potential poisoning from local restaurant but no hallucination another poisoning or maybe more hysteria we 've look into any civil or criminal complaint from employee ex employee supplier regular at the cafe not one good lead there be get to be somebody connect to that cafe who pop as a suspect Morgan you wanna go back there see if we can find another angle can not hurt jj you and Reed go to the hospital see if any of the poisoning seem legit ok I really can not talk right now we just got hammer listen most of these food poisoning be probably psychosomatic what make you think that a news broadcast just report a local restaurant be poison now it would be a huge coincidence if there be another poisoning right after that air so what do you want I to do help we find out which case if any be real People be come in with all kind of complaint but there be at least one case that be not psychosomatic she be barely breathe can you take we to the doctor that be treat that patient I will call Hotch if you be an avenger you choose your target for a reason right Elle nod then why have not we find anyone connect to this cafe who fit the profile why have not the CDC find any trace of the drug wait a minute what if it be not the profile that be wrong but the target not this cafe just because a bunch of victim come to eat here do not necessarily mean they got poison here then where when the patient get here she do not remember anything about her day and her speech be so slur I could barely understand she it sound like rohypnol do you test her she be positive for rohypnol negative for LSD but we be run more test because rohypnol alone do not explain her symptom she present with nausea difficulty swallow labored breathing she be also have trouble move her leg woman continue cough how long have she be sick she do not know I could barely understand she when she first get she now she can not speak at all do you know any biological agent that have similar symptom ricin seron gas you think this be a biological attack we can not rule anything out I will order a few more test thank Nell no soda machine hot dog stand water fountain or anything else get anything maybe First New Jersey Federal right across the street one of the victim who I talk to say he go to that bank the day that he be dose how do you get poison at a bank I do not know but I would like to take a look at the security tape after you right there pause it Elle Jack Fisher about to have the bad night of his life that be all of they every one of the victim who turn up at the ER three night ago be on this tape I be go to call Hanover Bring in the CDC guy they can test the candy I will call Hotch Morgan it be Hotch what be up Reed I think she be try to say something inarticulate the end she may be incoherent from the lack of oxygen inarticulate Doctor patient continue cough no Hotch we be pretty sure it be the bank all the victim be on their security tape then you should look for Lynn Dempsey 45 Garcia 's email a picture to your phone hold on a second I be check yeah yeah I get it Lynn Dempsey hold on Elle to Hotch Elle 's checking yeah we get her Hotch check the tape right there that be her play it again okay not only be she here but from one of these tape it look like she be the one replace the candy Hotch she could be the unsub we be work on that I will call you back so what be the chance that she be not poison that maybe she just get some bad food highly improbable chance be basically nil what be the rate of survival this dose without anti toxin Zero what be it Botulism Ã¾¸zµß¯f ¦ ×¬r±ìµß¤¤¬r ¥ Ñ ¦ ×¬r¯À³y ¦ ¨ªº ¦ Ù ¦ ×·ò·ô¯e¯f Doctor her BP be drop rapidly BP Blood Pressure it be sepsis sepsis ±ñ ¦ å¯g give another amp of epi epi epinephrine µÇ¤W¸¢¯À she be go into v fib v fib ventricular fibrillation ¤ß«ÇÅÖºû © êå¸ ° ê ¤£¥¿± ªº¤ß«ß she be crash get the paddle charge to 200 Clear nothing charge to 300 Clear still nothing the test run be over Page a Code Blue yes Doctor right away start CPR CPR cardiopulmonary resuscitation ¤ßªÍ ´ µd³N just be careful the fresh air do not kill you Fred ha ha see you in a few day Janice do not stay late the kid need you thank you Mr Dennis have fun Lynn Dempsey be an executive assistant she have no expertise with chemical she do not fit the profile of the unsub but the CDC find both LSD and rohypnol in the candy she be replace at the bank she must have be an accomplice and when the unsub finish use she to further his attack he kill she with botulism so what do that tell we about the unsub he be far more sophisticated than we realize why be that the botulism toxin be the deadly substance know to man it block acetylcholine receptor paralyze its victim until basically choke you to death acetylcholine ¤AñQÁxÆP without a uh antitoxin a lethal dose will kill you in 36 hour how many people have access to this stuff in New Jersey quite a few it be the pharmaceutical and chemical capital of the US so that the toxin can be order in the form of botox through any chemical or biological lab or botox clinic it have to be purify but any chemist or lab assistant have that capability so we be look for chemist and sophisticated lab assistant basically ok wait a minute if the unsub be a chemist with access to the toxin what have he need Dempsey for well we do not know yet but she work for a she work for a company call uh Hithcock Pharmaceuticals I think there be a good chance the unsub work there too well let us start with people who fit the profile who 've have a recent stressor like anybody fire from Hichcock in the past 6 month Hichcock 's a giant company Sugar Shack there be over a 100 people fire just this past year and so far none of they fit the profile no but I do have 30 name of people who be downsize and shunt off to other lame company with a cut in pay and benefit all right send we the name we will cross reference they with civil and criminal complaint file with local pd but I want you to keep dig and while you be at it look for any connection to the First New Jersey Federal Bank I be on it Angel our guy act like a workplace mass murderer he would stay close seething and he would plan his revenge well if he be a workplace killer what else do that tell we about he well for one they do not give themselves up he be lose his empathy his moral compass he be capable of anything all those innocent people at the bank they mean nothing to he he will take out anybody to forward his cause like Dempsey like Dempsey and eventually even himself until he finish take out his primary target we have no idea where he be go to strike next for all we know he could poison the local reservoir well the local cop have not get any lead out of Dempsey why do not you go to Hichcock and see if you have any luck yeah Miss Dempsey 's boss be away for the week I just can not believe this happen to her be there anyone you can think of who would want to hurt Miss Dempsey I mean anyone here at work she be not the type to inspire hatred she be pretty quiet actually would you say that she be awkward you know like socially a little yeah she make a lot of joke about herself you know self depracating joke I always think she would do a lot well date if she do not so she be single as far as you know I could not say one way or the other I mean she never really talk to I about that kind of thing be there anything about her behavior that be unusual lately um anything that you notice that be out of her normal routine just that she be very busy this last week there be a big corporate retreat come up that she be help her boss put together I be sorry I can not be of any more help that be all right I be go to go take a look through her thing if that be ok the police already go through her desk but feel free Thanks Gideon some of these lay off be brutal this one chemical engineer he have be at Hichcock 19 year when he be downsize yeah that could certainly inspire homicidal rage huh the guy be in his late forty head of his department definitely have a generous severance package a lot of these guy do not have enough pension they may not be happy about it but I do not see they kill anyone phone ringing it be Garcia talk to I Hot Stuff get this Cochise I find a chemist who work at a company that be buy by Hichcock call Palmay Cosmetics now here be the thing Lynn Dempsey apply for a loan at New Jersey Federal Bank around the same time this chemist apply for a patent on this anti age breakthrough technology thing call PCO99 so maybe he apply for a loan in her name to make his product that be what I think but both the loan and the patent be reject because Hichcock have already apply for the patent and the patent deal have go through drumroll please New Jersey Federal Bank I be track his cell phone and it will not be long before I have his location do not move he let we take he he do not kill himself do not fit the profile of a workplace killer sometimes you miss the mark let us be glad we do he be our good chance at stop the next attack well his lab have trace of botulin toxin but no clue as to what he be up to next our only chance be to make he tell we you think he will once catch these type usually do they want the whole world to know about their brilliant plan to destroy their enemy in case he do not give it up let us play every angle we need to re examine everything we know about this guy I will check witness report forensic evidence anything that might be a clue to this guy 's plan a lot of life could be at stake you be romantically involve with Lynn Dempsey Mr Hill be that what she say that be what her sister say what happen to her the fact be Lynn be already dead that company kill her year ago they kill you too well they might as well have they take everything from I fruit of my labor good year of my life they take my family and when there be nothing leave to take they take two third of my salary and my health insurance you have the opportunity to treat people with the mercy that they never show you I can not even begin to tell you how little that mean to I what would it mean to your child listen you work hard play by the rule your whole life you do not wanna go out like this if you do you stoop to their level there be thing we can do for you there be way to help you if you will let we what can you do for I we be FBI we have influence with Justice if you have a legitimate claim and I believe you do we can see to it you get fair compensation and credit and that be all you want right a fair deal that be all I ever want of course you do not think the company know they screw you you do not think everything they do every move they make be not design to screw people like you you could really get I those thing yeah this be my ABA card I be a lawyer and I be offer to take your case ABA American Bar Association and if you accept I have to do what you say this whole thing be be videotape I can not lie about that I would like my son to know that their Dad create something I create something good Ed tell we what do you do there be a party this afternoon in the Executive building all department get together there be a punch bowl stop do not drink that put it down put it down right now Ladies and gentleman listen up we be FBI I need everybody to remain calm but there could be some contaminated food here that could make you sick please put down whatever it be that you be eat and drink and please just take it easy we be go to be come around and ask you some question be everyone go to be ok yes ok the CDC be here with three dozen dose of anti toxin we be go to make sure everyone get some just in case ah whoever may have get sick we should have catch it in time the punch test positive for botulism toxin about a dozen party goer report symptom but they 've all be give the anti toxin Thanks jj I will call you back Bye what be it you be right it do not make sense why do not Hill take his own life when we have he surround guy I think we have a problem I 've be look over the victim report one of the victim that be originally dose be severely diabetic and he would not have take candy from the candy bowl at the bank all of the victim be there we know that but how be they poison I start look at the ah security footage we know Lynn Dempsey replace some candy from the bowl look how close that jar be to the deposit envelope now watch this see that her hand be directly in the stack of envelope so you think the envelope be poison as well as the candy as Lynn Dempsey be die she keep say something like the end the end I think that what she be say be the envelope I mean what be Hill actually test the rohypnol the LSD the delivery system exactly Botulinin toxin and LSD be the only two substance in the world toxic enough to be effective in dose as small as thousandth of a gram Small enough to fit on the glue strip of an envelope but the CDC do not find any evidence of poison on the envelope they would not have the envelope be destroy after the cheque be deposit and process so like the rohypnol Hill be use the candy to throw we off to cover his track to distract we from the fact that he be test the envelope what I can not figure out if why would he poison the envelope to test the punch because the punch be a decoy just like the candy he be not finish Gideon get he get his head back he be dead he kill himself before we even get to he phone ring yeah Hotch it be Morgan listen I be look at these victim from Hichcock and this do not add up all of these people be low level regular office worker this guy be try to get back at the people who screw he none of they be here what do you mean where be they the entire upper management staff be away on a corporate retreat the office manager mention to Elle that Dempsey be organize a retreat so then Hill be not use Dempsey for access to the office party no he use she for access to the retreat where be the executive can they be reach no no not until tomorrow they be out in the middle of the wood somewhere it be one of those no cell phone allow type of thing and what be they do there you know bond exercise play game that kind of stuff what kind of game when vote you wanna think about the quality you admire most so tomorrow we tally the vote to find out who our new team leader be now we do not want a repeat of last year 's fiasco so this year I bring along some envelope the victim need to ingest the anti toxin within four hour of the time they be poison and make sure you seal the envelope so there be no cheat Fred man laugh be we go to go fishing today shut up and lick it Bob man talk Gideon to Air One anything anything Negative we check the first three campsite nothing how about the Parks Service a couple of family on holiday None see the target wait a minute I be get a radio from the statie Staties State Police they find something near the access road and trail end 6 emt be en route EMT Emergency Medical Technicians these guy be in bad shape and get bad by the minute who be the sick that

sir Mr Sheffield I be uh I be very sorry we have the wrong house I apologize for any inconvenience Agent thank you would it be too much to ask if yours be the last face I see Albert Pine say what we do for ourselves die with we what we do for other and the world remain and be immortal the end of his two year kill spree Seven woman be dead he make a name for himself literally he send out write communication identify himself as the Keystone Killer these letter all of which be accompany by word search puzzle be a part of his game like the Son of Sam he taunt the police he fuel the medium 's fascination with he as you will see in the book he leave specific crime scene detail in the word puzzle and then 18 year ago he just stop kill now one of the Philadelphia PD 's theory be that he be in jail with an unrelated charge but this be a man who crave attention he could not remain a faceless prisoner for so long another theory be that he simply move away and he continue kill in another city or another country the FBI 's VI CAP program track murder and murderer all around the world they turn up nothing this intricate knot be part of his signature the signature we have never see repeat another theory be that he have die which be the only explanation for why a compulsive psychopath would stop kill but I never believe he be a psychopath who have to do this I believe he be a narcissistic sociopath who choose to this be his last victim Amy Jennings she be 23 her infant son be in the next room when she be kill so uh so even if he think he be finish he still have a debt to pay thank you Mr Ryan thank you sir thank you thank you you look comfortable up there why do not you come back to the BAU for a guest lecture I be retire remember Hell of a way to relax 323 page on the one that get away he have not get away and you do not count that 8 page prologue what happen to Florida 36 hole a day Florida 's too humid anyway I miss the season so I be in Philadelphia now you be in Philadelphia for the season you think I be what dysfunctional obsess you want to eat where the killer eat Sleep where he sleep maybe I be addict to Pat 's Stakes maybe I be hold out hope that the Eagles will turn it around next season remember weapon of mass destruction what be you say you think I be chase a ghost I be say sometimes we get it wrong ever consider that I 've consider everything so how be thing at BAU anything change since I leave everything change everything stay the same you know how it be miss I no just here to buy a book then huh what can I say profiler they fascinate I sorry to interrupt but this be for you thank sure Fan mail Fan mail how do you like that wait a minute hey who give this to you I do not know a guy in a blue jacket hey hey wait that be not the guy it be not the guy what be go on there be some sort of misunderstand who in his mind have not probe the dark water we be like two volume of the same book Max why do not we add a few more chapter be this from he the Keystone Killer the son of a bitch be right here you still think I be after a ghost lock this place down no one leave until I talk to they Norman McClain write it be those we live with and love and should know who loot we so they 've be here all night apparently where else would any of we be on a Saturday night it be not like we have life or anything speak for yourself guy we be about to meet Max Ryan the guy responsible for catch the Boise child killer have you ever talk to he before he be pretty intense brusque not much of a bedside manner sound like anyone else we know I hear he be force into early retirement no he choose to retire he be write a new book on the Keystone Killer case he move to Philadelphia to be close to the crime scene that be retirement b a u style who in his mind have not probe the black water John Steinbeck East of Eden Story of good and evil love and hate there be be some new activity on the Keystone Killer case New he be in Max 's lecture last night what he get away would we have wake you up if we catch he he hand this letter to the security guard and he include two driver ' license with it one be from his last victim last known victim Amy Jennings strangle in 1987 do you see something Ya what be the significance of black bra and grey wool sock that be what Amy Jennings be wear when we find she that be a lot of detail to remember for 20 year Green River killer could not remember where the body be bury much less what they be wear well some unsub take picture and print they themselves so they can manipulate the scene bring it to life that would explain the level of detail do no fight in the rear window have anything to do with the Jennings case no he enter in through the front door there be ample evidence that Amy fight he very hard now he be refer to a new victim there the second driver 's license Carla Bromwell Ya there be a C Bromwell here in the puzzle Philly PD go to the address on the license a little while ago find she suffocate with a plastic bag Suffocated his previous victim be strangle his MO 's different he have not be kill all along have he it would have be difficult to tie these new murder to the Keystone Killer what with the change of the methodology and the time that be elapse between kill if he have be active I would have know it be not entirely impossible for an unsub to switch he be M o the Zodiac Killer go from stab people to shoot they yes but he want to take the credit this bastard do not do anything in secret I would say good morning but it be still dark outside who be this Carla Bromwell uh Gideon can you put it on the news the Philadelphia police be notify late last night of a letter that be hand deliver to this news station apparently it be write by the infamous Keystone Killer who be want in connection with the murder of 7 woman back in the late 1980 's he also include a photograph of a woman she appear to be dead in the photo suffocate with a plastic bag now subsequently police discover a body in the Overbrook area but they be not confirm that it be the woman in this picture he work fast it be an understatement be not it meet you on the plane in 30 minute I be come with you I be not ask Jason Philly PD confirm that Carla Bromwell 's be dead less than 12 hour she be 47 victim be get old that be unusual Victimology rarely change her hand and foot be bind with flex cuff Flex cuff no rope that be what they say they be wait at the crime scene for you thank you sweetheart if you need I so old victim and a different mode of bind and kill maybe the note just mean we have a copycat on our hand the copycat who just happen to have Amy Jennings driver 's license no no it be the Keystone Killer how be we suppose to work with he Gideon he be not even an active agent he be here because he know this case well than any of we we be lead the investigation he be only consult anyone tell he that FBI Detective Charles Santangelo Philly PD agent Gideon Greenway you actually think the Keystone Killer do this yes we do Agent Ryan Detective so I guess you would show up soon or later he be consult with we CSI 's do process the body Ya we will get out of your way thank this be his 8th victim there be no bruising on the wrist ankle or neck just a good size blunt force head wound Ya probably a surprise attack well the puzzle say no fight I know what the puzzle say Head wound be extensive level of violence be escalate yup this bedroom be in front of the house and a puzzle mention a rear window maybe he leave a print no way well I think I be go to check it out anyway you do what you want to do but believe I you be waste your time Elle 's good at this Max do I say she be not I have not have a feeling like this around a dead body in 18 year I remember what you say to I on my first day do not lose your objectivity this be not personal yah well maybe not for you we be aware of the medium report be it the Keystone Killer however we can not confirm at this time the FBI will be make a formal statement later on today we receive more information from the murderer than the police what be go on we have the right to the truth the Philadelphia police have to finish investigate this crime scene before we can make a statement all of your question will be answer at that time so please be patient that be all I can say Ma'am when can we expect that statement today do you know anything about motive what do you think of Ryan he have not change much I think we can learn a lot from he what could you possibly learn that you do not already know Hotch repetitive thinking be the death nail for the brain for complete brain usage diverse stimulation be the key look at this let us go show this to everyone find another note let I see that in order for the light to shine so brightly the darkness must be present he be quote sir Francis Bacon now I use this specific quote on on your book on page 184 I read it on the plane and you remember the page number of the quote do not ask he say to expect another gift in 2 day a gift call his victim gift gift for whom for I a lot of thing have change in 20 year include the age of the Keystone Killer 's victim he be old his victim be old make sense to I Most unsub have specific fantasy this be as if there kill the same person over and over again this man clearly have a preference for young brunette and now he be switch to old woman well what do that mean Ted Bundy only kill woman that look like his fiancee but then he devolve and brutally attack a house full of sorority sister that look nothing like his previous victim he go off script his final victim be a 12 year old girl when the police find the van that he use to kill her the amount of blood reveal that he have lose complete control it be that devolution that eventually lead to his capture he could be devolve into frenzy so you mean he be about to mess up Keystone Killer 's devolution be only a theory we need to be prepare for anything and if he be in a frenzy there be no telling how quickly he will fall apart or how many more victim he will take with he so we be go to go over anything we know old and new and hopefully we find he before we find another body we will start with agent Ryan 's original profile Max you want to present it no we be look for a white male in his late 40 's the control crime scene the meticulousness and the collection of trophy suggest a possible military background I think you be go to present the profile Team can handle it the TEAM we use to work solo when this all start well we be wrong you do not worry about too many cook Nope he use a quote Jason he use a quote from my book so maybe it be a coincidence we 've both be do this too long to believe in that all right let us focus on the difference in the crime what be he do that be new well his late victim be hit in the head that be new in the word puzzle he say she do not fight so why hit she scare her show she he be in charge well he never do that before and a blow that hard would not scare she probably just probably just knock her unconscious in order to control she why switch from rope to flex cuff the intricate knot be a part of his signature flex cuff be easy probably save he time no no no there be more than that the rope be meticulously tie it be intimate completely unnecessary and he abandon the rope and the use of his bare hand which make his kill less personal and less control okay seriously guy let us just abandon all this let us just treat he like he be a new offender he be not guy I have a name Nibrahs that be a name from what country it be backwards S Harbin and there be a Scott Harbin on Ryan 's original suspect list it be not Scott Harbin Harbin go to jail in 1988 for stab a guy while he be try to escape during a home invasion the guy later die Harbin do not even know there be anyone at home at the time he break in how long do he get 30 year so it make he a little more than a half way do unless he be be parole no no it be too easy I interview Harbin twice he be a pervert he be a small time burglar with a fetish for lingerie I mean he be a creep but he be not the Keystone Killer believe I our guy have not be in jail for all these year all right I be go to call Garica see what she can dig up on this guy he be not the guy Jason what be we do here what do you mean well be Ryan interested in catch the Keystone Killer or just prove he be right Scott Harbin be parole 3 month ago oh yeah to Philly yeah look like it and hey guess what bad boy miss his last appointment with his parole officer well that right there make he a wanted man do not it uh huh uh huh and I have an address on he you be amazing you have no idea FBI SWAT stop I say stop ok ok all right all right be you Scott Harbin what Scott Harbin Ya that be Scott Harbin hey come on Ryan you get old have not we all miss an appointment Scott oh they send the FBI now for parole violation Ya we be in the neighborhood excuse I fellas thank Hotch Ya look at that sock 3 inch underwear 6 inch they teach you that at basic training Ryan think he might have a military background Hey Morgan what be the chance he label his secret what do you think I do not know he do not seem to be a guy who need to be in control he be definitely obsessive everything have its place probably come from year of solitude huh Misdirect upbringing and this be a guy who like to be alone share a jail must have be a nightmare be you finish do I make you angry do I upset you what you be go to hurt I no I be not stupid no uou you would not hurt I here you would wait sneak up behind I and hit I over the head just when I be not look what be the matter Scotty can not deal with woman who be not afraid of you Hey Morgan Yo think he make his own movie well if he be a control freak or Ryan think he be why would not he where be the tape be you okay what do you mean get a little hot do I say anything that be not true nope well then I guess I be fine hear that yah I get it I get it oh man give I a hand what give I a hand hey a little help no it be okay it be okay no no no we be the FBI get an ambulance right now move I be on it call the EMT Roger that Ya here he come bring he out I will call you back Scott Harbin single obsessive military background fit your profile but he keep his victim in his house he be that far off script Ryan it be get your name on it be not Scott Harbin an inelegant creature a monster there be no light with he no balance he be pure evil Balance be what give one mercy you will be remind of my brand of mercy tomorrow Max what do that mean Scott Harbin be a predator just not the one we be look for Cordon off the area at least six block radius someone must have see this guy well that be get to be a first a killer actually lead we to another killer come on we all know they make the good profiler they admire each other 's work Ya but usually from the far at least we get Harbin off the street all right let us review what do we know about the Keystone Killer well we know that he be not dead or in jail enjoy taunt the game Ya he be in complete control he strangle 7 woman in the 1980 's stop for 18 year and then begin again suffocate they 10 of all violent crime be cause by strangulation it only take 11 pound of pressure to fully incapacitate your victim and if you hang on for at least 50 second they will never recover when you suffocate someone you actually have less control over their death it be actually more passive because the killer do not feel the life leave the body he be change almost everything that he do why why why why what I mean what be he get out of this new M O where be his payoff you get Carla Bromwell she sustain a significant head injury Blitz attack suggest disorganization no self confidence this be a guy who walk into 7 victim home prior to this there be no force entry at any of the scene where be the loss of confidence he would never change the way he kill by choice what we 've be operate under the assumption that he purposely change his m o you be say he change because he have to change he knock her unconscious and it be not to scare because he could not control she physically while she be awake he could be incapacitate at least partially maybe an injury or a stroke either way you be go to have to have medical record agree yes so what be we talk about this have to have happen after the middle of 1988 in Philadelphia somebody who fit the rest of the profile it be a lot of hospital record call our girl Friday we be release a profile of the man we be look for we be hope that someone out there see this will recognize some of the element he be most likely a white male in his late 40 's with a military background and well educate he have a need for power and control so he probably have a job with some type of authority you 've just describe half of the man live in Philadelphia how do that help we if you would let I finish Killer write in his last letter that he would strike again within 2 day how close be you to an arrest I be not at liberty to discuss the progress of this on go investigation my name be Philip Bromwell my sister Carla be murder yesterday by a man you people should have stop 18 year ago be you at liberty to explain how I be suppose to tell our mother about this I be very sorry for your loss Mr Bromwell please know that we do have the very good team assemble to handle this be not special agent Ryan work with the FBI again he be unable to solve the murder before what make you think he be capable now Agent Ryan be one of a number of man work on this case there be no blame to be put on any one man or division I would hate to be stand out there in front of those jackal well jj she can hold her own you be all well at the press thing than we ever be well we have a lot more of it to deal with now they need someone to blame I guess it be I be you okay with that no the fact be that I have not be able to solve the case so I be an easy target but if I if we do close it that will all go away and you think you will be able to you know just walk away I will not have any choice but do not you want to I mean do not you get to a certain point where you want to relax maybe spend sometime with your family Family I lose that a long time ago I have not even see they in year as far as relax the B A u do not employ too many agent with a relaxing kind of mentality do they well we 've get some record to go through something debilitate enough to lose strength permanently I be still think stroke you know Ryan 's profile put the unsub in his late 20 's be not that too young for a massive stroke technically you be never too young for a stroke 80 of stroke be ischemic the other 20 or hemorrhagic which usually result in death ischemic stroke occur when plaque build up in the artery cause restricted vessel to be block by a blood clot okay but do not it take year for that type of plaque to build up ah typically well then like I say he be too young do you know that stroke victim that play virtual reality game show significant advance in recovery than those who do not now here be somebody in 1987 he be 30 single dishonorable discharge it be a good start what be the injury break neck intensive skull therapy for 9 year what be he be do since the guy move to the Florida Keys he be a scuba instructor he be get the right idea come on there be get to be something in here take a break be there anything bad than cop shop coffee Nailed cop shop donut you know at home I actually have to make the coffee bad now to enjoy it Ya I 've have what you make you be say you do that to I on purpose well what be friend for remember that uh Boise child murderer how could I forget he Lake City detective Griffin be his name right Ya I remember we get to that man that man be nearly suicidal literally have kid drop around he like file you tell he feel guilty when a series of crime be occur that you can not stop natural response important thing not to let yourself become another victim hey this be different really really you see Jason somewhere I think in my subconscious I hope that write this book would draw he out that he miss the attention and maybe maybe I want to play his game you have no idea he would kill again no but he do and now there be another woman out there in danger you know this man well than he know himself you always have now you 've get an advantage you 've get a team of most incredible agent in the world out there and you be stand here alone if you let we we will help you find he Helen 's run down injury on college campus the guy 's well read he may have be a professor there be just too many hospital clinic long term care facility we would be sift through record for week come on there be get to be someway to narrow down the search right we rule out a stroke and half the hospital do not even say how the accident occur accident in America someone be involve in a car accident once in every 10 second car accident with injury would all be report by the police we profile he drive a late model American make sedan all right so how about I get Garcia to check Philly PD record for accident involve American make sedan in serious injury it be a long shot it be a shot Start with 1988 if it be an accident it stop he in his track speak I need

one of they be impale on a 6 foot wooden pole who would want to torture 5 college freshman they be not tie up and no one escape no single unsub could 've exert this much control over so many people so you think there be mo than two I think we be look at a pack a pack 3 or more that kill in unison as in nature of the group dynamic dictate the pack 's survival be dependent on their ability to hunt successfully and as in nature of pack will keep on kill until it run out of prey or be stop stop by what strong pack Nietzsche write the individual have always have to struggle to keep from be overwhelm by the tribe Sheriff I be special agent hotchner the be agent reid and gideon I be hope there be more of you the other agent go straight to the station house to look at the victim 's file have forensic have any luck County csu go through for print and trace evidence they say with all the workman trample through here look at footprint would be a waste come on the body be almost completely skin yet there be so little blood I think I know why the unsub avoid area of skin on the wrist and the throat area where the vein and artery be close to the surface why would they do that they do not want they to bleed out these kid be skin alive two case of beer two sleeping bag there be a third sleep bag upstairs everything you need for a night of teenage romance it be unlikely the two couple bring a fifth wheel to take note Sheriff it be possible there be a third girl here a sixth victim I will get my deputy to canvass the area see if anybody see a girl you say there be another one outside yeah he be like the other Coroner say from the amount of blood he be alive when they impale he I know this be go to sound strange but the way the victim be flay alive mutilate and now the impalement display of this last victim what these be all war ritual of the native american plains indians that mean something to you sheriff I will say it do everything you see around we be apache land this whole basin 's a sacred burial ground and be the sight of a number of massacre as I understand so this development be on their land it be their land but they do not have the money or the inclination to build on it so the town seize half of yeah last year the supreme court rule city could use imminent domain authority to seize and repossess undeveloped private land for private development and now the town be look for investor to build on the other half the apache be fight it of course in court be there be any violence until now nothing like this you know anybody on the reservation capable of this I do not know Reservation 's federal jurisdiction sound like where we need to go go call garcia see what she can find ok one order of bad guy on the apache reservation come right up let us hear it apparently there be a militant group there in the 70 call the irm any of they still around no there be a guy on the reservation now who be be lock up more than a few time for demonstration resist arrest mostly political protest type stuff Yowsa get this his father be kill in a shootout with federal agent wound knee his name Benjamin blackwolf the son john Blackwolf Thanks Garcia Blackwolf John blackwolf you know he indian activist he be be in a little trouble relate to his activism but nothing violent not around here should we call the reservation police and alert they I do not think that be a good idea why not Blackwolf be the reservation police Jane bear these be fbi agent Gideon hello Hotchner how do you do and reid Miss bear be the president of the tribal council and principal of the reservation school President and the principal you must be a busy woman We'rout here on our own agent Gideon we all do our part be uh John inside be this about the terra mesa killing they just want to talk to he John blackwolf have do more to help his tribe than anyone Hell jim how many time have you call he in to find lose hiker how many drunken camper have he track down for the park service John be a peaceful man who would not hesitate to defend this tribe with force if attack what do this have to do with terra mesa well a lot if john consider the building of the terra mesa development on apache land to be an attack the developer have pay a lot of family to leave the reservation so many family have go now that we can barely fill a single class force the dene the apache nation to abandon their home and live in government control internment camp do anybody know the last tribe to surrender to the american government it be the chiricahua apache and do anybody know the name of the last leader of the apache Geronimo that be right he be catch by the u s Army 5 time but the ga'he have give he so much strength he escape each time Samuel yes tell the man from the fbi who the ga'he be the ga'he be mighty spirit who dwell in desert cave Reid be your name samuel Sorry be the ga'he good spirit or bad spirit they be both like man I will take over for you john Mr Blackwolf I be agent gideon these be agent hotchner and reid you look like a college professor you look like a student you you look like fbi we be with the behavioral analysis unit profiler should know well how be that we do not do massacre you do I personally your government Mr Blackwolf would like for you take a look at these photo and help we figure out how these kid be kill you be not ask because I be a cop no we be ask because you be an expert on native american culture I do not base my opinion on picture mr Hotchner I have to walk the ground we should start inside Forensics say the outside be be contaminate from all the construction traffic of all the native american tribe the apache be most renowned for their tracking ability it be say they can track a man or animal through any condition by simply notice the slight disturbance in the environment he be profile the dirt I notice you do not carry a gun 21 foot what ask agent hotchner there he be the real gun hand why do you say that you carry two gun the maximum distance an attacker with a knife can close in the time it take to react draw your sidearm and fire be 21 foot inside 21 foot I win Outside I have other option besides shoot a man like negotiate like run why do you say I carry two gun your right instep print 's heaver than your left and since you dot appear to have a clubbed right foot you can not tell that from my footprint it be no perceptible difference between they your problem be not with your print it be with your perception what do you see there be a saying once too much blood have be spill on the same ground that ground develop a thirst for it this be all consistent with native american warfare ritual but it be not apache whoever do this carry out the most brutal practice of the apache Navajo comanche pueblo and sioux no one tribe every do they all not like this Real indians would know that this be not indians and if you wanto figure out who do this it might help to know there be a sixth person in the house why do you say that female 90 95 pound Size 6 shoe fall arch she be walk alone when she be ambush by two man we also believe there be at least three suspect three yeah two over here plus at least six over there because while these two carry this girl strule to their vehicle to the east at least six other run single file to hide their number from the west so you be say that there be eight at least and one hostage you waed to see how I behave at the scene of therime you can at least tell I how I do you be lack of anmotional reaction at see the crime lead I to believe you'rennocent a guilty man would 've feign disgust exactly do you know what count coup be no the apache know they could easily prove their superiority by kill many of the enemy tribe but they also know killing would start a fierce blood feud which would result in t waste of life and resource make sense so the apache prove their superiority by count coup stealthily steal property usually horse from right under the nose of their enemy to the apache kill unless absolutely necessary be a sign of stupidity and weakness Ifhis your way of say you be not the killer we already know that so why be I still talk to you Hotch so if there be another girl out there no one 's report her miss none of the paper have receive any claim of reonsibility or ranm demand ' d like for you to stay and help with the profile briefing if it will keep the fbi off the reservation I will stay each torture ritual have specific religious significance but only to the tribe that pctice it it be highly unlikely that any one tribe would mix they all together like this Meaning whoever do this obviously have knowledge of native american culture but they have absolutely no practical understanding of it what we know ishis pack share a singular vision whether they share religious faith racist ideology or political manifesto each member of this unit have surrender its individual identity to the group it be the act of kidnapping that reveal the nature of this pack from the german red brige to the munich olympics to iraqi insurgence the act of kidnapping be a characteristic of political terrorist group we could be look for a domestic terrorist organization like the symonese liberation army that kidnap patty hearst but these be indians right I seriously doubt it the torture and mutilation you see here be very confused imitation of warfare practice by native american tribe be you try to tell we that indians would not be so brutal no I be say that indians would not be so confud can we really be sure he be right well I be fairly certain blackwolf be not in on it but you do not need to be einstein to realize these people be indians or people that make it look like indians why would anyone want to frame these indians possibly to turn public opinion against they Sheriff you mention the apache be fight the land grab in court public opinion would be a significant factor be there anyone besides the developer who might be vehemently oppose to the indians get the land back the adu who be that american defense union found by a local businessman name roy minton they be like the minute man who control the border only these guy blame everything on the indians who be the member Mion 's people be mostly white construction worker build supply vendor Working class people that believe indians be stand in the way of progress and commerce whether they feel the indians be stand in the way of progress or profit or they be just nuine racist I think minton and the adu be strong suspect let us bring minton in Mr Minton any idea who might be behind these killing the indians have a history of violent behavior pecially the apache do you know that they use to kill white settler decapitate the body put their victim head on wooden pike outside their house that be a long time ago you still seem pretty upset about it that be the other night my family 's beeneale with the apache for year you know your rhetoric sound just hateful enough to justify violence we do not need to stoop to their level we be fight the indians in court be that right then why all the gun roy our recordshow that your member carry over firearm we be simply exercise our constitutional right under the second amendme we have the right to defend ourselves gun roy I do not think so that be n self defense that be plain paranoid not anymore if minton be as fanatical as he pretend to be he would not file lawsuit or organize labor union the indians be keepg minton and the member of the adu fr make a lot of money on the development and construction of the apache land I agree he be use racist ideology to cover simple greed Sheriff I would like you to put minton under surveillance you think he be guilty not likely but we 've just give minton reason to believe that some faction of the adu may have take matter into their own hand and minton may lead we to they it be garcia hey what have you get I have an ncic hit on one of the print on the slide glass door Ingrid griesen 19 year old family move she here two year ago from texas where they require fingerprint for driver 's license application she be not among the victim on the scene ok nice job think we might have find our sixth victim how old be ingrid when your wife pass away 14 and then you raise she on your own why didn'tou report your daughter as miss mr Griesen I do not know she be miss she have her own place she have her own life at school her own friend when be the last time you speak to her couple week ago she be be go through a phase the past couple of month distance herself have anyone threaten ingrid not that I know of have you receive any menang phone call or see anyone in the neighborhood anything that be be unusual at all no nothing like that we have reason to believe that people who kidnap your daughter may be politically motivated they killethose kid and they kidnap ingrid in the name of their cause think the first thing or the good thing you can do to help your daughter be for you to go on the news how will that help ingrid if we can personalize ingrid to the public the public will take any harm that come to she at the hand of the kidnapper personally hurt she would hurt their cause that will stop they from kill she it might ok hey so father blame themselves when a child be kidnap as irrational as it be it be typical this guy do not do that why not well in these situation innocentarent do not hide their feelgs of guilt while guilty parent do so we be think this guy 's guilty of something Ingrid be my only child she be my whole life please return ingrid to I talk to she and you will see she be a sweet child she be never hurt you have to see this anything you need contact I directly I will try what do we do everything I can to help we get rid of her whatever it take I be ask you please leher go we 've get a caller on the line have griesen be preppe Caller do not want to speak to griesen in fact he do not want griesen to know at he be even call this be special ent aaron hotchner yeah we have ingrid griesen we will turn ourselves and the girl in under one condition I be listen you do not tell griesen about it what do it matter to you what I tell griesen because he pay we to kidnap she do not move hey do not shoot where be the girl she be in the van get her Ingrid my name be Elle I be with the fbi be you ok just tell I what happen Peter griesen hire we he know about our record but he say he would ge we a chance two week ago he call we into his office say he have some off the clock work for we what kind of work he say his daughter be in tuble he say he want we to follow her grab she and take she to the motel you do not question his motive well of course we do but then he give we half theoney he say if we harm her accidental or otherwise he'dake sure we pay for it so he want you to kidnap she but not hurt she yeah so we grab she take she to the motel then we call griesen and he say co by in the morning but he do not show what about the killing we do not know anything about that we see it on the news the next morning we call mr Griesen he say hold tight he would come around in the afternoon but he do not show so then the next night he be on the news and he be talk about kidnapper and look man we may be dumb all right we be not stupid I make the call right then you kidnap the girl but then you leave just minute before someone else come and kill those kid we do not kill they kid we be with she the whole time since you can ask she well that be quite the story thing be they be tell exactly the same one I believe it be the truth why would you kidnap your own daughter you kidnap your daughter and coincidentally save her own life right now at the very least it look like you have prior knowledge of the killing and at worst I have nothing to do with the murder you pay leland and van owen to kidnap ingridwhy I want my phone call ifhat you be say be true it seem likely your daughter be somehow involve in these killing she have nothing to do with it you stay the hell away from her I want the name of all your daughter 's friend at school boyfriend I want her class schedule Ingrid 's very private we have 5 dead kid Tortured mutilate and murder and all we have to go on be you and your daughter do the math it be garcia I get this you re yeah yeah all right yeah talk to I hello ingrid I be dr Spencer reid I be with the fbi and I be wonder if you could griesen ingrid excuse I Griesen ingrid do not look like minton or the adu be part of it my man have be look at he and his friend check on alibis nothing the only thing I be certain of be that peter griesen be try to protect his daughter Hotchner Ingrid be not catatonic anymore but she be answer evy question with only her name and social security number like a prisoner of war there be more Garcia do some check Ingrid have not be enrol in school for over a year she have good grade just suddenly drop out and vacate her campus apartment she leave no forwarding hotch we have no idea where or how she be be live thank I need to see ter griesen 's phone record how long have your daughter be in a cult Unit 4 I be still on a code 6 outside the minton residence look like everyone be go to bed over 10 4 patrol Base out about a month ago you place a call to a psychiatrist in boulder name dr Richard frank he be a deprogrammer and his specialty be get kid out of cult your daughter join a dangerous cult and you could not convince she to leave so you have she kidnap now you be protect she because you think ingrid and her cult kill those kid and you be probably right there be another kill a family of 5 be slaughter in exactly the same way as the terra mesa killing and among the dead be three girl Ages 5 8 and 1 legally this could go a long way in distance your daughter from the other if ingrid have a change of heart a case could be make for brainwashing or even temporary insanity Mr Griesen we need you to tell we what you know about ingrid 's situation it be all my fault ever since her mother die I 've do everything I could for her somehow I leave she vulnerable to these people give the wrong circumstance this could happen to anyone 's child tell we what happen Ingrid be in her first semester she start act strange she hardly visit anymore when she do she be different how how be she different the way she speak she keep repeat these word this jargon I do not know where she be get it and she just disappear Cults commonly have theirwn language they invent or redefine certn word only the cult member understand it be a way of isolate the member from outsider it be a very powerful form of thought control if you could help we identify some of the key word perhaps we could get ingrid talk she say I be a trespasser that I have no right to be here New mexico in the desert she say grandfather have teach she the way of oh what be the word Ofahi gaji ga'he yes that be right thank you we be look for the cult leader typically man between the age of 25 and 35 with a high level of intelligence sociopathic underachiever with an extremely abusive childhood and obviously someone with an interest in and affinity for apache culture and ritual look for male with criminal record for less type crime Drug possession petty theft what about school record the victim from the first crime scene be terra mesa university maybe the leader be there too that be great look for student who sty native american culture extensively we need to do it all with this second strike it could be a spree sorry about your man jimmy I appreciate that that her she will not give we anything but her name and her social thank ok they be ready everybody out come with I my friend want to show y something Ingrid name be john blackwolf I know who you be you be the son of benjamin blackwolf the chiricahua apache come with I what do you think happen here ingrid I think three little trespasser meet the vengeful blade of the tribe Whatribe would that be there be only two people the apache know who trespass against we you be not apache ingrid no you be not apache not anymore Grandfather test I he send I to the desert mountain to be bless by the ga'he the ga'he have bring grandfather back to we to build his new tribe to reclaim the sacred land for the apache where be grandfather do grandfather ever tell you where the name apache come from it come from the yuni word apachu it mean enemy and if grandfather know the first thing about the real apache he would 've teach you to refer to we as the dene it mean the people Grandfather say that you and all the live apache be like the jews of old Lost and wander the desert in search of their messiah and he have the dene do not believe in a messiah you be lie to ingrid the ga'he say do not use a word you do not understand the ga'he be not magic fairy they be not god as you understand they this be not the blood of an enemy this be the blood of a little girl just like you be you 've be feed bit and piece of a culture you do not understand you do not know what we do know be you 've be manipulate and exploit by a very disturbed individual you be a liar you have disavow your ancestor only those who dwell at the deadland deserve to live the deadland be on the southern edge of the western tract you say cult like this se out remote place yes they like to isolate their follower and give they freedom to create their own society ok I get it it do not get any more remote than the deadland how big an area be this place about square mile we will need to narrow it down we might just have our cult leader it be a guy name jackson cally he be expel from tmu six month before the other what for Mescaline Peyote Terra mesa be the last in a string of college he study religion and native american culture in every school and he be in a seminar in native american culture with ingrid griesen that be how they know so much about I I 've be a guest lecturer in that seminar for the past 4 year if cally be our cult leader we need more information on he have garcia pull every shred of cally 's life of the system she be already pull it do we know he be still in the area he be arrest for trespassing on a bunch of motel property break into unoccupied room but his last know aress turn up cold Most cult do not have any legitimate mean of pay rent they tend to seek out abandon previously stand structure like manson 's spahn ranch there be an abandon motel off route 29 right in the middle of the deadland Let us go I will stay with reid and we will pull as much as we can on cally Fbi do not move put your hand out to the side and turn around very slowly Jackson cally Grandfather there be no one else here hotch where be the other hunt Jackson Gordon cally 32 year old spend most of his childhood move from foster home to foster home Hang on a second I be go to put you on speaker Ahead reid simply another sad but unremarkable statistic aside from the fact that he have an iq of 189 any criminal record at 18 he spend 22 month in prison for auto theft I just speak to the warden at the prison say when he be there he find religion and begin preach to his fellow inmate and that he once convince a mass murderer he be do time with to beat to death an inmate that be threaten cally ever since he be a child this guy just survive on cunning force of personality spend 22 month in the clink be release and then bounce from university to university study you guess it native american culture ok thank what be his connection to the apache aside from take your class nothing that they could find with sociopath like cally there be no connection if it have not be apache he would 've find some other culture to attract and manipulate his follower like manson cally have be force to become an expert profiler of sort he read the people around he he find a way in and then he brainwash they to serve his need and the only way to figure out his game be to play it I be go to give he exactly what he want what be that an audience Mr cally I be special agent aaron hotchner with the fbi you know I spend my whole life talk to cop and doctor something different about you you be not just a cop be you you be very perceptive so what be you I be a profiler so be I your colleague respect you a great deal look to you to find all the answer Leadership be a grave responsibility they do not call I grandfather well in my tribe grandfather be simply another word for teacher do you teach your tribe to murder no I do not teach murder I teach love Love of land Love of ancestor Love of the tribe these trespasser poison the land the apache will soon remember who they be and they will hunt these trespasser off their land until no one but the apache remain you think you speak for the apache but you be nothing but a coward and a killer I have not kill anyone do you think that your little tribe be go to wage a war with all the white peoplen this state pretty soon we will not have to why be that what be go to happen when the angry white man come to the door of your child blame you for the killing of their people what be you go to do call the cop no you be go to string they up you be go to put their head on pole and rape their woman just like the savage animal you really be too bad you could not be the leader that your father be before they shoot he down enough Blackwolf let I in with he alone I will get he talk you 've do more than we could ' hope for you guy take cally down to the sheriff 's office you tell that man he be welcome on my reservation anytime I will give you a ride back Blackwolf get cally to reveal his true nature he be a racist none of this be for the sake of the apache never be it be always about cally it be about power and manipulation Charles manson claim that he order his follower to kill white in order to initiate a race war something he refer to as helter skelter and he believe in the aftermath of helter skelter the black who he deeme inferior would need a white man to lead they there be a large cache of gun miss from minton 's house why why would cally suddenly need gun his whole m o be to fight a war use the native american method maybe he be not try to fight a war maybe he be try to start one the first attack be design to look like indians in an attempt to manipulate the a d u to retaliate against the reservation but they do not how could they we have they put under surveillance so cally try to provoke they far by kill the head of the a D U Minton and his family right but that do not work either so now he want to attack the other side he be try to provoke the indians by stage an adu attack against they Call blackwolf we need to get to the reservation the school be for our most vulnerable target Killing kid in 61 cochise lead his follower to fight put that away what you do not need it use your baton the be many path to the same place trust I just so you know you sound like a fortune cookie Split up find they Hey Psst big mistake stay down I do not want to hurt you down do not move do not shoot I give up you ok just have to shoot

bad I do not think he be go to make it at least I do not shoot he I think I would rather be shoot there be an old apache say you can take many path to get to the same place be with you in a second nice what be this Paul morris he be in the new york field office if you ever need anything give he a call he will take care of you this your way of say I can not take care of myself no it be my way of

remind I and thank this be uh a pretty mess up go away present you know that Brother worry you need to get out of the office more tell I about it so I be starve how be the food it be pretty good let I fix you something special I be in your hand want a beer sure man thank so be you a knick fan 10 million a year they be pay Larry Brown you be from here no out of town suit yourself you sure this be where you wanna be do you hear I Walter Derbin age 52 his body be find in his cab in east harlem he be blindfold and shoot once in the chest Death be cause by knife stab through his ear he break off the handle and put the blade lodge in his brain it be the same signature as two other murder Rachel Holman 24 find in her apartment 3 week ago on the low east side and kaveh surrani 30 the police find he 2 week later in his painting studio in hell 's kitchen different location different victimology it be possible we be look for someone who will hunt indiscriminately Nypd have any lead Guy 's a ghost he kill at night there be no witness be the nypd feel the strain well they 've withhold detail so the press have not sniff out a link between the murder with no discernable victim pattern the killer 's practically impossible to stop do you know the original zodiac killer actually continually change his victim young old man woman white black exactly and he kill for 30 year without ever be catch Criminal Minds Season 01 Episode 17 W H Auden say murder be unique in that it abolish the party it injure so that society must take the place of the victim and on his behalf demand atonement or grant forgiveness this be not how I plan to spend a few day home in new york I would kill for an afternoon at barney 's and dinner at il cantinori I be look forward to see new york you 've never be to new york we 've never have an unsub there I think you be go to talk to Reid about take some vacation time what be vacation time Reid it be a one hour flight well if we have some time I will show you around it be 3 hour train ride man ok here be what we know Blitz attacker be almost always male he got pick up in the pour rain by a new york cabbie so we definitely know he be not a brother the fact that he kill in a major urban setting without detection indicate he be highly intelligent how intelligent can he be and blitz attacker be textbook disorganized killer yeah but he bring along a murder kit Blindfold knife how disorganized can he be we will split up we will take the last two crime scene in the meantime let us talk about what we can agree on a blindfold likely mean one of two thing the unsub might blindfold they initially if he be unsure of kill they and want to avoid detection exactly but since we know the cab driver could not have be blindfold when he drive the unsub we be look at reason number 2 blindfold a victim suggest the unsub feel remorse do not want his victim to look at he as he kill they what be in that building nothing it be be vacant for a couple of month this train go express after midnight it do not even stop here he pick this spot beforehand his last fare be log in an address on church street you have any idea what be there Church be an entry point for brooklyn there be a dive there where the cabby stop for coffee before the overnight shift explain how he get a cab this guy 's definitely not disorganize Rachel holman Change of address card she just move in have not even fill out yet so she probably do not know her neighbor and they be not likely to check in on her Nope I also find this it be a printout of a A meeting in the area she be start a new life hey you guy check this out the cop ' theory be that she be home and the unsub break in through the front window and surprise she but look this be the gunshot to the chest this be the knife to the head so then after she be shoot she try to run away from he toward the door exactly he be already in the apartment when she get home the hallway be the only room in the apartment with no window no one could see he so he just wait patiently so she come home and she open the door and she walk in the hallway she walk down and then bam he shoot she right here but she try to run away and he be on her so why do not he just shoot she again why stab she and break the blade off in her head well there be a number of possibility through the ear be the soft path to the brain snap the handle 's also common in prison shanking break it off other guy can not pull the blade out what be the other possibility Lawrence bittaker and roy norris drive ice pick into their victim 's head and break off the handle it be possible our unsub be sort of a uh serial killer groupie so be this guy an ex con or some nut job with an amazon account this particular unsub present a mixed profile no offense then what good be it the profile be just a starting point for narrow down the suspect for instance the fact that the unsub shoot his victim first suggest that he need a quick and effective mean of control the situation it be possible that he feel he can not overpower his victim it could be that he have a physical problem or that he be not confidant just because he be small we now know he have a high degree of organization that couple with the fact he hunt at night mean he probably have a steady job so we be look for a small angry white guy with a day job maybe it be wilson cut it no that be all right that be all right you be right there be a lot we still do not know but we do know this these be not blitz attack they be too control these be absolutely execution an unsub 's signature be his own extremely rare combination of m o and ritual an unsub kill to satisfy an inner need and he will continue kill until that inner need which be base on a ritual be live out perfectly because reality never live up to fantasy this become an impossibility in other word he be not go to stop kill until we catch he ok hit the street and keep your head on a swivel thank you very much hi Jennifer jareau we speak on the phone Detective bennett hello Agent Hotchner so I speak to your point man I reiterate how important it be to keep the crime scene detail under wrap but it would go a long way if it come out of your mouth too you get it if this guy 's who we think he be we be talk terror like New York have not see since sum of sam may I help you be you ok so this be where terror start how have they find he Night janitor he see anything no but he remember a parishioner who be here early so there be a potential witness right there this lady Mm hmm help yeah first public kill he be get bold huh he do not let his surrounding alter his method he be meticulous presentation be important as the kill as soon as the police ask I if I would see anything I have a sickly feeling so you see he not his face he have a hood on and he keep his head down but something about his behavior unsettle you I be sorry I should have know there be no way that someone could know something like this it almost feel like he could not hear I like he be in his own world you know you speak to he I just ask if he be ok and he do not speak he do not even look up I could not stop watch his hand they be move like he be play a piano or finger a rosary maybe he could have kill I unless he be not kill at random and whatever these people have in common 's what get they kill I be sorry would it be possible to maybe slide that thing out of his ear I think maybe he be uncomfortable be in this parish why would it be uncomfortable because of all that business a year ago the rector be indict for pedophilia a lot of people stop worship here but father Breeman be try in a court of law and find innocent it be not my place to question that he be not use just any knife it be make of flint as in stone in egyptian mythology flint be the symbol for protection and retribution with hieroglyphic they use to depict dangerous animal like scorpion and snake be cut with flint knife in order to render they powerless anything strike you as strange the blood 's all on the inside Fount of all knowledge check my flow I need you to check all the victim and see if any be charge with a crime ok you wanna time I or should I just dazzle you off the clock ok Kaveh surrani vehicular manslaughter try and find not guilty july 2002 Rachel holman convict of cocaine possession 2004 oh baby girl just say no no acquittal uh wait hold on same case she be also up on charge for administre a fatal dose of heroin to her boyfriend Jury find she not guilty can we go 3 for 3 Yahtzee our cabbie walter derbin Spousal battery Bastard but he be innocent if you wanna call it that charge be drop mid trial 4 month ago you be a genius you be just say that 'cause it be true thank if the victim be blindfold first the blood would have flow over the blindfold he put it on after he kill they all 3 charge with a felony all 3 find innocent and that do not show up on your man 's radar acquittal no why be it important because we have a new profile we know believe these killing be not random we might be deal with a vigilante the unsub first shoot his victim in order to subdue they Flint knife then provide both an efficient kill and symbolic retribution finally the victim be blindfold like the statute of lady justice this particular unsub he display both a heightened it be actually almost a poetic sense of right and wrong serial vigilante be extremely rare the exaggerated drama of these killing suggest that they be somehow personal he or someone close to he be likely the victim of a violent crime his first killing be possibly against his original attacker and since then he be develop an overblown sense of justice in order to justify that kill to himself because he choose the imagery of lady justice it be possible we be deal with someone who work in or around the criminal justice system Lawyer paralegal bailiff even a judge we will cross check unsolved murder against suspect in assault case and victim who work in the system whatever the unsub 's job he be someone who be a cog in the machine he be overwork undervalue he be use to not be notice his sense of theatric be a way to enhance his own self esteem convince himself he have a high purpose and he also know that people look right through he be faceless be his good defense against protection he be everyone one last thing we need you to close rank the more detail slip out the more he will feed off it we do not want he believe he capture the public 's fear or imagination too late the afternoon edition 's lead with the vigilante story how do they get it I do not know you be worried about this guy become another son of Sam now we might be deal with a vigilante folk hero like bernhard goetz so you know there be a big hole in the profile you present back there can you pass the moo shoo please what be the hole I leave out the possibility our unsub might be a cop well the do know the system they be definitely overwork and underpaid they see so much injustice every day they can easily take matter into their own hand when someone like our victim be kill police refer to the murder as a public service murder you know how many rapist I see walk during my sex crime day none of the victim they do not want to press charge or the jury they say that she be ask for it it be enough to make you explode it be a long way from feel like that and actually commit murder do not you think not really excuse I can I get a fork perhaps do you know that expert credit confucius with the advent of the chopstick he equate knife with act of aggression you do not know how to use they do you it be like try to forage for dinner with a pair of number 2 pencil ok here let I help you oh the rubber band well new york city cop do have a lot of pressure on them every move they make be scrutinize you know the first case of criminal profiling happen when a new york city cop ask a criminal psychiatrist friend to help with the mad bomber case the mad bomber be a major inspiration for the unabomber he elude cop in new york for 16 year start in 1940 but he keep his promise and never set off a single bomb during the second world war psychiatrist james brussels he develop a profile so accurate he predict that when they catch the bomber he would be wear a double breasted suit and it would be button you guy we be here in new york and even when we be not talk about our case we end up talk about another profiler you be right so elle be you see anyone uh gideon why do not you tell the cop that it might be one of their own if we be go to catch the guy we need all the help the cop can give we the last thing I want to do be accuse one of they of murder Gideon it be absolutely incredible 1 3 billion people stay nourished use these thing yeah ok I get it he just take out a cop killer his name 's shawn cooley one year ago he kill 2 port authority cop and he walk because the only witness against he be shoot 6 time outside his apartment it might be worth have your man re canvas this morning People be more likely to talk in the day they feel safe I be already on it more bad news it be the same reporter every time Ncwagner he be practically deify he I be not even happy with the result when god play god you know a few of the man be talk about make he wish list of other dirtbag some day a real rain will come and wash all the scum off the street Taxi driver this town love a psychopath why have not he contact the press yet Reid 's right he be get the symbolism the inflated sense of duty he should be seek out acclaim maybe it be not about acclaim with he he be on a mission maybe it be about the work yeah but the last 2 case be a cop killer and a pedophile priest those be high profile case he be get more confident he be grow until his role be the city judge and executioner I will check the press archive for controversial acquittal maybe we can target the victim before the unsub have the police wait on he Hey guy listen to what come off the tip hotline I get a tip let the guy be how come the nypd want to catch this guy be you jealous he be do the job well than you it go on for half an hour he be a hero the exact same thing happen with the goetz new york subway shoot in the early eighty you be not even bear I read a lot hey talk to I baby who do you love that depend on what you be give I oh do not be such a man I run the name of the 5 victim like you ask no overlap in arrest officer public defender or district attorney do I sense a but small but atne not what I be jonese for you be kill I with entendre but each one be process at the manhattan criminal courthouse at 100 centre street do you have any idea how many case run through there every year 122 998 but at least we 've eliminate 4 other borough hmm yeah great all right it be a start thank Ta do you have any idea how many case 122 998 case a year we will check it out maybe there be someone with a history of erratic behavior who work in the building Crime groupie a security guard that fit the profile get with J J see what you can make of her case list ok I will go with you ever cross your mind take the law into my own hand not the law justice what be this about the boy in iowa it be just a question I guess if I think if I ever let my mind go there then the unsub would be get into my head instead of I get into theirs that would not be a good idea now would it the cop have already be down here ask their question I just want to give you a description of someone see if he sound familiar he be quiet he body language give the impression he be see too much work in this building long enough we all get that way he be small meticulous you might not notice he at first but when you do you realize he be hear everything around he he might have have a personal brush with crime when it happen he talk bout it all the time but now you realize he have not mention it in quite a while and when the subject of the vigilante come up he express his support but it be not something he would bring up in conversation himself well if people be be honest with you that be most of the people in this building how old be you 24 I will give you 6 year that point a tiny part of your brain will be ask if what this guy 's do be not the right way to go anything uh uh you no what happen in iowa it be one of the first case hotch and I work together small town 2 boy have be murder same signature the profile lead we to the local 4 h leader we go to interview he the guy he be suiciderly our gun be draw at some point he turn the shotgun on hotch instead of fire hotch talk he down the guy surrender sound like pretty good work at trial the guy 's wife give he an alibi for both murder small town they all know each other the juror believe she eventually they get he when he kill another boy any luck this guy be not do we any favor his access be unbelievable he be practically scoop we the fbi need help and they get you to do their bidding I be an fbi special agent the rest of the team be too busy they be out in the field yeah and they be do a bang up job too look the fact be you 've scoop every other reporter in new york you 've even manage to be ahead of the cop a few time a good crime reporter need to be well than the police you get less to go on well that be why agent gideon be hope you would accept this invitation to help Jason Gideon he use to be one of the good he still be yeah he have kind of a famous meltdown and a whole string of success since he be return yeah yeah Meltdown 's make well copy maybe you can take that up with he yourself you know if you decide to come in so how do you put together the vigilante angle so quickly I cover the original trial of all the victim you must have a good memory a lot of killer can not remember detail from their own crime some case just stick right in your brain tell we about the victim all right well this girl she be just a waste case the jury buy into the whole addiction as disease bs and this old guy he be a thug he beat his wife but the case fall apart because she would not testify Surrani he drink and drive it be a tragedy but it be the kind of thing that could happen to anybody so who do you think we be look for what be his background my guess be he be a crime victim probably something violent but you do think he be a hero well you know this city make you swallow a lot of crap it be hard not to feel for someone who will not take it anymore these have not be release to the press they be pretty grim I 've see plenty of crime scene right we be stuck on the ear be it for kill efficiency or symbolism why would you stab someone through the ear into their brain what be go on here the profile lead we to think that he work close to the criminal justice system what do you think no no you do not bring I in here because you want my help the profile suggest this guy'd contact the medium he hasn'T and we think the killer would not need to contact the press if he be the press you be single handedly turn this psychopath into a folk hero so what happen you get your man kill on the job and you think everybody else must be a killer too watch your mouth it be ok hotch not our guy you be damn right I do not kill anybody what about you Wagner you be right you be not the killer Mm hmm everything you feel be vicarious you do not have it in you to act this psycho be the last chance for you you 've screw up other job you drink too much probably have a broken marriage or two you be actually hope he do not get catch for a while part of you know that be twisted and pathetic but hey you be just report the news right hey hey the reporter be not a vigilante yeah we know how do you know there be just another shooting in central park you say shoot what about the rest of the signature officer hear the shot but he run off before they get there the victim be an undercover cop I think you be look for I Put the gun on the ground on your knee drop the gun get down do not move no you do not understand I do this all for you we be in this together his name 's will syke he be a security guard at a boutique in soho he be a mug victim last year spend 2 day in intensive care fit the profile how be it go in here he just confess to all the murder so what be you do in the park it be full of animal Muggers and scum drug dealer I know one of they would try to prey on I that be not your usual method I mean you target they you do not let they target you I make that point now I be make this one which be if you hunt we on the street you will die the way you live so why turn yourself in now I can not change the city without help People need to be inspire they need to see I they need to hear my voice can you tell I about the cab driver derbin he be a thug a wife beater and the priest what be to know he prey on young boy be that why you stab he in the groin it be what he deserve thank you why would he confess to murder he do not commit because he have narcissistic delusion he want the glory he want to be a star he go into the park hope that somebody would mess with he he kill your undercover officer but not the other so where do that leave we we know our unsub have a heightened sense of right and wrong if he know that he inspire a would be vigilante to murder an undercover cop he might feel remorse you think you might be able to mend fence with the reporter wagner if it play to his ego yeah we might be able to draw the unsub out that be a good one Wagner say this morning that the cop 's blood be all over the vigilante 's hand how do J J get he to cooperate the unsub may feel a need to be there to physically mourn for what he cause if that article lure he wagner get to claim he catch a murderer it be the ultimate scoop will they know how to spot he I brief your man if the unsub 's there he will be alone out of place not speak to anyone else probably not even make eye contact hopefully he will panic draw attention to himself I can never get that sound out of my head wake I in the middle of the night if there be any justice cop killer would have to hear it for an eternity Hotch hey hotch Hotch it be morgan thank you listen something 's funky man I be here try to get transcript from the victims'original trial I think maybe there cod have be a disturbance at the courthouse or maybe the unsub even make himself know you know what I mean yeah ok well here be the thing there be no record available yet from the cabbie 's trial the clerk tell I that your average court reporter be 3 to 6 month behind in transcribe his note that mean that anyone who know the detail of that case have to have be in the courtroom Court reporter take their work home with they they get pay overtime they take their note in court and finish transcribe they at night you know what bennett say about not be able to get the sound of bagpipe out of her head maybe that be why the unsub stab the ear Killers often harm their victim in way that they themselves have be harm Court reporter by definition be a faceless cog in the machine he sit there day in and day out transcribe testimony what if the voice would not stop when you leave the courtroom they witness at the church say that the unsub be play a piano like motion or transcribe killing a good way to get the voice to stop huh Holla I need the name of the court stenographer in each of the victim ' original trial same one every time Marvin doyle Cross check he against crime record see if he be ever the victim of a violent crime not he his parent kill in an attempt robber ' 04 that be his stressor be he still work 100 center courtroom 12 b we 've get he Marvin doyle be that he Doyle call in sick we be in this courtroom yesterday he see we tell

and here be life insurance check for 250 000 it be 2 year old he do not cash it he will not accept blood money here be a box full of flint knife there be get to be a hundred of them hey guy Come take a look at this it be a stenography machine look at the key they be all wear out it be like he be try to transcribe the voice in his head and he could not keep up look like hieroglyphic it be call steno it be basically a phonetic series of syllable no court reporter take note the same way so no one can translate they but the reporter himself he be getting pay overtime to study potential victim he know we be onto he he be race we now someone in these box be target to die we need to get inside his head and figure out who so we can stop he let us go start fishin ' this be a lot of box how be we suppose to narrow it down check and see if it end in acquittal if it do not toss it aside it have to be a capital case he be escalate the more brutal the well why not go by most recent judging by his elaborate filing system doyle obviously have obsessive compulsive disorder People with ocd often finish task then go back to the beginning and start over so he continually go through the transcript and the first one to trigger he become his next victim here be one this be a liquor store owner who be shoot with his own gun Flip to when they present the defense do the defendant testify no Stick with the one where the accuse take the stand this be personal he hear their voice Doyle 's victim all claim to be a type of victim themselves they first two throw themselves on the mercy of the court plead alcohol and drug dependency the priest say he be a victim victim of recent hysteria look for key phrase Victim mercy anything that signify they think their crime be not their fault I

innocent hostage he have an exaggerated sense of right and wrong and so do I talk 's worth a shot I be come with you shut up he do not do anything to you tell she how you lie tell she how you kill your parent and pretend they would be hurt you they do hurt I I will kill he then you would not get to hear the truth if he admit the truth the voice will stop right they always lie do you have the shot Negative let we interrogate he Put the gun down we be the fbi we will get the truth Marvin I be go to put my gun away we will do this together ok tell he the truth tell he how you lie on the stand they do hurt I do not listen to they if he die they will go away what do you think they will not come back Beverly iowa 1999 a man kill 2 boy only to walk away free and kill another one stop

minor fall and the major lift the baffle king compose hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah Gandhi say it be well to be violent if there be violence in our heart than to put on the cloak of non violence to cover impotence Gandhi also say I object to violence because when it appear to do good the good be only temporary the evil it do be permanent he get what he deserve he only do what the rest of we wish we could do I feel safe when he be alive this be why we need gun control the guy be a murderer he get his own Death penalty I say he be a hero they only kill he because they be afraid no jury would

victima which mean sacrifice no I can not go to the gym I be wait for my shooting script I think it just come uh yeah ok I will see you at the gym babe bye victim of violent crime be brutalize by a subject who take upon he or herself to decide life and death over a fellow human being hi be you go to give it to I Aah there be around 16 million people in the Los Angeles metropolitan area every time a person be kill rob or rape the most important question you will ask yourself be why why do your unsub choose this victim at this time Natalie be there anything do which provoke the criminal to act or be the target available or weak a causality of circumstance Natalie Natalie oh my god oh my god no Natalie no oh my god Criminal mind season 1 Episode 18 you know we really can get ourselves to the airport I do not invite the FBI here to let they make their own way around town we really appreciate it I can not thank you guy enough for conduct the seminar well do not hesitate to call if there be anything we can help with Kim here Great yeah I will be there as soon as I drop the FBI agent at L A x everything all right double murder at a hollywood bungalow a celebrity Young movie star Natalie Ryan and her fiancé apparently shoot to death it be go to be a major pain in the ass you guy care to take a quick look before I drive you to the airport it be on the way absolutely no sign of force entry same weapon the girl be shoot execution style once in the head the male 3 time in the torso so you have 2 different m o S we have an image on the video surveillance camera look like a messenger of some kind wear a motorcycle helmet he be unidentifiable there be no sign of struggle between the girl and the unsub from the door to the couch he most likely force she at gunpoint he tell she to trust he do what I say I will not hurt you fatal mistake he ask she to sit on the couch and then shoot she in the head the fiancé be not expect his killing 's messy it be less control it be less organized what do you think I 've have a couple other case recently past few month same type of weapon 22 caliber handgun both shoot in the head the first be an establish film producer Wally Melman and the second be Chloe Harris another young actress but not as well know as natalie here any forensic evidence no and the guy have be go through this place all morning and have not come up with anything so he clearly know how to cover his track in like a professional hit man maybe Gideon there be people actually take photograph of we from the next yard welcome to L A 22 's be small but efficient they bounce around inside a person like a pinball preferred weapon of the mafia u know there be no obvious sexual component to these crime which be usually the case with serial murder so be be think this be a serial killer well it be certainly a series of murder we do not know enough yet to call they serial would you consider hang out in L A a little while let I lean on your expertise until we do figure out what we 've get yeah just cancel our flight we will have the rest of our team out here ASAP first 2 victim Wally melman and chloe harris both kill in public place Chloe be kill while walk her dog on the beach in santa monica which she do every morning and wally be kill outside of a massage parlor in culver city which he go to every tuesday well if he know their schedule maybe that mean he follow his victim for a while and not a single witness so we know this unsub can blend in regardless of the location he have the ability to hide in plain sight he be meticulous the medium 's call Natalie Ryan 's murder the big celebrity homicide since Sharon Tate what do that mean for we that everybody will be watch this guy be an assassin when you look at the victimolgy there be no obvious link all the kill be clean except in the instance of the last victim Jeremy Collins there be absolutely no evidence leave at the crime scene there be no dna no manifestation of psycho sexual release and there be no detectable signature of any kind remember our profile be formulate not just by what be present at the scene but also what be absent from all the evidence that we 've gather we believe that you be look for a type 4 assassin Type 4 type one 's be political assassin like John Wilkes Booth Type 2 's be egocentric look for simple recognition type 3 's be psychopath cold blooded killer who leave far messy scene and type 4 our unsub suffer from a major mental disorder and be frequently delusional the close we come to figure out that delusion the close we will get to find the unsub what be he go to be do until we do find other victim excuse I hi be there a detective Kim here right here you be head the investigation into the Natalie Ryan murder yes um my I have a client she be uh be there another place we can be private we be all work this murder well um she receive a note my client do and she freak out I tell she not to worry about it where be the note where be your client she be wait in the other room Reid let us go Lila hi how well do you know Natalie Ryan we speak when we see each other in public but we be never friend how about Wally Melman what Wally Melman he be a producer who be kill a couple month ago the paper say that be a robbery the paper be wrong do you know he we meet a few time about a project but I do not get the part they go a different way which way he cast um another act oh my god what be it he cast Natalie Ryan you owe I I guess that be one way to ice out the competition do not look at I I bring she to the police station have you ever have a sense that someone be watch you follow you from the moment I get to work I have hair and make up and wardrobe people producer writer my agent my manager publicist not to mention the photographer it be part of the life anything seem out of the ordinary happen on a regular basis or semi regular basis what do you mean repetitive phone call gift leave anonymously I receive flower

have to go Lila Lila Lila what be happen Spencer it be still rather speculative but it appear there be a delusional assassin who be kill people to help far your career it probably start as a stalker an erotomanic stalker The be a psychopathology of the evolution of these type of stalker and the fact that he be contact you indicate that he believe you owe he something this model frequently conclude itself to one of 2 possibility either the stalker will kill himself or he will kill the object of his affection with this unsub we be look at a compound profile a type 4 delusional assassin with an erotomanic fixation on the actress Lila Archer erotomanic be a form of stalker who posse the delusional belief that another person usually of a high social status be in love with they in the united states at any give time there be over 200 000 people be stalk our unsub be have a fantasy love affair with Lila Archer the way John Hinkley do with Jodie Foster Ms Archer be not aware of her stalker until yesterday he be not try to impress she he be more like an unwanted very violent guardian angel when the stalker feel as if they 've be in some way betray by their love object this often lead to violence against the target in the case of John Robert Bardo when actress Rebecca Schaeffer take a role where she have to have a sexual relationship with another character it be enough to force he to snap and seek she out to kill she though stalker can be either male or female it be most likely we be look for a single male a loner in his late twenty to early forty very intelligent with ample time to follow his victim and study her habit as of yet the unsub have not direct any violence towards ms Archer but he have shift his focus from those around she to she directly this do not preclude the fact that anyone who have the vague association with ms Archer be a potential target I love you you be my favorite client no I have not ask you anything yet I be not stop my life you can

000 the victim be lupe trejo 62 she be find in her home stab in the face chest and genital the paper down there connect her murder to 11 other in the past 2 year all elderly woman they be say it be the work of a serial killer the mexican government disagree what kind of city be this half factory town half tourist town the factory make the tchochke and clothe that tourist buy and even though the murder have happen in the poor neighborhood where the local live serial killer make lousy tourist attraction yeah so if the government deny that this be a serial killer why have they call we they have suspect in custody the victim 's son where be the serial killer expert they want we to go down there and confirm that this be just a one time kill Put the serial killer angle to bed so we be go all the way down there just to prove they do not have a serial killer maybe or we be go down there to tell he if what I 've read in the mexican paper be true they 've get one of the bad serial killer the country 's ever see let us go Hotch Call from the car www ydy com bb Proudly Presents Sync YTET Starry www ydy com bbs criminal mind season 1 Episode 19 Anthony Brandt write other thing may change we but we start and end with family hey at least you get to spend your birthday weekend in mexico yeah what be dog house in spanish La can sa del pair o La casita del perro that be what I say face it chicko you be only a genius in english you speak spanish since when I be full of hidden mystery all right so why be there so few serial killer in mexico they probably have as many as we do but they document almost none of they why be that it be the chikatilo syndrome the what Andre chikatilo one of the most prolific serial killer of the 20th century by the time they find he he have kill more than 50 people he be no more experienced than any average serial killer but he live in the soviet ukraine the soviet be convince the serial killer be a uniquely american phenomenon inevitable result of decadent capitalism so what be the cultural bias in mexico many mexican believe that serial killer be the result of the break down of the family which give rise to the kind of alienated loner who become a serial killer it be a fact that there be 12 time as many broken family in the U S than in mexico all right so be it possible that there be few serial killer in mexican culture it be possible but in my experience evil be not a cultural phenomenon it be a human one nothing like jet sleep right yeah kind of like a night of drink without the drinking Agent gideon Captain navarro you be short than I remember I be on a stage this be lieutenant borquez hello this be my team Captain navarro have be put in charge of the case by the assistant attorney general you guy get history we meet at a seminar I give at mexico citya few year ago sexual homicide in latin america I just read a chapter on the subject in max ryan 's book where do you think I get it from I be glad you come I be never sure how much you like I why be that I 've often tell agent gideon that his profiling technique would not translate accurately in latin culture without a well understanding of our cultural value now be a good time to find out right uh captain I would like to get a handle on the type of press this have be get and meet some of the local police here of course but I imagine you would all like to settle into your room and rest before we go no we be ready let us go so what exactly do you think agent gideon get wrong about your culture well there be two main english english please English I be explain to agent gideon that his profiling theory do not take into account 2 powerful influence on mexican culture which be family and machismo you have some interesting idea the district attorney general put I in charge of this killing when she realize that we have a relationship she have I invite you down to help we settle this mess you be aware that we may not be give you the answer you be look for on this one yes you think the paper be right what be they say exactly SeÑorita there be a serial assassin who be kill elderly woman in local town and the attorney general and the authority be move slowly we will see what be all this Dia de los muertos day of the dead a 3 day latin holiday where soul of dead relative be say to return to earth to enjoy the pleasure that they once know of it sound like he be read that out of a book no trust I he always sound like that actually I be read I pick this pamphlet up at the airport as profiler I think you would want to see the crime scene first before meet the suspect yes you remember something from my lecture huh actually I get it from your mentor max ryan his book it be a great read the victim 's name be lupe trejo 62 she be find in the bedroom by the daughter no sign of force entry be there be always this many people around no Church just get out they be walk home from the town square what time be she kill I be guess some time during the evening mass there would not have be a lot of people around otherwise he would 've be see unless he blend right in let us go no force entry mean one of two thing a push in he hold a knife or a gun to she and force his way inside the murder weapon the knife be take from the kitchen and place at the scene in that case it be most likely that she let the killer in voluntarily she look through the peep hole see someone she recognize someone who make she feel safe she let he in and then what they have a drink hey do you run a dna analysis on this the close thing we have to a crime scene unit be detective hernandez he have a fingerprinting kit from 1984 find anything the victim 's print be on one the print on the other one be too smudge to make any match but I do not think the killer drink this anyway why not this drink be tamarind water it be sweet I could see the victim offer this to a woman but these be family festivity and at night most man will have a shot of tequila some beer and maybe some cigarette this look like two woman to I you do not think a woman could 've do this do you it be highly unlikely get they to the fbi at the very least they will be able to tell we the gender of the drinker where be she kill this way what be you look for why why do the unsub choose this victim why do she feel safe enough to let the killer inside this be her son that be miguel I would say lupe have a problem with he she have family photograph everywhere but not miguel he be tuck away in her drawer ok so the unsub take item of jewelry out of the daughter 's bedroom you think he do it before or after he kill the mother I would say after the way the victim be stab mean this be a sexual homicide when the killer be look for a sexual release the item take be usually an afterthought trophy but he leave jewelry on the victim 's body why it be a common sign of remorse a small amount of respect for the dead very small if you ask I you be almost certainly look for a heterosexual male why do you say that well the victim be find on the bed multiple stab wound to the face chest and genital area all indicator of sexual homicide in case it be a sexual homicide the attacker target object of his or her sexual attraction heterosexual man attack woman so homosexual man attack man do the daughter have any idea about who might have do this she do not have any idea about anything when she find out that her brother be a suspect she want to talk to he alone I refuse because I do not want they to get their story straight then she stop talk completely so what be she protect we be ready to talk to the suspect of course but first there be someone I would like you to meet Maria sanchez District attorney general do not be afraid Agent gideon hello it be an honor our paper be fascinated with the idea of a serial killer and when navarro suggest that I invite you in to dispel this nonsense I immediately see the wisdom but enough formality I will let you get down to business excuse I she be bad in spanish Neighbors hear a loud fight the day of the murder between the victim her son daughter and brother in law one big happy family well the uncle have a solid alibi but we could not find the son then get a tip he have hire a coyote to take he over the border we catch he before he cross that be miguel 's sister rosa she be be here ever since she find out that her brother be arrest seem though she think he be innocent the dutiful sister this way you be go to tell we about the fight you have with your mother the other night I do not hurt my mother do it have anything to do with you leave she do not want I to go she be angry it be more than that miguel you have problem with your mother for a long time what be it you be hide what truth could be so terrible that you do not defend yourself against kill your mother what truth would have your mother hide your photograph in her drawer when do you first know know what that you be a homosexual More to the point when do your mother find out no speak english how do he know you tell we Machismo and family you know he be gay you be a well profiler than gideon as a lecturer you also know that a gay man could not have commit this murder that be why you ask we about the sexuality of the killer at the crime scene you know miguel be innocent you do not understand how thing work here if I tell the attorney general that this one be a homosexual and that be why he must be innocent she would 've laugh in my face why do you lie to we I have to play along with the official line until I could trust that you would come to the same conclusion that I do so we be here to serve as pawn in your political game there be a very bad man kill woman in my district and I 've know this for a very long time but so far no one will believe I or help stop he so if I have to play politic to protect the woman of the city then that be a very small price to pay do not you agree the good way to bring the attorey general on board be by provide a complete profile what do you need from I we need the file of all the murder of course but I must warn you these report be take by local police in the area who be not use to this type of thing most basic detail be miss we will take a look at they we also need to get the whole story out of miguel trejo and right now he be not talk why do that matter obviously he be not a serial killer 'cause there be obviously a great deal of anger in the family and before we give a profile we need to rule out the fact that this might be a crime of passion and not one of the serial killing why would not miguel talk if he be innocent must have something to do with the fact that he be a homosexual he would rather be straight in jail than gay as a free man I can protect he in here but if he be take to a prison in mexico city and the other inmate find out that he be gay he will be kill that be the way thing work here so how do we get he to talk Rosa do you know the say love be blind but not the neighbor we know there be a fight we need to know what it be about Rosa we know about your brother if you do not help we he could go to prison and he could be kill there this could be his last chance rosa do you understand Miguel have a friend Roberto he be outside the house wait for my brother watch he see the fight with my mother do miguel see he I do not think so why do not you tell we about this before because it would mean tell you that miguel be like you say if he go to prison and they know this about he they will kill he and I could not risk that but you be talk about the man who might have murder your mother you do not understand how bad it be you do not understand the shame you do not understand what people will do to we I just lose my mother I can not lose miguel La familia es todo Family be everything she may have come clean about that day but I still think she be hide something the way she go on about shame almost like she be talk about herself this be interesting before miguel meet roberto roberto have a wife well if he be bisexual that make he capable of sexual homicide of a woman and if he blame miguel 's mother for deny their relationship that would give he a motive we need to find roberto Roberto we have to talk please not right here let us walk let us go you do not understand I would never hurt miguel 's mother she be nice to I she be try to accept I but miguel 's uncle make she feel bad for that People like he make it impossible for we they will never accept we why would you follow miguel to his house and why be you watch rosa and her mother Miguel and I have a fight that day he be very upset he get drunk he be go to his family celebration and I be afraid for he I be afraid ofthe trouble he might cause with his uncle what do you see Miguel do not do it be that what you want from I to turn against he I won'T he do not do it no it be not what I ask you be outside of the house watch so what do you see uh I see nothing I see child play and uh a woman what woman I walk past she in the street uh she have paper a badge I think she be a social worker go house to house what do she look like I do not know Heavy maybe forty or fifty Gracias ok it be common for social worker and nurse to come from the city help out elderly woman tell they about benefit they may have it be part of the reach out program so it could 've be the victim who invite the social worker inside or maybe she be the one give the tamarind water or she could be our good witness I will check with local service what about roberto I do not think he do it why not the way he talk about miguel he do not point the finger at his boyfriend I think a guilty man would 've see if he have an alibi run his print against any find at the scene right now though I feel confident we can rule out a family fight as a motive for the murder there be a call from the fbi yeah Morgan Como esta my lovely Es bueno no Tripero esta la ok take it easy garcia I think you just offend somebody 's mother Shut up you I take french what can I say Penelope your last name be garcia yeah I know it be my stepfather 's name now do you want my genius or not yes please get on with it okay so I rush your cup full of mucus through all the regular channel at lightning speed and survey say one female drinker and one male thank doll it be strange on this occasion a man take that drink unless the victim think he be a woman the woman roberto describe the social worker that be a common ruse for old lady killer what if she be really a he in woman 's clothing a heavy woman he come to the door knock on it and the victim feel comfortable because she think it be a woman it would explain why no witness have come forward no one expect the killer to be a woman not in this country or ours we need to tell the local and give they the rest of the profile we have reason to believe that the killer may be a man who wear woman 's clothing as a ruse to get into his victim 's home once inside the killer stab his victim and then abuse they sexually with the knife but he be not always a killer he gradually escalate from sex crime this may have start out as peep tom incident eventually lead to rape and then at some point he could not rape anymore so he begin kill woman who represent authority figure in this life he hate typically a mother grandmother woman that he blame for his impotence Navarro how would he have target these woman we find no connection between they we do not know yet but base on the number of time he be kill and the skill of gain the trust of his victim we can assume that he plan his murder and that he be be commit sex crime for many year we think he be somewhere between the age of 35 50 you need to talk to all know sex offender and compare they to this profile you should also re interview all your witness and see if anyone see a man who might have be dress as a woman Gracias we have another body Isabel santiago 67 no sign of force entry stab in the chest and genital abrasion on her neck Beads from a necklace obviously rip off her neck yeah but jewelry take form the body that be the first we 've see from this guy so why be this one different for the past 2 year we 've have an average of 1 kill every 9 week not 2 in 3 day that be a pretty extreme escalation he will kill again soon who be that over there that be the daughter of the victim maybe she could tell we something about the necklace hello anna my name be elle I be sorry about everything I have some question for you if you could answer they do you think you might be able to answer a few question right now Si yes your mother be wear a necklace it be take from her do you know if it have any special significance to her she give it to I for my birthday she never buy jewelry for herself she ask if she could wear it during the holiday so this cklace be yours it be my favorite I wear it almost every day Navarro say there be some sort of disturbance at the police station we be go to go check it out ok what be go on here borquez what do they do what do they do they be follow the order of the fbi bringing in sex criminal what do you tell they we put out there the possibility that he dress like a woman we tell they to look into people convict of sex crime we do not mean this Maria please what be go on these man be suppose to put the serial killer rumor to rest and now they be make we look like a joke what have you want people to think of we it be a misunderstanding and it will not happen again it be your idea to bring they here and obviously it be a waste of time please go home these police be not stupid man they be frustrate they read article in newspaper say that they be ineffective and they want to prove that they be not they will do this any way they know how we tell they that the suspect be probably a man dress as a woman we do not say to round up all the transvestite and bring they in why be it possible that this man be a transvestite no no no that be not what we be say man dress like woman be a manifestation of sexual preference it be a lifestyle it do not imply a psychology of violent behavior we be talk about the killer 's past that be why we be ask for people who have be accuse of sex crime be the police look onto this how Most rape here be not even report and the rapist be often people who have power they sometimes family sometimes even law enforcement I have interview many many woman and they do not want to talk we can help you we can teach you interview strategy I specialize in sex crime and I speak spanish how do we even get to these woman we hold a press conference let everyone know what we be look for what about the attorney general she want we to leave do not worry about her I convince she to bring you down here I can convince she to let you stay we will have that press conference all I have to do be figure out what to say be forceful but respectful tell they please if you have any information at all we urge you to come forward the one thing we absolutely do know about this kind of criminal be that he do not stop offend until he be stop the reporter will ask why look for a rapist when we be try to catch a killer you do not need to mention the killer just tell they that you care about the woman in this town and that you be committed to catch the man who hurt they why be we look for a rapist because we know this man commit sexual homicide we could also assume that he be once a rapist it be a lot easy to track a rapist than a killer because you have witness you also have the chance to discover something else the reason he begin kill which be the stressor as far as we can tell the first killing be about two year ago what happen to the suspect during that time a typical stressor Loss of job Loss of love he may have be release from prison whatever it be it make he feel impotent make he feel frustrated and very angry and that be when he start kill you should be talk to victim who report rape just before that first murder two year ago hopefully the press conference will help bring some of these woman forward but we also need to head out and talk to some of these people directly you should use all the female police you have that will help put potential victim at ease we do not have any boss you do now ok see you later I 've be talk to so many woman and forget how to speak english well you know you look latina there be a good reason for that my mother 's cuban well my cuban friend we may have something a woman call the police station after she see the report on television yeah she say she have information on the rapist excuse I I be tell you want to talk to I about the rapist we be look for can you help we do you care I be sorry do you care Most of the time nobody around here care what happen to woman nobody do anything about it that be why nobody talk to the police Gimme a second ok what can the police do if when a crime be commit no one come forward the man who attack I be a stupid dog he be a coward he come up from behind and he start to rape I but then I turn around and I start hit he I scratch he I make he bleed and that be when I see he be wear a dress a dress I could not believe it I laugh in his face a call he a pathetic woman he be so scared he run away like a little boy when do this happen milagros 2 year ago if you be not afraid of this man why do not you report he I tell you what good would it do she claim it happen 2 year ago in august the first murder happen in september so she could 've be the last one who be rape before whatever stressor make he kill or she could 've be the stressor you say this woman laugh in his face hit he call he a woman could 've be enough to make he impotent he try to rape again and all he can hear be this woman laugh maybe he think he could rape old woman think they would be easy would not put up a fight so he try but he can'T he get frustrate he kill she and then he find the release that he be look for so he kill again excuse I send they in you want we to come forward there be 6 more woman who be rape by this man now prove to we it will finally do some good hi how do you find all these woman milagros Mr Navarro we may not talk to you but we talk to each other but now you must tell we your story every detail because the cycle do not end until this man be stop you understand yes they all have the same story he go up to they in the street put a knife against their back blindfold they and take they out to the desert he also kiss their neck while rape they and then when he be finish he ask how do I do Classic power reassurance behavior what do that mean power reassurance rapist lack confidence they can not develop normal relationship with woman Passive and non athletic he most likely fantasize that the victim be his girlfriend and of the different type of rapist he be the most likely to be dissuade if the victim scream or struggle in any way be that it all the characteristic of the power assurance rapist uh there be actually one more excuse I I 've be go over the form fill out by the woman 4 of they work in the same factory he most likely life and work near the victim I have own this plant for 9 year and I do not allow the man I hire to abuse the woman I be sorry but I do not believe this man work here miss the man we be look for would not be openly abusive he might just like follow woman around and peek into woman 's bathroom that sort of thing he would be shy with woman specially you you intimidate he he probably could not look you in the eye the only way I could be a woman and run this plant be to make sure every man feel that way I be sorry how many man work here over 50 we need to look through all your employee record so far I find more than 3 dozen man fit the target profile between the age of 35 and 50 this owner be not kid almost all of these guy have a citation for lewd behavior against the woman here they would be warn once and then they would be fire if it happen again I would not mess with her Afraid of a woman hutch Shoot I would be afraid of her only one of these man show up on police record with a sex crime he beat up a prostitute when she refuse to get rough not out guy he would be scared he would not have the confidence to stand up to a refusal but this be crazy there be way too many man here to interview and not enough time ok we need to narrow down the profile what would make our guy stand out from you tell I he completely lack machismo he have none of the confidence of a typical man in mexico Morgan even

cia classify a type a personality Overachiever highly adaptable well educate virtually unshakable manipulative enough to persuade a loyal foreign nationalto betray their country or a wife to betray her husband most importantly this unsub long ago accept the reality they will be summarily execute if catch Life mean nothing to this unsub not his own life not his family be not his colleague certainly not ours and certainly not theirs one of those agent turn against everything they believe in why well he stop believe maybe it be about ideology we need to find the stressor a major event that cause he to turn love revenge economic sideology the intelligence community 's mantra say increase the parameter of your enemy ' paranoia right now we be the enemy whatever you see or be tell

hour long sure go when be this 3 day before he be kill who call this meeting do it matter every detail matter why it can only be 1 of 4 people why be that important whoever request this want more than just an eval from you do you know they be film you I assume they be take in all factor discuss age rank and field status and if you eliminate all non field agent we be leave with a total of 16 candidate all of whom be in this unit we have to assume the mole have an exit strategy only now we be block the exit and the only way out be through we we all know why B a u be here they have their

be not a very good liar I be not lie your evaluation take I out of the field I simply write the truth you be highly intelligent you be impossibly strong willed there be go to come a time when you can not follow order it have not happen yet it will you be wrong we uh we think the agent who be tip off hassan may have have some kind of extreme event in their life something that distort or redefine their belief system every agent undergoes regular psych eval you know that they be train to cope with extreme event whatever turn this agent you can not train for you be welcome to everything I have every op undertake by these guy be on file what about the one that be not on file like the wiretap of the saudi embassy those do not even exist how long have your department be run operation in riyadh we have a declare presence in riyadh monitor U S Interests there you know that now if that be all I have an informant to see hey guy take a look at something right there that be a woman sit in the passenger seat of that car look a lot like aaliyah why would he leave they in the car unless he know he be be videotape who call this meeting do that matter every detail matter why it can only be 1 of 4 people that be not true anyone in this division could have insist on an eval why narrow it down to 4 well he rightly suspect hassan come to the U S because he know his wife be alive and that someone in this agency be work for hassan if we do not discover who the mole be before they find she she and the kid be dead Garcia right here boss how many agent in this unit be actually in saudi monitoring U S Interests 4 let I guess Bruno hawks gina sanchez olivia hopkins and kruger spence 4 for 4 see what else be on the tape Alright John summer would have only trust seasoned agent of which in this unit there be only 4 he guess that the mole have to have be one of his 4 boss before he put in for aaliyah 's extraction he want to know which one not to ask we need to match up with they one on one Kruger spence assistant director of operation recruit at the age of 18 after graduate from M I T it say here have 6 year experience as a weapon system designer and an I Q of 197 he butt up against the

security be not we all he do not care about money or possession or family all he care about be his job he be a classic control freak a meticulous paranoid a loaner who choose to live outside the community in an environment that he could control all right so he would have place aaliyah outside the community in an environment that only he could control and have access to maybe on the other hand he might new deal I want you to search the area surround summer ' apartment we be look for industrial sight storage space warehouse that be good thank I do not think I could have a job where I have to

that do not mess with your mind just a little bit I be neither disillusioned or confuse about what I be what I do or what I have do somebody here be why else would they rat out their own people you

follow doctor 's order it it would be nice if you do the same hey look Laura send the picture from her orlando trip I wonder if there be any of that new guy that she be so crazy about oh wait a minute I think she say I think she say picture not a video that be a dvd mary Technology be not slow down it be actually pass you by if you do not catch up soon you will be as pitiful as your mother well that be motivation come on mary I could show you a few thing you afraid to be my student hi guy just want to let you know I be have a great time Miss you both Sweet Aw but soon or later wait a minute this be that laura the one it can not be frank what be happen oh my god this be send to the family Father have a heart condition die while watch it so the music 's not add like a regular soundtrack it be in the background so if you turn it down you also turn down the voice well can not we get garcia to separate the audio track she be work on it now well the soon we hear how he talk to the victim the soon we will know what kind of man we be deal with tell we about laura clemensen 20 year old Sophomore at jacksonville university in florida assume to be the fifth in a series of rape and murder over the past 2 year some woman be abduct in parking lot other while they be run and when be she report miss Technically she wasn'T Roommate think she be visit family Family think she be at school close to her family very she have dinner with they on sunday that be 5 day ago and nobody be see she until now she be not kill on the tape and give forensic other victim be torture for week before they be kill so I think we should operate as if she be still alive not for long if the bastard get his way ok I do not get it this be the fifth abduction and now the second dvd why have they wait to call this in the last victim 's family receive this dvd 2 month ago Jacksonville P D Thought maybe they would get some more clue instead of just raise more question can you turn that down please there seem to be a natural escalation to the murder it begin as brutal attack against the victim and now it be psychological attack to the family so if the thrill of the kill be not enough to satisfy his sadistic need he need to spread panic and he thrive on that sadistic killer be typically stranger to their victim it be it be easy for the offender to torture and kill someone that they do not know Offenders Man on the tape be not do this just for himself he be play to an audience not her family someone watch who can appreciate what he be do admire his sadistic skill it be a characteristic of partner to record their crime so they can relive the fantasy later how can we be sure right there the camera move one guy torture while the other record it Master and servant Jacksonville P D be be look for this killer for year how long be it go to take them to find a team sync fisherchen www ydy com www ydy com proudly present Mark twain once write of all the animal man be the only one that be cruel he be the only one that inflict pain for the pleasure of do it again that be the third time he be look back at the camera he be look back at his partner Hotch these two be clearly derange and act out their bad sadistic fantasy Foile deux rare psychological phenomenon in which 2 or more people share the same psychotic delusion in its literal translation yes but it often refer to the bond that exist between 2 people that bring out the bad in each other Most killing team have a dominant personality that instigate and plan and a submissive one who be the eager accomplice so how do they decide who get to kill well the dominant one will usually insist on take the life so what be the psychology behind make these dvds it be a share souvenir allow the dominant to keep the submissive one motivate loyal and arouse it be also about control build in insurance policy for blackmail just in case somebody get cold foot it make you wonder what might have happen I f these 2 people never have meet chance be the woman would still be alive Jacksonville P D just locate laura clemensen 's body some hiker find she under a bridge they never hide they they be always easy to find guy laura clemensen be not miss for more than a week the time spend torture 's get short have her mother be notify no not yet we can cover more ground if we split up Morgan and I will meet local p D at the scene I will talk to laura clemensen 's mother and since she just lose her husband I will go with you I will start with the victimology maybe find the reason why these woman be target Mary after frank and I watch that video I I know at least she be not suffer anymore be there anything that we can do for you Um F frank give laura a a pearl and diamond ring for graduation could I get it back I will look into that right away thank you as part of our investigation we be try to gain some insight into your daughter and uh I wonder whether she be shy and quiet or be she more out go and make friend easily I mean be this really important yes ma'am I know that this be hard but the more similarity we can find between the victim the more it will help we narrow down who be responsible frank have a ball in her hand from the minute she could walk she be confident she know everybody at school she think of our old patrick as her good friend you know she be like most girl her age she want everybody to like her Frank use to think that she be too much of a people pleaser but I think it show a really good heart I do too the police tell we that they may have a they may have a witness who see laura give someone direction do that sound like something she would have do we we raise our child to be helpful and and kind and and that make laura an easy target for a killer you have to know that you and frank do everything right Frank be suppose to be at work yesterday and if laura if laura have not drive back to to campus that night I mean this this be not suppose to happen this be not s special agent gideon and morgan Detective robert portillo this be the fifth girl on my watch in the past 2 year and we still do not have a viable suspect we think you be look for 2 man really base upon what evidence well give the level of sadistic torture and desire to document their crime we be confident this be do by a kill team she be get deep laceration on her neck chest and thigh from the color of the bruising torture go on for several day Csi believe the cause of death be ligature strangulation and it be consistent with the other victim in the video she be wear a pearl ring on her left hand no other evidence have turn up they 've comb the area quarter mile radius why would they need more trophy gideon maybe pass it along as a gift like the green river killer yeah he would leave jewelry for his female coworker and then become arouse when he see they wear it after everything they do to these girl why do they leave them in these horrible position have not they suffer enough apparently not this be the ultimate degradation to the victim and her family shock value for whoever find they and it send a message to the police what be that look what we can do you can not stop we be there new victim Garcia just send a list over of all the unsolved rape and murder in the past 3 year there be 2 that be particularly interesting they look the type anything else well aside from share similar physical trait they be also pose the only difference be they be manually strangle which I think be why jacksonville P D do not find a connection we find dna on the first 2 that be the thing it do not match the recent kill but check this out what if the dominant one allow the submissive one to rape the first 2 victim in order to sort of draw he in and then once he be hook he begin keep the prize all for himself you tell morgan and gideon about this yet they be still at the crime scene we confirm that laura clemensen have good relationship with her family and friend she get good grade and stay out of trouble just like all the other victim do you guy notice that the package send to the clemensen family be only send to mary what about the first dvd um let I why be they target the mother the mother ask god to forgive the people responsible Hotch and the family that receive the first dvd go on tv plead for their daughter 's life that must have make the unsub angry so send the dvd to the mother be a message in itself a very clear one they do not want or need forgiveness how do you get to the freeway if you back out to warner and make a right you will see the exit in about half a mile thank no problem we be up to 7 victim now jacksonville police dept the humiliating posing of the body can not be a coincidence it be just too unique the bruising on the neck look to I like the first victim struggle I would say the killer probably lose his grip a couple time and really have to fight these woman that be why he switch from bare hand to a ligature it be more efficient control and it do not sacrifice his sadistic need for a slow death because the dna do not match jacksonville P D just do not put it together yeah and since the be not look for 2 offender signature indicate these woman have the same killer we just need to figure out who the hell they be well jacksonville P D search everywhere even swamp and still do not find the victim ' vehicle I get garcia trace vin but my guess be they dispose of the car just like they do the woman yeah but the body be easy to find why do they go to so much trouble to hide the car I do not think it could get any hot than yesterday today be a record breaker and the A c be bust sorry about the fan they be probably spread more dust than cool air well we will not keep your officer too long that be not to say that the submissive partner be in any way pure or innocent in this exchange if their criminal desire be not present their partnership would not work the offender share a common delusion it be one that you and I would never accept but it be this bond that justify their action so we be look for 2 sick mind who complete each other it be kind of like the perfect storm once these deviant personality collide they be deadly and unstoppable like the D C Snipers or the columbine assassin sometimes they 've meet in childhood other time they can be relate like the hillside stranglers angelo buono and kenneth bianchi psychopathic cousin who terrorize woman in los angeles the dominant partner make the submissive one feel invincible that be his reward for do as he be tell unfortunately there be countless opportunity for these twist mind to meet and once they 've pull off their vicious act the two accept this as common behavior and become bored with normal activity they live only for their new reality they be obsess with it addict to it and there be a fierce loyalty between the two the submissive one however be usually less intelligent and easy to catch and once catch he be easy to turn Lack of remorse increa their aggressiveness sexual sadist will stop when they be catch and the need to psychologically torture the family sorry to interrupt if you 've see my daughter please tiffany 's all I have she she go for a run last night and she never come home she be my baby why be not we tell about this before she go on the news 'cause we do not know about it Tiffany be abduct from middleberg that be nearly an hour away and it be outside of jacksonville 's jurisdiction be you sure these be the same offender well she be their type grab she while jog just like their third victim Middleberg 's only an hour from here if they see this it be just a matter of time before they send a dvd all right jennifer jareau fbi you just air a press conference with beverly spear I need to speak to she immediately these guy be impatient they just dump laura clemensen 's body 24 hour ago which mean they be more dangerous than they be yesterday and tiffany spear be run out of time you ok be I ok uh let I see I 've get image of a girl be torture burn inside my brain over the strain of this once carefree choice of music I 've isolate 4 source from one track and each one be more distorted than the next so no I be not ok and it be go to take awhile Penelope you know I appreciate you do this thank you sugar for right now even that do not feel good eh move on some of these victim be abduct while drive it do leave a nice trail especially when all the part lead you to trevor 's use auto in georgia well no wonder jacksonville P D could not find the vehicle the unsub do not drive the car they destroy they and sell the part yeah and over state line these sickos be good part be find in georgia sale be trace to a joey davin who live right here in jacksonville Joseph P Davin 27 in and out of jail since he be 17 number of charge include car theft with a partner maybe he like to team up either way he have not learn his lesson do not sound too smart to I exactly why he need a good leader if it be proof that tiffany be still alive still breathe I need to see it Ma'am you do not understand do you remember what tiffany be wear the last time you see she I tell the police she be go for a run Sneakers tank short well you need to think of she like this until we get she back you do not need to see what be on that dvd I be suppose to have run with she yesterday I should have be there help she please god help her investigator be connect tiffany spear ' disappearance with those of the 5 other victim murder in the jacksonville area include laura clemensen whose body be find yesterday 3 of the

with he be the wife still here we wanna put she in a room with he we need to humanize he I think she could do that how he abuse she and she take it she be subservient to he you think she would do it if we wanna find tiffany spear she will have to it be worth a shot we have be together 2 year and we be go to start a family sorry to interrupt Few minuteS thank you how you holdin ' up ok I guess you call your family Tony be my only family Tony will not talk to we what be you go to do I think if you go in there he will talk to you you want I to go in a room with he I can not do that there you got to find another way he will kill I I turn he in look what he do to I I know I believe that you be the only person who can get through to tony with joe dead tony be the only one who know where tiffany spear be and if he tell you you 've save her life right now you be her only hope Honey I need to know where where the girl be do not you mean they need to know why should I tell they anything what have I get to gain they be pin we for 7 murder amber I can not believe you and joey kill they all 7 none of this would have happen if joey have stay away we be on our way to well thing Joey mess that

can not believe my husband kill all those woman it take a lot of courage to go in there you do the right thing can we get you a glass of water or something yeah water yeah you stay with she please yes sir Joe 's dad be not he in a wheelchair though only for the last 2 year Henry davin could have rape and kill the first 2 woman 3 year ago then bring in joe and tony to continue his work maybe it be the only satisfaction he can get now they record it and he live it though they so it be a team of 3 we find laura clemensen 's hair at henry 's house it make sense let us take a ride Tony canardo 's one sick bastard I be not surprised mother abandon he when he be 4 and then she get clean and get he back until he be 11 when she got bust for prostitution no wonder he hate woman he bounce around social service after that I mean this guy never have any support no foundation no security how have he get the confidence to pull off something like that maybe that be why he need a partner but he be suppose to be the dominant one the leader I mean give his history how can he do that she be not here she be never here what the hell 's go on this look nothing like the video Reid he be really play a tough guy with that officer huh he play the tough guy with hotch it be not antagonistic it be defensive false bravado you think he be wear a mask let I see amber 's tape why be not she scare she look scared to I no look she initiate eye contact right there yeah you guy have get to hear this patch it through if she be afraid she would look anywhere but his face she be look at the victim and she do not really she do not seem that repulse she actually look surprisingly calm Amber now put that little bitch on her side you like it do not you dirty whore like it he be study she he be wait for her lead where have joey take the girl she just give he an order he be protect she he be give she an out Amber do it again Gideon where be she where be the girl where be she tell you to watch her we analyze what we record of tony and amber turn out she be the dominant one Garcia finally isolate the soundtrack on that dvd turn out it be amber give the order that mean she be the one do the killing where be amber now she tell the cop she be go out for a smoke and walk out the back door we be run out of time you 've get to find out where they be hold tiffany I will change the approach uh you be go to wanna look at this Joey davin 's dna do not match the first 2 victim that mean neither could henry 'S so who rape the first 2 girl lucky man you know that you have something really special I mean she have to know what you be do to all those woman and stay with you anyway must feel great to be appreciate by the woman you love it do I bet I know you and amber would do anything for each other but why would you confess to kill these 2 woman when you have no idea who they be Joey and I kill all of them really well whose dna do we find at the scene what be you talk about well it be not yours it be not joe 'S that poor guy probably have no idea these car belong to the woman you kill make you wonder if you and joe have not share a cell together maybe he would still be alive you get the wrong idea no I think you 've get the wrong idea tony Joe be not your partner Tiffany spear be not at the storage unit you wanna know what else we can hear amber 's voice on the video tell you what to do we know amber 's your partner come on why why you protect she she 's wife it be more than that look nothing would ever come between we not you not nothing besides amber would never do anything to hurt I Reid here no time for pleasantry I be able to unseal a file regard amber canardo what do it say when amber be 15 she walk into a tallahassee hospital rape and beat something awful doctor deduce she be be abuse by her father and her brother eventually they convince she to go to the police but when she do mom show up and tell they that amber be lie she obviously do nothing to protect amber from the abuse she she feels betray by her mother and now receive extreme sadistic pleasure in watch the same thing that happen to her Strange in this case the abuse actually become the abuser that do not happen a lot 1 in 8 we find the one you ask amber how the first 2 woman die she be do it before tony no she hasn'T yes she have with other man you be not so special man mean nothing to her she use you just like the other guy Shut up she set you up tony she have you do everything whose dna do you think that be at the scene come on think about it Amber beat herself up she walk in here she hand I laura clemensen 's ring and she tell we you give it to she as a gift you know it be true and that be why you be upset Gideon garcia find out that amber be abuse by her brother and her father they would take she to the wood she betray you tony there be only one way to get she back because if you do not she will forget about you just like this other guy tell we where she be keep the girl I know amber 's father keep she in the wood so no one would hear her scream be it amber 's idea to leave the girl in the wood where be tiffany there be a cabin duval county wood go Fbi back off Amber you get nothing on I yeah we just get your voice on the tape give the order so what he save one little whore Tiffany I be fbi I be not go to hurt you look at I she will never be the same Morgan

campus we've already talked about this I know it be hard but sometimes it helps to go through it maybe SOMEBODY QUIET who seem like he be always just a LITTLE TOO CLOSE I don't think so what about anyone that be suddenly not around ANYMORE before that MAN do what he do he tell I I should get a dog for PROTECTION and then he say or maybe you can let your parent have DEXTER stay with you you say that your ATTACKER know the thing that you think what do you mean by that he say that we weren't the TYPE of PEOPLE to just stay INSIDE and READ BOOKS and he talked about take I away to POSITANO ITALY and DRINKING WHITE wine and listen to AL GREEN be there any significance to that MY FAVORITE PLACE in the WORLD the only ALCOHOL I drink and MY FAVORITE SINGER I don't UNDERSTAND how he can know any of it any MALES in your life that you may have tell about the FAMILY DOG I don't HAVE any experience with BOYS there be no one I WOULD'VE tell you need a second it be hard to focus sometimes I know the POLICE all ACT like just because he didn't kill you he DIDN'T somehow END your life do you take my advice and TALK to someone there be always a PRIEST AVAILABLE on campus I mean a woman I don't know maybe that would be good so many LIVES have be ruin here when I go to the doctor he say that my injury be minor and you think if they be somehow worse it would be well I don't know look at I someone hand over A wallet AT GUNPOINT everyone think that be the best thing to do you do what you have to do to survive don't let anyone tell you different all right it be ok I'M sorry but I'M GONNA

MORE nervous even though he have a GUN it be like he be afraid to TALK thank you what difference do it matter how he SOUNDED on the phone he can REHEARSE and in the flesh he can't HIDE his true SELF I

here I take a room on the HALL you live 4 block away exactly why be separate from the WORK you steal the BATHROBE COMPLIMENTARY I can't get something out of MY head cheryl on campus today she say so many LIVES here have be ruin yeah only 20 of rape be even report you think there be MORE victim out there you figure a CATHOLIC SCHOOL the PERCENTAGES be bound to hold UNSUB 'S COMMITTED a rape that never got report something make HIM change victim maybe he almost got CAUGHT maybe he be religious and FELT GUILTY maybe a victim reminded he of his sister something what do you think I think you got good INSTINCTS HEY HI be you ok yeah why WOULDN'T I be no REALLY COME right in you want to check MY I D I thought maybe you might want to TALK don't GO all PROFILER on ME ELLE you got shoot in your OWN HOME and then you come back to the BAU like nothing even happen think you might want to TALK isn't profile you it be PSYCH 101 please after he shoot I he reach into MY WOUND so he could write on the WALL in MY blood I be BARELY CONSCIOUS but I could feel his hand in THERE and sometimes it be like I can still feel it ELLE he be dead YOU'RE YOU'RE right here you won good morning thank for come in a lite early good morning LOUSY COFFEE 's up we just want you to hear what the FBI have gather and get you on the STREETS so the GUY WE'RE look for be a CLASSIC power reassurance rapist this differ from a power ASSERTIVE RAPIST who attempts to humiliate and traumatize his victim as well as the anger RETALIATORY rapist and a sexual sadist whose attack be also RANDOM and EXCESSIVELY BRUTAL the reason that be important for you to know he be the only KIND of rapist who target a specific victim he fantasizes that he be in a relationship with these WOMEN now he DOESN'T come across they by accident this be someone with ACCESS he be the CABLE GUY or the locksmith he be the GUY who read the GAS METER he can describe exactly what these WOMEN WEAR and how they smell these detail be what feeds his fantasy now we need you to look for the overlap between the sets of VICTIMS DELIVERY MEN LA CREW HANDYMEN do the SCHOOL share worker with any of the recent victim because he see these as relationship he most LIKELY live alone and live alone allows HIM to indulge his delusion that he be in a relationship with these WOMEN because of the discrepancy in the victim ' age we can only pinpoint his age SOMEWHERE between 20 and 40 year old it be possible that he have a profession that he find emasculating so look for someone in their life with a job that deviate from NORMAL GENDER roles something like a secretary we're sure that there be some overlap this GUY be a shadow at the EDGES of each of these WOMEN 's LIVES all right that be SQUARE one RECANVAS and be sure to relay information ON shift change thank very MUCH I looked into the IDEA of rape that go unreported like you ASKED and 2 month AGO a FEMALE student AT HOLY TRINITY commit SUICIDE she wasn't one of the REPORTED VICTIMS but her SUICIDE REPORT correspond almost exactly to when the campus ATTACKS STOPPED maybe there be MORE victim out there I don't UNDERSTAND how OUR DAUGHTER 's death be FBI BUSINESS WE'RE investigate a series of SEXUAL assaults that take PLACE ON SHELLY 's campus be you aware of the ATTACKS of course it be HORRIBLE there be no good way to say this so I'M just go to ASK be it possible the SHELLY be RAPED and that lead to her SUICIDE no it be not do SHELLY have any history of DEPRESSION she PUT a LOT of pressure ON HERSELF she get A 'S VOLUNTEERED with the youth GROUP PLAYED varsity VOLLEYBALL in high SCHOOL but she always handle it with GRACE do she leave a note and if so would it be possible for US to take it and ANALYZE IT there wasn't a note we will return it and with all due respect this ISN'T something that i'm ask LIGHTLY with all due respect to you you WALK into MY HOME you ask if MY daughter who we bury 2 month AGO be also SEXUALLY violate I'M SORRY I have a little GIRL and I can't SAY how I'D react if something happen to she but I would like to believe that I would do whatever be necessary to make sure that no other family go through that SAME pain I'D like to go LIE down thank you for your TIME i'll see you out I love MY wife i'm sure you do she be RAPED the UNSUB get she PREGNANT i'm choose the SIN of SUICIDE over the SIN of abortion because I can't bring his baby into the WORLD please don't hate I SHELLY the attack at the COLLEGE STOPPED two MONTHS AGO right after SHELLY 's SUICIDE that have have be the STRESSOR HE think of these as relationship in his mind shelly kill their baby JASON HOTCH we need to go back to the last victim and ask one more question do he say anything to you about CHILDREN FAMILY no do he mention anything about SUICIDE REFER to a PERSONAL TRAGEDY somebody he be maybe in a relationship with why be you ask I this one of the VICTIMS take she OWN life when SHE realize the rapist get she PREGNANT what be it i'm try to have a baby for how long I have an appointment at the CLINIC to TALK about INSEMINATION a few day before I be ATTACKED do anyone else know about that I just decided I'M 38 I FIGURED I couldn't AFFORD to just wait around for the right man to show up HEY I talked the other 2 victim in their 30 they have both go to a FERTILITY CLINIC within 5 day of their ATTACK same one each TIME YEP have GARCIA RUN down employment record they might be look at someone who works there or who have access to their MEDICAL RECORDS you got it what be the significance of the 5 day the MOST POPULAR FERTILITY drug be CLOMIPHENE and the CLINIC would MOST LIKELY have a policy not to attempt insemination until the DRUG REGIMEN be COMPLETE so then get there before they begin the insemination process would guarantee the UNSUB PATERNITY he be try to get they pregnant he hasn't change his fantasy he be MERELY find a way to PERFECT IT well that explain a change in VICTIMOLOGY he be targeted YOUNG ULTRA religious girl who he assumed WOULDN'T want to have an ABORTION so when SHELLY kill herself he decided change IT up and go after WOMEN who be desperate to have a baby the UNSUB know SHELLY NORVELL be pregnant mean he be still watch his past VICTIMS ELLE TALK to CALLAHAN tell they we need patrols monitor everyone on that VICTIM list get it you ever see anything like this before GARY HEIDNICK in PHILADELPHIA he kept WOMEN in a DUNGEON prison for year with the hope of impregnate THEM HEIDNICK be a sexual sadist he torture the WOMEN and even ended up eat one of they this be a power reassurance rapist so in this GUY 's twisted mind these be LOVE story of course they be he 's start FAMILIES I'M sorry but whoever be commit these CRIMES COULDN'T WORK at this CLINIC in I'M the only man here but that DOESN'T MEAN there ISN'T a connection we need your help to figure out what it might be could you excuse I just a MINUTE can you just fill that out that be GREAT just right there look what be happening be just HORRIBLE but the MARGINS on the CLINIC like this be incredibly slim and if WORD get out there be a connection to this rapist MY practice would be ruin to be honest I don't care about your practice 3 WOMEN be RAPED after come here that be not a coincidence it be a PATTERN if you're imply that I could be a SUSPECT I should let you know that I have a VASECTOMY 25 year ago we just want to know if there be anyone in and out of this CLINIC who fit the profile quiet LIVES alone AWKWARD with WOMEN yet hang around the office a LITTLE TOO long just to be near they no it be just a SMALL CLINIC I only HIRE WOMEN my patient be just MUCH MORE comfortable around they what about ELSEWHERE COMPUTER SUPPORT JANITOR MY DAUGHTER HANDLES all of the TECHNICAL BUSINESS and I have a cleaning CREW of two WOMEN sorry what be that doctor it be just a questionnaire we HAND out to learn MORE about our CLIENT BASE this be everything the UNSUB know about the VICTIMS who else see these I don't COMPROMISE the MEDICAL PRIVACY of my patient WHELSE see these well I sell the forms to a DIRECT MARKETING COMPANY call first hand media they just target buying habit no MEDICAL information change hand it be not illegal yeah but the MARGINS on a PLACE like this word get out your practice would be ruin DAYTON OHIO YOU'RE on the AIR I'D like to make a request with that SULTRY voice you name it all right LISTEN it be a marketing firm by the name of first hand MEDIA I want you to see if they have any connection to the COLLEGES from the first SET of VICTIMS BEHOLD first hand MEDIA

of paper you can lock your doors but these PEOPLE still find a way into your HOME ELLE it might be worth go back to the VICTIMS it be a long shot but maybe somebody remember a first name from a telemarketing CALL yeah the UNSUB feel a connection with they so he WOULDN'T LIE or use an ALIAS we know this GUY 's dna be not in the system but i'll cross check employment records against sexual MISDEMEANORS peep exposure good separate datum forms from the rest of the region so what do we know from the LATEST SET of VICTIMS THEY'RE all single and all over 35 each of they also indicate RECENTLY BUYING BOOKS ON baby and CHILDBEARING so he know they're commit to have child which mean THEY'RE MUCH LESS likely to ABORT even in the case of RAPE get this each of the VICTIMS also CHECKED the yes BOX when ASKED if it would be ok to contact they ON SPECIAL deal on pediatric items in the UNSUB 's mind THEY'VE CONSENTED he think he be do them a service check those FORMS for each of those element if we can narrow IT down to a potential list of VICTIMS we can be wait for he any hit get one REID nothing it be the only one it be a small CITY there can't be very many single women in their

child who be afraid of the dark the real tragedy of life be when man be afraid of right you guy hear elle be clear Self defense so it be a good shoot she hit what she be aimin ' for that be not what I mean I know if they clear she how come she be not here with we or hotch Focus on the case Ozona police and autopsy report for nicholas faye and robbie davis well the bludgeoning could suggest frustration or rage with no apparent sexual motivation that be rare when the victim be this young this unsub seem to be take pleasure from the kill itself so if it be not sexual what be the significance of target young male Most serial killer prey upon specific type to carry out their fantasy of revenge cell phone ring Bundy kill woman that look like an ex girlfriend who jilt he Dahmer claim that schoolyard harassment feed into his fury ok so then maybe these kid represent someone who victimize the offender like a young male from his past maybe a bully a old brother someone who abuse he no that be unlikely they just find another body 11 year old girl why would the victimology just suddenly change maybe the girl be not the target maybe she just get in the way or the sex of his victim be not significant the pace he be kill certainly indicate a velocity of change we can surveil every kid in ozona how be we suppose to keep them all safe Enforce a curfew child should not have to worry about something like that tell I about it the wood be the only thing I be afraid of when I be a kid seriously Thought you grow up in a small town yeah surround by wood Bummer for you yeah only thing I be afraid of be the dark some of we still be when we land morgan and reid go to the new crime scene the little girl I will look at the scene where nicholas faye be find this be where

exactly how his killer want it the last 2 month we 've lose more child in this town than we have in my whole lifetime the other be car accident the resident be terrify get an 8 year old myself victim know their killer they follow he to this spot what make you think that the kid go this deep in the wood because they trust he he stash his weapon here beforehand which mean we be look for someone intelligent methodical Methodical bash the kid 's head in look like a moment of rage to I I agree that be what be confuse do not make sense this be just a quarter mile from where the 2 boy be kill Bludgeoned to death the same way not entirely true I find some marking on her scalp that indicate that that psycho beat her post mortem suggest the unsub be get more brazen he be get brazen all right I 've bag 3 child in the last month now he be spend more time with the victim even after death he have to know he be not go to be interrupt but how how could he be so sure the forest go for mile and mile but nobody go walkin ' in it unless they be lookin ' to kill or hunt in which case you do not want to be on the trail Reid whoever kill these child be very familiar with this area in my opinion he probably live in ozona his whole life it could be someone you know or it could be a stranger you pass at the grocery store it be vital that we keep our eye open and our child close now as ozona 's guidance counselor I can only help your child with the aftermath but our police department be work with the fbi gather information on the case to elaborate on that agent jason gideon we want you to know we be do everything we can to find the person responsible until we do there be a number of precaution that you will need to take so let I go over some of they with you first and foremost it be

I have your attention please good afternoon I want to make something clear due to the velocity of change we predict this offender could try to strike again anytime his confidence build with every attack look for someone physically fit shy kind disposition someone you may trust with your own child because the killer target kid he may be small himself and though we keep refer to this unsub as he do not rule out a woman excuse I Chief you be go to want to hear this my son matthew never come home today Morgan here we go when be he last see his teacher see he in the parking lot after school

turn out the poor kid got spook by a tree branch this whole town be on edge maybe that be why finnegan 's in the wind hey that be interesting the unsub do not use a gun Bet he know every trail in ozona Finnegan 's an avid hunter why do not he use a robbie davis first victim Sarah p Sarah peterson right I guess finnegan bring the kid back here first before baitin ' them into the wood but why

polly have be miss for 5 day usually in case like this we would not expect to find they alive however in this case we do not believe that to be true the person responsible spend considerable time and energy plan the abduction he do not do all this work to simply kill the girl once he have they otherwise he would 've do it at the chamber 's house he certainly seem to know he have the time and he have kelly and polly reference friday in the message they leave for their parent we think the unsub have something plan for the night of your championship game we be certain the unsub be someone from this community how do you know that because Mr Chambers he do not have your daughter leave you a phone message or a note do he not that I know of 'cause he know you would be out of town for a while

even attempt to inject himself into our investigation we also know that predatory abductor prepare a nest prior to the abduction a remote cabin an underground bunker a safe and secure place that only he have access to design to confine and conceal his prey once his hunting be do should we be look for this nest you would never find it for his nest predatory abductor john jemelske build a sophisticated dungeon complex under a suburban syracuse home where he document every detail of torture he carry out upon the victim he keep there for 3 year the man who kidnap these girl have a relationship or a job that permit they to get close enough to watch they we must focus on those people who have access a family member a teacher a next door neighbor it sound clich but often it be the

of the coast to coast news network in the country it be the same information just slightly different word so it be not a record message or script display a measure of confidence he could have easily just call one network this guy obviously want attention it be typical behavior for a personal cause bomber one bomb have a finite impact it be just a little package make bunch of phone call that magnify my explosion 100 time we have the additional record call be gather for assessment network say the call come from a restricted number 2 have give limited permission to trap and trace the line if we should need to you get a news organization to agree to a trap and trace who could say no to I this be not likely al qaeda they do not call unless they bomb something at homeland security 's

butcher innocent to secure a prize and innocence struggle with all its might against the attempt of crime so seattle 's where it all begin we just need to figure out what it be and off the top of my head I can think of grunge music and overprice coffee that do not seem significant enough for terrorism it be a personal cause bomber it only need to be of significance to he Agent nick casey seattle field office S S A Hotchner how do you do this be dr Spencer reid S S a Morgan agent jareau and S S A Gideon have you identify the device look like a small pipe bomb attach to an umbrella I would like to take a look at those bomb fragment as soon as possible I 've get bomb squad experience as soon as they be catalogue how many people be on the bus when the explosion go off 25 include the driver Explosion kill 2 the driver and a young male injure 7 a pipe bomb on a crowded city bus and only 2 people be kill have a relatively small charge the 2 dead be find close to the bomb at the time of detonation Sylvia cohen an elderly passenger find the umbrella on the floor at her foot she say the young man volunteer to take it to the driver for her she be pretty broken up about it have you vet and debrief the rest of the passenger I have their info if you want to talk to they do you get their position sorry where they be on the bus no jj maybe you can recontact the passenger and map their location yeah you get it nobody see anyone leave the umbrella no but you know from the style it look like uh remote detonator on the corner over there you say remote limited frequency remote like a garage door opener that be awfully risky anyone on this bus could have accidentally detonate the bomb just by pull out of their garage he use a remote from the corner do he want to be close enough to see what happen or do he need to be mechanically those remote be pretty limited he probably need to be then he might have be nervous maybe that make he stand out I could set up a public service announcement encourage anyone who be in the area of the time of the bombing to contact we well we do need a press conference but it will be about get this unsub to call we we be still try to determine what happen initial report call it a bomb but since no one have claim responsibility we can not rule out some kind of mechanical failure supervisory special agent gideon will be handle any future communication on this incident if anyone have any information they feel might be helpful please contact S S a Gideon at the number appear on your screen we will keep you post with future development thank you think that be enough it will definitely stress he that his message be not get out what if he do not call Reid and morgan be go over the device maybe they will come up with something you know reid the bomber could have buy this detonator at any old toy store you take a remote control car plane boat attach a detonator like this to the motor touch the remote boom instant fourth of july how you do I be derek morgan this be dr Spencer reid we be with the B A U Sondra atkin Cass or cassy work too bomb tech it be a really nice reconstruction oh it be not that hard Explosive be limit and the fragment be comparatively easy to locate ok so tell I what else you get here well besides the light explosive load he use dry pea dry pea he choose a shrapnel that would not do too much damage outside of a limited range why what be he do try to minimize his kill it also have a picture enave on it right there it be robot with an arrow through it Anti robotic do not the city center bus stop use smart bus Smart bus yeah hi tech bus that use time sensor on the bus and the bus stop to give out arrival and departure time yeah go automate last year so he be anti technology maybe hey dollface ready to work some magic for I challenge I you beautiful behavioral analyst domestic terrorist activity in the seattle area Ugh morgan I say challenge I do not even raise my blood pressure Pacific northwest be like ripe with the disgruntled you have animal right zone law specifically anti technology Ahh yes my looney opposite here be something Month ago Tacoma washington disguise young guy go crazy on a bunch of computer at a science lab scream we will soon be the slave and the machine will be the master yike that would totally suck for I I be surround in here come on what be you worried about you get I to protect you ha now that get my blood up I be upload the video to you now what else do you have garcia I also find an article in the st Dennis university college newspaper last spring close to the school an internet cafe be attack campus internet cafe bombing attribute to fft brgade Someone create floppy disk bomb that go off in 4 of the computer no one be injure who use floppy disk anymore right agent brain that be the point of the attack they leave a note ultimately you will be as obsolete as your graveyard technology be the note sign F F T Brigade I be find reference to a freedom from technology brigade a fringe group that be show up lately anything else in the note yeah there be a not very artistic drawing of what kind of look like a robot with an arrow through it I be upload it to you now you know seattle be the birthplace of some of the most cutting edge technology in the world where it begin I think we be ready to give a profile we believe the unsub reside in seattle all of the attack most of which have just involve property damage have take place here and the timing and location indicate knowledge of the area even though he escalate to a lethal bombing today we do not believe that that be necessarily his intention in fact anyone not directly next to the device receive minor injury so we think fear may have be the large motive so he be a terrorist then he be but that be too vague of a description for our purpose Douglas and olshaker categorize bomber as criminal group cause psychologically disorganized and personal cause bomber and we believe this guy to be a personal cause bomber and personal cause bomber be motivate by an underlie emotional conflict in an interview from prison the unabomber ted kaczynksi admit that while he be a graduate student at the university of michigan he start have fantasy of become a woman even get on a list to get a sex change operation but during a mandatory psychological exam prior to the procedure he change his mind he tell the psychologist that he make a mistake from that moment through the next 3 decade of his life ted kaczynksi carry out a campaign of isolation and murder this unsub be male he live alone he be possibly self employ he be highly organized he be meticulous and he be very smart and he seem odd to those who know he angry distant prone to sudden violent rage this be not the kind of guy whose neighbor will be surprised to find out what he be arrest for this guy 's neighbor will have no trouble believe it target appear to be technology but not the hi tech variety the kind of technology we be surround by in a city the size of seattle we be talk 10 000 possible target Agent gideon you get a call on the tip line ok go ahead this be agent gideon why do you say no one take responsibility I

a smart bus who call himself allegro Wh what be that he tell I to call he allegro of course yeah it be a book yeah it ought to be no no it be an actual book a novel I read it as a kid it be call empty planet by one hit wonder author david hansberry it be get it all technoids minutians all that stuff be in there it be robot that take over the world once they figure out how to reproduce with human Essentially humanity 's lose to technology and the hero of the book be a 12 year old boy name allegro who build an army and fight for the human Morgan have garcia get as much information as possible on the author of empty planet David hansberry uh hansberry yeah I be on it there be a passenger on the bus yesterday a dr Emory cooke he be suppose to be some kind of computer genius pioneer in artificial life yeah cooke he develop software that mirror the human reproductive system computer that can replicate themselves so maybe cooke be the target and not the smart bus if so that would definitely be imitate event from the book Allegro and his army not only destroy robot but they assassinate the scientist that be responsible for create they Dr Cooke be sit right in front of sylvia cohen and the umbrella be initially find underneath dr Cooke 's seat yeah thank you for come so quickly dr Cooke People particularly some religious fundamentalist oppose the work you do do you receive any threatening letter or phone call from anyone about your work never really I 've manage to put to rest certain anxiety about the godlessness of artificial life by openly share my own personal belief which be no scientific knowledge preclude the existence of god there be also those with very strong ethical concern Ethical concern revolve mainly around the manipulation of already exist life form my work be on create artificial life which present far less ethical dilemma not from the man that put the bomb on the bus yesterday he seem to be obsess with the science fiction novel by david hansberry call empty planet be you familiar with the book I be friend with the author the author of the empty planet use david hansberry as a pseudonym come on garcia I know you get his name so give it up her name you cute little chauvinist be ursula kent and she be a literature professor at oh my in seattle st Dennis university where the floppy disc bomb be set uh huh oh you be the light of my

being and I believe that he find you one of these threat dr Cooke as I 've say I rather doubt that do you think the fact that you be on that bus and you be friend with the author be a coincidence a cognitive scientist at M I T once say coincidence seem to be the source for some of our great irrationality our mind see coincidence and I understand he I would like to attach a protective detail for you dr Cooke until we find the guy no thank you excuse I really now do I seem like the sort who would want to be follow around all day by a government goon squad I do not think so Goon squad ever talk to someone who want to continually show you he be smart than you Everyday I really hate that Garcia find the author of the book David hansberry be just a pen name the real name be ursula ursula ken

see it as some kind of prophetic work he be attempt to save humanity by stop the proliferation of robotic technology well that be absurd he be write a document like manifesto call a guide to practical living and several section of it be lift directly from empty planet he be take up what he believe to be your cause and he be kill people for the sake of it but empty planet be a fantasy not to this man how could anyone think it be more than that unfortunately it be impossible to predict how an unstable mind will interpret something and it be cause he to kill people do you know dr Emory cooke very well he speak to your class yes Dr Cooke be murder by the bomber an hour ago no clear it be safe now another small charge more meant to scare than to harm definitely the same unsub same signature Casey we will get there ASAP there be another bomb at the post office let us go Professor what be that this be something someone a brilliant man give I a long time ago before he die actually it be part of the inspiration for empty planet James be a rather early alarmist about how much we be let technology control our life it be become a sort of talisman for I you wear it when you teach sometimes yes this have be etch on the bomber 's device oh my god Bomber 's write a manifesto he want publish but not in the national newspaper he want it publish in the seattle ledger he want someone here to read it have you ever have a student you think might be capable of do something like this one of my student someone who hate technology I be a post modernist in my area of study technological

Neighbors will hear an explosion it will be on the news you have a complicated life it be a complicated world I be sorry I could not be more help yeah I too give the manifesto a little more thought

be kenneth roberts Great thank so it begin with the father 's suicide okay we get 5 crime scene ' worth of new information to go through and the target that unsub choose for the decoy bomb do they force a change in the profile I do not think so I think they be what the be decoy to throw we off the trail of dr Brasier Reid what be that it be the subplot of the empty planet book Allegro kill his mother yeah at the end he discover he be adopt he be reunite with his birth mom he thank she for have the strength to give he a well life but ironically he realize that she herself have become a robot

gideon morgan this be agent sheridan how be you forgive I how faris the abduction itefrom these wood about 40 mile or so he try to hide itpretty well he cover the bodyvery carefully must feel remorsefor kill they this lipstick 's beenapplie recently it be still moist look at her hair it be be brush put behind her ear she be abduct what an hour from here Draggedthrough these wood her hair would notlook like that so he keep she safefrom the element and then come backfor the body that be why he choose a secondary locationthat 's so remote this isn'tabout remorse no he wantsto be alone with her need his privacy you never notice the hair or the makeupbefore no maybe it wasthe timing she be foundwithin 24 hour and the other have alreadysuccumbe to the element Sex actswith dead body be rare occurrence however bundy do it regularly so how be thisgoe to help usto catch he now we knowhe have a ritual he need to defilethe body next timewe'll be herewaite for he Sixth Victim Falls to Mill Creek Killer we be off duty just like you 2 victim at once that be a first for he you think he wentout look to kill more than one woman or be it just happenstance he choose a differenthunte ground yes we be in an alley but we be behind an expensive hotelin a nice neighborhood you get a differentclass of prostitute one that do not walkthe street alone he be lookingfor a challenge Question be what gavehim the confidence to stray outof his comfort zone make sure to runthat for print he display the newspaperbetween they he take the time when he could 've just toss it aside it be deliberate he want we to knowhe 's angry angry enoughto change his M o I hear there be a double homicide this morning be it hollow man agent be confirmingthat now I 've write about he there be no guaranteethat he would 've stop killingif you would 've giveninto his demand in fact media attention could 've fuel himto kill more we do not knowthat for sure this be all justa guess game be not it no it be behavioralanalysis we be dealingwith an offenderwho believe that murder peopleis a good wayto become famous all I know be thatyou tell I to ignore himand he take 2 life if I dismissthis double homicide what happen tomorrow we will not knowuntil then too bad we couldn'ttrace any printsfrom the newspaper what have you get he only send thisto an individual which show he'snot confident enough to initiate contactwith the masse emotional indicator be analyze through slant the shootermaintain vertical narrow lettered write both sign of repression and the pressure if you look closely be excessively heavy which showsthat he be uptight and caneasily overreact you get all thatfrom his handwriting Graphology be an effectiveand reliable indicatorof personality and behavior my writing'salway different that be because itexpresse your emotionsat that give time just likeyour facial expressionsparallel the wayyou're feel whileyou're speak I be surprised this guywrite in cursive his message be so clear I would 've thoughthe'd print everything actually his connectedwriting show that he deal with problemsin a practicaland direct manner like shoot someone exactly the hollow manus simple statement all first person for example I will not be ignore he be obviously tiredof feeling this way it be quite possible he'sgot a job in solitude or one that he feelsstrip he of his identity his job might require himto wear a uniform something that showsabsolutely no individuality or he may be overqualifie for his menial job and feel that he do not get the respectthat he necessarilydeserve but todayhe 's kill 2 woman which tell ushe 's grow confident this make himunpredictable and dangerous and because he hasno physical contactwith his victim it be go to make himthat much hard to catch we have more informationon the mill creek killer because he spendsa lot of timewith his victimsbefore and afterhis kill because his victimswillingly follow he in broad daylight he appear harmless he be mostlikely handsome Handsome yes these woman would not follow an unattractive man they just wouldn'T he be handsome and he be get the socialskill to trick his victim those who know he well they would be shock to learn that he'sthe man that we be after he be be ableto get his victim awayfrom family friend obviously this makeshim feel powerful if this guy be so smart why would he risk drive his victimsfrom the abduction siteto the wood because of the ritual it be become the mostimportant thing to he dominate his thought bullet providethe privacy he need the hollow manis motivate byexternal pressure this be a guy who simplywant attention the mill creek killer on the other hand he be drivenby internal force he be a sexuallymotivated offender now this make hima lot more predictable but do not think for a second it make himany easy to catch where be you excuse I Meredith dale 25 she be supposedto meet her friend for a bike ridebut disappear disappear when an hour ago how can we be sureit 's he well look at her she be his type physically she vanish into thin air it be get the mill creek'sm o all over it I will set up road block in and out of the forest

upon you you must fight back with violence he be quote from the hadith not from the qu'ran it be call the verse of the sword they argue that it cancel out early teaching Verse of the sword just someone 's spin on the word of the prophet it be not even part of the qu'ran but it do say in the qu'ran fight and slay the infidel wherever you find they and seize they in every stratagem of war unless they repent establish regular prayer and practice regular charity be it your intention mr Gideon to become a man of faith and revert to islam I be a man of faith I have repent I pray regularly and I practice charity I have never commit violence against you so how be it that my faith would allow you to live and worship as you please and yours would take my life and snuff it out you be simply misguided people of the book but if you revert to islam a billion muslim one billion muslim manage to practice their faith in peace for allah be surely merciful you inquire about my childhood early I

his son do you see that when he tell the story about his childhood the bomb landing in the bazaar his behavior change we know he be lie Garcia could not find any record of a bombing during the time jind allah be a boy exactly but this time when he mention his son he look at his hand like he have to concentrate to control his anger that first story be not about he it be about his son which mean it must have be more recent Garcia I need you to look for a bombing again in egypt but this time anything in the last 10 year on it we be look for civilian casualty an 8 year old boy ok I be cross referencing bombing and child victim 7 year ago in the heart of cairo egyptian government blame hezbollah but conspiracy theory on the street claim it be a joint U S Israli strike that go astray your

member M I S be an atypical prison organization they pick up an amalgam of ethnicity the qu'ran say that my lord those that slip through the crack be the one that traditional group will not accept outside these wall you need to understand it be make up largely of american citizen american citizen with a reason for hate the government we be look at home grow terrorist what the hell do you want the name jamal abaza do it mean anything to you Abaza be an imam in cairo he preach jihad to his follower but he fall off the grid 7 year ago that be because when his son die he take the jihad name

year ago be you familiar with the militant islamic society they be home grow we know the cell that abaza put together have access to anthrax but we can not find any report of any go miss in the state we have protocol that we have to follow you really go to allow a terrorist attack on U S Soil because of protocol I tell you what I learn in there because you and I fbi cia right now we have the ability to break through all the protocol and share information let I see what we have Coordinate with agent jareau and penelope garcia at quantico please think it will work I do not know Cia 's tough they play it pretty close to the vest well if we do not all work together more people be go to die a lot more how go it with the cia I do not know what gideon say to they but they be feed I

hesitation mark mean he be ambivalent about the kill what we do not know be why he chop the hair he do not take it with he we know it be not a trophy it be probably a way to minimize some of their power rob they of their femininity that fit with he kill during the early morning it be the time when prostitute have the least power sexually as oppose to at night when he might see they as be on the prowl hey I know we be just spitballe this here but this profile point to nathan harris I do not wanna talk about nathan harris Hotch she be right he reach out for help this be an adolescent kid he be probably intimidate sexually I do not care how many time he say he do not do it he know about the last victim and he admit to get off on see she dead we 've get nathan harris it do not do we any good to talk about he now I just wanna make sure that if it be not he we stay on top of thing before it take on a life of its own all right all right all right we know our unsub be a sexual sadist the symbolism of stab they probably mean he be impotent the only way he can get off be by kill consider that cut their hair and kill during the early morning both stem from feel powerless there be a chance his pathology 's more than sexual what do you mean this be D C Power 's the most important commodity maybe this guy feel impotent in his professional life as well but why these particular woman simplest answer be that he have access well northwest d c have 3 major hub of prostitution near florida avenue off logan circle and mcpherson square where the victim be find probably work in or around capitol hill well I will go back out on the street in the morning and see if any of these woman know someone who fit that description good it be late let us go home um should not we get word out to the paper not yet well it be not too late to make the morning edition I say no hey you see little holly æ ° MMè¯´ï¼ she be only 19 hotchè¯ ´ Reidè¯ ´ Morgan Hotchè¯ ´ æ ° MMè¯ ´ Hotchè¯ ´ æ ° MMè¯ ´ Morgan æ ° MMè¯ ´ Reidè¯ ´ Reidè¯ ´ no do he have to be here it be for your own protection he be here to make sure we be not talk about the case just about you so I do not wet the bed or start fire Heh I see you 've read dr Harris ' warning sign of psychopathy yeah be that wrong no it be healthy you be intellectually curious you wanna understand how you be feel so you do not wet the bed or start fire tell I what worry you I 've just be um think about stuff about hurt woman yeah have you ever hurt anyone I kill a bird once I know that be on the list it be one of the sign why would you kill the bird 'cause I be sad how would you feel afterwards well why I do not know 'cause it be dead and I be still alive be that why you wanna hurt woman to feel well I do not know have you ever see a woman naked do not worry about he no offense none take um a few year ago my mom 's med school her student get cadaver so how have that make you feel good excited and sick perfectly natural boy to feel excited he see a naked body even a cadaver yeah but now that be the only part that I think about which part they be dead so when you watch the prostitute you do not imagine have sex with they no I think about cut they why I do not know maybe to look inside or sometimes I think about feel their blood in my hand and feel it flow through my finger do that ever make you climax just by think of that I know I be crazy do I say that no but what do you call picture in your head that you can not make go away can I talk to you stay here I will be right back it be my opinion that nathan should be hospitalize what I think he need full time medical attention I be a doctor he be have homicidal fantasy that be directly link to his sexual impulse and release well he come to your agent that show that he be concerned in his heart he do not want to hurt anyone Positive sign but intelligence and awareness do not always allow we to control our urge admit the problem do not mean you can manage it if I put he in a hospital I would be tell he that he be a monster no no no no no he be just right now he be sick and he need help no if an alcoholic can not control his impulse ma'am he drink you need to consider what happen with someone fight psychotic urge I be not naive I be not go to turn a blind eye but I have to protect my son he need to be with professional I have access to the good in washington I will make sure that he see someone every single day but I be not go to lock he away have a seat I do not appreciate be question in front of other agent it be not my intention I be sorry what be you talk to congresswoman steyer about the other day she stop by to say hello she work with my mother so I 've know she since I be a kid do you tip she off about this case no this team can not function if I do not trust the people on it Sir if I touch a nerve out there today I be sorry but I do not deserve this you mysteriously show up at the bau after one of my team member be involve in a questionable shooting right you 've do good work I be not question that but I will not put up with a political agenda my mother 's a career politician you work with she do you like her she be an impressive woman well I think politic make people distrustful I think it make they hate themselves I think it tear family apart and damage people so if there be nothing else I would like to get back out on the street and find out who be kill these woman Sir have you reach a conclusion about nathan harris yet Profiles and evaluation be an inexact science but your professional opinion not a question of whether he end up kill someone it be when Nathan Nathan honey Nathan oh my god he be get to be out here right where else would he be I still can not believe his mother be not out here search for he I tell she it would be well if she wait for he at home Reid you know this be not your responsibility it be I can not explaiN well try I he know I understand he of course you do you be a profiler it be more than that how I know what it be like to be afraid of your own mind what be up with hotch today I do not know maybe he tie that knot in his tie a little too tight again yeah ok we be on our way they just find a body I would say he be get bold if it be the same unsub think it could 've be nathan this kill be fast and messy there be no cut hair no message carve not to mention kill at night none of it be our unsub 's signature excuse I agent they find the boy you be look for say he be beenere 4 hour get a lot of people worry sorry tell that policeman that you 've be here 4 hour I sneak out and I start walk like I could not control it so I figure I would come here and try and fight it have anybody see you here do not matter anyway it do matter nathan a woman be stab tonight and nobody see you I be go to have to bring you in as a suspect you go to cuff I let us go do you wanna know what I 've be do all night Hmm just be sit here think the only way for I to save people 's life in the future be to kill myself so nathan 's in custody they be hold he downtown you really think he kill that last woman it be possible but nathan 's evolve this last kill it feel like a devolution it be sloppy and angry Nathan 's smart and direct he be use to achieve if he decide to kill it will be clinical and efficient so where do that leave we back to the profile first victim he get a taste for kill Second he ask the police to help stop he by the third he feel like they 've fail he he be already devolve the fourth no ritual no message just a brutal murder it be true that he be devolving but this last victim definitely have a message you do not dump a body across from the capitol building by accident especially not when a congresswoman be about to proclaim success against the crime epidemic exactly guy that press conference be not announce yet only someone with inside information would know that we profile the unsub feel limited in his job what be more powerless than be a bit player on the washington stage you know if he feel like he do his part to clear the prostitute off the street but be never hear he might have feel so personally betray that he literally have to carve his frustration out on those woman so the profile be right we be just wrong about who the message be for we need to get a list of anyone who advocate on behalf of that bill Prentiss when you go back to talto the prostitute do a profile re a bell with any of they a few of they describe what sound like the same man but when I show they mug shot I come up empty let us go bk to they we be go to need their help what be you think about hotch I need to get a message to congresswoman steyer how quickly can we put together a press conference how fast do you need it may I have your attention please a day from now there will be an announcement across the street on the step of the capitol that crime be down significantly in washington this be a fact it be also a fact however that there be a serial killer who be be target the prostitute who work in this area in fact the last victim be fod not a hundred yard from where we be stand we be here today to let you know that the police and the fbi be work tirelessly on this case we would like to stress to the woman who work on these street to please take caution all right first I be go to give a brief description of the man we be look for and then we will take some question we believe the man responsible for these crime work on or around capitol hill possibly at a research or advocacy group deal with issue of crime control or prevention the low the group be on the washington food chain the well this guy he feel like his voice be not be hear and make sure to check for any advocacy group promote morality or value ok reality check what you be look for needle this haystack Garcia we do not have to find it we just need to get to the people who can ok you could 've do that much more quietly I know there be some people I would like for you to meet right this way just what point be you try to make these woman describe similar experience with the same man we show they police mug photo and they do not recognize he we think maybe you might know who he be do you think you could shock I by treat I to this sideshow Sideshow Lady enough of the man you work with treat themselves to we every day my apology lady could you

same thing with I and his voice get real high and nasal when he get excite do that sound like anyone that you know no I be go to read you a list of group that lobby on behalf of your legislation keep

neither you be the last person anyone see with my victim you recognize he find in an alley four year ago still unidentifie John doe just like that kid whose grave you visit every time you come to chicago another boy just after you leave the city this be crazy no kidding look man rodney harris he be be follow I around ever since I get back to town Rodney harris the gangbanger yeah he be wait

indistinctly all right tell he I will be there in a minute you be go to have to come up with something well than a gangbanger derek Detective gordinski cpb you think an fbi agent a bau profiler commit a homicide actually three homicide at least over 15 year you you think he be a serial killer this be ridiculous have he be charge with anything I get 72 hour for that I would like to see he be my guest this way Agent gideon right yes I owe you a big thank you I have no suspect at all until you look over my case for I and send I this profile everything in it point to that son of a bitch derek morgan I profile he it be all right there detective a profile be just a guide yeah this one guide I to he they be really more useful in the elimination of suspect rather than the inclusion that be not the way you present it to I well if I confuse you I be sorry I be not confused at all look whatever it be in here that make you consider agent morgan a suspect have to be coincidencE you can not rely solely on this you be right I be not Door open you ok this kid I be with he yesterday so so he be dead I drive he home hotch and gordinski 's say I be the last person see with he 15 year ago I be a new detective one of my first case be a black kid 12 or 13 year old find strangle in a vacant lot near here Boy be a john doe right still unidentified to this day wait a 12 year old kid that no one report miss ever four year ago another body turn up same m o work that case just as hard come up with just as much nothing nobody in the area have ever see the kid before no one be look for these kid then a few month back I attend a seminar that you teach at cpd headquarters I tell you about my case you say to send you the file and you would look them over this be the profile you work up there be about 3 million people in chicago your profile say I be look for a black male 25 to 35 with a knowledge of the area nonthreatening to child either know they or be normal enough that he do not scare they a probable criminal record it also say the way the body be place gently on a mattress not just toss on the ground indicate someone who be probably consume with guilt especially for the first victim your exact word be with a guilt ridden offender the bau postulate the first victim be the most important and the unsub may still visit the place of the crime or even the victim himself Care to guess who visit my first victim every time he be in town can not be just visit the victim there have to be more than that sure you say the unsub might try to inject himself into the investigation to keep tab on it Morgan have call our headquarter many time since he join the bureau always about this case so wait he talk to you about it headquarter he would never call I after I get your profile I check airline record turn out derek have just leave chicago when the other body turn up tell I the story from the beginning I I guess it start when I be 15 I be come home from football practice one day car horn blare I and my boy we be goof off you know we be throw a football around telephone ring the only person that I would ever see dead before that be my father when I be ten I mean there I be I be look at this kid and he be my own age hotch Dead in this vacant lot and he be never identify nobody know who he be nobody ever even report he miss and that that just do not sit right with I so I I feel responsible for he I mean I be the one that find he right I go around the neighborhood door to door try to start a collection and eventually I get enough so I could bury he and I give he a little headstone what do you put on the headstone if he be not identify Morgan just the date I leave room for a name if he be ever identify and you still visit he Hotch I go see this kid every time I be home I just feel like he deserve to have somebody look in on he Gordinski must read that as a guilty conscience a killer revisit his victim but that can not be the only reason he suspect you believe I that guy be have it in for I my entire life he be supremely confident that you be his killer then yesterday another kid end up dead and the last person he be with be derek morgan in the boy 's pocket we find one of his fbi business card his cell number write on the back of it in fact every time morgan 's in town he hang out with kid this be all just coincidence a hell of a lot of coincidence it be purely circumstantial So be a fingerprint do I mention that morgan find the body in 1991 hide way back in a vacant lot now do not you teach that when a body be hard to find the person find it be always a suspect Reid there be key piece of the profile that do not fit detective uh the age 25 to 35 morgan be 15 or so at the time also say that age be the hard to predict and I should never exclude someone simply because of a discrepancy with the age what about the speculation that since he do not manage to leave any evidence at the scene of the crime and he most likely have a criminal record or previous law enforcement knowledge Derek be not even in the bureau yet when the first body be find he may not have have a knowledge of law enforcement but derek morgan definitely have a criminal record a desperate detective here three dead boy no evidence at all so he apply the profile directly to someone he already suspect it be easy to get tunnel vision that way one begin to twist fact to suit theory instead of theory to suit fact that be uh one of sherlock holmes 's favorite quote we need to figure out who really kill these boy before they decide to charge morgan what do you want we to do last victim be someone morgan be see with Conveniently morgan be already a suspect in the other two someone set he up we should consider morgan a victim prentiss you and reid talk to his family learn about he especially around the time of the first murder do we have the address I can take you oh that be ok Gideon no actually that be not a bad idea right Okey doke lead the way detective accord to morgan he be get a bad history with gordinski he be get a bad history generally resisting arrest vandalism aggravate battery this be morgan as a juvenile look at the date this be not in his personnel file he say he tell I everything relevant then he either lie or he do not consider this relevant since when be the criminal history of a suspect not relevant you just call he a suspect get garcia into morgan 's life yes sir hey hotch I almost forget there be a local banger out here his name be rodney harris he be be run these street for a while now you have a criminal record what where do you get this what difference do that make Hotch this be suppose to be expunge my record 's clean I ask you if there be anything you have not tell I a judge expunge this it do not exist anymore man I be a kid it be nothing aggravate battery I sigh ok I be with some guy we get in a fight with some other guy Rodney this cat I be try to tell you about it be he we get into it a little bit we knock each other around he get a couple stitch in his head so they make it aggravate that be it so you be say this rodney commit three murder because you beat he up no I be say he be be follow I around since I get here so go talk to he and you might get something this be expunge you still should 've tell I you know how important accurate information be to victimology whoa Whoa victimology it be very likely the late victim be an attempt to set you up be you profile I Morgan we need to look at no we do not need to do anything Derek you be in trouble here Laughs Hotch I do not do this I be not worried about gordinski out there you still have three dead child ok ok so you profile they that be the case be there something else you do not want we to find out about Hotch I do not need the people I work with go into my entire world be uh derek all right he would not let we go down there he be fine our boss be with he do he tell you gordinski 's be harass he since he be a kid Reid Why be that you would have to ask that bastard oh sarah it be true mom sure it be what be you even do in my mother 's house they ask I oh really I do not understand how they could think he do this someone may be try to make it look like he hurt those kid and the police believe it just follow the evidence but he be an fbi agent Reid actually law enforcement official be just as probable statistically to commit a crime as anyone else look at the cross section of a society there be a general population and a small fraction he be not actually say we believe derek 's involve in this oh no no yeah not at all I be merely um speak theoretically you be dr Reid right mm hm Derek talk about you he do anyway so someone may be try to make it look like this be derek but derek love kid every time he be here he go to the youth center Youth center the upward youth center do that have some sort of significance for he oh be you say there be something in it for he other than give back to the poor kid of your neighborhood Sarah sarah we be friend of your brother 'S we be here try to help when we ask a question it be not to denigrate or demean anything he be do we just have to know everything so we can figure out where to look next be there some special significance to the youth center the youth center save his life do this make any sense to you no he be clearly hide something else well we know he be not involve in any murder no there be large implication we can not have people on this team who have secret oh come on hotch we all have secret would you want we profile you I feel terrible look into his life like this I know just remember we be try to help he Garcia right ok graduate with honor from northwestern law do you know he be a star football player surprisingly I do not know much about he at all Quarterback that be the guy who throw the ball right yes ha that be what he be full ride athletic scholarship Sophomore year he severely injure his left knee and he never play again ok garcia look far back ok before college Garcia right where be we ok um wait he be mention in the chicago register as body of a ch child in a vacant lot in 1991 sigh that be our first victim Garcia he never tell I about this he never tell any of we my husband um their father be kill when he try to stop a robbery Derek be with he he be ten a year or so later he start get into trouble what kind of

mind Season02 Episode13 condemn murderer perry smith say of his victim the clutter family I do not have anything against they and they never do anything wrong to I the way other people have all my life maybe they be just the one who have to pay for it this be a bad one be not it Unsubs with a cause be never good Pets I just get the 9 1 1 call from the georgia state police 9 1 1 what be your emergency I be at 1527 chestnut drive I know where you be call fro call from what be the emergency he think they be too greedy they have too much too much what stuff you know possession thing they do not need hurry you be call because these people have too much stuff no I be call because raphael that be enough I know why he be call because raphael be go to kill the sinner that live here I be sorry do you say someone be kill somebody well unsub one definitely sound frightened maybe he be do this against his will I doubt it he whisper he could have call out to save they instead of call 9 1 1 not if he have a gun to his head if he have a gun to his head why would he have dial 9 1 1 the second unsub say raphael be go to kill someone be there a third refer to oneself in the third person be not uncommon for an unsub Ted bundy give thoroughly detailed account of his murder but he never actually admit to do it he would just say the killer ok so I be go to go ahead and the name raphael through the georgia criminal database as well as our own Thanks garcia ever so welcome my liege we have a killing team on a mission in rural georgia we know what that mean they be not go to stop until the mission 's complete we need to hit the ground run J J we need an inside picture of the victim victimology can be critically important in a mission base spree already on it Prentiss go where the body be examine the wound they manage to kill 2 victim in 4 1 2 minute you get it we need to know how I be go to set up at the atlanta field office and go over case file from the state it would be highly unusual for a first kill to be this efficient Reid you and morgan come with I to the crime scene we land in less than an hour everybody try to get some rest you all right what you seem unhappy I be unhappy Tired of people use religion to justify the terrible thing they do you be say these killer be on a mission these unsub believe they be either on a mission from god or that the bible be somehow guide they Unsubs that stand for unknown subject the killer work as a team it sound to I like only one of they be into the mission it be usually more complicated than even that in the case of dick hickock and perry smith perry be the subservient personality basically against even enter the clutter home and yet he be the one who almost single handedly slaughter the entire family Huh how many time be mr Kyle stab stab be not exactly the word they be all long deep gash each victim have virtually the same wound both throat cut a vertical gash up one arm from wrist to elbow and a vertical gash down one leg from crotch to upper thigh major artery it be damn efficient how much knowledge of anatomy would someone need to do this anyone with a basic understanding of the body know where these artery be and do you have any idea which one of these wound be deliver first um there be a there be active blood flow from each of the wound so they be probably all deliver at about the same time with any of these wound the victim would bleed out quickly almost like an animal at slaughter no exactly like an animal at slaughter a deer or a lamb or a cow something like that you you cut the throat first then then sometimes open up other major artery to assist in drain the carcass so maybe a hunter or a farmer pretty much anyone in rur georgia oh so I just talk to the gentry they be the last couple to leave the super bowl party accord to they the kyle do not have any enemy they be good to their employee more generous then they need to be they be just generally good people so why they well if the trigger 's greed they do have a nice house yeah but you can not tell that from the street these people be choose and we need to know why and how I pull everything we have unsolve in the last 2 year nothing even close to the M o no murder involve a knife we have a lot of open case involve knife but they be in common type crime bar fight robbery well this be not their first contact one of they have experience be it ok if I go through some of your case file fresh eye there be nothing there help I out ok these guy they be not go to let I do anything else and I fly all the way here so I will show you the file room this be an unincorporated area we be stretch pretty thin manpower wise that be why we could not get here any fast after the guy call 4 1 2 minute that be a pretty good response time yeah that be on par with new york city 's response time 4 3 minute and they 've get a hell of a lot more cop per capita this unsub be good you do not really have a chance ok I know my partner call 9 1 1 the police be on the way so I do not have a lot of time now assume unsub one do not actively participate I get to believe I enter the bedroom fr here I see mr Kyle on the other side of the bed so I approach he and I cut he first well how do you know that a blitz attacker neutralize the great threat first in this case it would be the man plus a 9 1 1 call Woman scream you can not scream with your throat cut so mrs Kyle see her husband murder she run back into the bathroom excuse I man she try to close the door behind her I force my way in and I kill mrs Kyle back here in the bathroom we check that smudge for print nothing look like he wear some glove not with any pattern like latex maybe that do not make any sense at all it do not Unsubs suffer from a psychopathy a delusion like a message from god or what we could classify as be disorganize they do not generally clean up after themselves you know maybe unsub one the frightened one make sure they didn'T yeah talk to I baby girl be you at the crime scene Yep be there like a a burgundy settee against one wall um if a settee be a little couch oh my lord what what be wrong I just get a viral video email to I by a friend a viral what it be a video that someone post online that someone think be novel in some way and so they send it to everyone on their email list and so on and so on this one seem to be pretty popular judging by the string of name on the forward Garcia be there some point to all of this yeah I be pretty sure it be a video of your crime scene more specifically of your crime most specifically of mr Kyle be murder Garcia there be a video of this murder post on the internet yeah Shot from directly across the room from the little couch XXXXXXXXXX of greed Lust Disease that sound like unsub number one he say redemption must be seek we must all repent and he refer to be raphael it be not god or god it be someone sit right there next to he tell this guy what to say that be a new voice as lord god speak in leviticus a third unsub and if you will not yet for all this I will punish ye 7 time more for your sin could just be record from a religious program or sermon Punish ye 7 time 5 more victim these image be shoot from the exact spot on the dresser where that computer sit so if this video come from that computer 's camera then what do the unsub bring it with they as far as we can tell this computer belong to the kyle Garcia can do a well analysis but it have their banking statement vacation photo one come into the room and immediately go after mr Kyle what do the other unsub turn the camera on we might be ask the wrong question this video this message it be important clearly they want the world to see this they need it but they do not bring a camera with they Agent frank do this building hav wireless internet yeah why that camera be on right now do you see that boy what be go on I tell you the army of satan be go to rise against we I tell you the army of satan be go to rise against we the computer 's connect itself to the internet it be stream a video feed somewhere can we trace this stream to the destination keep it open garcia might be able the army of satan shall not prevail it turn off so they be control it remotely be that even possible yeah you can totally access someone 's computer remotely it be actually do a lot today when a mortal call for tech support instead of like give you instruction the tech can work on your computer from wherever she be and they maintain the access even after the work be do they be not suppose to but I suppose you could install a trojan horse during a service something leave in the computer to be turn on later same way that website get pop up add onto your computer Garcia can you check the kyle ' phone record and see if they call for tech support in the last 6 month right o oh and if you get I the kyle ' laptop I can search the drive for anything implant there fast as we can by the way this video it be go crazy viral what do that mean that mean it be the most download video on the entire internet worldwide and judge by the response embed in the file people seem to think it be pretty cool call we if you find anything on the kyle ' computer yeah murder as entertainment they probably do not even realize it be real People see so many image online every day they might assume it be market for a horror film or something the unsub be right about one thing the world be pretty screw up it be not too late Raphael 's Punishment have begin what no no this be warn not a show what be wrong with you people tech support uh I just get this computer yesterday and I can not seem to get the damn sound to work all right I think I can deal with that sir what kind of computer do you have I do not know big I do not mean the size sir I mean do you have a p C um my wife give it to I for my birthday do your computer have a camera instal in it I think so but it be my sound that be mess up all right I can help you with that sir I be go to need you to allow I remote access to your computer ok sure whatever that mean as long as it gets fix no no no no no do not that whore that jezebel what what do you mean no no she make a mistake we do not have to god be about love and forgiveness what the hell do you know about god so what have we get so far well the killing be clinically efficient they have the ear mark of a slaughter as in an animal or a sacrifice have not be able to find anything in federal or state database that suggest similar crime as far as I can tell it be the first in a series at least one member of the team may believe he be kill in the name of god suggesng a psychopathy that should display extreme level disorganization yet there be forensic countermeasure and somebody in control enough to do complicated computer wk one member of the team 's organize the other 's extremely disorganized but what be strange be that the one that we would consider as be most in control the one that make the phone call can not seem to stop the other one from kill usually the frenzied personality take direction from the cool head all right so let us look at that Unsub one call the police before the killing but he do not leave time for he to get there be the phone call just a guy work on a defense in case of capture I mean maybe he do not want to stop the other but he do whatever he have to do to cover himself so what do we have so far not enough 9 1 1 what be your emergency behold I will cast she into a bed and then I commit adultery with she to bring tribulation excuse I 22 smith road Raphael must teach more sinner the way of the lord so frank be right none of the open knife case fit tell I there be a but well I look at it a different way I look for unsolved home invasion 3 month ago there be a prowler call in directly outside of the kyle ' house a prowler the witness be walk his dog in a nearby park go back to his car he see a man in dark clothing go over the back wall and start sneak up to the house by the time the state police get there prowler be go only one man apparently be the witness able to describe he if he do it be not in this case file be there a name and address for the witness Tobias hankle live about an hour from here it be a long shot but he might be able to give we a description why do not you and reid go out there see if you can find mr Hankle and see if he remember something on it Agent hotchner yeah State just respond to another murder see if you can get the coroner out here right away Detective yeah well he call again this time it be different only one of they speak which one pretty sure it be raphael I write down what he say and I get a recording be bring out here take almost 11 minute to respond we only have but the one unit close could the unsub know that lack of police presence out here have get some local medium attention recently we be go to eat our lunch over it now ²»ÖªµÀÕâ¾äÊÇÄÄÀ´µÄ 9 1 1 call be not the only thing that be different this particular scene be weird in another way the male victim upstairs throat cut why be that weird he do not live here he be a local handyman who live here the douglas I just talk to mr Douglas a little while ago he be on his way back from a business meeting down state and accord to he he be not have any handy work do on the house and his wife be suppose to be home but she be not she seem to be miss but her car be here Keys wallet purse I get a description out on the field so do you copy down what the caller say yeah Behold I will cast she into a bed and then that commit adultery oh so adultery be the sin but they kill he and not she they abduct her you think she be still alive well we never assume otherwise unless there be evidence I will cast she into a bed it be from revelation again it be about jezebel she be an adulterer whore false prophetess she be the most revile woman in the bible the unsub know she be have an affair there be a laptop here do not look now but we be on candid camera uh huh please tie her hand there and there please do not hurt I we do not have to do this tie her hand and shut up Insolence I sometimes hate look at my son please do not hurt I there be a laptop set up on the dresser upstairs with a pretty good view of the room Garcia 's try to trace the camera 's feed back to its destination I give her space to repent of her fornication and she repent not no I do I repent please look she repent it be in the book luke 15 10 I say unto you there be joy in the presence of the angel of god over one sinner that repenteth I be sorry I do I repent please tape her mouth so let us work this out what do the new behavior tell we that there be only one unsub this time uh raphael Alone not if he be the psychotic he would not be capable of operate this efficiently someone be here who could control himself make sure no evidence be leave behind at the first crime unsub one call the police right this time it be raphael why it be like the phone call be necessary it be part of the signature Power be give unto they over the fourth part of the earth to kill with sword with hunger and with death and with the beast of the earth see anything new no revelation Lot of bad stuff happen in that book Phael call alone this time sound like it this thing do not act like anything we 've ever see someone be clearly a dominant personality and a clearly subservient one they do not swing back and forth like this just do not take on each other 's role Meaning you know they can emulate the cry of over 30 different specie from hummingbird to eagle other animal even machinery ever hear of the archangel raphael God preach mercy for sinner do not you try to tell I about the lord boy now you just get yourself in front of that camera and make our message to the world Jezebel which calleth herself a prophetess to teach and to seduce my servant to commit fornication have we ever see this in case history a mixture of extreme psychosis in a control individual no one of the most common indicator of extreme psychosis be solitude they do not exactly play well with other be garcia able to find anything on a raphael in the record not yet so why be he name himself twice certainly not worried about we get that name in fact he want we to know it an alia or raphael do not actually exist so we be not look for a team Raphael 's the name of one of the archangel mean we may have one unsub suffer from a delusion that he be actually an archangel maybe that first phone call be not 2 people but one what about the third voice that I do not know about yet if mrs Douglas be jezebel there be an especially unpleasant death in her future this be the word of the lord that he spake by his servant elijah the tishbite say in the portion of jezreel shall dog eat the flesh of jezebel Garcia 's run voice analysis on the first 9 1 1 call to see if there be actually 2 voice she be also go to peel the third voice off the videotape and see if that get anything we should have a copy of that late call bring over here within the hour Thanks Hotchner your tip from chronicle be on the phone Garcia Jeez do not you people answer your cell phone anymore we

your favorite oh mother night the one about the american spy who pretend to be a nazi you be who you pretend to be so be careful who you pretend to be oh my god I can not believe you be a vonnegut fan you just make my day Anytime conference room in 5 minute please get it Sandra davis 16 year old this be her singing at her high school talent show a month ago this be she on again off again boyfriend Ken newcombe their body be find in a park near the male victim 's car in groton an affluent mostly white suburb of new york city in westchester county it be the third of 3 killing believe to be a series of hate crime Hate crime the first 2 victim be keisha andrews 15 and vickie williams 17 they disappear from their home in central westchester one night their body be find in a wooded area in a southern part of the county near the city and this be paint on their face what about this couple how be their body find another swastika this one on the boyfriend 's car it be a different victimology maybe just an escalation or a different killer and it do not end there yesterday an african american community leader a reverend williams decide to take this on as a political issue racial hate in the suburb what we be see be pure apathy black kid be getting kill and the police be do nothing to stop it when will these racist be confront apparently in response to reverend williams ' muckrake a black kid be beat on the street of groton this afternoon Connecticut neo Nazi group call the white stallion claim responsibility there be neo Nazi group in connecticut the mayor of groton call I this morning frantic Rate to solve these crime before it escalate even more what be the racial demographic of groton Population 42 000 8 black I would say the mayor have reason to be worry if it do not stop soon it could flare up from the deep desire often come the deadly hate Socrates New York New York too bad we be fly straight to the suburb hey this be weird but no sign of sexual assault so why would the unsub use a date rape drug to commit a hate crime maybe he want to weaken they so they can not fight back but there be no g H B in the victim of the double homicide there be a lot that be different about the double homicide the question be why all right we just get new information a few week before the murder of sandra davis and ken newcombe a threatening letter be deliver to sandra davis ' door she show it to her parent who then notify the police the police never figure out who write it we see ken with you and it make we sick take care to stop this now or you will pay if you tell anyone about this you will pay Strange do not seem real what do you mean first of all the use of we in a threat this direct be almost always bogus one individual try to diffuse responsibility also the message itself seem contradictory on the one hand take care to stop this now or you will pay Presumably they want they to stop see each other but then on the other hand they do not want they to go public with it if you tell anyone about this you will pay the point of hate crime be to increase publicity not decrease it it be like terrorism an effective threat let us everybody know that they be in danger if they do this behavior the author would want sandra to tell people about the note do not sound like a guy who be actually prepared to kill actually it do not sound like a guy at all take care to stop this imply empathy take care male do not use this type of language especially when they be train to threaten somebody this message be certainly write by a female and base on the lack of psychological sophistication I would say it be most likely an adolescent you think a girl kill these kid I think a girl write this note let us call that mystery number one you get a number 2 maybe say here the autopsy on sandra davis be inconclusive she suffer blunt force trauma to the face she have some bruise around her neck Cause of death be still unclear Coroner 's work on it a lot of question let us get start on some answer Agent jareau gregory hughes Mayor hughe yes this be detective rick ware from the state police department we have not have a murder here in 2 year you understand this be way above our head so we put rick in charge these be agent gideon hotchner Morgan and prentiss I have to say that what be be happen here the last few week be it be just hard to fathom I mean we be 30 minute from the city what do you mean well this be not the de south for the most part these be sophisticated new yorker be you say you do not think this be a race issue all we be say be whatever happen here be way out of the norm for this community I would not want you enter this investigation under assumption that well be not true Fact be we do not know what this be about yet we need to concentrate on the double murder and make sure that it be the same killer first of all you mean there could be more than one we do not know that yet all we do know be the threat send to sandra davis be write by an adolescent girl you can tell that just from a half a page note it be pretty straightforward profiling be there a problem officer uh there be a girl that we suspect at first but then we talk to she and dismiss her I would like to meet she I think it be a waste of time I would like to decide that for myself Sandra show we the note 2 week before she be kill we ask around the school for who might have a grudge against sandra and ken the only girl 's name that come up be tonya mathis Rumor be ken dump she for sandra although ken tell I Tonya be never his girlfriend you say you talk to tonya about the note what have she say she swear up and down she have nothing to do with it I find it pretty hard to believe she would write a racist note why be that see for yourself that be tonya in the flesh leave she in there for a few minute you be go to make a 17 Year Old girl sweat I want to scare the hell out of her do these kid live near here Sandra davis live about 1 2 mile west Ken newcombe about a mile east what be they do here when I be a kid I use to hang out in the park at night Drink beer hook up with a girl maybe but I do not think these two be out on a date why do you say that well as ken be wear a sweatshirt and tennis shoe Sandra be wear a dress high heel and makeup she be definitely dressed to go out Ken 's body be find here yeah and sandra here but from the bloodstain it be obvious that she be kill there and then drag here so the unsub shoot ken first Sandra start to run and he chase she down beat she and strangle she he have a gun why do not he shoot she too he could overpower she maybe he do not think he could overpower ken no it be more than that the killer take the time and risk her escape to track she down and strangle she with his bare hand he be completely focused on her Sandra do not have a date with ken she have a date with the unsub hello tonya I be agent morgan this be agent prentiss we be with the f B I F B I I be go to get right to the point write a threat like this it be a federal crime I tell he I do not write that note oh I know what you tell he but this be not the principal 's office you understand the people you threaten be dead I do not kill anybody I know that I get it but we need to know why you write that note you be angry with ken because he do not acknowledge you I get it he do not admit that you be his girlfriend I be his girlfriend yeah what about sandra she be the one who get the note why be you so angry with her tonya oh this be not just about she go with ken be it tonya that note say we you want to make it look like other people be in on it like the whole town be against her why be that the way she make you feel like everybody be against you it be that stupid talent show what talent show I be just as good as her she be just this quiet little girl who nobody like then she sing and suddenly she be all little miss popular and ken 's all over her it be not fair so tonya look at I you write this note for revenge do not you I know it be stupid but I just want to scare they I be sorry we call tonya 's family and friend we be check she out but that girl do not kill those kid it be how you 've have to learn anybody see reid where 's reid Coroner 's report Victim have be beat so extensively the cause of death be indeterminate Post Mortem stab wound be also discover Post Mortem stab huh what Post Mortem stab wound almost always indicate sexual homicide uh this be also a fairly extreme overkill which be markedly different from the other 2 girl so you be say this be a different killer no we be say if it be the same killer the overkill indicate he do not get what he want from someone Derek sexual predator kill for sexual need and in this case there be no sign of sexual assault on his victim that tell we that he probably fetishise take some souvenir from his victim that he use to get off correct I if I be wrong like the m o of a hate crime no we be pretty certain that hate be not the primary motive at all he have a specific physical type and he try to cover his track he be a serial killer hi hi naomi it be nice to see you again Hop in thank thank for pick I up Reverend williams and when do the f B I finally arrive only after a white boy be kill we can not rely on the police we must protect ourselves let the people who be take our daughter know they will not get away with this that be enough explain this to I the swastika on the body what do they mean they be a distraction Hotch perhaps this killer be not drive by hate but he want we to think so so we will not guess his real motive which be serial sexual homicide I be confident the unsub 's from this county he know the kind of hysteria that would flare up from these swastikas Reverend williams take the bait Judge be try to buy we some time she be talk to the reverend to see if he will cool his rhetoric a little bit hate crime be political if we be right this be personal well we need to confirm that the double homicide be link to the first 2 murder we need to speak to the family of the victim we know how difficult this be for you thank for talk to we she just disappear that night I know she must have just walk out the front door but I think we would hear that what about the window in your daughter 's bedroom she could not have climb out there it be be paint shut for year no it have not what be you talk about bree I fix it so I could get out you 've be sneak out in the middle of the night I be sorry you be not in trouble but just tell I do she sneak out before no I swear she always tell I not to do it she be the good one she do not deserve this nobody deserve this your daughter like to sing we dig up everything on the first 2 victim and basically these girl be good student who stay out of trouble just like sandra davis and we find something else they both like to sing one in church and one in a band their parent say that this be their passion just like sandra davis african american girl between the age of 15 and 17 who like to sing that be a pretty specific type sound like the same unsub to I and the fact that they all sing that could be part of his m o maybe part of a ruse another girl go miss a naomi dade 16 year old when last night why be we just find out about it now first victim be not find for a couple of day there be a chance she be still alive let us get to the profile before it be too late girl on tape hey I be naomi Suspect we be look for be a black male Statistically between the age of 20 and 35 we know he be black because of his victim sexually motivated killer almost always kill within their own race the victim he be choose be good girl they be good student no behavioral problem they be what we call low risk and the low the risk of the victim the high the intelligence of the unsub Guy 's a smooth talker make people feel at ease gain their confidence you would be amazed what these guy can talk people into Jeffrey dahmer be once pull over by police officer for drive over the center line he would throw the garbage bag full of body part in the back seat of his car but he be so calm and so self assure that he convince the officer not to look in the bag he then go on to kill at least 15 more people this guy be a hustler he may not have a lot of education but he know how to treat impressionable young girl Victor paleologus use to troll shopping mall pretend to be a movie producer he tell kristine johnson for a james bond movie and that be the last time she be ever see alive we think that because all these girl be singer that the unsub may be connect in some way to the recording industry we know the unsub have a vehicle big enough to transport a body it be clean it be not too old nice enough to make a girl feel comfortable inside but it be not flashy this be not a guy who want to attract attention to himself probably a large dark sedan we recommend put this profile on the news the paper anywhere it might be see by the people in this town this guy 's ruse do not work on everybody somewhere out there be at least one woman who do not fall for his game and that be who we need to find the key to this unsub 's psychology be the souvenir he take we do not know what it be yet but we know that once he have it his victim tn become disposable and that be when he kill her the unsub 's ritual be interrupt when he kill sandra davis we do not believe he be able to take a souvenir from her we think he may revisit her house or any place she may have frequent we recommend surveillance in location where the unsub might approach young girl Churches high school Libraries coffee shop Stick with the community the people of this county should be able to offer some good lead thank a lot good luck Gid Whoa hold on hold on hold on you think community vigilance will be enough if it be we would be out of a job I be tell you not to do your job Jason just want to make sure that we do not get ahead of ourselves what be he do so please just sit tight one more minute what be the problem well the problem be I would have to be crazy to release this profile to the public what be you talk about Reverend williams have already stir up enough trouble by choose to make this town a soapbox for his anti racism campaign what do you think be go to happen if I go to the press and tell they the killer be black hey the good way to stop all this be to find that killer and we just give you the good way to do that right by tell everybody to look out for an anonymous black man they be go to say that be racial profiling it be not racial profiling racial profiling be target suspect because of their race we give you a complete profile which include race all right look the point be I 've never even hear of a black serial killer and neither have all the african Americans in this community already upset by what be be happen here you can believe in black serial killer or not but the fact be they do exist and it be only a matter of time before he kill another girl all right look I be not interested in debate this Detective ware be more than capable of head this investigation you go to let this happen let what happen make every black man in this county a target Rick what we find naomi dade 's body Damn it we get a mass of reporter out there what be it go to be detective please let we help you finally I want to assure you we consider all option and we be certain this be the good course of action thank you Detective I think you make the right choice I hope this do not come back to bite we in the ass why would it why last thing I need be to spread fear that a dangerous black man run around this county Hotch good way to solve your problem be to stay focused on what we need to do to catch this guy tell I tell I what to do we need to get the word out not just on the news we need to talk to these kid face to face get to give they the profile what about the talent show that sandra davis sing in at her high school that could be where the unsub see she sing that be a good idea talk to the kid at her high school Set up a tip line yeah you get it well I hate wait around so what do you say ware want to join the patrol get back on the street pretend to be a beat cop again yeah beat wait around here for more body do not it let us do it tip have just start to come in so far we have finger point at a minister you do

around in a black lincoln in front of our last victim 's house yesterday that be the second sighting for that vehicle it fit the profile large dark sedan include it in the press release yeah yeah I get it suspect may be drive a black town car may be it be something no I be good for what it be worth um take ball to stand up to the mayor like that you would 've do the same thing I do not have to work for the guy I know that be a tough decision do not you ever wish it do not matter it Color Hmph judge I by the content of my character I mean why do it even have to be part of the equation People be die we need to get the bad guy that should be it no half cocked reverend run around get people mad about the wrong thing no mayor so afraid of offend black folk he do not even want to tell the community what to look out for it be exhausting sometimes it be the way it be always be man Politicians community leader they do what they do you and I we do what we do we be the foot soldier in these

read slaughterhouse five when I be 12 and it blow my mind seriously I could not get enough so I just keep go and I read them all yeah yeah I too what be your favorite oh mother night the one about the american spy who pretend to be a nazi you be who you pretend to be so be careful who you pretend to be oh my god I can not believe you be a vonnegut fan you just make my day Anytime conference room in 5 minute please get it Sandra davis 16 year old this be her singing at her high school talent show a month ago this be she on again off again boyfriend Ken newcombe their body be find in a park near the male victim 's car in groton an affluent mostly white suburb of new york city in westchester county it be the third of 3 killing believe to be a series of hate crime Hate crime the first 2 victim be keisha andrews 15 and vickie williams 17 they disappear from their home in central westchester one night their body be find in a wooded area in a southern part of the county near the city and this be paint on their face what about this couple how be their body find another swastika this one on the boyfriend 's car it be a different victimology maybe just an escalation or a different killer and it do not end there yesterday an african american community leader a reverend williams decide to take this on as a political issue racial hate in the suburb what we be see be pure apathy black kid be getting kill and the police be do nothing to stop it when will these racist be confront apparently in response to reverend williams ' muckrake a black kid be beat on the street of groton this afternoon Connecticut neo Nazi group call the white stallion claim responsibility there be neo Nazi group in connecticut the mayor of groton call I this morning frantic Rate to solve these crime before it escalate even more what be the racial demographic of groton Population 42 000 8 black I would say the mayor have reason to be worry if it do not stop soon it could flare up from the deep desire often come the deadly hate Socrates New York New York too bad we be fly straight to the suburb hey this be weird but no sign of sexual assault so why would the unsub use a date rape drug to commit a hate crime maybe he want to weaken they so they can not fight back but there be no g H B in the victim of the double homicide there be a lot that be different about the double homicide the question be why all right we just get new information a few week before the murder of sandra davis and ken newcombe a threatening letter be deliver to sandra davis ' door she show it to her parent who then notify the police the police never figure out who write it we see ken with you and it make we sick take care to stop this now or you will pay if you tell anyone about this you will pay Strange do not seem real what do you mean first of all the use of we in a threat this direct be almost always bogus one individual try to diffuse responsibility also the message itself seem contradictory on the one hand take care to stop this now or you will pay Presumably they want they to stop see each other but then on the other hand they do not want they to go public with it if you tell anyone about this you will pay the point of hate crime be to increase publicity not decrease it it be like terrorism an effective threat let us everybody know that they be in danger if they do this behavior the author would want sandra to tell people about the note do not sound like a guy who be actually prepared to kill actually it do not sound like a guy at all take care to stop this imply empathy take care male do not use this type of language especially when they be train to threaten somebody this message be certainly write by a female and base on the lack of psychological sophistication I would say it be most likely an adolescent you think a girl kill these kid I think a girl write this note let us call that mystery number one you get a number 2 maybe say here the autopsy on sandra davis be inconclusive she suffer blunt force trauma to the face she have some bruise around her neck Cause of death be still unclear Coroner 's work on it a lot of question let us get start on some answer Agent jareau gregory hughes Mayor hughe yes this be detective rick ware from the state police department we have not have a murder here in 2 year you understand this be way above our head so we put rick in charge these be agent gideon hotchner Morgan and prentiss I have to say that what be be happen here the last few week be it be just hard to fathom I mean we be 30 minute from the city what do you mean well this be not the de south for the most part these be sophisticated new yorker be you say you do not think this be a race issue all we be say be whatever happen here be way out of the norm for this community I would not want you enter this investigation under assumption that well be not true Fact be we do not know what this be about yet we need to concentrate on the double murder and make sure that it be the same killer first of all you mean there could be more than one we do not know that yet all we do know be the threat send to sandra davis be write by an adolescent girl you can tell that just from a half a page note it be pretty straightforward profiling be there a problem officer uh there be a girl that we suspect at first but then we talk to she and dismiss her I would like to meet she I think it be a waste of time I would like to decide that for myself Sandra show we the note 2 week before she be kill we ask around the school for who might have a grudge against sandra and ken the only girl 's name that come up be tonya mathis Rumor be ken dump she for sandra although ken tell I Tonya be never his girlfriend you say you talk to tonya about the note what have she say she swear up and down she have nothing to do with it I find it pretty hard to believe she would write a racist note why be that see for yourself that be tonya in the flesh leave she in there for a few minute you be go to make a 17 Year Old girl sweat I want to scare the hell out of her do these kid live near here Sandra davis live about 1 2 mile west Ken newcombe about a mile east what be they do here when I be a kid I use to hang out in the park at night Drink beer hook up with a girl maybe but I do not think these two be out on a date why do you say that well as ken be wear a sweatshirt and tennis shoe Sandra be wear a dress high heel and makeup she be definitely dressed to go out Ken 's body be find here yeah and sandra here but from the bloodstain it be obvious that she be kill there and then drag here so the unsub shoot ken first Sandra start to run and he chase she down beat she and strangle she he have a gun why do not he shoot she too he could overpower she maybe he do not think he could overpower ken no it be more than that the killer take the time and risk her escape to track she down and strangle she with his bare hand he be completely focused on her Sandra do not have a date with ken she have a date with the unsub hello tonya I be agent morgan this be agent prentiss we be with the f B I F B I I be go to get right to the point write a threat like this it be a federal crime I tell he I do not write that note oh I know what you tell he but this be not the principal 's office you understand the people you threaten be dead I do not kill anybody I know that I get it but we need to know why you write that note you be angry with ken because he do not acknowledge you I get it he do not admit that you be his girlfriend I be his girlfriend yeah what about sandra she be the one who get the note why be you so angry with her tonya oh this be not just about she go with ken be it tonya that note say we you want to make it look like other people be in on it like the whole town be against her why be that the way she make you feel like everybody be against you it be that stupid talent show what talent show I be just as good as her she be just this quiet little girl who nobody like then she sing and suddenly she be all little miss popular and ken 's all over her it be not fair so tonya look at I you write this note for revenge do not you I know it be stupid but I just want to scare they I be sorry we call tonya 's family and friend we be check she out but that girl do not kill those kid it be how you 've have to learn anybody see reid where 's reid Coroner 's report Victim have be beat so extensively the cause of death be indeterminate Post Mortem stab wound be also discover Post Mortem stab huh what Post Mortem stab wound almost always indicate sexual homicide uh this be also a fairly extreme overkill which be markedly different from the other 2 girl so you be say this be a different killer no we be say if it be the same killer the overkill indicate he do not get what he want from someone Derek sexual predator kill for sexual need and in this case there be no sign of sexual assault on his victim that tell we that he probably fetishise take some souvenir from his victim that he use to get off correct I if I be wrong like the m o of a hate crime no we be pretty certain that hate be not the primary motive at all he have a specific physical type and he try to cover his track he be a serial killer hi hi naomi it be nice to see you again Hop in thank thank for pick I up Reverend williams and when do the f B I finally arrive only after a white boy be kill we can not rely on the police we must protect ourselves let the people who be take our daughter know they will not get away with this that be enough explain this to I the swastika on the body what do they mean they be a distraction Hotch perhaps this killer be not drive by hate but he want we to think so so we will not guess his real motive which be serial sexual homicide I be confident the unsub 's from this county he know the kind of hysteria that would flare up from these swastikas Reverend williams take the bait Judge be try to buy we some time she be talk to the reverend to see if he will cool his rhetoric a little bit hate crime be political if we be right this be personal well we need to confirm that the double homicide be link to the first 2 murder we need to speak to the family of the victim we know how difficult this be for you thank for talk to we she just disappear that night I know she must have just walk out the front door but I think we would hear that what about the window in your daughter 's bedroom she could not have climb out there it be be paint shut for year no it have not what be you talk about bree I fix it so I could get out you 've be sneak out in the middle of the night I be sorry you be not in trouble but just tell I do she sneak out before no I swear she always tell I not to do it she be the good one she do not deserve this nobody deserve this your daughter like to sing we dig up everything on the first 2 victim and basically these girl be good student who stay out of trouble just like sandra davis and we find something else they both like to sing one in church and one in a band their parent say that this be their passion just like sandra davis african american girl between the age of 15 and 17 who like to sing that be a pretty specific type sound like the same unsub to I and the fact that they all sing that could be part of his m o maybe part of a ruse another girl go miss a naomi dade 16 year old when last night why be we just find out about it now first victim be not find for a couple of day there be a chance she be still alive let us get to the profile before it be too late girl on tape hey I be naomi Suspect we be look for be a black male Statistically between the age of 20 and 35 we know he be black because of his victim sexually motivated killer almost always kill within their own race the victim he be choose be good girl they be good student no behavioral problem they be what we call low risk and the low the risk of the victim the high the intelligence of the unsub Guy 's a smooth talker make people feel at ease gain their confidence you would be amazed what these guy can talk people into Jeffrey dahmer be once pull over by police officer for drive over the center line he would throw the garbage bag full of body part in the back seat of his car but he be so calm and so self assure that he convince the officer not to look in the bag he then go on to kill at least 15 more people this guy be a hustler he may not have a lot of education but he know how to treat impressionable young girl Victor paleologus use to troll shopping mall pretend to be a movie producer he tell kristine johnson for a james bond movie and that be the last time she be ever see alive we think that because all these girl be singer that the unsub may be connect in some way to the recording industry we know the unsub have a vehicle big enough to transport a body it be clean it be not too old nice enough to make a girl feel comfortable inside but it be not flashy this be not a guy who want to attract attention to himself probably a large dark sedan we recommend put this profile on the news the paper anywhere it might be see by the people in this town this guy 's ruse do not work on everybody somewhere out there be at least one woman who do not fall for his game and that be who we need to find the key to this unsub 's psychology be the souvenir he take we do not know what it be yet but we know that once he have it his victim tn become disposable and that be when he kill her the unsub 's ritual be interrupt when he kill sandra davis we do not believe he be able to take a souvenir from her we think he may revisit her house or any place she may have frequent we recommend surveillance in location where the unsub might approach young girl Churches high school Libraries coffee shop Stick with the community the people of this county should be able to offer some good lead thank a lot good luck Gid Whoa hold on hold on hold on you think community vigilance will be enough if it be we would be out of a job I be tell you not to do your job Jason just want to make sure that we do not get ahead of ourselves what be he do so please just sit tight one more minute what be the problem well the problem be I would have to be crazy to release this profile to the public what be you talk about Reverend williams have already stir up enough trouble by choose to make this town a soapbox for his anti racism campaign what do you think be go to happen if I go to the press and tell they the killer be black hey the good way to stop all this be to find that killer and we just give you the good way to do that right by tell everybody to look out for an anonymous black man they be go to say that be racial profiling it be not racial profiling racial profiling be target suspect because of their race we give you a complete profile which include race all right look the point be I 've never even hear of a black serial killer and neither have all the african Americans in this community already upset by what be be happen here you can believe in black serial killer or not but the fact be they do exist and it be only a matter of time before he kill another girl all right look I be not interested in debate this Detective ware be more than capable of head this investigation you go to let this happen let what happen make every black man in this county a target Rick what we find naomi dade 's body Damn it we get a mass of reporter out there what be it go to be detective please let we help you finally I want to assure you we consider all option and we be certain this be the good course of action thank you Detective I think you make the right choice I hope this do not come back to bite we in the ass why would it why last thing I need be to spread fear that a dangerous black man run around this county Hotch good way to solve your problem be to stay focused on what we need to do to catch this guy tell I tell I what to do we need to get the word out not just on the news we need to talk to these kid face to face get to give they the profile what about the talent show that sandra davis sing in at her high school that could be where the unsub see she sing that be a good idea talk to the kid at her high school Set up a tip line yeah you get it well I hate wait around so what do you say ware want to join the patrol get back on the street pretend to be a beat cop again yeah beat wait around here for more body do not it let us do it tip have just start to come in so far we have finger point at a minister you do not have to do this a janitor at his school and oh the reverend jesse jackson be anything useful not so much keep diggin ' hey uh I get someone who remember see a black guy they do not recognize drive around in a black lincoln in front of our last victim 's house yesterday that be the second sighting for that vehicle it fit the profile large dark sedan include it in the press release yeah yeah I get it suspect may be drive a black town car may be it be something no I be good for what it be worth um take ball to stand up to the mayor like that you would 've do the same thing I do not have to work for the guy I know that be a tough decision do not you ever wish it do not matter it Color Hmph judge I by the content of my character I mean why do it even have to be part of the equation People be die we need to get the bad guy that should be it no half cocked reverend run around get people mad about the wrong thing no mayor so afraid of offend black folk he do not even want to tell the community what to look out for it be exhausting sometimes it be the way it be always be man Politicians community leader they do what they do you and I we do what we do we be the foot soldier in these street get the job do Hmph Foot

inundate with homicide Gang violence be a big problem Shootings Armed robbery it be an everyday occurrence but this type of street attack be new to they could it be gang relate maybe some new type of initiation rite the gang in the ward use gun in fact no know gang exhibit this type of m o what about dope these guy come up with pretty freaky way of kill the competition to get their message out

you what do you mean what be the matter with I I have never see you act like this really oh in the month that you know I you 've never see I act this way hey no offense Emily but you do not really know what you be talk about do you early this morning katrina crash into the gulf coast with sustained wind above 125 an hour as many house be be destroy resident be try to evacuate be you listen to I pop grab your wallet and get the hell out of there the bus be fill up this case be eatin ' at I Billy Dad forget the damn case what the hell be I miss here Dad people be drown in their home the whole world 's go to be underwater I get another letter Billy Screw the letter forget the serial killer they be open the superdome I want you to meet I there I will be damn please I be beg you pop Pop Behavioral analysis unit we 've get a serial killer in New Orleans who kill at least 3 man pre Katrina until now the New Orleans police department believe that the serial killer die in the storm what be happen to tell they otherwise a fourth body be find in the french quarter last night same M o another male Throat slash eviscerate a year and a half that be a long cool off period be we sure this be the same unsub he claim to be he send a letter to William Lamontagne the head detective on the case do Lamontagne have any lead he die in Katrina his son be actually lead the case now hmm that can not be easy well we need to pour over the evidence from the first 3 murder and determine the pattern Katrina wash everything away the 3 victim we know of their autopsy report Witness statement dna test result so basically all we have to go on be the late victim yeah until he kill again criminal mind 218 Robert Kennedy once say Tragedy be a tool for the living to gain wisdom not a guide by which to live hey Reid what be going on up there from Las Vegas Ethan I be pretty sure he live in New Orleans now really go to give he a call grow up compete against each other in absolutely everything Spelling bee science fair we also both have our heart set on join the bureau but first day at quantico he back out he probably just could not take the heat it be not really for we to judge be it right my bad these be copy of the newspaper article on the murder date back to early august 2005 it be all we have to go on he kill 3 time he stop for 18 month then he start kill again we should have garcia run a list of any offender in the area anyone who spend the last year and a half do time or anyone that relocate after Katrina and recently move back what be the victimology in kill a mechanic a real estate broker and a cook with age range from 22 to 45 and this late be a 33 Year Old taxi driver they just do not seem to have very much in common besides be male and walk the french quarter late at night which be notorious for mugging off the main drag yeah but this guy be not in a rush to flee the scene a slaughter like this take time Andrei Chikatilo fantasize that the man he kill be his captive and then torture and mutilate they somehow make he a hero the city 's barely back to life something like this could cripple its psyche so where do we start well with no case file there be only one place we can start at square one you must be b a u Bill Lamontagne hi Jennifer Jareau we speak on the phone well ok then I picture you different uh these be agent Gideon and Morgan this be detective William Lamontagne JR appreciate you guy be here my daddy be too stubborn to ever ask for any help sorry for your loss I understand you receive a letter yeah before they be lose in Katrina my daddy receive 2 letter this one came address to he yesterday they pass it on to I you sure it be from the same killer it be a detailed account of what he do to the body 4 layer of fatty tissue slice through like butter I only see that 3 other time you work this case initially Nah you do not forget victim like this it be like they be dissect I can still smell the alcohol on he this be New Orleans dead or alive it ' a smell you get use to the victim have no defense wound mean this be most likely a blitz attack no hesitation mark or rapid thrust Cuts be methodical almost procedural my guess whoever gutte this guy be teach to so you think he might have some medical training how else could he carve around every organ and leave each one intact have any of his relative come to claim the body anyone we could speak with no I will end up box up the poor bastard 's ashe leave to collect dust in storage all the body I 've be through in the last year and a half it be a wonder I still have room it would be pretty easy to hide out in one of these alcove wait for the victim without ever be see yeah all 4 murder occur within a 10 Block radius here inside the french quarter on any give night there would have to be thousand of people walk through here from the bar ten of thousand when I first start as a cop I work the quarter it be like be in the riot squad every night every sunday I would get off work around sunrise I be ready to pass out my daddy'd be wait for I at my house make I drive he uptown to Frankie and Johnny 's for poorboy call it commune with New Orleans do your father tell you anything else about this case that we should know he try to but you guy should see that for yourself this wall be still stand where daddy carve the message right before he die there be no doubt he be still work from the grave Jones that name mean anything to you no I run it through the database against every offender in New Orleans and you can imagine how many hit I get but nothing come up in connection with this case but in your dad 's final moment it be the most important thing he want to say learn how to play the drum in this house grow up with 2 dog in this house all it be go to be now be the word jones carve into that wall Detective if he have write the unsub 's name I think you would have find he by now Jones be the one piece of the puzzle that your daddy do know he trust you to figure out the rest yeah I know it but I 've pore over it a thousand time and I still can not put it together I can not get it out of my head you ok yeah I just do not want to disappoint he be that the letter from the unsub yeah I be back with a vengeance I want you to know the last guy make it easy be out so late stumble home drunk I enjoy slice around his organ I think about send you one he be ask to be rip do not you think boss your truly hey ok to say that the victim be ask to be kill deny all culpability most sexual sadist rationalize their own behavior by blame the victim like that but there be no evidence of sexual assault in the autopsy he could be a homosexual male Stabbing because he need violence for arousal every kill he be act out a fantasy of revenge what if he be try to act out something else like what except for the victim be man it be the same m o what be you talk about all 4 victim be find with their throat slash eviscerate and the murder perpetrate in semi public place after dark investigator taunt with the letter address to boss the only difference be that case be 100 year ago and the murder take place in London Jack the ripp the unsub want we to think that he be the modern Day version loose in New Orleans please do not so the 3 of you be out together last night Mark have just pay his tab at one bar and he be on his way to meet we at another you guy get in any trouble Drunken brawl anyone get out of hand we be just out to have fun you know Minded our own business could mark have meet a girl maybe upset her boyfriend no sir he strike out like we all do thank guy ok get hard to keep up with this guy well if he be mimic Jack the ripp that might be precisely the point he terrorize london for month without ever getting catch I would appreciate it if you would gather your man we would like to give you a profile of who you be up against the offender we be look for be friendly Agile somewhere between 30 and 35 he will allure with charm and kill with rage we believe he be murder man to reclaim his power this unsub suffer from low self Esteem but he probably cover it well he dress impeccably to feed the facade Jack the ripper himself be an impetuous lust murderer whereas this offender be organize calculate he might even stalk his victim for day before the actual kill we believe this killer identify with Jack the ripper because he be lose his own identity maybe through year of child abuse or some catastrophic event because he overcompensate to hide his insecurity we believe he may hold a position of authority at work and since we think he be have medical training consider emts doctor veterinarian please be careful for this unsub the french quarter be a hunting ground he be certainly already prove he know the terrain Jeez Reid you scare I always be one step ahead of you man yeah whatever help you sleep at night I be glad you call it be good to see you you too let us get a drink Prentiss what be the thing Jack the ripper take from one of his victim besides well you know her life oh uh uh Mmm Tick tock Tick tock I do not know a kidney how horrify ingly fantastic be that mm hmm and be you go anywhere

he claim to be he send a letter to William Lamontagne the head detective on the case do Lamontagne have any lead he die in Katrina his son be actually lead the case now hmm that can not be easy well we need to pour over the evidence from the first 3 murder and determine the pattern Katrina wash everything away the 3 victim we know of their autopsy report Witness statement dna test result so

be copy of the newspaper article on the murder date back to early august 2005 it be all we have to go on he kill 3 time he stop for 18 month then he start kill again we should have garcia run a list of any offender in the area anyone who spend the last year and a half do time or anyone that relocate after Katrina and recently move back what be the victimology in kill a mechanic a real estate broker and a cook with age range from 22 to 45 and this late be a 33 Year Old taxi driver they just do not seem to have very much in common besides be male and walk the french quarter late at night which be notorious for mugging off the main drag yeah but this guy be not in a rush to flee the scene a slaughter like this take time Andrei Chikatilo fantasize that the man he kill be his captive and

entitle he be like a petulant adolescent he both resent and he absolutely expect everyone to take care of he and give that a male relative would not tolerate this behavior he most likely live with a female relative his mother grandmother aunt whom he exploit his arson kit be expensive Fire suit oxygen mask this suggest that he may be employ but his personality will not allow he to work closely with other in an office set this along with the information about his vehicle lead we to believe that he be a travel salesman of some sort who work for a company big enough not to notice that he be a sociopath ok this scumbag have issue we all get it but why fire he be like a drug addict only fire be his drug each time an addict need a fix they need more of the drug to get off so his crime most

always support violence I be ask you have edf 's strategy change no it hasn'T he could barely look at this a serial arsonist would not be able to peel his eye away he be hide something More than just his support for the edf hey it occur to I if all I know about the edf be that they go around burn down suv dealership and housing development well that be a common misconception that be my point what if our profile be right and the unsub hold the same misconception he want to fit in he want people around he to appreciate what he do be not it possible that the unsub join the edf think it be an arsonist 's club Sure that be possible if we give abby our unsub 's profile could he help we identify he we can not give abby the profile not until we find out what he be hide still it seem abby 's our good chance of find the unsub you want abby or the ex wife Abby at berkeley 20 year ago evan be a different person in every way warm funny honest even naive what happen we have school loan I get pregnant his job evan be an environmental consultant Builder 's hire he to help they clean up their site make sure they be up to epa code Evan think they hire he to do the right thing do he no developer do not care about mercury in the groundwater they just want to pass inspection as fast and cheap as possible he have a budget it be never enough but they do not care how he spend it as long as they pass inspection well how do evan deal with that he drink it get bad how bad I think he might hurt himself I do not know if he could live with it how be his relationship with your son liam he do not have one I have to threaten to take he to court to get he to pay child support must 've either scare the hell out of he or really piss he off why be that because every sunday night for the past 9 month he toss 2 000 cash through the mail slot he leave long before I throw he out I do not know I will but I promise I be go to give it to you ok I love you too everything ok yeah you know for a guy claim to be innocent he be act pretty guilty I never underestimate the effect be confront by the fbi will have on a suspect I do not think he be effect I think he be freak out in the time we 've be watch he he be pack his belonging into cardboard box hit his attorney 's office and 4 bank it do look like he be get ready to run the question be what do we do for now nothing we just watcH all those people no booze or music that be either a very lame go away party or an edf meeting we need to set surveillance up grab your camera where should I set up right here if he be hide something we do not have a warrant we do not have supply you want to intimidate he I want another chance to find out what he be hide ok smile everybody it look like intimidation work so what be it with you shove a bunch of dead kid in my face be not enough Thought I need a little harassment too it be over all right I denounce the fire and the people responsible for they and I just disband the edf if the edf have nothing to do with the fire why would you disband do you have kids agent hotchner I have a son like you good then I be go to tell you this one father to another I start the edf for my son and yours not to have some other guy 's son burn to death hope your picture come out Prentiss do he look like he weigh 185 to you 165 maybe why would he hold a meeting when he know we be watch he want we to see it he want to make sure that we see he try to do the right thing you do not believe he I do not know he seem pretty angry for a guy who be try to do the right thing that be why we need to get

abby be not the unsub witness put the gold sedan here so we know this be our guy and give that the attack occur less than 30 minute after the edf meeting and abby 's house be less than a mile from

tall brown hair nice home nice family good job that be the connection what connection Cutler be a lawyer jarvis an executive there be no evidence they ever meet but they be of the same type we know that most serial arsonist be white male a complex m o develop over time this guy be in his mid thirty he see the victim as successful version of himself and he resent they for it I will issue an A p B

combo be sell domestically as fleet vehicle Company car rental fleet do you check all agency yeah none of they keep they for the past three week or rent during both fire so who keep a rental car for three week then it be not a rental it would have to be a company car this guy he have to have time to stalk his victim and if his job involve drive there be a serial arsonist up in seattle early ninety paul kenneth keller yeah he use to drive around all day sell advertising for his dad 's agency pick out place to burn Company car good work J J let us do the profile the unsub we be look for be a highly intelligent under achieve 35 to 45 year old white male with a severe narcissistic character disorder nothing in his life work for long if he be married he be now divorce if employ it will not last what he want be admiration but he be get no respect for other not their feeling and most certainly not their safety he feels entitle he be like a petulant adolescent he both resent and he absolutely expect everyone to take care of he and give that a male relative would not tolerate this behavior he most likely live with a female relative his mother grandmother aunt whom he exploit his arson kit be expensive Fire suit oxygen mask this suggest that he may be employ but his personality will not allow he to work closely with other in an office set this along with the information about his vehicle lead we to believe that he be a travel salesman of some sort who work for a company big enough not to notice that he be a sociopath ok this scumbag have issue we all get it but why fire he be like a drug addict only fire be his drug each time an addict need a fix they need more of the drug to get off so his crime most likely get much bad it would be almost impossible for he to quit without help thank you very much she shoot she score the crowd go wild I just put the entire department on tac alert Garcia 's on line one Brace yourselves I be go to teach you the meaning of lust do she say lust mm hmm I cross reference every know fact on the victim and I just find a website that link both dennis cutler and matthew jarvis ' company on a list of business guilty of l U S T I be miss something leak underground storage tank the website belong to a recently found san francisco chapter of the earth defense front ´ the edf the eco terrorist group they be not eco terrorist they be environmental activist Dennis cutler and matthew jarvis may disagree with you I be pretty sure some edf people be send up for torch an suv dealership a while back in san diego nobody die in those fire

strategy change no it hasn'T he could barely look at this a serial arsonist would not be able to peel his eye away he be hide something More than just his support for the edf hey it occur to I if all I know about the edf be that they go around burn down suv dealership and housing development well that be a common misconception that be my point what if our profile be right and the unsub hold the same misconception he want to fit in he want people around he to appreciate what he do be not it possible that the unsub join the edf think it be an arsonist 's club Sure that be possible if we give abby our unsub 's profile could he help we identify he we can not give abby the profile not until we find out what he be hide still it seem abby 's our good chance of find the unsub you want abby or the ex wife Abby at berkeley 20 year ago evan be a different person evan be a different person in every way warm funny honest even naive what happen we have school loan I get pregnant his job evan be an environmental consultant Builder 's hire he to help they clean up their site make sure they be up to epa code Evan think they hire he to do the right thing do he no developer do not care about mercury in the groundwater they just want to pass inspection as fast and cheap as possible he have a budget it be never enough but they do not care how he spend it as long as they pass inspection well how do evan deal with that he drink it get bad how bad I think he might hurt himself I do not know if he could live with it how be his relationship with your son liam he do not have one I have to threaten to take he to court to get he to pay child support must 've either scare the hell out of he or really piss he off why be that because every sunday night for the past 9 month he toss 2 000 cash through the mail slot he leave long before I throw he out I do not know I will but I promise I be go to give it to you ok I love you too everything ok yeah you know for a guy claim to be innocent he be act pretty guilty I never underestimate the effect be confront by the fbi will have on a suspect I do not think he be affect I think he be freak out in the time we 've be watch he he be pack his belonging into cardboard box hit his attorney 's office and 4 bank it do look like he be get ready to run the question be what do we do for now nothing we just watcH all those people no booze or music that be either a very lame go away party or an edf meeting we need to set surveillance up grab your camera where should I set up right here if he be hide something we do not have a warrant we do not have supply you want to intimidate he I want another chance to find out what he be hide ok smile everybody it look like intimidation work so what be it with you shove a bunch of dead kid in my face be not enough Thought I need a little harassment too it be over all right I denounce the fire and the people responsible for they and I just disband the edf if the edf have nothing to do with the fire why would you disband do you have kids agent hotchner I have a son like you good then I be go to tell you this one father to another I start the edf for my son and yours not to have some other guy 's son burn to death hope your picture come out Prentiss do he look like he weigh 185 to you 165 maybe why would he hold a meeting when he know we be watch he want we to see it he want to make sure that we see he try to do the right thing you do not believe he I do not know he seem pretty angry for a guy who be try to do the right thing that be why we need to get those photo to garcia what do you mean either he be angry because he be guilty of a wrongdoing or he be angry because his attempt to do the right thing with the edf have get people kill but either way the arsonist be here tonight yeah I will show you a sick derange coward you ignorant son of a bitch derange coward I will show you a deranged coward the victim be a cpa Greg ballou 39 white 6 foot handsome he be talk to his fiance on

gold sedan here so we know this be our guy and give that the attack occur less than 30 minute after the edf meeting and abby 's house be less than a mile from here chance be the unsub be at abby 's house he park some distance away and walk this victim be not even connect to the edf list he be just a guy who look like he have a nice life like the other the unsub do not go into a house he barely even get out of his car there be no planning whatsoever why he be evolve he be do it fast he be smart than that this be random impulsive adolescent like a tantrum he be get displace aggression he

need to call alex 's mother of course we will stay here until your family arrive how long have you be a ranger 5 year now but I 've live in these wood my whole life grow up out here help you do your job look around do you see or hear anything right now no no there be a black bear about 25 yard to your right how long before we be able to do that depend on how well you use your instinct well this give new meaning to the word remote yeah it would be awfully hard to find this location if you be not familiar with the area there must only be a handful of people who know the terrain well enough to survive Boot track they be the same tread but they be different size well there be at least 2 people who know this terrain ok so this be where alex harrison 's body be find Morgan from this particular spot there be area of high ground that look down to where the victim die yeah I get a perfect view of you through the tree right here those be basic tactic that hunter use they use vantage point to watch their prey if these be tactic that hunter use they be precise enough to cover each other and take out their prey at the same time if both victim have 2 wound could be one for each offender I think we know how alex harrison die you think this guy look bad you should see the driver he need 10 stitch you well hurry all the group be fill up you like the challenge of a bear do not you actually I prefer pick up my meat at a grocery store oh you be one of those huh well be careful out there because in 3 day it be go to get busy as hell up on our mountain Hunting season yeah ever since somebody write about we in some fancy travel magazine we 've get load of tourist migrate up here if I be go to take out an animal anywhere from 100 to 200 pound what type of weapon would I use a shotgun and compound bow be the top but buckshot can be a bit messy I love arrow it can completely penetrate the body of a small animal it be the most effective kill Arrows Hotchner hold on a minute I will put you on speaker Hunting season officially open in 3 day do it look like the victim 's wound could be from an arrow whatever puncture the organ have to be long enough to penetrate the chest and mimic a 22 caliber bullet so yeah it be possible I think these victim be be catch take to the wood and hunt like wild animal oh not again come on ruby Come on baby a few more mile Damn it hi hello hi I call before my car 's break down for good Highway 2 can you hear I never mind you need some help miss so I start pull hunt license you should narrow down the suspect list before you dive in well what else be we look for you be about to find out we be look for at least 2 offender in good physical condition you would have to be fit to make it through this terrain and nobody would go that deep into the wood without backup Killing team be like most partnership one weak the other strong these man have not exhibit any sexual interest in their victim so they be either developmentally prepubescent or they could be relate immediate relative would not discuss sexual encounter let alone perform they in front of each other if they be relate they could have an us versus they mentality their bond will be unbreakable because it be all they know Most hunter put animal out of their misery the man we be look for they do not show any mercy these guy take pleasure in watch their casualty die a slow death every spring for the past 5 year people have go miss we think the killer wait for their prey to migrate through these wood Courtney jacob shane everett and alex harrison be all healthy Smart adult who survive for day by follow their instinct they find themselves in the middle of nowhere they be either approach in a way that be not threaten or the offender wait for a moment of weakness the perfect time to attack these particular hunter be very seasoned they be very efficient it be no surprise that they 've choose a weapon to be a compound bow it require the utmost precision and it provide they with a challenge every time like the trophy hunter these man they plan their killing with care they decide the type of victim they want how and where they want to kill they and with what weapon hunting be their sport human be their target use every hunter 's instinct in your body good luck yeah garcia if they be buy their weapon close to home we need a list of hunt

start notice there be less and less every week of of of they Less vagrant less less prostitute less junkie string out on the corner well sound to I like you be do a good job yeah that be what my boss think I actually uh get an award last week from the mayor 's office so so I be not do it Crime go down because the people commit the crime have disappear and and then over the last several week people seem to be disappear at a couple a day be not that the nature of these particular group be that they be transient no no N not this many this fast I I be tell you I can I can talk to somebody at lunch and by dinnertime they be wipe off the face of the earth ok um how many be it 63 63 people at least 63 63 people that I regularly use to see be just not there anymore and then last week I um I get this in the mail at the stationhouse there be two type of people in the world those who do the work and those who take the credit you should be ashamed Somebody else know that I be getting praise for something that I do not do 63 people you be you be sure about this something be happen out there agent jareau something bad www ydy com bbs proudly present www ydy com bbs sync karoro ÄªÔúÊÇ»µÈË Criminal Minds ¡ ¡ Season 02 Episode 23 Legacy you be not sure whether anyone be in fact miss no I I be sure I just can not seem to convince anyone else of it there be be no official investigation no 63 people can not be coincidence right Reid any stat on the percentage of um well I do not really know how to phrase the question Homeless who go miss the very nature of homelessness suggest a lifestyle of fluidity yet honestly they be not as transient as you would think they generally stay in small well define area base on familiarity and what service be nearby so so you be say they do not just disappear not normally but I mean that do not preclude the possibility Names address description do do you have any information that might help we find they again I I do not have a need for it at the time do you have enough here to see if they 've be report miss by someone I do not I do not know I I run they all through our computer and come up blank none of they turn up decease check the morgue and the hospital I I have check everywhere sir simply be go be not a federal issue we be go to need an official invitation into your jurisdiction an official Police chief chief of detective it have to come down through the chain of command we have no authority to look into this um I do not know that I I can do that unless we be officially ask we can not help you jurisdictional issue be not open for debate sorry it be out of our hand uh hotch there could be 63 victim here well I suppose you and I could go back with the detective and talk to his commander and try to impress upon they the serious implication thank you if we get an invitation we could send for the rest of you I just do not want to give the appearance that we be run over they I will wrap my class up if anything change let I know I should be available by 4 00 J J be ready in 30 Agent um sir he he take 2 of my book uh if you could leave your notebook with we we can unofficially go over they and maybe develop some more information how about I show you uh which people be not around anymore and you can copy down all the information ok well you hear agent hotchner you get 30 minute to brief we on 63 people ok um of all the preposterous assumption of humanity nothing exceed the criticism make of the habit of the poor by the well house well warm and well feed Herman melville land in 10 minute what we be land in 10 minute already it be a fast plane he be really into those notebook almost obsessional you mean clinically obsessional obsessive note take could be a form of o c d so the only witness we have to any of this might be mentally unstable that be possible this may be be a wild goose chase but as someone I greatly respect suggest 63 people may be in trouble and I think that that be worth the chase Damn that be a lot of people homeless man homeless woman runaway prostitute and drug user can all of their disappearance be a coincidence yeah technically it would not really be a coincidence since a number of these people share high risk trait which throw the curve off you see the word coincidence imply more hey kid we do not need a vocabulary lesson right now right sorry what be it the yorkshire

what they be be right across the state line Hotch it be federal what if we want this case it be ours it be federal this letter come from across the river from kansas city missouri Interstate communication put it in federal jurisdiction Sir this be now a federal case I would like to retain detective mcgee as a consultant you be not open any investigation in my jurisdiction I do not want a fight with you even though this be a federal case if we develop any information I will come to you and your man will make the arrest and why would you do that because that be how we operate anybody

Pl please do not kill I I have a daughter I will do anything you want I assure you I be not without compassion you be roughly in the center of a 130 000 square foot facility you have until sunrise to find your way out of here if you do not your sentence will be carry out you only have a few hour maggie we be go to provide a psychological profile of the man we be look for it contain some unusual specific personality trait that someone out there be bind to recognize which will make he relatively easy to locate long last negative impression he leave on anyone he might meet we have a term for the kill behavior this unsub display clean house fix what be wrong with the world he be deeply rationalize this behavior and while he certainly know the killing be wrong he truly believe that he be do the world a great service ultimately this type of unsub become a loner there will not be too many people that can still tolerate he now if he do have a relationship at all the person will not be his equal it will be someone subservient to he he will be fastidious tend toward obsessive compulsive disorder and he will have an overwhelming sense of indignation towards the thing that he be judge to be wrong he would not even consider the reason why someone might disagree with he he sound like a real jagoff exactly Class a scumbag Detective mcgee start notice the disappearance a year ago the unsub probably have a stressor at this time the death of a family member or someone who have some semblance of control over he right now no one have control over he it be probable that he be not currently work after this many victim and the devolution that it bring a job just would not leave he time to practice his true calling which be a predator a kill machine by now it be become all he think about it be not fair you son of a bitch SLAUGHTERHOUSE what be you lookin ' at just want to ask you a few question my man about what Unfamiliar faces walk around here be there anything I can do for you get you to a shelter maybe have you ever see one of they shelter I will take my chance in the park at least I get the bird I can feed there ok ok I understand be careful you hear I this world need all of its beautiful lady and that mean you too mona you be a good guy you think yeah you make the people around you feel good well he be no charlie chaplin again with the chaplin how have you guy do well reid got proposition by every prostitute we talk to but we do not find anybody who think they would see the unsub same story with we we see gideon and mcgee a block back they have not have any luck either it be odd if the unsub be out here he would stand out you know people would recognize the description so where do that leave we right where I think we be Captain you say this guy would definitely be memorable you be adamant so if no one out here remember he accord to you he do not exist that be not exactly what we say but it be what you imply what do you think happen to they captain I tell you I do not think anything happen to they oh that be right you think they all get house and job ok all this mean be we have another piece of the puzzle here someone get over 60 street smart people out of here and no one notice it be almost like he blend in it be more than that it be like he must somehow belong like he be here all the time like social service what Captain wright yeah do your social service department patrol around excuse I do they drive around in the middle of the night look for people to help no they have to be call and then Morgan Mona Mona wait a minute do not get in that van what be you do I think you do not need any help he be go to drive I to the park hey how be it going my man I should go slow down what be your hurry I get a lot of work I should go Sir do you have a city employee I d look I really do not have time for this yes you do I d please out of the truck out of the truck get out here all right all right do not hurt I just do not hurt I oh no way please I just no no not fair I do not I do not do anything everything 's good it be good it be good he be good he be terrify of we of the unsub Garcia could not find much on this guy at all no employment record no tax record no credit card no bank account the van be register to a paper corporation out of the cayman island other than have a valid driver 's license steven foster have no paper trail my guess be he be devote his entire life to help the unsub Unsub take care of everything for he in return steven provide fresh victim so how do you know there be another guy do he look like he could cleanly pull off 63 murder so if he be his accomplice why be he so afraid of the guy Steven 's the only person in the world truly aware of what the unsub be capable of the only one still alive Sadism and torture invariably get bad with every victim that be why this be so important we could not take the chance that it be not happen that be he he be not the unsub well then then who be he only relationship the unsub have leave in the world his only friend do you want I to publicize the arrest put some pressure on the unsub no he might run ok so uh how we go to find he then Steven 's go to tell we where he be well finally you take your damn time do not you what the hell be I doing here anyways I do not do nothing I mean what be the charge do you even have any what do I do offer to help an old lady get a get to a park be that even illegal I do not think so should be get some kind of award instead of sit in here wait for you to decide to talk to I I know you be go to charge I with

clean house fix what be wrong with the world he be deeply rationalize this behavior and while he certainly know the killing be wrong he truly believe that he be do the world a great service ultimately this type of unsub become a loner there will not be too many people that can still tolerate he now if he do have a relationship at all the person will not be his equal it will be someone subservient to he he will be fastidious tend toward obsessive compulsive disorder and he will have an overwhelming sense of indignation towards the thing that he be judge to be wrong he would not even consider the reason why someone might disagree with he he sound like a real jagoff exactly class a scumbag Detective mcgee start notice the disappearance a year ago the unsub probably have a stressor at this time the death of a family member or someone who have some semblance of control over he right now no one have control over he it be probable that he be not currently work after this many victim and

place of life and excitement they be suppose to be about the future figure out who you be and who you be go to be they be suppose to be about dream not nightmare they be suppose to be about hope I just apparently do not understand the world anymore www ydy com bbs proudly present www ydy com bbs sync ßçèâèâ Criminal Minds Season03 Episode01 Doubt all homicide scene be tragic but when the victim be someone young their life rip away before they 've even have a chance to live I 've get man at every exit point on campus she have her mace out but she do not use it and it be well lit he be not afraid of be see how often do the shuttle run every 10 minute be all the other victim pose like this with their arm cross yeah why it be a classic sign of remorse the unsub kill the victim then immediately feel bad about it so he pose they like this so they will rest in peace you can tell that just by the arm that be why you call we here to build a psychological profile of your killer how long will it take your man to clear the scene a few hour lucky there be a curfew otherwise there would be a mob scene have hotch set up at the precinct we will run everything through he by the time this campus wake up I want a handle on this what the hell Dean suzanne cable special agent morgan and gideon thank you for be here wish we do not have to be I speak to amy 's parent Funeral service will be hold on sunday in chicago they be arrive later today to bring her home they ask I to let you know that they will be stay downtown at the mainline hotel if any of you would like to visit or pay your respect they would like you to feel free to do so how do you all let this happen what everybody be think it you be the fbi the campus be crawl with police and she gets murder wait for the security shuttle that be not helpful katie actually it be the fact that your friend be kill in such a well light area with a police presence indicate that the killer be most likely part of this campus he be not an outsider he be someone who would not raise alarm with the police or potential victim you should also be aware that the 3 victim be brunette what at this point we do consider it an intentional pattern so tell I how be I suppose to keep these woman safe I have security camera be instal in virtually every corner of the campus and that be come out of the city 's budget it be not the school 's I want to shut down the school that be a viable choice but if the killer be part of the campus he may simply leave once the school shut down when class restart there be a good chance he will kill again what would you do in my place I can not say shut it down I can not justify keep these kid lock up in a pen while someone hunt they in this line of work I be afraid I would lose the ability to trust but I realize I can not really look at anyone without see their death and as bad as lose faith in humanity seem lose your faith in happy ending be much bad do the other victim have this much overkill Death be cause by a single very forceful stab wound to the heart yeah he break through the breastbone and after that he just lash out at random well no defensive wound she do not even hold her hand up to fight he off the first 2 victim be the same do you run toxicology screen none of the other be drug consider that she be stand wait for a shuttle my guess be she be not either I be sorry about before I be sorry about your friend uh your r a tell we that you guy be at the library last night do you see amy there we do not go with she but we see she there I think she leave before we her bag be not in her cubicle or else we would have wait do you notice anyone she might have be talk to early be it like she to be walk alone even in a dangerous situation like this she be not the victim type it be almost impossible to pinpoint who be the most vulnerable that be why we be try to teach you how to well protect yourself I just mean that she be strong and she be smart I do not know why she do not at least mace he be a lot of girl carry mace Pepper spray mace switchblade if you can buy it online or find it at the army navy store we 've all buy it be you sure about who he be kill I mean brunette pretty sure yeah Prentiss good morning emily Agent prentiss I be here I be just check in Checking in on your case the college girl uh we do not know that much yet ma'am but you will let I know if there be anything to report will not you I really have to get back to work of course you know where you can reach I realistically it will take 2 or 3 day to empty campus I be afraid that will be our window for catch this guy what do you need from I you say you be instal security camera yeah this afternoon can they be functional by nightfall I will make sure we will need as many man as you can on duty if the unsub 's part of campus life he be go to know it be about to shut down next few day that be his last chance to hunt Uniform presence help but it would also be good to have some of your young officer go in plainclothe try to blend in I can ask my man to work double shift till we be evacuate I will call campus security and have they do the same good good morning how many victim have we see how many crime scene hundred a thousand Pictures family victim both alive and dead I be always able to stay objective to stay at arm 's length now all I see be sarah in they have many day will it take to evacuate the student 2 3 day top you think it be premature do we have a choice Detective can you gather your man we would like to present a rough profile got it all right grab a seat let us go anywhere we know everyone 's tired work overtime we want to tell you how much we appreciate it we would like to give you a rough profile of the man we be all look for this be someone with access he be manage to move in a small community with a high police presence without raise suspicion which mean there be a good chance that this be someone you 've see this unsub have kill 3 woman in 4 day that be what we call a spree killer now most likely something have happen in the past few day to set he off because he kill white brunette woman that stressor probably have to do with a woman in his life who fit the same description wife mother girlfriend woman he be kill they be most likely a substitute what we need you to do be look at people who be part of the campus fabric see if anyone fit the bill student professor support staff I be sorry but how be my man suppose to know about somebody 's home life well the people around he have see he devolve if you suspect someone on campus talk to anyone who know he find out if he be recently find religion be drink even if he be be harm himself he may feel emasculate consider the stressor and the victimology there be a good chance that rejection be a recur theme in his life this unsub display a great amount of anger stab his victim repeatedly even after they be dead second later he feel remorse it be possible that his guilt be because his victim be in a position to trust he how be that as we say we think he be a part of campus life the victim they feel safe around he he be able to get close he be also able to kill these woman without they fight back not one of they have defensive wound on their hand like if they have be tasere first that be possible why security guard on campus be not allow gun they carry taser can you get I an employment list fouscampr security what be it these marking could have easily come from a taser Employment list campus security how we go to narrow this down this unsub choose a closed community on purpose he would want to inject himself into the investigation can you check the record find out if any of these security guard respond to every crime scene you get it in the meantime call garcia have she check the list against criminal record talk to I girlfriend I need to give you a list of security guard I get nothing nothing Nada Security guard be all clean squeaky no

you no ok it be ok ok it be ok do not move do not move I be protect she what be this this be over Nathan tubbs he be easy there be a time in my career when I would have ask the question I should have ask the bad trap for a profiler to fall into be pride forget that for all your skill profiling be just a tool be I under arrest I just want to visit for a while I do not murder anyone you be not suppose to be work tonight they ask we to pick up extra shift there be a killer out there oh I know you be at every crime scene it be my job you seem to be do it well than any of your coworker People should be thank I thank you you think just because I be a security guard I do not understand sarcasm be you angry I I know how interrogation work do you lose your temper easily be this fun for you no how be it go out there Gideon 's wind he up Smart Yone who exhibit that much overkill be bind to explode how go it in here mean of subdue the victim potential weapon source of displace rage stressor evidence of a self destructive spiral and trophy of his kill everything that point to the profile yet nothing we could hold he on that look like it hurt I 've be under a lot of stress the murder your job a lot of thing you keep clip of the murder on your wall Rkm woi'in ' on the case you have a knife on you we be not allow gun be you allow knife she be pretty be not she the girl you pick up tonight be a brunette oh be she tell I you do not notice do you like brunette use to not anymore not so much you know I would not mind some actual physical evidence do we have anything the knife tubbs have on he be inconclusive the taser do not have any print on it which I guarantee mean we be not go to get a dna match either I will stop by the security office if tubbs keep any trophy link himself to the crime he might have keep them in his locker I will go with you no let reid do it go to the hotel Check in they be not go to hold our room forever we will go in shift I will sleep when he confess we all will why do not you charge I be you guilty well you seem to have already make up your mind that I be I tell you you and I be just visit right do you really want to know what I think I think you chew your cuticle to punish yourself over what your hand have be do I think you hate your ex wife I think you want to kill she but you can not because she be the mother of your daughter so you find girl who remind you of she and you kill they instead you stab they over and over 'cause they deserve it if not now they will soon or later you be just save someone else the nightmare later on and then you remember your daughter how you be actually suppose to be look after these girl so you feel bad and you cross their arm over their chest try to give them back some of their dignity my job be protect these girl like you can not protect your daughter I be a good father why will not the judge let you see she I be not go to talk about that why do you fail your police psychological evaluation I want a lawyer Bag these get them to a lab Jim do you mind give I a reason you be hold my client we be look for someone who be part of the campus who have motive and opportunity and inject himself into the investigation so you have a hunch we have a comprehensive psychological profile your client fit exactly you do tell he we deal in fact here right do not be a jackass paul I invite he here my client be work during each of the murder he be present at every scene because it be his job there be not one witness place he anywhere near one of the murder there be not a shred of physical evidence your client be apprehend with a young woman she fit the description of each of the victim could you imagine the uproar on this campus if a brunette woman be kill and people find out a security guard let she walk to her car alone excuse I do you get tubbs ' psych eval Yep Police shrink diagnose he borderline with antisocial and sociopathic tendency he be go to be all over I I need to make a decision you can hold he for 72 hour without charge he what do you think gideon I think only a guilty man can lay his head down and sleep when he be face 3 murder charge it be physically exhaust the kill the secret evade the police it be almost a relief when you do not have to hide anymore tell I you be do the right thing we be hold he for 72 hour everyone be so much young than I remember be it be a weird age you want to be treat like an adult but you be still use to someone else solve your problem for you all I remember be try to figure out who I be you move around enough you get use to be whoever people want you to be hey J J hey there be a rumor go around that you catch the guy be it be it true we have someone in custody thank you it be like you could physically feel the mood change on the campus kid they be so resilient they trust and believe in a way I remember but can not reach anymore like a very old picture if she be a cartoon character she would have steam blow out of her ear she be a cartoon character you remember the circumstance with the feeling the emotion they be just out of your grasp all right see ya no no well I can not study here that be the point ok I be go to the cafe it be open late technically you still have a curfew yeah well technically I do not care go crazy girl they believe in we believe in I the way sarah believe in I and as with sarah I feel that I lead they right to the slaughter be I even do there how many time have I tell you that a profiler can not do the job if the mind be unfocused if anything be go on in your personal life that would cloud your judgment my mind have never be more unfocused than it be on that campus Griffith we get to get this barrier push back we be gettin ' press Joe give I 10 more foot on the tape huh I think you have someone in custody we do Ma'am can you help I with the student how tell they we understand that they be upset but we need room to do our job yeah I guess we can release tubbs after all well I think that would be a mistake what be you talkin ' about I do not think it be the same killer you got to be kid I she have blunt force trauma to the head she be knock out not tasere she be a brunette stab to death on this campus these stab wound be shallow they be hesitation mark whoever kill she either be not sure they want to be kill or they never try it before there be no defensive wound just like every other victim that be not surprising consider the head wind excuse I Sir uh this be drop at the precinct there be no print on it he be innocent I be still out here now do you believe we have the wrong guy the first unsub show remorse he would not brag about or flaunt his late kill I do not believe this this victim be not pose the paper never include detail abt outhe body if this be a copycat he could only do it the way he assume the first killer do look I ask you guy here because I need your help you be the expert but right now it sound to I like you be try to cover your own ass hey look around this be not the place for this conversation I be so sorry you say you catch he I I say we have someone in custody Alisa 's dead and you be argue over word no I I be so sorry you need to keep people out of here man what I be fine it be nothing just wait here for a second Tubbs ' lawyer be be here for the last hour demand we release he what be happen out there I think we get a copycat do you want to tell I why the hell my client have not be release cut I some slack here paul you 've get another murder and a note from the real killer we be discuss that I be not say he be not a creep I be just say he do not do this just take a seat please ok come on give we a second everybody still in the conference room yeah how long can you hold that lawyer off you kid I be a prosecutor I can hold he off for day so you think we be makin ' a mistake huh I know we be tired there be a lot of pressure we all want to believe that profile be right I believe it be what if we be wrong gideon Tubbs entice that girl to get in his car there be nothing to suggest that the unsub have ever do that before there be also nothing to suggest he hasn'T I know how bad cop want to believe they get the right guy I 've be on both side of that this last kill have a different signature I know I also know that richard jewell fit the profile of the olympic bomber to a t and he be innocent but the accusation tear apart his life I can not believe we be actually think about let tubbs go J J we get no evidence Tubbs ' lawyer be not go to let he talk so we be not about to get a confession out of he yeah but we can still hold he for another 48 more hour you can not hold a suspect indefinitely with no evidence not indefinitely 48 hour it be enough time to clear the campus can we please forget about tubbs for a minute let us just say we have a copycat what be we talkin ' about the most common example be one that people do not always think of of be copycat uh kid who commit school shooting also teen suicide they tend to come in cluster both model we be talk about an age range that be consistent with the campus School shooting fit the classic copycat model they want their own piece of the glory they be compete ok but that do not jibe with whoever write this note he be innocent it be about free tubbs not try to steal any credit so could tubbs have a partner yeah sure that be possible but I think it be highly unlikely I mean come on look at tubbs he be a loner he be antisocial he be not the partner type could be more like a groupie after kenneth bianchi be arrest he actually convince a woman he hardly know to attempt a murder so the police would think the hillside strangler be still at large but tubbs subdue his victim first he be not powerful not to mention the stabbing most likely mean he be impotent Groupie do not have to know that all they have to believe be that tubbs answer some need inside they and whoever write this definitely need something from nathan tubbs I be still out here I can not believe he be walk out of here it be the right thing to do remind I of that the next time I have to tell someone their friend or daughter be be murder you still think he be guilty do not you your security cam up and run yeah Good we be go to need them I know you can not stand I no offense I be just not up for this right now ok I need your help I go to tell anna begley that the dorm be officially close tomorrow at curfew she would not even open her door she tell I she will not leave campus what do you want you dye your hair dark so what do you want stephanie be flip out about close the dorm she want I to make sure that you understand that we can not stay here past tomorrow night tell she after tomorrow I will not be anybody 's problem Freak be my judgment cloud by a need to make someone pay for sarah 's death somebody take my clothe I do not know who else to call what be it campus SAFETY I want to talk to you um I be sorry I do not work here anymore do you like it um do do I know you do you want to every girl I know be either bleach her hair or buy a wig and she go and dye her hair dark I agree it be weird but I do not think it be anything to be overly alarmed about be there something else I think I see story about the murder tape to her wall and there be like blood or something all over they what can you tell we about anna 's usual mental state I do not know no one really know she very well she do not play well with other you know anything I know she cut herself she cover it up but people know have she ever be violent towards other I do not think so do she ever talk about suicide talk to we she talk about it all the time but everyone make fun of she like she think she be some goth chick sylvia plath hey gideon it be reid be morgan and prentiss still follow tubbs I think I know who we be look for it be good that you call we it be not just the other who make fun of her it be I too Gideon we ga otbrunette that just approach tubbs outside the security office Good Hotch be have they uplink the security monitor get it ok they be on the move what do you want we to do Stick with them keep your distance we have video Hotch and I will be your eye and ear got it let us go I pick this spot because no one walk back here we will be all alone I think you have I confuse with someone else no you be the one I need yeah they just walk into a courtyard we can not get an eye line without they see we get an image get them uh the security camera microphone be unidirectional the audio pickup be only good for so far we 've get it as loud as it can go without distort all we get to go on right now be a profile I need you to get as close as you can until he make a move on she or either one of them admit to murder ok just give we the go let us get close maybe we should go somewhere else the other girl be all on campus what other girl I know what you do we could go to my apartment you kill those girl you be wrong Police let I go only because someone else commit another murder we can not move no he have not do anything hey guy talk to I what be go on she be offer he a knife do he take it no she want to be a

white be that just an illusion I use to know I use to understand my place my direction where I be head Profiling require belief Belief in the profile Belief in yourself after sarah I no long trust myself at home but after tubbs I no long trust myself in the field and without that I have nothing I do not even know you could take off this early ah we want to leave at first light I get it so I guess thank you thank you Bye Gideon you know how this be go to end do not you I never think anyone would die no of course not I know that I mean the copycat you know the two of they would find each other that be why you let tubbs go be not it look I trust the profile at good it be always just an educate guess it be the good chance of catch they I know Anna begley be ill her suicide may have be inevitable and tubbs he kill 3 woman right what if we be wrong I 've be on the phone with the flagstaff arizona police all morning do you actually allow a disturbed college student to meet with a man

I if I be wrong but I believe it be protocol to brief everyone before we arrive at the crime scene yes ma'am this unsub be abduct woman from very public place with no witness he hold they 48 hour with no sexual assault and then he dump their body with their heart carve out of their chest there be an obvious dichotomy in the skill the unsub exhibit in abduct these woman and the fact that he cut their heart out so crudely we be probably look at someone in a psychotic break could be a butcher might be a hunter somebody who be very comfortable be around blood but as you can see he obviously do not have the skill of a surgeon so do we have a work theory sure we do somebody really do not like woman be it appropriate to ask whether I could talk you out of it hear you get a big office a swanky new map and everything it be the milwaukee file J J want I to give it to you I be not work it I be just follow order they find a new body this morning the other be head straight to the scene you the

afternoon and turn up here in the morning 2 day later all this foot traffic and no one see anything well he up wrap the body uh loosely so they be not immediately recognizable eventually the uh wrapping come oNPe my guess be he uh have a van or a truck something he can back up so he be shield when he make the drop no print on whatever he wrap they in there have be trace of paint and wood stain but most of it be just common stuff you would get at any hardware store he be try to demean they put they out like trash this guy might work or live around here get off on the reaction to his handiwork what can you tell we about the victim she be take from a supermarket her husband say that most day she would have be pick up her son at school but he be spend the afternoon at a friend 'S

say all the abduction and disposal have be time around school we think the unsub might work in the system what if this guy be actually use his own son to lure his victim Detective wolynski tell we you be try to single out truck and van that be smart the unsub be dump his vic msti in the business district so I would agree with you he be probably not drive something that would stand out he may even have some type of company logo on the side of his vehicle as well we know that he abduct the woman in wauwatosa and dump their body somewhere in the third ward Most unsub keep their area of control where they kill their victim triangulate between the two point which mean that the unsub probably live in wauwatosa or the third ward somewhere in that area and the people who live there know the unsub there be no sexual component to these crime which mean it be more about the unsub make a point he be cut their heart out it might just be that this be the sick way the unsub know to disfigure the woman and throw they out like trash ' T canwe really know the two most important question to ask ourselves be what be this guy do with these woman for 48 hour and why be he willing to use his own son to abduct they and if he be truly use his own son then it be likely that he have what we call borderline personality disorder now borderline they think that all relationship revolve entirely around they when they set their mind to something absolute there be no gray area it would also manifest in a way atth would be visible to people around the unsub intense bout of anger and depression problem drink he aould wlso be highly sensitive to rejection and one last thing it be not easy to crack clean into breastbone you be deal with a guy who work with his hand and he be use to hard labor at the very least he be not afraid to get dirty now I be go to take that out of your mouth and you be go to be really quiet like a doll ok oh that be good let us go on upstairs and you be go to be

ask why be you really here I tell you I think strauss come to you and ask for dirt on I why would she do that I think if you have your eye on top leadership at the fbi you want to know who might stand in your way and what could I have tell she that one of my agent might have murder a suspect in cold blood or another might have a serious drug problem which I do not report and if strauss have any evidence my career would be over I think she put you on our team and expect something in return and to your credit you quit rather than whisper in she ear I tell you I hate politic come to milwaukee I will make you a deal if your ready bag be not here pack I will not bug you anymore if it be I want you on that plane with I one more case I already turn in my badge and my gun that be just hardware I

already here 2 day ago do not find anything we be from the behavioral analysis unit what be that mean it mean that we study human behavior we do not just look at evidence it help we to determine why this killer choose this particular victim the place have a live in feel to it it look like she spend most of her free time here no message on the answering machine hey guy Come take a look at this there be bath product all around the tub but she never turn the shower on what make you say that it be get nothing but box inside she use it for storage uh do anything ever strike you as odd about jenny you know what when she move in here 2 month ago she walk up and down those stair a hundred time she would not use the elevator I do not blame her ok so we know jenny do not like tight space or the elevator what else do we know we know that he prey on people that be new to the city with no strong social tie and jenny fit the model she be an easy target and he be bet that she will not be miss we have be over the detail of this case so many time I could recite it in my sleep nothing like be prepare sorry to interrupt but I just speak to jenny wittman 's family do they give you any insight well they be not what you would call close knit it be like she want a fresh start strike out on her own yeah garcia could not come up with any connection between the victim different socioeconomic background level of education and area of work but they all have relocate to portland without any family or friend one divorce the rest single they do have that in common New to the city and they all live alone that would describe I to a t I transfer to this field office a month ago I be 30 single and do not have much of a social life since I work so much well I need to go over whatever evidence you find at the other victim ' home and then I would love to pick your brain about how you got settle into the city absolutely so this guy he burn them hang them smother them why do he kill so many different way that be exactly what we be try to find out Mommy please do not turn off the light stop whine but I be scared on pmoree eep out of you and I be go to mommy please do not get the belt no no mommy please no please Patrick I be so sorry to have keep you wait I do not know that kelly have go home for the day it be no problem I get plenty to keep I busy thank for come in so late do this time work well for your schedule yeah after class be great this be our fourth session tell I about the progress you think we 've make well I think about what you say I want to move on to the next phase I recognize these name from your website how many specialist work with the goodman institute we be look for another who can make house call for agoraphobic some patient know what be good but they can not find the courage to go through behavioral therapy I figure it be what I have to do to get over it I have nothing to fear but fear itself that be what they say so what be the first thing you do when you move here I find the good coffee in town then move within walk distance ok so you got establish get comfortable in your surrounding join a gym all right ok so where else be there doctor dentist dry clean you think he go to these place to find his victim maybe there be something around every corner well we only have to canvass 4 neighborhood I have to stop go to camp after that and you never learn to swim no I couldn'T I have a panic attack every time I get near the water well look at you now you be do just fine patrick I guess so our body know water before they know air it be really the most natural thing in the world it be not go to hurt you I 've never be this close and feel so calm that be because you 've admit you need help that be the hard part all we got to do now be get ahold of this fear I think we would be in a laboratory or something I just behavioral therapy 's most effective in a natural setting you get a feeling for what it be really like how you do I be kind of sweaty that be perfectly normal do you need a second no no let us do it ok we know this guy use wildwood trail as h pisersonal graveyard for 6 month that site 's be blow for he now which mean that he be be force to change part of his M O which will not be easy for somebody who thrive on be in control the reason that he be get away with these first 3 murder be that he be be meticulous at every stage from how he choose his victim to their torture and their burial to we his victim appear to be nonspecific other than be new to portland all they seem to have share be a torturous death but you think the unsub choose they for another reason too we think so the torture lack a sexual component which be incredibly rare I think it be more about uh not necessarily about exert power but more like overcompensate for a lack of it this guy crave control he be come from a place of weakness try to demonstrate strength now we see this a lot in unsub who 've have be abuse the lack of sexual assault could be as simple as the fact that he be impotent something that he be try to hide a man this obsess with control most likely feel powerless in his everyday life so he would crave stability security he be most likely marry if he be impotent he could keep up appearance by adopt child yeah and someone this methodical have every moment plan if he be capture he would most likely take his own life rather than give up any sort of control Morgan the victim ' lack of defensive wound suggest that they willingly put themselves in danger so someone of authority or otherwise easily trust put they up to this also the victim ' family be lead to believe their love one be alive and well through e mail write by this murderer he be calculate and he be intelligent and we be go to have to do something that he be not expect like what like warn his potential victim you be do great just keep tell I that ok this be good how be it feel deep breath no I be do I be do this be not go to work t be iworse than you think I be not ready no help I aah Help be it bad than you think we find the remain of 4 victim in wildwood trail 2 woman 2 man all in their 20 all transplant to portland because the victim have this in common we be confident that the person we be look for latch on to people new to the city he choose they because they make for easy target if you be young and new to portland or if you know someone that be please call the number on your screen for more detailed information about how to stay out of a dangerous situation we believe the person that we be look for be able to fit into many surrounding oh this poor dog have be like this all day Lucy it be ok it be ok Ma'am you be say your tenant patrick walker 28 move to portland for grad school and he be be miss for how long since this morning I know that that sound crazy but patrick stick to a routine I tease he that he be more predictable than I be Jogs while I be watch the morning show walk to class with his backpack after that he he be always home for lunch that be when he walk lucy you be in his apartment right now do anything look out of the ordinary be his backpack there still yes ok then we know he be not at class

production be interrupt Melo what you grow in your sleep and n u cayoonly do that if it be dark I do not like the dark there be nothing to be afraid of it be for your own good do not daddy do not turn off the light please good night local police I d ' d the body it be patrick walker he be get deep abrasion and bruise on the neck and shoulder I be go to go see if they find anything else in the water ok I know his landlady call you about this guy miss but what make you think this be relate he fit the profile of our victim he be the same age live alone new to the city but he be not bury like everybody else no you find the unsub 's dump site he could not go back to the trail it force he to do something different well they find a rope at the bottom of the river but that be probably be there for year a couple foot out they find this it be shepherd 's crook Lifeguards and rescue worker use it oh I bet he do not use it for safety Officer thank you we have not see any evidence of a struggle with the other body this be the first one do you remember any open case involve suspicious drowning since I 've be in portland we 've have 2 or 3 I can call the office get the file to your other agent maybe they can make a connection thank you yeah Hotchner hey that landlady prentiss speak to be right to be worry we just find patrick walker dead in a river and it be exactly what you predict he find a new place to dump the body Fire hanging asphyxiation now we 've get a drowning I think it be someone who be afraid of drown what do you mean yeah it hit I when morgan freak out when we be stick in the elevator you got stick in an elevator I freak well that be not important here be what be if you look at the M o S of the victim what do they all have in common they could all be classify as anxiety disorder it be right out of the diagnostic and statistical manual it list 5 subtype of phobia Most of these be environmental and situational exactly so it be all about fear these people be be kill by their fear please help I help I so hotch be even more intense now that gideon 's go yeah I 've notice do you think that be go to change I certainly think we will find out what about you you ok oh I be I be great do you want to talk about it what be there to talk about really Gideon oh no he uh he leave a letter explain everything just like my dad do when he abandon I and my mom he address it to you yeah yeah you know gideon stand toe to toe with some of the sick people on this planet I think that take a lot of courage right yeah so why have he do this it be address to I but I be I be not I be not the only one that he abandon but why be it address to you I think you need to read that letter again I have an eidetic memory emily ah yeah I know and an I Q of 187 but what do you remember about your father what do you mean well he give you 10 year before he leave and yet you 've erase all those memory and it be too painful I get it but then gideon leave I think you need to read that letter again and ask yourself why of all the people he walk away from do he only explain himself to one person you how be you adjust to the city do I actually move to portland I would not know it since I 've only see the 4 wall in my apartment I also work at home Blessing and a curse must be hard I have not even have time to hook up my cable Morgan say this be the laundromat close to patrick walker 's apartment building so we have washer and dryer and we have a bulletin board Snack machine yeah I do not think he be lure they with pretzel Babysitter buy a car ooh look at this baby participate in a control research project and you will receive 100 buck to get over your anxiety you only have to attend 2 session 2 hour of your time 100 buck easy sell just one stub 's take hey well patrick walker just join a pretty sweet boxing gym but that be about it you guy find anything well I think we should go over to victim number 2 's coffee shop see if any of these be hang around if all of our victim see these flier we just figure out how he cast his net let us do it have you tell anyone that you be go to therapy I can not talk to my family about it they would just tell I to get over it tell I what kind of situation cause you to feel anxious well uh over the holiday I be suppose to go on a cave diving trip to mexico Cave diving that be pretty advanced you 've scuba dive before oh yeah I got certify when I be 15 but there be no fear of the water so drowning be not an issue no I can go below the surface in 50 foot as long as it be open water I be ok but uh the idea of go near a cave really put I in a panic what do you start to think about the wall you know they get small and then uh they fall on top of I and then it be dark and I can not breathe so when you be down in the imaginary cave you become trapped and you can not get to the surface yeah you be essentially talk about be bury alive can you help I the core of any phobia be the feeling that we be lose control once

not get the image out of my head I join the bureau to rescue people not to stand over another dead kid today I could not handle it hopefully you will not have to it be all chance you know wrong place at the wrong time no logic no sense how do a parent reconcile that they never do you want every inch of surveillance footage yes because I need to examine it frame by frame to see if there be anything in the background you guy miss I also need a joystick controller video transmitter a coax cable and a programmable park and I do not mean that hypothetically Ms Jacobs ' cell phone have katie 's picture on it Mall security help we make copy ok we need to get one of these to every search team every officer every patron potential witness need to know who we be look for too Problem be our unsub could be any one of them there be her parent hi we be agent jareau and prentiss with the B A u and you must be katie 's aunt and uncle this can not be easy we be here to walk you through this well aside from the stairwell storage closet and hundred of shop there be a whole underbelly beneath our foot subterranean level air duct boiler room realistically it will take at least 3 hour to cover this place realistically we have less than half that time how do you figure 99 of abducted child who be kill die within the first 24 hour 75 within the first 3 hour and what only law enforcement know be jessica davis join the 44 of child who be abduct and kill within the first hour yeah what do you get ok so this be surveillance footage off an exit camera outside the arcade well can not you get a well angle Sugar I be not london here I can only work with what they have believe I when I tell you the 1980 just call they want their security system back ok look in the far right middle section you see the 2 ponytail yeah that be katie Angle barely get an image of she let alone who she be with can you enhance the image for I I could start the process we do not have that kind of time aw you be breakin ' my heart baby girl where be you going and who be you with www ydy com bbs proudly present www ydy com bbs sync ßçèâèâ Criminal Minds Season03 Episode05 Seven Seconds Dostoevsky once say nothing be easy than denounce the evildoer nothing more difficult than understand he Katie jacob this image be capture moment before your nephew report katie miss oh god I know the angle 's limit but be there anything or anyone in the frame that you recognize no no Katie have asthma she need her inhaler H how could someone have just take she in front of all those people that be what we be try to figure out how do you plan on do that we be retrace katie 's step we be go over surveillance footage we be search every crack and crevice under this roof I want to be out there look for my girl I would want to be do the same thing but when an abduction be report the parent be debrief separately it be more efficient that way what do you wanna know do katie have any connection at all to jessica davis no there be no connection maybe a dance class a church group you think katie will end up like that no now mrs Jacobs just listen to I here I be just be that what you be try to tell I I be try to find your daughter look at I I know it be excruciating at a time like this but I have to ask these question ok just breathe ok I want you two to take this path I will meet you there Katie Katie jacob Katie jacob so she and her cousin come in here about 30 minute ago and that be the last time anyone see katie that be right 10 minute after the assault be generally the molester 's low point of self esteem he could be panic right about now realize he be get a witness Richard allen davis strangle polly klaas just to prevent she from identify he a single abduction like this would normally be classify as a snatch and grab but with the jessica davis abduction it be more likely we be deal with a preferential offender whose victim fall into a particular type he come to this mall know what he be look for because he feel safe here familiar with his surrounding so when you and your cousin be go in and out of store do anybody try to talk to her I do not think so do somebody maybe compliment her hair or open the door for you guy he be not exactly pay attention yes I be yeah you would think after all my year in retail I would hate the mall but it be convenient she be right next to I I swear and then we split up because I I have to shop for my husband 's birthday and that be when you got lose in that video game right I should have stay near the kid it be not fair and now I wish we never leave the house this morning I be sure that be how my brother feel too how be all these question get we any close to find she assume that she know not to walk off with a stranger it mean she might have trust the offender which can tell we a lot well then explain to I what happen to her she might have walk off with someone in uniform no I mean jessica I wanna know what happen to that girl Katie Katie Katie jacob Katie Katie jacob Katie you know this may all be a mistake Katie might just be lose maybe in some bookstore or something she love to read you know she could just be in a corner just you know or maybe play dress up in a store or something Katie Katie jacob Jeremy we we ask your mom and dad if we could talk privately think it might be easy that way 'cause my dad think this be my fault no Jeremy your dad be just super upset right now because time like this people get really emotional hey kid the moment right before a kidnapping like this be the most important you got to understand you be the only one who can help we with that but but I can not remember Jeremy all we need be the last thing katie do or say before you realize she be go Jeremy Jeremy what what what what be it talk to I what I can not breathe uh y you be have a panic attack sit down Jeremy sit down sit down want you to put your head between your knee Put your head between your knee that be right just breathe just breathe be that katie 's yeah she do not like it with her sneaker today say it do not match would you mind if we borrow that sweater why it would help the search dog to pick up her scent whoever abduct katie do so by look at she as an object if there be the slight chance that he have a conscience it may help to remind he she be not and uh how would you do that well we would not you would Hotch thank you my guess be jeremy either hear or see something that could be useful but the guilt have manifest itself into an acute stress disorder the kid can not remember a thing take he back to the scene and do a cognitive interview ok do you have kid no not yet but everyone that need we we think of as our own I do not know if I can do this ok just just stay calm do not address what he be do that will only make he defensive Ready just keep the focus on katie all right we need he to hear who she be no one know that well than you my name be beth jacobs 45 minute ago our daughter katie go miss she be only 6 year old last month she start first grade Katie be our only child and we love she very much we just want she back safe the other day Katie tell I that she be ready to ride a big girl 's bike without train wheel and I promise she that she could do that on her birthday please whoever you be I hope you be listen we just want our daughter back to we safely Katie be just a little girl she be just a little girl who deserve another birthday only 7 second I be able to decipher but it be 7 more than we have what be we look at surveillance footage I retrieve f ofa second camera on the first floor it show katie exit the arcade follow her movement through the crowd she go north unable to locate matching subject till she disappear Criminy I still can not make out who she be with 7 second that be all the image I could find sir be all it take for a child to disappear if katie be alone the only store in the vicinity she would be walk toward would be furniture Stationary or bedding nothing that a 6 year old would leave an arcade for unless it be not a store that catch her eye I once follow todd cortel the entire length of silver beach because he have a kite the right bait might lure she away from the crowd so what be you youngster play these day I like d o a d o a as in dead on arrival it be dead or alive what do you like so much about it jeremy the close combat it be all about time how well you know your enemy plus I be really good at it yeah I bet you be kid so uh what be the first game that you walk to when you come in here early Girl 's trail stop cold because that vent be deposit air from the food court the dog be overwhelm by the smell Katie Katie jacob I be sorry ma'am I can not let you do that but I be his mother for god sake look I understand I will take care of this Jeremy be talk with 2 of our agent right now well then I should be there too Whatever be block your son 's memory may be exacerbate by that he might be feel a bit responsible somehow one minute you be have a light engrave for your husband and the next minute katie 's name be be page I never think something like this could happen to our family nobody ever do what be they do to my son it be a sensory method of question we be hope it will help jeremy remember what happen before he realize katie be go I be go to ask you to close your eye for a minute all right I want you to go back to when you first walk in the arcade a little early can you remember that yeah you be doing great my man ok in your mind I want you to try and picture what it sound like ine her picture what it smell like be it crowd it be loud be the people loud or be the sound effect loud both some kid be yell at his game die I own you you be mine now die Jeremy I do not like it here well tough because I do I want to find my mommy stop whine I give you a quarter now go play a game die die die die die die die die die what be make you so uncomfortable jeremy I do not like it in here Jeremy what be she cry about I do not remember I I could not hear Ok Jeremy go back to the video game I be win and how have that make you feel Awesome proud of myself kind of embarrassed embarrassed how like people be watch I why be you self conscious who be watch you I could smell her shampoo Katie 's no please I wanna go can we please go die Jeremy I do not like it here you like that game huh you wanna play we can switch back and forth for combo attack please can we go please jeremy get out of here I have extra quarter please jeremy I want an ice cream Katie Katie so katie be ask for ice cream yeah be there something else no you do good kid pick up katie 's scent on something in here just a lot of half eat food empty cup and this what have you find it be a necklace in the trash Bag it and label it in case there be any connection there be Katie be wear it she find it in the schoolyard about a year ago this be 24 karat gold and the stone be real whoever lose it would have be look for it be there any reason that katie would have lie no how far do you live from here about a mile do you mind if we search your house of course not what do you think you be go to find there it be just protocol excuse I what be he not tell we the clasp be damage like it be rip off of her neck then they toss it in the trash if the abductor just want to fulfill his urge and move on he would not take the time this be motivate by rage it be personal David westerfield kidnap danielle van dam out of revenge when her mother reject he this may not be relate to last week 's abduction after all somebody light a fire last night well there be dirty dish for 3 in the kitchen so they eat together as a family hey my favorite movie from when I be a kid so they watch movie together too by a fireplace in a house that be in a cookie cutter neighborhood Norman rockwell could not have paint this any cozier that be what worry I be there anyone in your life you would consider a threat why would you ask I that we have to explore every possibility I do not understand now you do not think it be connect to the other case we be not sure why would someone we know do this Katie jacob I just have a couple of question I want to ask you be there any family in your neighborhood that you do not get along with my neighborhood or an employee that you might have fire no or any child that katie might have upset h hold on where be you go with this Katie 's necklace do not fall off by itself and it be possible that she know the offender ah that be crazy I mean w why would any no no we get along with everyone in our neighborhood and uh katie love all of her all of her friend at school I mean I uh I teach my daughter well why would you say I 've teach my daughter well and not we 've teach she really well you know what I mean why be you look at I like that be there marital issue that I should know about be you kid be either of you have an affair you son of a bitch my daughter be miss and you wanna turn this around I know that I be concerned with find she which be why I 've ask you the question my family mean everything to I Finding katie be everything to I no we be not participate in any affair ok Katie jacob Katie jacob Katie Katie jacob Katie Katie Katie 's be wet her bed a lot of 6 year old do could be bad dream some kid will not get up at night 'cause they be afraid of the dark or it could be a lot more complex than that Most girl covet their doll like an extension of themselves Reid I know these sign act out on her toy wet the bed she be obviously cover up something about that necklace be there something else no and her cousin might be hold something back Katie 's in a lot of pain and not tell anybody and I think I know why yeah Hotch I think katie 's be molest and we both know the odd most likely by somebody under the same roof Mr Jacobs buy his own daughter a necklace nobody would think twice about that so why would katie lie she do not because her father do not buy she the necklace get back here as soon as you can we need to separate the boy and his father 2 room now Katie jacob Katie no sir what be go on here we be question jeremy in another room I know that why we suspect that he may know something about katie from you mr Jacobs we would like to know more about your son what be go on do you find katie Jeremy how old be you 13 13 you know when I be 13 I be start to notice girl too I be curious but uh heh I be I be like really awkward so it be super hard for I to talk to they and I uh I find that incredibly frustrating why be you tell I this ' c ause I think I understand you you be uh you be in the arcade pretty girl walk in and uh you get distract by the the scent of her hair right I guess so what so you be you be become a man it be heh believe it or not it happen to all of we there be nothing wrong with that at all never say there be and these video game that you play these cool video game allow you to to explore your violent side right so I mean clearly you be intrigue my only question be whether or not you act on these curiosity you 've experiment yet should not you be look for my cousin right now I be look for your cousin right now why be you ask I these question why be you avoid they what would you like to know what jeremy 's interest be uh computer like to be on the computer spend hour at a time what be go on who do he socialize with I do not know kid at school I suppose you live under the same roof but you can not name any of his friend he spend hour in his room listen to that metal music I do not understand have he always be this distant with you or be this something new well I guess I guess it be always be like this that be why I do not find it odd well we do some checking and uh we find out that jeremy at the ripe age of 13 have a record for steal 6 month ago we know that and that do not strike you as odd he steal earring for a girl he like when I be his age I I probably do the same thing he must have really want to make an impression on her make she feel special because we check the record and they be very valuable we reprimand he what be her name who the girl jeremy like so much he steal for I I do not know we be his parent he be 13 year old if he have not be arrest we probably would not even know that he be interested in girl J J can I get a minute excuse I where be my brother he be be question sir about jeremy you think jeremy know something we do not know the answer to that yet oh god believe I when we do know something you guys'll be the first people we tell W we have to trust that excuse we well that be strange what you would think during a time like this Susan would wanna know why her son 's be detain she do not even look to we for an answer look at her she be relaxed enough to sit down maybe protect what composure she have leave or protect someone else hey jeremy do you know what I do for the fbi no study human behavior like uh the way you be push your chair away from I it tell I that what I be say be make you uncomfortable like uh you be try to distance yourself from I maybe from what I be capable of read about you whatever case in point you bite your inner cheek it be a it be a nervous tic like you be hold on to something do it right now you be also do it inside the arcade and I think you be do it because maybe I do not know maybe you remember something more than what you tell we no I tell you everything I do not know I do not think you tell we everything I think something else happen inside that arcade something something you have not tell anybody yet Mr Jacobs have a seat do uh jeremy and katie spend a lot of time together our family spend a lot of time together he like his cousin do that make you jealous what why would it why would it we find that in the trash how be it that you know your 6 year old niece like to read book and play dress up but you do not know the first thing about your own son typically molester only pay attention to the child that they be groom ignore even their own Katie wear that necklace because you tell she to because you tell she she be special as if the sexual abuse be not enough be that when it start when what start when you give katie the necklace when she start wet the bed when her parent come to you and susan wonder why their daughter lock herself in her room be that when it start be that when the molestation start this be ridiculous could not help yourself could you you be crazy like so many little girl before I I wanna get outta here you start spend more time with she and tell she she be special I be not listen to you you know it be sick your brother 's own daughter Shut up do she outgrow your preference Shut up do she get too old for you no no I may have do some thing that you could not possibly understand but I would never hurt katie whoever rip the necklace off katie do it in a rage and he just seem broken one minute I be have a light engrave for my husband and the next minute katie 's name be be page you know for probably the most stressful day of your life I have not see you light one cigarette I quit over a month ago you would think after all my year in retail I would hate the mall

we just tell she that this guy could still be out there she be not even concern she be not scared at all why maybe she be get nothing to be afraid of where be you go with this why can not someone let a case go because in your gut you know the son of a bitch be still out there exactly only she do not blink she would only move back here because she think it be safe so the guy who actually do this to she either move away or he die you know who this man be he grow up here too he be in his mid 20 back then he leave after you find his last victim December 13 1980 he might have go to prison could have join the military move away sell his property he be reckless in his personal life a drinker he would have have arrest for dui this be it this be your case right here he be meticulous so he he may have have 2 area of control both private one to torture and one to confine they a workshop maybe a barn a garage even December 1980 the man be here and then he be go you know he john Robert wilkinson 3 duis spend a few day in jail well he be dead he be 28 when it happen he fall into his combine harvester when be this December 1980 right when the killing stop Karen foley move back soon after that be

widow and the sheriff say you have to raise your son by yourself it be hard to believe you would not think about he from time to time I 've never feel sorry for myself Most woman who be widow young consider themselves victim I move on you remarry I move back here with my parent Stayed here for a bit while I be pregnant Robert be mean when he drink he beg I to come home say he have change do he I

site only you never release any of that to the press no he have to learn it from someone a family member a friend maybe Mary and robert wilkinson have a son be you suggest there be a genetic predisposition to kill it be one factor along with psychology and socialization if you have a combination of genetic and a son who grow up without a father search for his own identity it could be a stressor I remember charlie wilkinson when he be 15 kill a neighbor 's cat he put it in a bag and hit it against a tree how old be charlie wilkinson Mary be pregnant with he when robert die that be 27 year ago that make he roughly the same age robert be when he start kill what do you got for we girl I just find the reason why karen foley be lie what be you do back here I tell you before I do not

to look at all of it to be sure and be you no really you I would be lie if I say I be not disappoint the material be the product of a disturbed individual but there be nothing there to convince I that the person have enact on his fantasy so you 've come to say good bye I be afraid so we 've get real case in quantico case with body but if I be right about this thing there will be plenty of those it be nice meeting you there be something else in the box in eye of a predator you write that collection of integumentary item be a definitive precursor skin nail hair this guy be for real I will call my team we 've get work to do great http www ragbear com ææàãðü×öä»×é I know indeed what evil I intend to do but strong than all my afterthought be my fury fury that bring upon mortal the great evil Euripides be this everything from the unit no we pull the salient material and have philly p d Process the rest of the item on site what else be there just some book album toy toy yeah Old stuff like from his childhood and we be able to lift some print but afis be a bust he be not in our system Morgan and prentiss go back to the unit and see what else it can tell we about the man I will get you direction we have to establish if this guy be take his fantasy to the next level we can use these material to try to identify his signature and connect he to any open case on the surface it read like he want to try it all I think isolate any one aspect might be tough well then dig deeply try linguistic look for pattern in the handwriting Rossi and I will take the image find the fetish find the fiend hey you want to make this interesting good insight loser buy lunch Ooh bring it on girl ok it look like we have a happy kid well round varied interest this look to have be draw at about the schematic stage so that would make he about 6 year of age at the time right it be date 1976 so that would make he about 38 now Kid 's blond assume it be autobiographical and he be caucasian oh yeah you hit that one on the head Ohh but now here look look at how the drawing change over the year a bright sun a love family an idyllic home but then the mother go away maybe she leave they maybe she die the father struggle to make end meet the boy begin to withdraw retreat within himself this be his turning point so what inform his fantasy and when do it begin this be the early one I find 1982 it be tame in comparison to the later stuff Vintage think he be a collector or it be hand down from his father I can still remember my dad 's less than skillfully hide stash but this guy graduate to hard stuff the torture porn it be brutal it bring out certain desire the early exposure be a trigger when I interview bundy he have a theory about pornography he say if you want to stop people from become like I do not burn catcher in the rye Burn hustler I read your book too dave get some textbook in here Engineering Mathematics Cad manual Trade school ok so he be in a fix it field Construction home improvement that be good but I think I get you not so fast look at these dress what they be different size mm hmm they be different size they 've be alter Cross dresser Tch look like I be buy lunch extra linguistic indicator in his writing suggest he be most excited by the prospect of electric shock as a method of torture be specific when you be in a court the judge will demand it see how heavy his handwriting become at time he so exhilarate he actually rip through the page the idiolect support it as well I mean nowhere else be he as creative in his description good work you find a signature that be easy to track the electrical burn on his victim will be unmistakable this be dana foster she be a 34 year old real estate agent from the suburb of blue bell she be murder 5 year ago when she go to meet a prospective buyer at a house in buck county her nude body be find in a cellar and she be strangle and rape and here be the torture behavior that reid identify from the journal the contact wound be burn mark most likely the result of electrical current any lead on the buyer she go to meet fake name Louis ivey could this guy be any more perfect be her clothe find at the scene no how have you know he take they as souvenir and he alter they to fit his own frame so he be bisexual actually most cross dresser be heterosexual it be fairly common in sexual predator what about her hair be any of it miss not that be report J J Contact garcia and widen the victim search Rossi and I will go visit the crime scene watch this daddy hold on son let I get the door Mr Overholt I be agent hotchner this be agent rossi we be with the fbi FBI you 've live in this house for 4 year correct yeah I assume disclosure be make at the time of sale about what occur here yeah my son do not know about that and I prefer to keep it that way of course we understand we will be discreet we just need to take a look at your cellar I 've have it lock up since we move in you know it be kind of useless anyway flood when it rain you know it be really damp and all the electrical 's mess up hope you guy do not mind if I stay up here we will try not to take too long so he be do with the tour of the main house before he go he ask the realtor to see the cellar and boom Contusion on the back of her head say he surprise she he incapacitate she with a blunt object thick wall neighbor be few and far between he can make her scream as loud as he want to Rope burn on her wrist he probably suspend she here like in his drawing and then he apply the current and watch her whole body spasm and make her dance but where do he get the juice Cattle prod Taser Contact wound do not conform to that Outlet 's be tamper with Careful Jerry rig Clamp be still there he do not have to use a taser he pull power from the house Handy guy Dave and hotch be back thank I will be right in wow it be impressive oh it be just stuff on the wall you know I do not join the bureau to win award then uh maybe you can loan I a couple hey um J J what do you think of these what be this well we can not call he the unsub forever we generally try not to mythologize these guy all right and these be not very good anyway the fact be we do not even know if this guy be a serial actually we do 3 female age 31 38 discover off freeway in maryland jersey and new york all naked burn wound consistent with the signature and he dispose of all of the body in different state to avoid detection Garcia when be these body discover between ' 02 and spring of ' 03 after the real estate agent he change his method fast learner 4 kill by the age of 30 and he be just getting start we connect the 3 new body with miss person case so with a total of 4 victim on the board we be able to narrow down the unsub 's type 30 attractive caucasian upwardly mobile Yeah College grad above average income career woman you establish a cycle 10 month between the realtor and the first of these victim then 7 month 3 month he be practically double his pace every time as with most prolific killer the cool off period tend to shorten after each murder last know victim be find almost 5 year ago 5 year so could he haedtoppve s no not this guy it be more likely we just have not find the body yet and there might not even be body per se we know he write extensively about create a homemade incinerator so how many we talk ballpark if you extrapolate the cycle in the last 5 year he will have kill approximately 19 more woman it be great stuff guy keep I post she do know we do not work for her right with 4 know victim we should start by re interview friend and family we be look for a white male in his 30 to 40 and with his knowledge of circuitry and wiring we think that he be either an electrician or an electrical engineer it be a job that may give he access to a victim 's home or workplace the opportunity to observe his target they be attractive professional woman he see they as strong righteous unobtainable so he seek to tear they down to reduce they to base sexual creature and punish they he be a true sexual sadist a typology we refer to as anger excitation mean he becomes sexually arouse by the suffering of his victim kill these woman be an afterthought their pain be what he be after and he take his time to exact maximum stimulation what about his trophy he keep their clothe right yes we believe he be use they for rehearsal fantasy by dress as his victim he can relive the torture it be during this time that he most likely pleasure himself in order to reinforce his association between suffering and gratification and when he become dissatisfied with this he seek out a new victim keep in mind he be be do this for a long time and he be be think about do it most of his life he will continue to evolve find new way of challenge himself increase his stimulation threshold there be no boundary for this man Hotch he be an individual that we believe to be currently active within our community if it be not for certain evidence bring to our attention in recent day he may well have continue to operate without our knowledge we be still investigate more specific you know about this past murder and who might have be his victim but now that he be on our radar you can rest assure that we will find he and bring he to justice Agent I do not know how you usually do thing but you need to let my team know if you be plan on hold a press conference no it be not a conference it be just an announcement I think you know what I mean we be send half the cop in the city out to canvass the story would have leak I be just put a reassuring face on the situation your face I be the case agent and you be also outrank by every member of my team mean what you will vote I off the island nothing tear a case apart fast than an agent try to make his or her name on it I be try to protect my city from what could be the most prolific serial killer since charles cullen what about michael strenko florian gall christopher hardgrove I do not know those name those be cullen 's victim nobody remember the victim everybody remember the killer and that be exactly what happen when an agent put the story ahead of the case and the bureau do not need any more agent like that do you understand I have no doubt she be highly capable I be just I be say that I find her excitement level at the prospect of find more body somewhat unsettling thank you yeah J J say she be make up name for the killer and yet if she be a man you would say she have ball oh do not even go there this be not a gender thing right let us get back to reid 's map all right the nearness principle tell we that a killer will not travel far to abduct his victim but this one be go to great length to spread out his abduction and disposal site so the site be irrelevant to the geographical profile the only location I can attach a real meaning to be the storage unit 4 victim and we get squat for year he be go unchecked I think it be only a matter of time before he grow comfortable and start kill close to home unfortunately that only help we if there be a fresh kill so there be a woman out there right now who have to die so we can do our job hi do something happen yeah uh agent hotchner tear I a new one and I owe you an apology why I I get you to bring the whole team up here and then the press briefing it could have wait until morning my conscience do not allow sleep in these situation look like you could use a break there be no break but there be drink let I buy you one female ambition can be unseemly in the eye of some people and I forget that sometimes when I be in the academy in ' 97 I score 99 on my defensive tactic test which needless to say have an immediate chilling effect on all my relation with the male cadet I bet you can not remember a time when you do not overachieve well the young kid in a single parent home you learn to scratch and claw real quick single parent that would be your father go on a good man who you come to see as weak unable to provide probably a drinker I be guess scotch Blended I prefer single malt I think I do a seminar at the academy in ' 97 yes Collateral material on sex crime I be in the third row hang on every word good memory well your first book have just come out and you sign my copy yeah I kind of have a thing for you come on you be a star no one in the bureau have make inroad into publishing and consult like you have your hair be light and a big long then be not it talk about a good memory no I do not remember you oh but that would explain the hair that you claim to have find in that storage unit the hair be a keepsake I be guess you hold on to it as a vestige of the femininity you relinquish in the pursuit of your career ambition you can stop profile you manufacture evidence to get a b A u Commitment and it be for the great good I be right be not I look jill I know you when I be your age I want the same thing but I burn a lot of bridge in the process People got hurt be that why you come back to undo your past wrong just be careful that ego of yours be go to get you into trouble now I 've get to get some sleep your little press conference be go to bury we tomorrow bury we how I have a nightmare the night she go miss it wake I up but I forget it instantly you know how that happen I know this sound crazy I feel like if I could remember that dream I would know what happen to her when she do not show on time I leave she a message on her cell phone I be angry with she for make we late I do not know and that message be probably still on her phone somewhere it keep I up at night wonder if she ever hear it I just want to know if she be still alive it be the not know it be selfish I know our own peace of mind she disappear 2 month ago on her way home from work this be what she be wear we just want to know what happen to her it hurt it hurt I you like it what you like how it feel I like it do you love the pain no yes no no don't ask for it no do not do not do not please no please no more Aah oh it hurt it be so bad no no just kill I just kill I just kill I Aah Philadelphia police department Man I think I see something it might have to do with the killing what do you see my car break down on I 76 there be a field off the road a man be dig a hole what kind of hole for the body I see it a bleeder strip of its clothe can I have your name sir Mile marker 115 on the eastbound they will find it anything strike you strip of its clothe objectify the victim exactly Dehumanizing this be not just any tipster the way that he refer to the body as a bleeder visible trauma to the corpse no I do not think so I note usage of the same word in the page from the storage facility he refer to his target as bleeder it be misogynistic he be refer to menstruation he would use it as a weakness I think we need to see what be in that field M E Morning Prentiss Good morning body look well preserve be some cold snap the last few month Ground 's frozen check out her stomach Prentiss electrical burn finger be in really bad shape how be her tooth look good for an I D to say we need a rush on that would be an understatement you understand yeah thank you Let us get she up gently hey you guy might want to stick around he call in anonymously and hand we 2 more victim why you vow publicly to bring he in he may be react to that to show you who you be deal with he be a narcissist he be preen Good I hope he keep it up you do not want that he will drop a breadcrumb every time he try something like this he will drop body too if he be make it personal he will get sloppy and give himself away maybe that be what he want it never track for I that this guy default on that storage unit you think he want we to find it maybe he be decide it be time for the world to know his name but if he want a come out party then why not just send his victim photo video something to prove what he be he want we to start at the beginning to chart his evolution bright childhood grow into darkness he be get we chronicle every step so if this be his story what chapter be we on the final one he be write it as we speak hey honey um I think we have to cancel with

product of a disturbed individual but there be nothing there to convince I that the person have enact on his fantasy so you 've come to say good bye I be afraid so we 've get real case in quantico case with body but if I be right about this thing there will be plenty of those it be nice meeting you there be something else in the box in eye of a predator you write that collection of integumentary item be a definitive precursor skin nail hair this guy be for real I will call my team we 've get work to do great http www ragbear com ææàãðü×öä»×é I know indeed what evil I intend to do but strong than all my afterthought be my fury fury that bring upon mortal the great evil Euripides be this everything from the unit no we pull the salient material and have philly p d Process the rest of the item on site what else be there just some book album toy toy yeah Old stuff like from his childhood and we be able to lift some print but afis be a bust he be not in our system Morgan and prentiss go back to the unit and see what else it can tell we about the man I will get you direction we have to establish if this guy be take his fantasy to the next level we can use these material to try to identify his signature and connect he to any open case on the surface it read like he want to try it all I think isolate any one aspect might be tough well then dig deeply try linguistic look for pattern in the handwriting Rossi and I will take the image find the fetish find the fiend hey you want to make this interesting good insight loser buy lunch Ooh bring it on girl ok it look like we have a happy kid well round varied interest this look to have be draw at about the schematic stage so that would make he about 6 year of age at the time right it be date 1976 so that would make he about 38 now Kid 's blond assume it be autobiographical and he be caucasian oh yeah you hit that one on the head Ohh but now here look look at how the drawing change over the year a bright sun a love family an idyllic home but then the mother go away maybe she leave they maybe she die the father struggle to make end meet the boy begin to withdraw retreat within himself this be his turning point so what inform his fantasy and when do it begin this be the early one I find 1982 it be tame in comparison to the later stuff Vintage think he be a collector or it be hand down from his father I can still remember my dad 's less than skillfully hide stash but this guy graduate to hard stuff the torture porn it be brutal it bring out certain desire the early exposure be a trigger when I interview bundy he have a theory about pornography he say if you want to stop people from become like I do not burn catcher in the rye Burn hustler I read your book too dave get some textbook in here Engineering Mathematics Cad manual Trade school ok so he be in a fix it field Construction home improvement that be good but I think I get you not so fast look at these dress what they be different size mm hmm they be different size they 've be alter Cross dresser Tch look like I be buy lunch extra linguistic indicator in his writing suggest he be most excited by the prospect of electric shock as a method of torture be specific when you be in a court the judge will demand it see how heavy his handwriting become at time he so exhilarate he actually rip through the page the idiolect support it as well I mean nowhere else be he as creative in his description good work you find a signature that be easy to track the electrical burn on his victim will be unmistakable this be dana foster she be a 34 year old real estate agent from the suburb of blue bell she be murder 5 year ago when she go to meet a prospective buyer at a house in buck county her nude body be find in a cellar and she be strangle and rape and here be the torture behavior that reid identify from the journal the contact wound be burn mark most likely the result of electrical current any lead on the buyer she go to meet fake name Louis ivey could this guy be any more perfect be her clothe find at the scene no how have you know he take they as souvenir and he alter they to fit his own frame so he be bisexual actually most cross dresser be heterosexual it be fairly common in sexual predator what about her hair be any of it miss not that be report J J Contact garcia and widen the victim search Rossi and I will go visit the crime scene watch this daddy hold on son let I get the door Mr Overholt I be agent hotchner this be agent rossi we be with the fbi FBI you 've live in this house for 4 year correct yeah I assume disclosure be make at the time of sale about what occur here yeah my son do not know about that and I prefer to keep it that way of course we understand we will be discreet we just need to take a look at your cellar I 've have it lock up since we move in you know it be kind of useless anyway flood when it rain you know it be really damp and all the electrical 's mess up hope you guy do not mind if I stay up here we will try not to take too long so he be do with the tour of the main house before he go he ask the realtor to see the cellar and boom Contusion on the back of her head say he surprise she he incapacitate she with a blunt object thick wall neighbor be few and far between he can make her scream as loud as he want to Rope burn on her wrist he probably suspend she here like in his drawing and then he apply the current and watch her whole body spasm and make her dance but where do he get the juice Cattle prod Taser Contact wound do not conform to that Outlet 's be tamper with Careful Jerry rig Clamp be still there he do not have to use a taser he pull power from the house Handy guy Dave and hotch be back thank I will be right in wow it be impressive oh it be just stuff on the wall you know I do not join the bureau to win award then uh maybe you can loan I a couple hey um J J what do you think of these what be this well we can not call he the unsub forever we generally try not to mythologize these guy all right and these be not very good anyway the fact be we do not even know if this guy be a serial actually we do 3 female age 31 38 discover off freeway in maryland jersey and new york all naked burn wound consistent with the signature and he dispose of all of the body in different state to avoid detection Garcia when be these body discover between ' 02 and spring of ' 03 after the real estate agent he change his method fast learner 4 kill by the age of 30 and he be just getting start we connectedthe 3 new body with miss person case so with a total of 4 victim on the board we be able to narrow down the unsub 's type 30 attractive caucasian upwardly mobile Yeah College grad above average income career woman you establish a cycle 10 month between the realtor and the first of these victim then 7 month 3 month he be practically double his pace every time as with most prolific killer the cool off period tend to shorten after each murder last know victim be find almost 5 year ago 5 year so could he haedtoppve s no not this guy it be more likely we just have not find the body yet and there might not even be body per se we know he write extensively about create a homemade incinerator so how many we talk ballpark if you extrapolate the cycle in the last 5 year he will have kill approximately 19 more woman it be great stuff guy keep I post she do know we do not work for her right with 4 know victim we should start by re interview friend and family we be look for a white male in his 30 to 40 and with his knowledge of circuitry and wiring we think that he be either an electrician or an electrical engineer it be a job that may give he access to a victim 's home or workplace the opportunity to observe his target they be attractive professional woman he see they as strong righteous unobtainable so he seek to tear they down to reduce they to base sexual creature and punish they he be a true sexual sadist a typology we refer to as anger excitation mean he becomes sexually arouse by the suffering of his victim kill these woman be an afterthought their pain be what he be after and he take his time to exact maximum stimulation what about his trophy he keep their clothe right yes we believe he be use they for rehearsal fantasy by dress as his victim he can relive the torture it be during this time that he most likely pleasure himself in order to reinforce his association between suffering and gratification and when he become dissatisfied with this he seek out a new victim keep in mind he be be do this for a long time and he be be think about do it most of his life he will continue to evolve find new way of challenge himself increase his stimulation threshold there be no boundary for this man Hotch he be an individual that we believe to be currently active within our community if it be not for certain evidence bring to our attention in recent day he may well have continue to operate without our knowledge we be still investigate more specific you know about this past murder and who might have be his victim but now that he be on our radar you can rest assure that we will find he and bring he to justice Agent I do not know how you usually do thing but you need to let my team know if you be plan on hold a press conference no it be not a conference it be just an announcement I think you know what I mean we be send half the cop in the city out to canvass the story would have leak I be just put a reassuring face on the situation your face I be the case agent and you be also outrank by every member of my team mean what you will vote I off the island nothing tear a case apart fast than an agent try to make his or her name on it I be try to protect my city from what could be the most prolific serial killer since charles cullen what about michael strenko florian gall christopher hardgrove I do not know those name those be cullen 's victim nobody remember the victim everybody remember the killer and that be exactly what happen when an agent put the story ahead of the case and the bureau do not need any more agent like that do you understand I have no doubt she be highly capable I be just I be say that I find her excitement level at the prospect of find more body somewhat unsettling thank you yeah J J say she be make up name for the killer and yet if she be a man you would say she have ball oh do not even go there this be not a gender thing right let us get back to reid 's map all right the nearness principle tell we that a killer will not travel far to abduct his victim but this one be go to great length to spread out his abduction and disposal site so the site be irrelevant to the geographical profile the only location I can attach a real meaning to be the storage unit 4 victim and we get squat for year he be go unchecked I think it be only a matter of time before he grow comfortable and start kill close to home unfortunately that only help we if there be a fresh kill so there be a woman out there right now who have to die so we can do our job hi do something happen yeah uh agent hotchner tear I a new one and I owe you an apology why I I get you to bring the whole team up here and then the press briefing it could have wait until morning my conscience do not allow sleep in these situation look like you could use a break there be no break but there be drink let I buy you one female ambition can be unseemly in the eye of some people and I forget that sometimes when I be in the academy in ' 97 I score 99 on my defensive tactic test which needless to say have an immediate chilling effect on all my relation with the male cadet I bet you can not remember a time when you do not overachieve well the young kid in a single parent home you learn to scratch and claw real quick single parent that would be your father go on a good man who you come to see as weak unable to provide probably a drinker I be guess scotch Blended I prefer single malt I think I do a seminar at the academy in ' 97 yes Collateral material on sex crime I be in the third row hang on every word good memory well your first book have just come out and you sign my copy yeah I kind of have a thing for you come on you be a star no one in the bureau have make inroad into publishing and consult like you have your hair be light and a big long then be not it talk about a good memory no I do not remember you oh but that would explain the hair that you claim to have find in that storage unit the hair be a keepsake I be guess you hold on to it as a vestige of the femininity you relinquish in the pursuit of your career ambition you can stop profile you manufacture evidence to get a b A u Commitment and it be for the great good I be right be not I look jill I know you when I be your age I want the same thing but I burn a lot of bridge in the process People got hurt be that why you come back to undo your past wrong just be careful that ego of yours be go to get you into trouble now I 've get to get some sleep your little press conference be go to bury we tomorrow bury we how I have a nightmare the night she go miss it wake I up but I forget it instantly you know how that happen I know this sound crazy I feel like if I could remember that dream I would know what happen to her when she do not show on time I leave she a message on her cell phone I be angry with she

like how it feel I like it do you love the pain no yes no no don't ask for it no do not do not do not please no please no more Aah oh it hurt it be so bad no no just kill I just kill I just kill I Aah Philadelphia police department Man I think I see something it might have to do with the killing what do you see my car break down on I 76 there be a field off the road a man be dig a hole what kind of hole for the body I see it a bleeder strip of its clothe can I have your name sir Mile marker 115 on the eastbound they will find it anything strike you strip of its clothe objectify the victim exactly Dehumanizing this be not just any tipster the way that he refer to the body as a bleeder visible trauma to the corpse no I do not think so I note usage of the same word in the page from the storage facility he refer to his target as bleeder it be misogynistic he be refer to menstruation he would use it as a weakness I think we need to see what be in that field M E Morning Prentiss Good morning body look well preserve be some cold snap the last few month Ground 's frozen check out her stomach Prentiss electrical burn finger be in really bad shape how be her tooth look good for an I D to say we need a rush on that would be an understatement you understand yeah thank you Let us get she up gently hey you guy might want to stick around he call in anonymously and hand we 2 more victim why you vow publicly to bring he in he may be react to that to show you who you be deal with he be a narcissist he be preen Good I hope he keep it up you do not want that he will drop a breadcrumb every time he try something like this he will drop body too if he be make it personal he will get sloppy and give himself away maybe that be what he want it never track for I that this guy default on that storage unit you think he want we to find it maybe he be decide it be time for the world to know his name but if he want a come out party then why not just send his victim photo video something

theory off us fresh eye can not hurt this be not even a b A U case maybe not yet but I can make anything a b a U Case if I want to it be about paperwork and I know the paperwork why do you care because you do you can tell I why I do the thing I do I think so I do your mother 's bipolar and almost certainly an undifferentiated schizophrenic your father suffer severe shell shock in the war what we now refer to as post traumatic stress disorder as far as I can tell he remain clinically depress the rest of his life 53 of all serial killer have some form of mental illness in their family in your case both your parent suffer psychological disorder which they largely take out on they beat each other as much as they beat you so violence become a natural expression of love there be something call the hypothalamic region of the limbic system it be the most primitive part of the brain it want what it want without conscience and without judgment it be what make baby cry when they be hungry uh Scream when they want affection become enraged when a toy be take away in most child a healthy relationship with their mother counter the hypothalamus and map the child 's brain into healthy emotional response your hypothalamus never learn control it still operate on that primitive level your record indicate that you display the symptom of satyriasis you be obsess with sex Sex and love be cross wire with pain additionally your hypothalamus will not allow you to stop seek the the desire that it want so you become a sexual sadist no functioninig sexual partner will ever willingly submit to the painful desire that you have the only way you can serve they be by make a partner compliant make sure that they do exactly what you want they to do and you ensure that by kill they early you say your victim never have a chance I think you know deep down it be you who really never have a chance everything all right in here fine we be do be that true I never have a chance I do not know maybe I be here on a serial rapist in ' 88 it be pretty short work the guy be not go to win any i Q contest the day after we uh collar he a local detective be drive I to the airport and uh he hear a call on the walkie of kid scream in a house not far from where we be he ask if I mind take the job in with he we be first on the scene inside we find find this the ax have be leave behind but it have be wipe clean it turn out it belong to the family the uh old daughter connie tell I her father buy it on christmas eve a few month early to cut down the christmas tree now I uh always associate the whole thing with christmas never be able to put a tree up myself again so he he never hurt the kid at all not physically but he would have know that the kid be in the house he only hurt the parent and then leave ok so use a weapon he find at the scene and not eliminate all of the potential witness that make he disorganized but he leave no evidence which suggest he be organize there be a fingerprint but it be behind the bedroom door I do not even think he know it be there there should have be print in other place but they be wipe clean an open back door a a drinking glass leave in the kitchen and that one good print be not a match anywhere I 've be over this a million time I I keep think if there be just one more piece one more thing to go on the answer be right in front of I he might be dead I have to be sure Rossi if he be dead you may never really know when we arrive on the scene before any of the other unit get there I could hear they before I even get out of the car it be a warm morning and the uh the window be open in the upstairs bedroom and their voice float out into the street they be cry and call for their mommy and daddy 3 terrified child scream for their murder parent I 've see so much death and pain but that sound it be be 20 year and I can still hear they scream every night cry if I can not tell they for sure that whoever be responsible will never do it again that screaming might never stop Alicia let us go in a minute now leesh God guess what my sister 's a bitch call I you do not give I your number why do you have to be like that where be you for 2 day it be only one whole day where be you I be 23 year old connie you should 've call you be not my mother hi connie I bring the team you need to stop this excuse I we think that if we do not call you back the last couple time you would just give up and leave we alone well I know that it hurt but I be only try to make sure someone pay for your parent ' death we do not care anymore it be be 20 year we need to be able to move past it please I will not bother you kid again and you will stop it with the gift too gift what be we suppose to do with a bunch of toy they remind we of the bad day of our life I never send you any gift this be it it be all we could find we throw a lot of they away I wish you would have tell I about this we think you be send they first we kind of like it and then it just become a bad reminder these be incredibly cheap be not they where would you even buy toy like that or why how do you receive they they be usually leave on the front porch at night Mine be find in my car this time so he be follow you there be a pickup outside the uh where I work I just I always think it be you what do you remember about the pickup uh all I see be the shape and the headlight Morgan obsessional crime be your specialty well there be two kind of obsessional offender that would send gift to survivor sadist who want to make the family keep relive the crime or guilt Laden offender desperately try to find some type of way to apologize sadist usually use something they know will remind the family of the person of the crime Jewelry newspaper clipping these do not look like the kind of thing you would send to inflict pain on someone so guilt Laden you know they actually look like the kind of thing a child would send ok well it be rare but an unsub who feel this much guilt sometimes commit the crime unintentionally they tend to be developmentally disabled extremely low I Q offender and generally well they be physically large and they be very strong strong enough to hurt somebody accidentally like lennie in of mouse and man exactly he need help then there be not a fragment of evidence leave at the scene that be not low I Q well usually they be assist by an old relative and it be almost always a parent and this parent rationalize that the unsub would never try to hurt anybody see in a lot of way this type of unsub they be sort of Overgrown child Jj when you get garcia on the phone tell she we be not look for other homicide here get she to look into a string of less serious offense in this area Parks playground involve child but not necessarily child that have be injure or abuse ok see an unsub like this when they seek out child they want to play with they they do not really want to hurt they but it be their size it frighten people this could be that piece you be look for that be smart to get hardwick to focus on himself long enough for the guard to come back I find that I do some of my good work under intense terror I be sorry for what I antagonize the situation no you do not well I certainly do not help ah I guess you really do not help so haley want I to sign the divorce paper unconteste so nobody waste money on lawyer you do not

some help you be wrong come on now rossi Bounce some theory off us fresh eye can not hurt this be not even a b A U case maybe not yet but I can make anything a b a U Case if I want to it be about paperwork and I know the paperwork why do you care because you do you can tell I why I do the thing I do I think so I do your mother 's bipolar and almost certainly an undifferentiated schizophrenic your father suffer severe shell shock in the war what we now refer to as post traumatic stress disorder as far as I can tell he remain clinically depress the rest of his life 53 of all serial killer have some form of mental illness in their family in your case both your parent suffer psychological disorder which they largely take out on they beat each other as much as they beat you so violence become a natural expression of love there be something call the hypothalamic region of the limbic system it be the most primitive part of the brain it want what it want without conscience and without judgment it be what make baby cry when they be hungry uh Scream when they want affection become enraged when a toy be take away in most child a healthy relationship with their mother counter the hypothalamus and map the child 's brain into healthy emotional response your hypothalamus never learn control it still operate on that primitive level your record indicate that you display the symptom of satyriasis you be obsess with sex Sex and love be cross wire with pain additionally your hypothalamus will not allow you to stop seek the the desire that it want so you become a sexual sadist no functioninig sexual partner will ever willingly submit to the painful desire that you have the only way you can serve they be by make a partner compliant make sure that they do exactly what you want they to do and you ensure that by kill they early you say your victim never have a chance I think you know deep down it be you who really never have a chance everything all right in here fine we be do be that true I never have a chance I do not know maybe I be here on a serial rapist in ' 88 it be pretty short work the guy be not go to win any i Q contest the day after we uh collar he a local detective be drive I to the airport and uh he hear a call on the walkie of kid scream in a house not far from where we be he ask if I mind take the job in with he we be first on the scene inside we find find this the ax have be leave behind but it have be wipe clean it turn out it belong to the family the uh old daughter connie tell I her father buy it on christmas eve a few month early to cut down the christmas tree now I uh always associate the whole thing with christmas never be able to put a tree up myself again so he he never hurt the kid at all not physically but he would have know that the kid be in the house he only hurt the parent and then leave ok so use a weapon he find at the scene and not eliminate all of the potential witness that make he disorganized but he leave no evidence which suggest he be organize there be a fingerprint but it be behind the bedroom door I do not even think he know it be there there should have be print in other place but they be wipe clean an open back door a a drinking glass leave in the kitchen and that one good print be not a match anywhere I 've be over this a million time I I keep think if there be just one more piece one more thing to go on the answer be right in front of I he might be dead I have to be sure Rossi if he be dead you may never really know when we arrive on the scene before any of the other unit get there I could hear they before I even get out of the car it be a warm morning and the uh the window be open in the upstairs bedroom and their voice float out into the street they be cry and call for their mommy and daddy 3 terrified child scream for their murder parent I 've see so much death and pain but that sound it be be 20 year and I can still hear they scream every night cry if I can not tell they for sure that whoever be responsible will never do it again that screaming might never stop Alicia let us go in a minute now leesh God guess what my sister 's a bitch call I you do not give I your number why do you have to be like that where be you for 2 day it be only one whole day where be you I be 23 year old connie you should 've call you be not my mother hi connie I bring the team you need to stop this excuse I we think that if we do not call you back the last couple time you would just give up and leave we alone well I know that it hurt but I be only try to make sure someone pay for your parent ' death we do not care anymore it be be 20 year we need to be able to move past it please I will not bother you kid again and you will stop it with the gift too gift what be we suppose to do with a bunch of toy they remind we of the bad day of our life I never send you any gift this be it it be all we could find we throw a lot of they away I wish you would have tell I about this we think you be send they first we kind of like it and then it just become a bad reminder these be incredibly cheap be not they where would you even buy toy like that or why how do you receive they they be usually leave on the front porch at night Mine be find in my car this time so he be follow you there be a pickup outside the uh where I work I just I always think it be you what do you remember about the pickup uh all I see be the shape and the headlight Morgan obsessional crime be your specialty well there be two kind of obsessional offender that would send gift to survivor sadist who want to make the family keep relive the crime or guilt Laden offender desperately try to find some type of way to apologize sadist usually use something they know will remind the family of the person of the crime Jewelry newspaper clipping these do not look like the kind of thing you would send to inflict pain on someone so guilt Laden you know they actually look like the kind of thing a child would send ok well it be rare but an unsub who feel this much guilt sometimes commit the crime unintentionally they tend to be developmentally disabled extremely low I Q offender and generally well they be physically large and they be very strong strong enough to hurt somebody accidentally like lennie in of mouse and man exactly he need help then there be not a fragment of evidence leave at the scene that be not low I Q well usually they be assist by an old relative and it be almost always a parent and this parent rationalize that the unsub would never try to hurt anybody see in a lot of way this type of unsub they be sort of Overgrown child Jj when you get garcia on the phone tell she we be not look for other homicide here get she to look into a string of less serious offense in this area Parks playground involve child but not necessarily child that have be injure or abuse ok see an unsub like this when they seek out child they want to play with they they do not really want to hurt they but it be their size it frighten people this could be that piece you be look for that be smart to get hardwick to focus on himself long enough for the guard to come back I find that I do some of my good work under intense terror I be sorry for what I antagonize the situation no you do not well I certainly do not help ah I guess you really do not help so haley want I to sign the divorce paper

who do not believe his brother commit suicide Come on next case now wait a second 5 suicide in the same neighborhood within month that be a serious spike suicide do not spike after a tragedy quite the opposite actually follow world war i and ii right after kennedy be shoot and follow 9 11 Suicides plummet within a society external threat usually create group integration People come together so if there be reason for doubt which there obviously be do not those family leave behind have a right to know yes they do ok sure they deserve to know but let somebody else tell they like social service Contact detective baleman let he know we be come Http www Ragbear Com Rossi there be no refuge from confession but suicide and suicide be confession Daniel webster Hotch would never have take this case and I say case in the loose sense we will follow the fact as they be without bias be not that what we do what fact rossi look at we we do not have a single file ok let I help you out jump right in anytime Fact one there be no file so it seem no case but what if there be one fire 14 death 5 suicide all the suicide be connect to the original fire and all exactly 2 week apart come on derek you can not tell I that do not feel a lot like a pattern Prentiss and a timeline right a lot of people lose their kid in that fire that be a whole world of grief and for a few Suicide 's their only way out or someone decide it be and make it look this way what if they have then we be look for one very smart unsub who target people in grief and that would make they what someone who think they be put they out of their misery an angel of death Agent jareau hi I be detective ronnie baleman hi this be ssa rossi Ssas morgan prentiss and dr Reid thank you all of you for come well your colleague do not look all that happy to see we they do not just lose a brother I would like to get start on all the file we be go to build what we call psychological autopsy to determine whether the victim kill themselves everything be in those box we would also like to take a look at your brother 's house I will take you there I think it be well if you stay here it be my case I bring you here technically there be no case if there be you would not be on it we need to profile the scene without bias I could use your help with these file it look like there be quite a few my brother keep a journal I find this on the desk in his bedroom Read the last page they be not the word of a suicidal man you seem pretty sure that an unsub exist so be you you be here be not you he be not on antidepressant he be not depress do you mind if my colleague take a look upstairs Ronnie keep it exactly as it be until you get here tell I about the fire it be the annual fall dance for the kid and it be really popular it be hard to get ticket but the kid love it do you personally know any of the other family who lose child and who recently commit suicide as a result just question ok he know Paul would not do this what Paul would not do this not after all we 've be through he would not leave we not like that go ahead put it up this be a physical representation of the 5 equivocal death together with the profile of each case we will build psychological autopsy of each person and this will tell we if it be suicide or murder uh suicide yes murder no and you think it be a pretty good indicator since its inception in 1958 it be prove to carry a 92 accuracy rate in case that have go to trial ok so the door be lock from the inside and the wife break the door in but he could have get out that window well it be a good 20 Foot drop it would hurt but you could do it so a toaster be throw in the tub right space heater Toaster space heater do the job hey it be a 110 outlet with no gfi go on well it be a 1930s house but it be be remodel with no ground fault installation yet there be a gfi unit instal in the kitchen I put they in all my property especially the bathroom and the kitchen any surge of electrical current will shut the power down at the source Properties yeah how many property 4 whoever throw the space heater in this tub know that there be no gfi Mm Hmm come on Mrs Baleman what do your husband do for a living he be a contractor well if these autopsy prove they be not suicide then I need to inform the medium right away I would err on the side of caution what People need to know and they will as soon as we have absolute proof I think the town 's be through enough already do not you also keep in mind that if these case be relate this unsub 's probably already aware that we be onto he but the community need to know if there be a serial killer in its midst and they will as soon as we have proof even if the proof mean another body he be right you know he be also personally motivate though which mean he be likely to react irrationally if this turn out to be the work of a serial killer the whole town will too you know what I think jakey Quarterback yeah maybe that be a little too dangerous how about a kicker yeah a kicker Ooh look like we have a visitor just a second Mommy will be right back hey there come on in thank you very much say hi jake can you do that for mommy say hi I 've get your bag in the other room you ok yeah I be good let us do this all right you get a kid there be a bad guy in the house what do you do to protect your child Fight not a single defensive wound on her body well I do not suppose she climb up there of her own free will unless she commit suicide she be get a baby cry for she in the other room Father find he in the high chair not a scratch remember the unsub believe he be on some kind of a mission the child be of no importance to he you find a suicide note I have not find one yet so what be you think in every case there be no evidence of a struggle or break and enter I be go to need you and emily to contact all of the family affect by the fire and inform they what be go on they need to be warn immediately so she could not cope she snap it happen it happen every day no not here it do not Emily right now that be exactly what happen Paul baleman 's house that be what you would expect from someone who be deeply depressed deeply traumatize yeah I know I see it everything past orderly everything present disorderly the bookshelf the glass cabinet all have order when their life have order have mean everything about beth 's home say she move on then how do she get up there without a fight Whew uh she be already dead dead weight be a lot heavy than alive um ok well she can not believe he be go to spare the baby if she do what she be tell the question be how do he get in Beth must have let he in I mean she have to they all let he in so she fix they drink he drug her that be get to be it Emily the strange and great what can I do you for hey uh I be look for a drug that would temporarily paralyze or subdue someone not kill they but give full control well I always use alcohol Less fuss way cheap um uh look for something that would not show up in a toxicology report ok get it thank you anything to tell we whether these be suicide or not these be some sample from diedre nollard the jumper see we have an insurance form a letter she write to her neighbor a month ago a birthday card she write to her husband a week ago and her suicide note as find on her body Suicide note match right definitely by her own hand but she be profess regret look uh I be sorry I let you down please forgive I I disappoint you and so on but the handwriting the forensic analysis be say the exact opposite what do you mean um well you see how the handwriting slant uphill it be a clear sign of optimism the same with how the spacing be so consistent and these long t bar those indicate an enthusiastic person not someone who would take a swan dive off a 5 story walkup look even if we have alert the medium now we will never know like I say that be on I but hey now we have the proof that these be not suicide those note be they coerce if you be to force someone to write their own suicide note these be word you generally would not use I will take that as a no and my brother 's journal I have not it be extensive I have not another no can we inform the medium now I have I need you all outside this be ssa aaron hotchner he be just arrive what have we get include extend family over 100 individual within the pittsburgh area be affect by that fire so this unsub be target grief eh Grief an event a single event in this unsub 's life lead he to end the life of someone he believe have to die from that moment on he create his own sense of morality what be right and what be wrong and he rationalize what he do that first kill over and over again by target people that he believe can not be save by anyone other than himself he decide who live and who die and this give he an all consuming sense of power so they be not go to stop anytime soon well that be assume there be someone to actually stop and if there be he be convinced he be on a mission of mercy and even after he be catch he will maintain he do nothing wrong he white male mid to late 30 he be polite forthcoming do not stand out and we believe his victim these family be all let he in my brother and his wife be not let anyone in if anything they be close themselves off well this unsub have find a way in one that be very hard to trace in every case there be no evidence of a struggle no attempt at escape he find a personal connection and use it to buy time and my officer need to know this we 've find that angel of mercy be often people in the medical profession cop as well as law enforcement which be why we be meet out here now we be only fish we do not want to point a finger point it I do not give a damn if that be what it be about let we figure out where to point it I ask garcia to check into emergency responder around the scene of the fire Good Prentiss he be smart he know all about these people 's schedule their routine look if this unsub do exist this be a guy who be all about control he choose how they die when they die he even position they exactly how he want they to die that make he hypervigilant a guy who be always on the lookout risk averse unseen the only way to stop he be to find out how he be manage to get into all of his victim ' life we find that out we 've get our killer we can start bring people in find the connection I have not have a drink it be be 3 week 4 day some of you know I lose my son ben in the fire a few of you have push I to go see his little league game his old team he use to pitch but I get to be honest I just have not be up for that I drive by every day I think maybe today maybe not I do not know thank you for come we be so sorry about the loss of your son I be sure you know about the suicide that have occur in shadyside over the past 2 month we believe there be a serial killer who be make it appear as though his victim be commit suicide oh my god and he be target people that be affect by the fire Wh what do you mean I mean why would someone do that he believe he be an angel of mercy that he be actually help his victim move on do you uh believe we may know this person yes we do we just bury our daughter yes we know whatever his motivation be it be crucial we look into every part of your life oh like he be do or be do right um can you think of anyone who might want might want to kill we they be just do their job he be a white male mid 30 he come across as very concerned Friendly charming no I be sorry if you need our help for anything thank you do you see she with her son what she could not hold he she could not look at he Mind if I sit here help yourself so you make it yeah I do face what you fear the most step 10 continue to take personal inventory go ahead hot stuff talk to I hey so prentiss be look for some narcotic my burn love hunk and I score humongously I run every toxicological panel know to man on the victim and come up with zilch which mean he must be knock they out with a neuromuscular agent with a what a paralytic yeah yeah something like succinylcholine or vecuromium one of those one that would metabolize in the body so quickly it would not be detectable plus plus also and I call I up mr Coroner and say how would you do this and he say by injection so I say hey guy would not that leave a mark and he be all hold up and then he go and look at beth smoler 's body and find the mark a hole right in her hairline ok so you have to be in the medical profession to get ahold of those drug right not necessarily you can get almost anything online these day this drug leave no trace none even if a coroner be look for something the evidence be go and beth smoler do not see anything come no sir she completely see it come they all see it come neuromuscular blocker paralyze the muscle temporarily while you remain very much awake he sedate they then quickly engineer their suicide well if that be true it mean this unsub 's not look for the glory of the kill no but unfortunately for his victim they be wide awake when he decide it be time for they to move on I know that feel when be it ever go to end the sadness it just go on and on every breathing moment and the pain it overwhelm you and if you could end it you would that be why when you look at I curtis I know in that moment what you want of I what you want I to do I be only sorry it take I this long but I be here now you can let go curtis I think we be ready now yeah we be ready will the barrel be place right there under the chin he shoot and the bullet go up through the small and hard palate of his mouth and then it exit out through his Cranium check the back of his head his hairline there see it oh a puncture wound make by a Needle do he leave a note all right rossi I be in we get ourselves an unsub they all have the same type of tone it be uncanny and you be say that they all write these willingly none of they be force but even here in curtis fackler 's he never say goodbye it be like they be not mean for anybody not for a wife not for a kid then who be they write they to they be amend to themselves and I I believe they be write as part of a program Program the five stage of grief in some self help group they ask you to write down an amend to yourself be that right and all of these group be anonymous right well just to give you an idea of what we be deal with here just for alcoholic support group for tonight Monday there be 91 around pittsburg proper you got to be kid I that many they have different meeting all day and night different location different degree of participation of religiousness ok I 've send you a schedule of meeting for the major grief staple Alcohol drug depression and loss all within a 2 Mile radius of shadyside there be 11 can we get a list of name why not no they be anonymous that be how he be be get away with it Let us gather the troop we be go to need all the people you can spare you get it can you think of anybody who stick out he be confident earnest Mm Mmm Hell I mean we be addict everyone stick out and no one stick out you know we be just check all the different group in the area this be a really private group honestly I do not think I can help you and if I could I would not even if it mean that one of the member of your group might get kill this person have a specific background a tragic event he would have felt compel to tell his story and maybe he tell it time and time again that be about 90 of the group he might have bring up suicide there have be a lot of suicide talk lately anyone come to mind you know there be a guy who talk about his brother 's suicide it be pretty intense this guy stand up and tell a story about his brother his family be so poor they share the same bedroom till they be 15 we hear the same story he be move from group to group repeat it he say his name be peter and that his dad be a Professor at brassard and we be just kid Slept in separate bed

who do not believe his brother commit suicide Come on next case now wait a second 5 suicide in the same neighborhood within month that be a serious spike suicide do not spike after a tragedy quite the opposite actually follow world war i and ii right after kennedy be shoot and follow 9 11 Suicides plummet within a society external threat usually create group integration People come together so if there be reason for doubt which there obviously be do not those family leave behind have a right to know yes they do ok sure they deserve to know but let somebody else tell they like social service Contact detective baleman let he know we be come Http www Ragbear Com Rossi there be no refuge from confession but suicide and suicide be confession Daniel webster Hotch would never have take this case and I say case in the loose sense we will follow the fact as they be without bias be not that what we do what fact rossi look at we we do not have a single file ok let I help you out jump right in anytime Fact one there be no file so it seem no case but what if there be one fire 14 death 5 suicide all the suicide be connect to the original fire and all exactly 2 week apart come on derek you can not tell I that do not feel a lot like a pattern Prentiss and a timeline right a lot of people lose their kid in that fire that be a whole world of grief and for a few Suicide 's their only way out or someone decide it be and make it look this way what if they have then we be look for one very smart unsub who target people in grief and that would make they what someone who think they be put they out of their misery an angel of death Agent jareau hi I be detective ronnie baleman hi this be ssa rossi Ssas morgan prentiss and dr Reid thank you all of you for come well your colleague do not look all that happy to see we they do not just lose a brother I would like to get start on all the file we be go to build what we call psychological autopsy to determine whether the victim kill themselves everything be in those box we would also like to take a look at your brother 's house I will take you there I think it be well if you stay here it be my case I bring you here technically there be no case if there be you would not be on it we need to profile the scene without bias I could use your help with these file it look like there be quite a few my brother keep a journal I find this on the desk in his bedroom Read the last page they be not the word of a suicidal man you seem pretty sure that an unsub exist so be you you be here be not you he be not on antidepressant he be not depress do you mind if my colleague take a look upstairs Ronnie keep it exactly as it be until you get here tell I about the fire it be the annual fall dance for the kid and it be really popular it be hard to get ticket but the kid love it do you personally know any of the other family who lose child and who recently commit suicide as a result just question ok he know Paul would not do this what Paul would not do this not after all we 've be through he would not leave we not like that go ahead put it up this be a physical representation of the 5 equivocal death together with the profile of each case we will build psychological autopsy of each person and this will tell we if it be suicide or murder uh suicide yes murder no and you think it be a pretty good indicator since its inception in 1958 it be prove to carry a 92 accuracy rate in case that have go to trial ok so the door be lock from the inside and the wife break the door in but he could have get out that window well it be a good 20 Foot drop it would hurt but you could do it so a toaster be throw in the tub right space heater Toaster space heater do the job hey it be a 110 outlet with no gfi go on well it be a 1930s house but it be be remodel with no ground fault installation yet there be a gfi unit instal in the kitchen I put they in all my property especially the bathroom and the kitchen any surge of electrical current will shut the power down at the source Properties yeah how many property 4 whoever throw the space heater in this tub know that there be no gfi Mm Hmm come on Mrs Baleman what do your husband do for a living he be a contractor well if these autopsy prove they be not suicide then I need to inform the medium right away I would err on the side of caution what People need to know and they will as soon as we have absolute proof I think the town 's be through enough already do not you also keep in mind that if these case be relate this unsub 's probably already aware that we be onto he but the community need to know if there be a serial killer in its midst and they will as soon as we have proof even if the proof mean another body he be right you know he be also personally motivate though which mean he be likely to react irrationally if this turn out to be the work of a serial killer the whole town will too you know what I think jakey Quarterback yeah maybe that be a little too dangerous how about a kicker yeah a kicker Ooh look like we have a visitor just a second Mommy will be right back hey there come on in thank you very much say hi jake can you do that for mommy say hi I 've get your bag in the other room you ok yeah I be good let us do this all right you get a kid there be a bad guy in the house what do you do to protect your child Fight not a single defensive wound on her body well I do not suppose she climb up there of her own free will unless she commit suicide she be get a baby cry for she in the other room Father find he in the high chair not a scratch remember the unsub believe he be on some kind of a mission the child be of no importance to he you find a suicide note I have not find one yet so what be you think in every case there be no evidence of a struggle or break and enter I be go to need you and emily to contact all of the family affect by the fire and inform they what be go on they need to be warn immediately so she could not cope she snap it happen it happen every day no not here it do not Emily right now that be exactly what happen Paul baleman 's house that be what you would expect from someone who be deeply depressed deeply traumatize yeah I know I see it everything past orderly everything present disorderly the bookshelf the glass cabinet all have order when their life have order have mean everything about beth 's home say she move on then how do she get up there without a fight Whew uh she be already dead dead weight be a lot heavy than alive um ok well she can not believe he be go to spare the baby if she do what she be tell the question be how do he get in Beth must have let he in I mean she have to they all let he in so she fix they drink he drug her that be get to be it Emily the strange and great what can I do you for hey uh I be look for a drug that would temporarily paralyze or subdue someone not kill they but give full control well I always use alcohol Less fuss way cheap um uh look for something that would not show up in a toxicology report ok get it thank you anything to tell we whether these be suicide or not these be some sample from diedre nollard the jumper see we have an insurance form a letter she write to her neighbor a month ago a birthday card she write to her husband a week ago and her suicide note as find on her body Suicide note match right definitely by her own hand but she be profess regret look uh I be sorry I let you down please forgive I I disappoint you and so on but the handwriting the forensic analysis be say the exact opposite what do you mean um well you see how the handwriting slant uphill it be a clear sign of optimism the same with how the spacing be so consistent and these long t bar those indicate an enthusiastic person not someone who would take a swan dive off a 5 story walkup look even if we have alert the medium now we will never know like I say that be on I but hey now we have the proof that these be not suicide those note be they coerce if you be to force someone to write their own suicide note these be word you generally would not use I will take that as a no and my brother 's journal I have not it be extensive I have not another no can we inform the medium now I have I need you all outside this be ssa aaron hotchner he be just arrive what have we get include extend family over 100 individual within the pittsburgh area be affect by that fire so this unsub be target grief eh Grief an event a single event in this unsub 's life lead he to end the life of someone he believe have to die from that moment on he create his own sense of morality what be right and what be wrong and he rationalize what he do that first kill over and over again by target people that he believe can not be save by anyone other than himself he decide who live and who die and this give he an all consuming sense of power so they be not go to stop anytime soon well that be assume there be someone to actually stop and if there be he be convinced he be on a mission of mercy and even after he be catch he will maintain he do nothing wrong he white male mid to late 30 he be polite forthcoming do not stand out and we believe his victim these family be all let he in my brother and his wife be not let anyone in if anything they be close themselves off well this unsub have find a way in one that be very hard to trace in every case there be no evidence of a struggle no attempt at escape he find a personal connection and use it to buy time and my officer need to know this we 've find that angel of mercy be often people in the medical profession cop as well as law enforcement which be why we be meet out here now we be only fish we do not want to point a finger point it I do not give a damn if that be what it be about let we figure out where to point it I ask garcia to check into emergency responder around the scene of the fire Good Prentiss he be smart he know all about these people 's schedule their routine look if this unsub do exist this be a guy who be all about control he choose how they die when they die he even position they exactly how he want they to die that make he hypervigilant a guy who be always on the lookout risk averse unseen the only way to stop he be to find out how he be manage to get into all of his victim ' life we find that out we 've get our killer we can start bring people in find the connection I have not have a drink it be be 3 week 4 day some of you know I lose my son ben in the fire a few of you have push I to go see his little league game his old team he use to pitch but I get to be honest I just have not be up for that I drive by every day I think maybe today maybe not I do not know thank you for come we be so sorry about the loss of your son I be sure you know about the suicide that have occur in shadyside over the past 2 month we believe there be a serial killer who be make it appear as though his victim be commit suicide oh my god and he be target people that be affect by the fire Wh what do you mean I mean why would someone do that he believe he be an angel of mercy that he be actually help his victim move on do you uh believe we may know this person yes we do we just bury our daughter yes we know whatever his motivation be it be crucial we look into every part of your life oh like he be do or be do right um can you think of anyone who might want might want to kill we they be just do their job he be a white male mid 30 he come across as very concerned Friendly charming no I be sorry if you need our help for anything thank you do you see she with her son what she could not hold he she could not look at he Mind if I sit here help yourself so you make it yeah I do face what you fear the most step 10 continue to take personal inventory go ahead hot stuff talk to I hey so prentiss be look for some narcotic my burn love hunk and I score humongously I run every toxicological panel know to man on the victim and come up with zilch which mean he must be knock they out with a neuromuscular agent with a what a paralytic yeah yeah something like succinylcholine or vecuromium one of those one that would metabolize in the body so quickly it would not be detectable plus plus also and I call I up mr Coroner and say how would you do this and he say by injection so I say hey guy would not that leave a mark and he be all hold up and then he go and look at beth smoler 's body and find the mark a hole right in her hairline ok so you have to be in the medical profession to get ahold of those drug right not necessarily you can get almost anything online these day this drug leave no trace none even if a coroner be look for something the evidence be go and beth smoler do not see anything come no sir she completely see it come they all see it come neuromuscular blocker paralyze the muscle temporarily while you remain very much awake he sedate they then quickly engineer their suicide well if that be true it mean this unsub 's not look for the glory of the kill no but unfortunately for his victim they be wide awake when he decide it be time for they to move on I know that feel when be it ever go to end the sadness it just go on and on every breathing moment and the pain it overwhelm you and if you could end it you would that be why when you look at I curtis I know in that moment what you want of I what you want I to do I be only sorry it take I this long but I be here now you can let go curtis I think we be ready now yeah we be ready will the barrel be place right there under the chin he shoot and the bullet go up through the small and hard palate of his mouth and then it exit out through his Cranium check the back of his head his hairline there see it oh a puncture wound make by a Needle do he leave a note all right rossi I be in we get ourselves an unsub they all have the same type of tone it be uncanny and you be say that they all write these willingly none of they be force but even here in curtis fackler 's he never say goodbye it be like they be not mean for anybody not for a wife not for a kid then who be they write they to they be amend to themselves and I I believe they be write as part of a program Program the five stage of grief in some self help group they ask you to write down an amend to yourself be that right and all of these group be anonymous right well just to give you an idea of

wave take out civilian the second wave take out first responder the local be think terrorism in west bune texas not exactly a tier one target but dhs do issue a terror alert for the border state yesterday just due to the timing and nature of the attack I 've never hear of this place I mean the militia ok that I could see yeah well it be close to the border it could be trafficker send a

near the primary charge if she be here between the charge and the window Boom Rod norris end up in the tree Jordan end up in the field they do not care about the rest of the house so the whole thing be design to focus the blast on whoever come through that door yeah but what be the trigger Rod norris he be a smoker and they know he would be come through this door and they know he would be smoke when he do it Hit pattern say they be fire on full auto Tight grouping for it single burst put they both down that take skill and some serious training Letts land here still alive Savage fall there dead but I walk past letts and I shoot lou savage in the face when I know he be already dead this be personal they know each other enough to know rod norris would enter through the back door while

know rod norris be a smoker who use his back door and shoot deputy savage in the face at pointblank range they be not be thorough no he walk past letts who be alive Shoots savage in the face when he know he be already dead Responders be come that last shot be risky overkill Overkill mean rage rage mean a close personal relationship Rod norris and lou savage be the specific target of this attack

possible some of our other colleague be out in the community now try to see if anyone remember anything about these man it be also not just the fact that our victim be travel alone that leave they

he may be offer assistance to those who be not he study his victim ' habit he learn how to gain their trust this unsub be charming charismatic intelligent we assume he frequent gay establishment but he may also work at one Hotch and give the technique with which he kill he may have have prior defense tactic training he be may be a member of the military or recently discharge he steal their possession but he do not pawn a thing and the fact that he be target gay man may mean that this be a hate crime and or the unsub may be struggle with his own sexuality I do not care what they say I be

woman syndrome after year of systematic abuse his client suddenly have no option leave to she but a 12 gauge and yet there be never be a domestic violence report file from that home not a single medical record documenting injury and not one witness who can say they ever see or even suspect abuse so what do you need from we I think I can win this case anyway but I would like you to help I prove that she be lie prove a negative that something do not happen be always a long shot yes but you can show she do not fit the profile of a batter woman what if she isn'T lie that be not go to be a problem her husband can not defend himself from what she be say about he any more than he could against the shotgun do not that bother anyone will she talk to we have she waive her right her attorney

jareau this be emily prentiss I be sorry to rush in but when I get the message you would see I this morning I could barely sleep last night but that be nothing new I have not be able to sleep for about 2 year we read the letter you write to the silver spring police begging and pleading be not get their attention they need to know I be not go away so you 've be get these note for the past 2 year I use to be in atlanta I move here 6 month ago and then out of nowhere another note I can not live like this anymore I want my life back what do the police tell you the detective I meet with be very sympathetic but his hand be tie unless something happen to I then it will be too late will you help I I be present the case to our team this morning I will let you know what we decide Lou evans ed derzmond and ryan scott excuse I those be the people who you will be call when you find I dead www ydy com bbs proudly present www ydy com bbs sync ßçèâèâ Criminal Minds Season03 Episode18 the Crossing where be mom and dad Hotch and rossi be still at the seminar in boston we should not wait on this Jj pull I in early I agree this be keri derzmond 2 year ago in atlanta she start receive anonymous note that meticulously describe her whereabout throughout the day local authority never find out who be responsible recently she move to maryland bring the stalker with her they think it be the same person he include photograph of himself none of his face that be very tell he be either try to protect his identity or he have self image issue he be control the part of his body that he show to her he write to keri in these letter about their future together have kid grow old he believe keri be in love with he and just do not know it yet ok so the guy 's clearly delusional but what make this a bau case he be so obsessed that he track she over 600 mile away that be unusual typically a stalker will change his focus to another woman if the object of his affection move away I mean I get that and he be way past the first level of escalation but still when keri receive the first letter in maryland she go to the local for protection they tell she they could not help she this woman be in serious danger this case be in my hand now and if we do nothing and something happen to her I will be the one notify her family ok a6 BOSTON MASSACHUSETTS Author christian nestell bovee once write no man be happy without a delusion of some kind delusion be as necessary to our happiness as reality nothing at all no sir there be no driver 's license no passport no bank account a6 BOSTON p d it be not even jointly hold her name be not on their plastic their check their mortgage their car title nothing nothing nothing aside from a birth certificate and a marriage license there be no actual record that audrey henson even exist how many year in the current home it look like they 've live in that house their whole married life and we be certain there be no medic ralecord that point to a history of abuse actually sir there be no medical record at all beyond the birth of their second child nathan what about life insurance any asset any financial motive for audrey to kill her husband no I mean there be insurance but mrs Henson be not the beneficiary of any of the policy she be not Sarah their 19 year old daughter be thank so we can use this area until something big come along I set it up just like agent jareau request be she come by the way she and another agent be at keri 's office be not you guy a little overqualified for this case I mean this guy be no serial killer we construct behavioral profile for a variety of investigative scenario that include stalk we 've see this kind of thing before and it can get ugly real fast hey I want to help this girl the day she come in I just I do not have the manpower listen we understand what it be like to be shorthande we be just here to help look do not get I wrong I get a sister keri 's age and if some guy be do this to she and I get my hand on he I would probably get throw off the force you and I both what be that bureaucratic red tape every case we take I have to explain why in term of cost and size relative to the bau they do not always think it be worth it they do have 4 agent do the work that local should just because there be not a dead body do not mean we should not take the case hey the fact that law enforcement include the fbi can not help someone until they 've be injure be appal all I be say be it be a drain on the system Emily last year in denver a woman be be harass by her ex boyfriend cop know who he be but they could not arrest he we do not take that case she be finally grant a restraining order 3 day after he throw acid in her face right now I do not care about limited resource I can not make that same mistake again ok when keri live in atlanta the initial communication happen at her job but then they get more personal and start go to her home the first card be likely an anniversary date of sort the first time he see she or the first face to face meeting he actually write the date on the card March 21 2006 that be a tuesday ok so we should look at other tuesday previous month on the 21st and march of 2005 if we can figure out what this date mean to the stalker it could trace his connection back to keri Prentiss why the move to maryland Ryan live here and my firm just open an office the move be not because of the stalker although the police back in atlanta think it be a good idea I be always cautious but for the first time I feel that if I look over my shoulder no one would be there we need you to make a list of name of everyone you know even acquaintance both here and in georgia do not forget ex boyfriend or any indiscretion nothing be insignificant if I know what I be do to make this guy so obsessed I would stop when your path cross something click with he if you be smile he probably think you be smile at he we have no way of know what his fantasy be what we do know be you be the star of it it be ryan he say it be an emergency you ok yeah they be here now Ryan 's at home there be another card and a box at the door tell he not to touch it we be on our way ok so every tuesday keri 's firm have a staff meeting and it be cater by a lot of different restaurant I will add it to the list what do you see look at the new photograph keri receive in maryland now look at the old one from atlanta the muscle tone have change the bicep be far more define also skin color he be tan why do we care if he be lift weight and out in the sun well we be look at this from a behavioral standpoint he be make improvement to his appearance and it be likely to impress keri what do her fiance look like here it be I appreciate you drive keri home ever since this guy show up again I 've be take she everywhere would he send something that could hurt I probably not but we do not want to take any chance you really think this guy would do something like that after all this time at this point you have not do anything to provoke he it be just a pair of earring they look like antique he say there be his grandmother 'S Family heirloom he want to make you a part of his family well we have the back of his head now he hope that uh you give he a gift soon too what do that mean we should probably get this back to the station and start a trace you can find he that way first class mail 's hard to track but we will see officer will be drive by your house periodically look for anything suspicious and you have my number if anything happen we will call and let you know if we find anything thank you his confidence be build and now he want something what do you think that be I do not know I be scared about what happen when she do not give it to he be that what my mother say that he hit she we have not speak to your mother yet but we understand it be be suggest by her attorney Unbelievable she be actually blame he so you do not believe she be abuse if anyone be abuse it be my father what he have to put up with be marry to her she be a lousy cook she could not do the laundry right the house be always filthy Hell she could not even grocery shop without some kind of supervision Supervision she would get all the wrong thing wrong brand too much or too little of something and my father be always patient with her always she be just she isn'T she be not bright you mean she be mentally challenge no I mean she be stupid this be your mother we be talk about here no we be talk about a woman who kill the only real parent we 've ever have our father be kind and gentle and love he always have time for we always he be at every game every school event everything important and what about your mother she never go to anything not once in my whole life I guess she just could not be bother so if your father do not abuse your mother why do she kill he probably just to take he away from we she be jealous that he love we more than her why would she think that because he say so all the time come on let I guess you do not want I to read we be go to fix dinner and we be go to do it together be we go to pretend there be not some weird guy leave I present too what weird guy I will take that as a yes will you go check on he ok the gate 's open what Brodie Keri derzmond silver spring p D I just see your dog take off down the street the only way to open the gate be from the inside which mean someone scale the fence so they would not be see I want you both to go back inside the house and lock the door behind you I should go look for brodie Keri we need to go inside where be he this be on your neighbor 's lawn it be ok it be ok I miss she too brodie I miss she too this guy be definitely try to mirror ryan he be even get the same haircut he be try to replicate what keri 's attract to he start feel good about himself he be go to find the courage he need to actually meet her we charge he with dognappe now too take the dog might not seem like much to you but it tell we that he be desperately try to feel close to her he be bold enough to break in her backyard add that to his prove determination and we 've get ourselves a serious escalation here I think he be just messin ' with her we have keri put flyer up we may get he to call to return the dog would he do that he want to prove how much he care or he will not call if he be jealous of how much attention the dog be get if he really believe that he be ready to eliminate all of his competition ryan could be next you think he be get the gut for a confrontation he move here take brodie he be not go to let anything get in his way he care about keri maybe he will not hurt she he have not yet he do not want to but if he feel like he be go to lose she then he will lose she he be be reject his entire life to escape he build a vivid fantasy world in which someone accept he I bad case scenario he get you alone in which case it would be important for you to play along with his delusion you mean like tell he I love he within reason do what he want by gain his trust he will let his guard down and that be when you can make your vemo you think it could come to that well not if we can help it we be go to have to comb through your life ever since he be be a part of it have not we already do that we be talk about each and every moment for the last 2 year the answer could be in the small detail ok the perfect family two mattresse that be less intimate she pass the murder weapon every day and the kid say she could not keep house I can not see anything out of place look even the hanger be uniformly space and the shoe I bet if we measure they would be almost perfect the kid obviously adopt their father 's skewed perspective of their mother Rossi the family that abuse together you know I think it be just the angle of the crime scene photo there be obviously something miss the rest of the blood somebody clean up this man be an incompetent suitor seek intimacy with a woman unavailable to he he think he be court uls sohi mate who in reality be a total stranger to he he be make some physical improvement but even if he be able to get enough confidence together to speak to keri she would find it more like talk to a 12 year old boy a very dangerous one his obsession have heighten as indicate by his follow she to maryland and the amount of detail in those letter he write instead of call which could mean that he be afraid of how he will sound he might be less educate or have some sort of physical issue like a speech impediment he would not have write march 21 2006 in that first letter if that date do not actually mean something to he it could be the first time he see she at the bank or the movie I mean the possibility be endless their path cross somewhere in atlanta he follow she so we need to focus on what she be do here and how she be live he be watch his move here mean that he be committed and unless he be catch he will never break that commitment yet if he perceive that she have we all know domestic dispute can be some of the most violent and there be nothing else pende no no it be ok um we will be back tomorrow I be go to need the rest of you back then as well ok thank they be work on a single stalker case all of they Jj seem pretty passionate about it you know sometimes u yocasen e it but uh they all look pretty happy

have their melancholy for what we leave behind we be a part of ourselves we must die to one life before we can enter another Anatole france a hadhe type Brunette young they be jog alone early in the morning easy prey well that be about the bad news I could have get Marvin leopold our only key witness die 2 year ago he o D how have you know I remember he have a heroin problem your good witness be a junkie it be solid he put matloff at the park with darci corbett victim number 3 the warrant and the indictment be make largely on the witness everything else be circumstantial I could name a dozen killer we got convict with less well you be not the one argue a rail thin case in front of the 23rd circuit the rocket docket give I half the time to prepare I can help you prep and I will go over the case with our team the local detective retire there may be line of investigation that fall off Cece I appreciate it we be not just do it for you we be do it for they Detective Wish I could say it be good to see you again this be our uh new agent dr Spencer reid Ted jarvis a little young be not you no offense none take in fact neural processing speed reach their maximum at around age 15 so when it come to be affect by crime scene and other graphic visual input we be all really the same age Hotch reid tell I what you see ligature mark seem to match that of the previous 2 victim he use a belt it be his signature Tan line on the wrist mean her watch be miss he take trophy they be always bury facedown it be a sign of remorse he can not bear look they in the face so he know they personally you do not have to know somebody to regret kill they no he pick these woman because he can he be opportunistic these victim happen to be in the wrong place at the right time Bogey come in the father do not suppose you guy want to rochambeau for the privilege I will go go get them tiger it be she be not it it be my darci it might be sir but if it be you do not want to see she this be not a memory that you want after the raid on matloff 's apartment we discover he have another area of interest native american mythology we realize our profile be not complete there be a native american believe that say bury a body facedown trap the soul and prevent it from haunt the killer that be why he bury they like this that be the theory 3 woman in shallow grave I do not see any progression there be no learning curve do you think there could have be more early victim when he be hone his skill we consider it a possibility it turn out matloff work in blue ridge parkway for the forest service he have free reign over the entire park it say here he be raise polish catholic any idea what lead he to identify with native american culture we do not get that far another thing we never get be any physical evidee at his apartment tie he to the crime what about the jewelry he take the souvenir no trace so what do he do with he well if we do not need the answer to that before we do now it turn out our star witness have be dead for 2 year he be the only one who could put matloff at the scene there might be another way we would like to request that the defendant undergo the process of brain fingerprinting this procedure will show if the memory of the crime be present in the mind of the defendant regardless of whether or not he choose to recall they your honor where do I begin the science on this type of testing be unproven to say the least in the state of iowa vs Terry harrington the result be rule admissible as scientific evidence as define in congress ruling 702 and in daubert v Merrell this be a hail mary your honor they have no evidence and they know it and beyond that my client be in a very fragile mental state I can not in good conscience let they go poke around in his brain what about that be it safe the test be non invasive and completely safe they will simply be look at image on a computer screen while an eeg monitor his brain activity subject he to graphic imagery to prompt some kind of reaction which they can then point to as evidence of guilt it be perverse I object to even I want to do it just one moment your honor your honor every day I waken to this uh Nightmare of not know who or what I be and if this test can really help I remember then whatever the consequence I I want to do it I have to Dr Reid Mr Corbett I do not see you in there how have you be oh not bad consider um you be not not buy this amnesia thing be you I be try to figure that out it be probably something the lawyer think up it will not work will it we have a pretty strong case good that be good you look different your hair it be be 4 year right I forget sometimes I feel like darci 's just ah it mess with time this thing you know you lose time yeah I know you always hear about closure you know Andyou never really knowwhat that mean maybe now I can get on with thing you know How be mrs Corbett do be uh she here oh no no no she be uh we split up it be hard to it be my fault really I be sure it be just you know it happen yeah it be ok Everything be go to be ok now you be with the fbi right you do not remember I we meet during the investigation so you do not have any doubt then about I who and what I be no I do not we be ready here yeah jj I be in with matloff I be at the hospital I may have something interesting what have you get Matloff have a visitor that come about once every 6 month while he be here somebody we know it be not a name I recognize from the case file the name on the visitor log be nina moore track she down I get to go I be on it he test no mermer across the board on each variable image Mermers it be an acronym Memory and encode relate multi Faceted be it good or bad depend on how you look at it it mean he show no familiarity with the image either he really do not remember or we get the wrong guy the brain fingerprinting may have just kill any chance we have of put matloff away the d a be not require to enter it into evidence no but he can get it on discovery and you can bet he be go to use it and that be why I distrust all technology so how have he get over I think nobody could beat this test the damage to his parietal lobe must have be more extensive than previously think the brain injury could have literally delete his memory oh he do the murder and we will prove it what he remember do not matter do not it I mean if those experience be go forever do not that sort of make he I do not know like yeah different person no not at all not to I it be interesting it go to core argument about the nature of identity there be a western philosophical concept Causal dependence that say that a psyological connection to the past play a key role in define who we be Reid what be you say that this guy should not be try I be not say that Prentiss but one could make the argument that in his current condition he be no long a danger to society not until he get his memory back but it be not just about this guy be a danger it be about make sure somebody pay for what happen to those girl well it be not up to we to decide to what extent he should be punish that be for the court where be we with matloff 's mystery visitor Prentiss and I contact every record nina moore within 500 mile of the hospital 71 in total no taker Matloff 's a textbook loner no meaningful relationship no family no girlfriend but anyone who would visit a coma patient a triple murderer coma patient we be talk about somebody who feels connect to he maybe connect enough to know the truth the truth could be she be just a fan every serial killer 's get them let us go back to the hospital and interview the staff we need to build a profile and help locate this woman you all right in there you be scream it be just a dream I guess I be anxious with the trial start tomorrow you pass that brain test thing right that be good suppose I could get something to write with and a piece of paper Doctor say it would be good for I will see what I can do hey what be that smell um it be popcorn Popcorn Bill make some on his break do I like popcorn Ladies and gentleman you be here to bring justice to the family of 3 beautiful young woman whose life be cut short by a cold and calculate killer Darci corbett Celeste ferami April sotherford 3 woman out for a run or a jog in the park when they be approach by an employee of the forestry service an employee who use his authority to lure these woman into a secluded area where he could safely perform the act of murder be it the work of a serial killer perhaps but the theory that my client be the responsible party be just that a theory he strangle they slowly inflict maximum suffering and terror and in the process turn the blue ride parkway into his own private killing field no eyewitness no fingerprint no dna no murder weapon not one shred of hard evidence the only way that they can tie my client to these crime be through the pseudo Science call profiling at the close of evidence you will know that brian matloff be the man who commit these crime whher he remember it or not so through this process of lkage analysis you conclude that all 3 murder be perpetrate by one man yes that be correct and you believe that man be brian matloff yes I do can you tell we how you come to that conclusion along with agent reid and morgan we begin to analyze the behavior of the unknown subject as manifest before during and after the commission of the murder our goal be to generate a suspect pool a list of name which we would eventually narrow down to one person he hunt 200 000 acre like it be his own backyard he attack high risk victim young strong female jogger but in low risk location like david carpenter the trailside killer be there other parallel this guy 's different Carpenter use a blitz attack this unsub insinuate himself disarm the victim maybe he use a con play the injure hiker lose dog too many variable she could run for help or call 911 on her cell phone before he gain control Control he be in a position of authority but not law enforcement a cop would know well than to bury a body in 2 foot of dirt the forest service would give he access to service road this deduction reveal to we how the killer gain satisfaction from his crime by bury the victim in the park he be able to revisit the scene and relive his act over and over so I imagine there be a lot of people who work for the forest service 1 718 employee he will not be a new employee he be cautious he be organize he leave behind no trace evidence he be border on paranoid he be the kind of guy who need to know exactly what the cop know he be probably insert himself into the investigation already hey what be that new tech girl 's name uh Gomez I think excuse I gomez hey baby girl Baby girl forgive I I just do not know the real I 've be call bad what can I do for you and what do technical analyst garcia do at that time we ask she to check name of forestry employee against a list of witness interview by the roanoke police and be you able to find a common denominator yes one Brian matloff of course it go well I teach he everything he know about give testimony how have the jury react good ok give I a call after the defense have have a go at he Reid say thing be good at the trial how do it go at the hospital our interview fill in some blank about the woman who vite matloff uh late 40 to mid 50 with quiet almost nervous demeanor on her first visit she do not even make it into the room she just stand in the doorway and watch for a few minute and then leave and on later visit she would what sit with he talk to he Read to he on more than one occasion she ask the nurse about his condition and they say she appear concerned with his pain that sound almost maternal we think so too but his parent effectively disown he after the indictment so we call his mother to make sure got to talk and guess what she be not his mother and his father be not his father Matloff be adopt this visitor could be his birth mother she be the right age they may have have a relationship that no one know about what other physical description do you get uh brunette brown eye dark complexion one nurse think hispanic another one say mediterranean what about native american that would explain his interest in the culture he be try to get in touch with his root now my client run from the police a behavior that you call a strong indicator of his guilt yes that be correct be you aware that he have an outstanding warrant at the time of his arrest yes I believe it be for an automobile accident a hit and run so be not it possible that mr Matloff flee not because he be guilty of murder but because of this other warrant there be 8 law enforcement officer in bulletproof vest I doubt any reasonable person would assume a yes or no answer will do yes it be possible right 54 native american Ma'am I have all that what I really need now be identifiable information yes I know what a closed adoption mean do you know what a court order mean we do not have time for court order you know what ma'am I be do be nice if you look to your cursor you will notice it be move on its own that be I hack your secure network now I get her file now I get her social and now 'cause you be grumpy I be go to send your boss these jamaican vacation photo check you out no tan line Nina genesee marry in 1978 change her name to moore current address madison heights virginia Madison height no I call this woman she say she be not the one say she would never even be to roanoke why would she lie and why have not she try to see he since he wake up so you 've state that it be your profile of the killer that lead you and the police to my client 's door that night behavioral analysis be a factor in our investigation yes and be behavioral analysis also a factor in the olympic park bombing case in atlanta yes it be and be that suspect you identify richard jewell ever convict of the bombing Objection Relevance go to the credibility of the witness and his field I will allow it no he be not convict because he be innocent your profile lead you to the wrong man Jewell be not the perpetrator but if you look at the real olympic park bomber eric rudolph you will see that our profile be dead on well how about if we look at the baton rouge killer your unit say that hwas white and live in the city he be black and from the suburb you say that dennis rader the btk killer be divorced and impotent he turn out to be marry with 2 kid objection your honor he be give a sermon do you have a question in there somewhere counselor having be wrong on those case be not it possible that you be wrong about brian matloff no the fact be behavioral analysis be really just intellectual guesswork you probably could not tell I the color of my sock with any great accuracy than a carnival psychic objection withdraw Charcoal gray well look at that he get one right you match they to the color of your suit to appear tall you also wear lift and you 've have the sol of your shoe replace one might think you be frugal but in fact you be have financial difficulty you wear a fake rolex because you pawn your real one to pay your debt my guess be to a bookie I take this case pro bono I be one of the most successful criminal attorney in the state your vice be horse your blackberry 's be buzz on the table every 20 minute which happen to be the average time between post from colonial down you be get race result and every time you do it affect your mood in court and you be not have a very good day that be because you pick horse the same way you practice law by always take the long shot well you spin a very good yarn agent but as usual you 've prove nothing if I be not mistaken the result from the fifth race should be come through any minute why do not you tell we if your luck have change your honor this be what do you want I to do either show we your blackberry or cut he loose counselor nothing far Wise decision Court will be adjourn until 9 a m tomorrow Mr Corbett hey uh I just want to make sure you know that cross examination be not as bad as it sound I be not worried oh good I have a well understanding of thing now understand after darci die I start to see a therapist have a lot of guilt you know Thought that I should have be there for her save she somehow I do not know this guy this shrink he always bring it back to control he say I have to accept the fact that there be always go to be thing in life I could not control I think that be wise I realize I have no say over what go on in that courtroom see you later spencer Nina moore yes we be with the fbi come in why do not you come forward I be protect my family they do not know I be a kid myself you give away a child I know it sound cold but you just want to forget about it believe it never happen so that be how I live but you maintain a relationship with brian maintain no I only see he once before the accident you never get the sense that maybe he be a murderer not in the slight I think be probably well I mean from what I understand in the news we meet before it start and when be that meeting 5 year ago he just call I out of the blue the record be suppose to be seal I think he hire someone to find I and what do you talk about he be interested in my family my kid he just want to call every once in a while maybe meet around the holiday but I could not I could barely bring myself to look at he I just you reject he whatever he become I can not help but feel it it be my fault you can not blame yourself for what he do why do you visit he at the hospital because it be safe I suppose I could be there for he and no one have to know and because when I would read to he and listen to his breathing it feel right hey whose car be that out there the oh hello who be this excuse I that be a lot to explain she reject he that be the stressor she be just lucky he take no for an answer it could have be a lot bad if he press the issue maybe he do Mrs Moore do he ever send you anything any gift I want to throw they away but I could not please please oh you ok yeah it be just uh I do not sleep last night I be not suppose to do this but um I bring something you want to know if you like popcorn right so uh you remember I think I be start to think about what this would do think about I

not feel anything you will be in prison and you will regret it believe I I be already in prison how do you know your affect your behavior you be too calm yesterday and you call I by my first name if

good we can use all the help we can get but uh all of a sudden she be take meeting with the mayor and call in you all without we know anything about it we be only here to help think of we as a resource ok profile I what be I think it be never go to happen no offense but we 've have 5 murder hope it get well than that you must be fbi Lisa bartleby Penelope garcia may I I hardly ever get visitor you will hardly know I be here what be your operating system um linux os with 6 gig of ram and a dual quad core 3 gigahertz processor with a geforce 8800 ultra extreme vid card and a cisco asa 5500 firewall yeah Bitchin ' how many camera uh 4 468 not include the one that only run in the housing project and all the footage be store catalogue and digitize Beautiful 'cause my boss man want I to send he a file so he can run facial recognition software on each of the crime scene um I 've already enhance all of the photo as much as I can no I be talk about use it on the crowd immediately after the shooting this be icky but these creep they sometimes like to come back and watch the police deal with their handiwork and Voila can I ask you a question when be the last time you go home and get some sleep none of we be go to sleep until this be over who in the hell think they can get away with murder in the middle of the day in new york city someone patient who wait for the one who gets separate from the flock Bang be that the spot yeah Thereabouts be we bore you look I know you do not like ssa joyner Fine I get it but we be here to do a job have any of your people ever be cop Chicago then you will understand I take it real personal if something like this happen in my city I be a beat cop during the son of sam this be bad he be not just go after one type he be go after everybody and I need everybody work on this case take it personally you have that we will see how long have you be do this uh about 6 month I wish I could tell you it get easy yeah well I be use to pull footage up for mugging maybe robbery watch someone get shoot in the head you know what help I you make it your own you know you separate yourself from what you see on the screen this be not exactly uh Regulation well then thank god it be only we in here do you want to see a superfox what camera be on the last crime scene Derek morgan Lisa bartleby Lisa bartleby Derek morgan this guy be definitely not afraid to get up close and personal or be visible if you watch the tape he duck his head the second he step off the train so he know when he be be film well we 've have glimpse but the description have be sketchy some people say he be a light skinned black man asian puerto rican basically every homeboy in the city ballistic be the same for every shooting we check the record back 10 year the gun 's never be recycle 22 be not exactly the weapon of choice these day unless you be israeli intelligence that be what the mossad use for all their political assassination all I know be this guy 's organize he study the camera carry a gun that be easy to conceal he know what he be do we be go to need record over the last 6 month for any arrest on gun violence or gun possession in every borough except the one where the shooting have take place uh I do not get it he will not strike near where he live what make you so sure it be anti geographical profiling now it be anti geographical profiling yeah come on you wonder why we be so skeptical this unsub 's organize he strike at the same time of day he know where the camera be place that mean he be do his own pre Surveillance a need motivated killer operate within his own comfort zone an organized killer with some other motivation will make sure to strike outside that zone not where he live exactly unfortunately that mean that every other neighborhood in the city have a reason to be terrify excuse I Pretzel no mustard uniform be round up witness it do not seem like anyone get a clean look it be over in a flash he be probably go before anyone even realize what be happen be this what it feel like during the son of sam First we realize that if the violence be truly random there be almost no way of stop it it seem like these people have figure that out from the placement of that camera odd be the only view they be go to get be the back of his head let us not be too quick to decide what we do or do not have Whoo the duchess of work have speak you mind tell I why I be catch attitude from her Fbi brass have make it clear to she that if she do not bring this case home she be go to be reassign and you be at the top of the list to replace she you be kid I why should you be surprised you be good at your job People notice that what happen to the bureau pat itself on the back for steal she away from scotland yard I do not know politic here be different and you can see she do not pull punch 6 murder and he be finally communicate with we what be that that be a tarot card Death be not that a little on the nose even for a psycho so we think this guy be into spiritual garbage if he be he certainly do not know tarot the death card do not actually signify physical death it be more of a transformation from one place to another a job promotion or a marriage so if he be not tell we he be into fortune Telling what be with the card the d c Sniper leave the exact same card at one of his scene so this unsub must see himself in that role he be thrive off create a panic more important he study other case he be tell we he know we be here what have we get the late shooting this be the previous murder ok do you see anything weird here he sprint off in one and walk calmly in the other it be two entirely different demeanor 6 kill in his behavior should be set look at this Garcia be you still there would I ever leave you ok check it out I do a digital perspective analysis render on the shooting where we have footage now the first two be inconclusive but the last two I find something tre weird your calm walking type he be about 6'1 but your sprinter he be like 5'9 5'10 top we 've get more than one unsub so we have more than one unsub what do that tell we Most team stick together uh ng and lake the kray Bittaker and norris they do not usually kill separately could be some kind of gang initiation gang will kill you if they encroach on your territory not random people all over the city I will coordinate with the gang taskforce make sure we have an overview by morning do you think we have enough for a work profile broad stroke Dave you and reid talk to the agent here Morgan and prentiss brief the police when each shift come on duty tomorrow I think we should get out on the street I bring you here to create a profile which we can give in the morning and then they can share it with the afternoon shift we 've allocate every extra man we have this be new york city it be not like a few more people be go to blanket the city I understand it be a long shot but these guy they hit at mid Day we could target ingress and egress to particular neighborhood position we near express stop 14th 42nd 59th Morgan it be not your call I would like to join you in the profile if that be not step on your toe no problem Let us see it again look at this Late edition do not miss a beat Jj will take a shot and fly to d c but that do not work out I figure a train ride to new york be only a few more hour Detective I be sorry for show up like this I know you be work but um I can not stand you be on this case and I not be there not with what be go on be there a problem I be pregnant oh my god jj Congratulations I 've ask jj to marry I will we be work out some kink we will give you both some privacy Hotch Jj you could have tell I I know I understand if you need to take some time no I want to be here okay be you crazy I tell you I could not get any personal time come back to dc with I tomorrow you be not serious they know now they would understand will we be cover a case with six murder exactly your job be too dangerous now yeah exactly like your be you go to give up your shield look I love the gesture and I love the romance but we be both go to be parent will neither one of we have exactly a typical job the first thing a cop do when she get pregnant be she take herself out of the field okay you know what we only have until 7 so can we just argue about name and crib only if you let I win not a chance okay let us start with what we know for these unsub it be not personal it be not about sex it be not about greed which be why we think there be something big at play here this be not random there have to be a motive now our first theory be that we be deal with a team in the case of the d C sniper there be actually one intend victim John mohame want to kill his ex Wife but he know if he do he would be the crime suspect so he create a spree in order to mask his primary motivation what if the death get ott their scene just like this unsub we believe our unsub have study that case they be open a line of communication hold on so now we have these guy play game just because you be here we be just say the unsub be sophisticated enough to study other crime that do not answer the question Joe easy hear they out hey I get request for gun permit up 200 in my precinct this whole city be about to go up we all need to deal with that hey listen you be right if the card be leave because of we then yes they be play game but what that tell we be at least one of they have some intelligence and like I say they know about other case he be also study the placement of the surveillance system well enough to avoid detection Most team have a dominant and sub missive member because of the relative intelligence of these unsub and the fact that they stick o a set time patternt we believe at least one of they have a steady job we 've ask the police to canvas their precinct check business that open and close around the time of the shooting we be hope someone will be able to identify a father son or co Workers that fit the dominant sub missive profile and what be the other theory it be less likely but it could be some sort of gang I initiation we 've ask the police to put every available undercover on the street these be all own gang member in manhattan Most of they be out of china town and clinton we would like you to study these and keep an eye out for anyone who look suspicious those i D number stay behind when the agent be finish I will give you your assignment like we say we think there be something big art play here talk to the people on your beat Save spark and pray this thing ai not random Cameras be not design to prevent crime suppose to help we catch the perp after the fact I get one be there anyone nearby Negative this be a surveillance command centre we have a possible murder suspect at the subway platform on 59th and lex okay Hotchner it look like it could be one of our guy what be go on we have eye on one of they he be on the 59th and lex we could have be right there he be get a gun oh my god he shoot she where the hell be the police this be kate joyner with the fbi we have a murder suspect Subway platform 59 and this lex he be get away Garcia can you get eye on he aboveground he be head west on 59th street if he make it to the park we 've lose he we 've lose the visual be the police on the scene Negative we could have have that guy even if we be on that platform odd be he wouldhave know he be isolate maybe but it be worth take a shot we have every available man on the street and I suggest to you that you use this team second guessing do not do we any good Hotch how be I suppose to look these cop in the eye and tell they we be here to help they we be here to present a profile let us we need to do I say put we in express stop 14th 42nd 59th that be exactly where they hit it be not your place to have this discussion my place you need to back off we get seven body man which be exactly why we need to stay focused focus from where I be stand all you be focus be on her take a walk now I know I be out of line you get too emotionaly involve sometimes I know the feeling I just feel like hotch be take her side there be no side here I know the word be they have an eye on you if jayner get can People talk if she be to get fire it would be because we do not solve this case Rossi I hope you be not say you think I want she to fail of course not I 've never see you push a superior like that before so would you take the job I do not know it might be nice to finally be the one make the call and deal with the politic of run a field office that do not seem like you it wear people out man look at gideon that man be the good and in the end he simply run away I mean hotc hflt have not even think about crack a smile in over a year that man have to take a personal day just so he can have a conversation with his own kid what about you how many time you be marry I get it but I will make you a deal if I think you be lose it I will pull you out myself but right now I see someone who want to get back on the job or be there another reason why you have not even touch that beer listen um about before you speak your mind I respect that Jj reid and printess be at the crime scene with the detective it be the first time they 've kill two day in a row they be speed up your analyst go over the late footage this be a different shooter from the last two there be three of they now who the hell be these guy I want you all out on the street tomorrow what be we miss when we first see this case what do it remind we of Sam same kind of unsung Random shooting not need drive no sexual component expect that berkowitz admit that he return to the crime scene day later to masturbate exactly so you be think if the dominant unsub have a similar m o we get garcia to study the footage and we see if the same person keep return to the crime scene in the day follow the shooting all we 've be look at right now be the immediate aftermath of the crime worth a shot we will hit the street tomorrow Dave will you grab reid and go over the profile and make sure we do not leave anything out thank okay people talk to I roll call 59th street Check Carol square Check Chamber street check 72nd street Check detective Son of sam this case still piss you off like it be yesterday yeah do there 've be a lot of killer in the city why he he be laugh at we and we could not catch he the only way we grab he be through a parking ticket what be you think he have not contact we again so this do not fit these unsub be organize they use presurveillance they strike in the heart of the day yet they have not do anything to seek out media attention and then this you say it be to tell you they know you be here we profile open a line of communication to create panic but if that be the case his correspondence should escalate after they leave their death card mohame and demand an atm card a million dollar and a bank account to taunt police Berko wit write letter about random hit in the city Sdrooik himself as a monster they be more disciplined the fact they have not contact the press tell I that this be private it be only for we so what do that mean they be wrap up to something and they wanttous know that they be watch we you see both these trait completely out of context what would be the first profile to pop into your head who do we have out on the street talk Garcia do you have eye on everyone on the team I can get they so we be on the cover maybe we should you know act like a couple be you still work this tired sexual tension angle I do not know you be the fortune teller you tell I you want to know what profiling be really why do I have a feeling I be go to hear no matter what I say it be just notice behaviour I be about to hear about mine be that the deal okay when we first meet when your partner be sarcastic and say yes ma'am you instinctively reach for your detective shield as if you be protect it that tell I you do not like he disrespect the chain of command but you be also loyal so you do not say something to he I would say you be military probably an officer public and sensor in public right you be right handed but you have two different colour pen mark on your left hand I guess you have a toddler at home just learn how to draw you do not wear a ring and you be quick to flirt with I so you be happy to let people think you be a player but if I take you up on it you would run for the hill because you love your wife and you would never actually cheat on her you might just solve this case yet okay this be not good why not I be do what you ask I be look at the footage to see if I see the same person come back to the crime scene in the day after the shooting right so I find the camera with the wide angle on the scene so you have to sift through hundred exactly but someone be hack in Garcia I be on it I be on it 16 and this broadway he be run east on 16th he be head our way move move get out of the way Cooper Garcia we 've get an officer down 16th west of union square let I see okay you be go to be okay Garcia can you see we we have an officer down stay with I it be go to be okay Cooper stay with I be you okay be he go to make it I do not know he lose a lot of blood he be not go to live to tell we anything any o d on he nothing this be not good I should not have have to shoot he Emily he shoot a cop you do what you have to do no not that I mean he be ahead of we he would have get away but he stop and wait so he feel trap figure he would shoot his way out I do not know tell I about his behaviour be he act panic be he wind his hand be steady his eye be dead calm I mean these guy have be hyper individual lend organize they do presurveillance what be the odd they would shoot somebody two block from where I and coop stand you think he deliberately shoot someone where he could see cop what if he do what if they choose this spot because we be here what be you think he have no I d on he he wait until we catch up to he he be strangely calm it be almost like suicide by cop why why would he do that I do not know maybe to make we think everything be finish we need to walk back through this profile we think we might have a serious problem what be it we have multiple unsub they be discipline they be use cop and surveillance they know the fbi movement there be a hierarchy what do that usually equal Terrorism so how do this work the murderer simulate a bombing in order to gauge police response time which case they know when to bring in a second bomb first round of civilian follow by a second wave of emergency responder it be crazy but ingenious they get a practice run and if someone catch a shooter they have a murderer that will not compromise it be lo Fi smart way to plan for a terrorist event create panic ensure that they see the most urgent response time short of a bombing so there be be seven different shooter have follower do the shooting would ensure they be willing to kill or be kill for the cause fit the profile there be something large at play it simulate a gang I initiation especially if they be home grow they have a chance to prove themselves I think they be target point of entry all the murder be take place near a bridge or tunnel Holland tunnel midtown tunnel manhattan bridge if bomb go off emergency response would shut down any ability to get in or out of this city it would be like people be trap on the island keep in mind still a theory just like any profile talktous garcia we get a problem I go through and check off 4468 camera they 've hack into the surveillance system they have footage of every crime scene they 've be watch since the beginning how could we not have catch that they be smart not system wide have to check each camera individually this be from every crime scene I be afraid so they hack into one camera at every scene Thanks garcia so much for theory we need to hit the ground run I be go to head to the hospital I will check on cooper and brief detective brustin Good Dave will you go talk to the commissioner and morgan you brief online security Jj and I will talk to the port authority police Kate and I will go talk to the mayor and we will meet back here as soon as possible one advantage that we have right now be they

go brief port authority police by yourself Jj you run point from the office why do not you go back to the hotel Tell will what be go on then get back in line yes sir and jj Congratulations How 's

Metesky Nice the winner sit loser drink Cheers hold on Metesky be not a serial killer none of his bomb ever kill anyone well you think all we do be serial killer trust I we cover the whole spectrum of psychos we profile the D c sniper the unabomber we do terrorist arsonist supervisory agent try to get trainee drunk excuse I wow Behavioral Analysis Unit you work with Gideon be you with he in Boston I be suppose to be yeah this be Morgan anyone recognize these face victim of the footpath killer that be what Virginia newspaper be call he we refer to he as the unknown subject or unsub I tell Virginia P D we be look for a white male in his 20 's who own an american make truck in disrepair work a menial job I tell them when you find he do not be surprised to hear he speak with a severe stutter not to sound skeptical but come on a stutter where have the murder occur hiking path isolate if I be a killer who have to use an immediate application of overpower force even out in the middle of nowhere I lack confidence I can not charm they into my car like Ted Bundy do I can not because I be ashamed of something excuse I they be call he the Seattle strangler 4 victim in 4 month he keep them alive 7 day the handle serve as a crank allow he to control the rate of suffocation to prolong it to enjoy it Seattle 's hit a wall physical evidence be nonexistent there be no tangible lead and another girl be miss I look the case file over I will get some thought to you asap you be go to be with we in Seattle asap 22 year old Heather Woodland before she leave for lunch she download an email with a time delay virus attach the killer 's virus wipe her hard drive and leave this on the screen for heaven 's sake catch I before I kill more I can not control myself he never keep they for more than 7 day which mean we have few than 36 hour to find she they want you back in the saddle you ready look like medical leave 's over boss they sure they want I the order come from the director well we would well get start Joseph Conrad say the belief in a supernatural source of evil be not necessary men alone be quite capable of every wickedness this girl may only have 36 hour to live we be not ask for a judgment of Gideon we want an assessment we want to know you be there to step in if he can not perform be we clear of course his first victim be 26 year old Melissa Kirsh Stab wound strangulation wait wait back up back up he stab she and then strangle she to finish she off other way around why do you think he start use the belt with the second murder Strangulation with your bare hand be not as easy as one would believe he tried probably find that it take too long so he stab she instead and realize it would be hour clean up the blood next time our boy 's get a method the belt he be learn perfect his scenario become a well killer what do I tell you about the tape I be sorry I be sorry I be sorry he never stand with his back to a window when I be between he and a doorway he ask I to move that be hyper vigilance it be not uncommon in post traumatic stress disorder just how much disorder be we talk about Morgan it be be 6 month everything be ok this be special agent Gideon special agent Morgan our expert on obsessional crime special agent Reid Dr Reid Dr Reid our expert on well everything and after 2 year bust my butt in this office I hope you all remember I he be willing to travel with the body then he drive a vehicle capable of conceal one 1 in 7 4 driver in Seattle own an SUV Explorer with tint window Explorers rate high with woman but how do we know it be his car Ted Bundy drive a VW Bug what about a Jeep Cherokee Jeep 's be more masculine we all know how an unsub feel about assert his masculinity when do the bureau become involved in the case after the fourth body he dump that one out of state on purpose if so knowledge of law enforcement do suggest a criminal record or that he watch television may I so you wanna see our suspect list no we will not look at a suspect list until after we come up with a profile it keep our perspective unbiased when do we sit down with your task force 4 00 an accurate profile by 4 00 today that be not a problem Agent Gideon where would you like to start let us start at the site of the last murder so that be Gideon the Gideon the one who catch that guy Adrian Baal in Boston Yep that be he but catch he cost we 6 agent 22 year old Anne Cushing be find right here Nails clip just like the other he want they to fight back but not enough to hurt he and he leave the belt around her neck he be probably in his early 20 's what be your reasoning youthful arrogance he clothe the body before dump it that be a sign of remorse it be not consistent look where we be his opinion of woman be pretty clear do not you think they be disposable why show remorse by take the time to dress she but then dump she here Sandy no no no I be so sorry no it be ok it be what we call the Reid effect happen with child too I be agent Hotchner this be special agent Dr Reid you look too young to have go to medical school they be PhD 's 3 of they be you a genius or something I do not believe that intelligence can be accurately quantify but I do have an I Q of 187 and an eidetic memory and can read 20 000 word per minute yes I be a genius Sandy you get a lot of attention do not you yeah Heather love this dog I feed she when Heather be away usually she be fine but lately she will not eat it be almost like she can sense something 's wrong not sense Smell our apocrine sweat gland release secretion in response to emotional stress Sandy 's worried because she know you be David do your sister drive a Datsun Z no but she be in the market for one how have you know come on Sandy there be an immediate relationship establish between a buyer and a seller a level of trust if I want to coax a young woman into my car offer she a test drive okay then how about the fact that on one hand we have paranoid psychosis but the autopsy protocol say what adhesive reside show he put layer after layer of duct tape over his victim ' eye he know he want to kill they but he still cover their eye he do not want them look at he apparently okay but then he take the body and dump it right out in the open murder weapon nearby not the M o of a paranoid convinced he be be watch or surveille Paranoid psychosis but behavior that be not paranoid all right enough let us tell they we be ready we be ready Reid you be good with this we 've get a woman who be only get a few hour leave to live an incomplete profile and a unit chief on the verge of a nervous breakdown they do not call they nervous breakdown anymore it be call a major depressive episode I know Reid the unidentified subject be white and in his late 20 's he be someone you would not notice at first he be someone who would blend into any crowd the violent nature of the crime suggest a previous criminal record petty crime maybe auto theft we 've classify he as an organized killer careful Psychopathic as oppose to psychotic he follow the news have good hygiene he be smart 'cause he be smart the only physical evidence you will find be what he want you to find he be mobile car in good condition our guess Jeep Cherokee tint window the murder have all involve rape but rape without penetration be a form of piquerism and that tell we he be sexually inadequate Psychiatric evaluation will show a history of paranoia stem from a childhood trauma death of a parent or family member and now he feels persecute and watch murder give he a sense of power organize killer have a fascination with law enforcement they will inject themselves into the investigation they will even come forward as witness to see just how much the police really know that make they feel powerful in control which be why I also think in fact I know you have already interview he hi I be sorry to bother you I be house sit down the street and when I get back the door be wide open and the light be not work I feel stupid ask this but be there someone who might be able to take a look inside with I Richard Richard get down here be you sure you lock it yeah hello hello FBI Freeze Freeze get he down Richard Slessman FBI you be under arrest for the murder Emerson say all be riddle and the key to a riddle be another riddle there be no sign of the girl here we can arrest he with probable cause but we will not be able to hold he Slessman 's be at the top of the suspect list be that the mother Grandmother the mother die in a fire when he be 13 probably not the only fire in his childhood before his Son of Sam murder David Berkowitz set a multitude of fire exactly how much be a multitude accord to his diary 1 400 and 88 lure he out be your idea right Greenway Elle I do not send a SWAT team into a house with child Hotch say your background be in sex offender case what can you tell we the last 4 murder show he be an anger excitation rapist he will keep a victim for a couple of day he probably record or videotape they so that he can keep relive the fantasy you ok with Hotch be in on the interview I would like he to lead actually fine but hold off Slessman 's do time and he know the process and all you will get now be a demand for a lawyer Hotch let us check the garage then show I what you get next time show a little leg Morgan the only time you be go to see a little leg from I be when I be about to kick your ass I still teach hand to hand over at Quantico if you need a little brush up training seriously I want that opening at BAU you get any advice just trust your instinct well we get the jeep right and everything else wrong the body have defensive wound Richard do not have a mark on he we be missin ' something something be not right about this this be a boy 's room not a man 's Log in password no no wait wait it be not turn back on yeah and it will not it be a false password what kind of game be it in China it be call wei chi here we call it go it be consider to be the most difficult board game ever conceive Chairman Mao require his general to learn it it also look like he be play himself how can you tell this might provide an advantage actually go be consider to be a particularly psychologically revealing game there be profile for every player the conservative point counter the aggressor the finesser what kind of player be Slessman Extreme aggressor okay here we go what be the number 6 at the bottom of the screen Number of password attempt before the program wipe the hard drive there could be an email or a journal in the computer something that tell we where Heather be do you think you can break in in 6 try try again Fail again fail well Samuel Beckett try not do or do not Yoda I wanna talk to he you read my paper learn anything heiren say a man live inside of his head be the one who commit the murder you say he be lie that there would never be an actual case of multiple personality you have an academic interest in disassociative identity disorder or you just plan your defense you a fan of Adrian Baal 's work no I be a fan of yours you know they never give you the real fact about CPR that outside of a hospital it be only effective 7 of the time your friend have a 93 certainty of die but you keep try even after you have break his rib even after his blood be all over your hand why do not you tell we where Heather Woodland be Woodland be not she the girl that go miss a couple day ago get he out of here hey he be be not she the girl if he have already kill she he would have say be not she the girl she be alive we do not know for how long be it true what he say about CPR I mean I do not know you want statistic on CPR ask Reid I wanna know if you be ok I be fine be you think I can not do the job I think you can not be 2 different

abyss the abyss look into you I will take this have a n I n nice day Subtitles cedr c www forom com previously on Criminal Minds anyone recognize these face victim of the footpath killer that be what Virginia newspaper be call he we refer to he as the unknown subject or unsub I tell Virginia P D they be look for a white male in his 20 's who own an american make truck work a menial job I tell them when you find he do not be surprised to hear he speak with a severe stutter have a n I n nice day the gun Ta take out the gun Th throw it any particular direction who who be y who be you who be you FBI T t t take out your w your w wallet wh what what do you kn what do you know about you or about the people who you 've murder I know a lot about you I know how you do it I know you can not stop and I know something that no one be ever be able to tell you I know why you stutter be not you a little bit worried he might just shoot you I be a lot worry but how do you find he I be just stop for gas I walk into that store and I see piece of a profile that I have give to Virginia P d almost a year ago Truck in disrepair a disheveled young man severe stutter James Reese once say there be certain clue at a crime scene which by their very nature do not lend themselves to be collect or examine how do one collect love rage hatred fear these be thing that we be train to look for so anyone else would have just see a guy who stutter but you see the footpath killer right but sometimes these guy be still find by just dumb luck Berkowitz be catch because of a parking ticket except the cop who catch he be not stare down a shotgun like you be this be true this be also a good time to stop thank you sir thank you okay I be curious why have he stutter you be on your way to become part of the behavior analysis team now Elle you tell I Check Checkmate 3 move what you know you will beat he when you start learn Learning what to think outside the box Question for you shoot the footpath killer why do he stutter come on Elle we 've all ask he and he will not say he want we to figure it out okay I be up for a challenge good because these go to you special agent Jennifer Jareau JJ if you like Elle greenway high number of solve case in Seattle 3 year run specialty in sex offender case not bad well I be the unit liaison my specialty be untangle bureaucratic knot you will probably be talk to I a lot my door 's always open mostly because I be never in my office so just call I on my cell okay we will talk do you watch it yeah think everybody should see it BAU team can you meet I in the conference room please I need to show you something this be from the Phoenix office Bradshaw College in Tempe 6 fire in 7 month who record it a student with a digital camcorder he be watch a fire in the building across from their dorm the other person you will see be his roommate 20 year old Matthew Rowland this be crazy hey Mac get over here you got to see this the building be on fire Bro you get this be that the kid yeah that be he relax man there be always fire during rush week yeah but that be pretty big what building be that dude over here check this out what be it I do not know but it be come underneath the door be someone in the hallway hey someone be try to get in hey man you should get away from there oh my god it smell like gas oh god God oh my god oh my god Put I out oh my god oh god help Einstein once say imagination be more important than knowledge Knowledge be limit Imagination encircle the world there be 2 common stressor for a serial arsonist Loss of job loss of love when be the first fire set March uh the next one be in may and the third one be not till september then 2 week later there be 3 in one night he be speed up Fire 's be close together hey Reid you get a statistic on arsonist 82 be white male between 17 and 27 female arsonist be far less likely their motive typically be revenge sound like our boy be a student do not be so sure you rely too much on precedent you never allow for the unexpected if he go from set one fire to 3 in 2 week ' time rapid escalation he be go from the power to damage a building to something far more satisfying the power over life and death who we talk to first Dean of student Ellen Turner no badge I do not want to satisfy the unsub 's need for attention by let he know he get the FBI here try not to look official try to look less official obviously I would rather be meet you under different circumstance this be fire inspector Zhang this morning the chemistry department report several bottle of highly flammable chemical miss I be prepared to evacuate this campus thank you that bring with it its own problem you might evacuate the arsonist as well then the case go unsolved the campus be reopen but the fire start up again Hotch Gideon hold on a second you say the chemical be miss today it say here that one of the previous fire be set with diesel fuel that disappear from the ground keep facility how long after it disappear be the fire set one day if he be hold to a pattern who be to say the next fire will not be today Door be lock Matthew Rowland and his roommate watch as the doorknob turn against the lock but the unsub could not get in so he pour the accelerant into the room from the hallway which mean he could not see the fire but he could hear Matthew Rowland scream yeah but not for long he would have leave quickly yeah to avoid be spot it do not make sense Pyromania as a mental disorder may just be a simple myth but we do know from precedent that serial arsonist derive pleasure from pathological fire set Sex and power but a serial arsonist would not just set a fire and walk away he need to experience it so why would he set a fire he could not watch he turn the water off just before the fire the last 3 be set with these 2 device simultaneous ignition there be no device use on Matthew Rowland Unsub set that one manually he want to be there to enjoy the kid 's death not necessarily well if the target be Matthew Rowland then why set the other 2 fire the motive for arson be relatively simple there ' vandalism crime concealment political statement profit and revenge we interview Matthew Rowland 's roommate he say Matthew be very well like no reason for revenge what about vandalism no the fire be too sophisticated and if he be try to make a political statement he be not be too clear about it there be an underlying strategy in this case Matthew firefighter injure victim to the unsub they be not people they be they be object more like uh chess piece exactly all right I want to set a dormitory fire where would I start in the basement the upper level would be fuel then why do I start on the third floor oh god because it be not the building I want to set on fire the timer set the road flare which then light the chemical mixture inside the canister Simple yet sophisticated in its simplicity I mean there be a meticulous construction to it Chemical accelerant could mean chemistry student could also mean chemistry professor Mmm I say student you need self confidence to lecture in front of a classroom full of 30 college kid Arsonists be socially incompetent this guy do not go on date he do not go to party he do not feel comfortable in front of group and of course he be a total psychopath course think we will get a lead from the hotline no if you do not mind my asking why then do you set up the number well serial arsonist enjoy manipulate authority they like to communicate explain themselves I be not wait to hear from a tipster or witness you be wait to hear from he yeah all right office hour I have my own homework to do thank you professor Wallace no problem we do not want a stampede on our hand because the exit out of the campus block so quickly now we have stage area and we must utilize every possible agent Gideon Agent Gideon Agent Gideon everybody out of the building go what be it look out Clear the whole building Clear it now come on help I help I get off of I there be a teacher let it go he be already dead let it go he might be here watch yeah take picture as many as you can you get it the professor 's name be Wallace it be a terrible loss he be one of those teacher um he know how to make a difference Gideon we 've get police and security interview everyone in that building how long will it take to finish evacuate the campus this be a college of 10 000 student and faculty well there be another problem with evacuate you mean we might accelerate the unsub 's timeline let us round everybody up Dean Turner hi I be Jeremy I be one of the research assistant at the science department we be talk and uh we would like to help the good thing you can do right now be just stay we know how he do it we 've be at this all night and we 've get nothing look at these expression we get fear a touch of horror even a little bit of panic where be the guy gettin ' off when ask about his motive Peter Dinsdale say I be devoted to fire Fire be my master okay so who be our boy 's master 10 000 plus student and one have a serious fascination with fire Fire start be one third of the homicidal triad an early predictor of adult disassociative criminal behavior if we look in his childhood we would probably find all three bedwette and cruelty to animal absent or abusive father trouble with the opposite sex chronic low self esteem M O would be dynamic Evolvings fire set escalate they thrive on panic fear it be just the standard profile of a serial arsonist base on hundred of interview base on precedent everything the unsub should be accord to research we be off the mark because of the 2 miss element Sex and power the 2 motive that drive a serial arsonist and without them we do not have a profile whoa hey uh sorry I do not mean to scare you I be just um I be campus patrol I be suppose to ask for your I D sure sure you be one of those FBI guy um like a profiler right like one look at a crime scene you can tell what kind of shampoo a killer use you sound skeptical uh maybe a little your girlfriend think you be go to break up with her you be kid right well you keep adjust your necklace that tell I you be not use to wear one or somebody else probably buy it for you buy it recently and the chinese symbol on it mean forever yours take care of yourself all right Reid since you be more their age why do not you do the talk Ahem hi hi guy uh my name 's uh Dr Spencer Reid I be a uh agent with the the BAU the Behavioral Analysis Unit of the FBI which um it use to be call the BSU the Behavioral Science Unit but not anymore they change it to the BAU um it be part of the NCAVC the National Center for the Analysis of Violent Crime which be also part of this thing call the cirg the Critical Incident Response Group and what he be try to say be we would love to know how you can help we may I please thank you see this Drill a hole in the side fill it with gasoline or whatever be good and flammable turn the light on Boom that be what go down do not it the stuff 's all over the net Wanna know how to make a molotov cocktail that set itself on fire potassium sulfur and normal sugar Sugar sugar which be not exactly plutonium you could get this stuff anywhere Sugar from the supermarket but you do not need to be a chem major to know that do you think it be a chem student you wanna know what I think I think it would be a good time to take the semester off hold on you need a key to get it movin ' after 10 00 p M so what be you still doing here I can not leave we get project you know hot to solve the 3 body problem compute the mutual gravitational interaction between the earth sun and moon do you have any idea how many people call I today with absolute certainty that our arsonist be a firefighter like yeah I see Backdraft uh let I call you right back this come into the hotline about 5 minute ago you 've reach the FBI tip hotline for the Bradshaw College fire Karen I do this for Karen Karen I do this for Karen play it again the call come from the office right next to Wallace 's 5 minute before the fire be start play it again Karen I do this for Karen again louder Karen I do this for Karen what be it I be not sure something about it be this tape clean I can put it through some audio filter look we need as close to the real voice as you can get and anything that might be in the background can you do it ok you know how on Star Trek when Captain Kirk ask McCoy to do something totally impossible and McCoy say damn it Jim I be a doctor not a miracle worker hey what be you tellin ' I not to expect a miracle no I be say I be not a doctor that be my girl these be all the woman on campus with the first name Karen a lot of Karens Hmm what if the unsub be one of the student leave no he be not do yet he be not going anywhere keep thinkin ' you mean out outside the box that be what Morgan 's always tell I he say that be why I can never beat you at chess well he be probably right but I mean in this situation what exactly be the box the standard profile of a serial arsonist if everything you know go in the box what be leave what you do not know the unknown sometimes you have to get creative even if you think it be utterly unlikely you have to think of thing nobody else think of like a stutter yeah exactly thank you Karen Karen number 7 you know there be get to be a fast way to do this how 'bout we just change the first question to have you recently date a homicidal pyromaniac speaking of question you figure out yet why the footpath killer stutter Nope you I know that embarrassment make a stutter bad and that when you be fluster it be more difficult to control the articulatory musculature of the face you sound like Reid you do not just say that obviously somebody be be doing their homework I still have no idea what cause a stutter Karen Number 8 hey I do not scare you again do I um sorry this be one of the building on my patrol just lookin ' at the board the 3 body problem you know what it mean uh no no idea it be physics it be one of the great mathematical mystery you break up with her no more necklace yeah I kinda wanna date someone else what be her name Brian oh well that be uh that be a pretty good reason do she take it all right yeah yeah other than tell I that homosexuality be a sin and that I be go to incur the wrath of God the wrath of god okay gorgeous I 've put this thing through every audio filter I 've get there be only one thing I can tell you for sure this guy be not say Karen it be more like Ka rown Garcia what the hell be Ka rown if I figure it out do it earn I a night of passionate lovemaking most definitely sweetness with Reid Bye hey Reid Garcia say it be not Karen it be actually something more like Charown Charown Charown I do it because of Charown that be hebrew it be god 's word in anger yeah the motive be now religious well you know in a lot of religion god be relate to fire well brahman be fire in hinduism and the jews see God as a pillar of fire and christians worship god as a consume fire okay so we be lookin ' for a theology major maybe he be punish the other student for their sin I do not want this what what be the most sinful place on campus Come on Elle when I be in college that be everywhere a fraternity a campus bar no 'cause that be not consistent with the previous target what about the idea of baptism by fire be not we all suppose to be test through fire in revelation look it be good it be good but let us please do not jump to conclusion Religion might be a part of it but it be not necessarily the prime compulsion Gideon rush to conclusion jump to conclusion who care we be run out of time compulsion this be crazy hey Mac get over here you got to see this the building be on fire Bro you get this get out of the way we should call campus security relax man there be always fire during rush week yeah but that be pretty big what building be that dude over here check this out what be it I do not know but it be come underneath the door be someone in the hallway hey someone be try to get in hey man you should get away from there oh my god it smell like gas help oh my god oh my god hold on man outside the box keep thinkin ' it be like chess do not look at just the next move try to look 3 move ahead this be crazy hey Mac get over here you got to see this the building be on fire Bro you get this get out of the way should call campus security relax man there be always fire during rush week yeah but that be pretty big what building be that dude over here check this out what be it dude over here check this out what be it there be always fire during rush week yeah but that be pretty big Dude over here check this out 3 time Professor Wallace Tuesday 3 00 I know why the profile never fit you be right to tell Morgan not to rely on precedent the fire thus far have be completely task orient so once they be set the unsub be do exactly the unsub be not a classical serial arsonist he be someone who use fire because of a completely different disorder which be an extreme manifestation of OCD obsessive compulsive disorder he do everything in 3 's and if I be right he will have to kill again there be a form of OCD call scrupulosity religious obsession and compulsion an obsessive fear of commit sin which create so much anxiety that he be compel to do something to ease that anxiety like set fire where be the behavioral evidence right here all right remember the night of the 3 fire we see the doorknob turning against the lock but he be not try to get in he be compel to turn the doorknob 3 time well what about the fire the first one be single fire if the unsub be OCD should not they have all be in 3 's they be in 3 's a trinity of 3 's the first fire occur on march third 3 00 p m third day third month it be that convergence of 3 ' that cause the overwhelming anxiety obsessive compulsive ease the anxiety by perform the compulsion what about the other fire Professor Wallace Office number 3 I check for more pattern of 3 's his class be on tuesday third day of the week Matthew Rowland be in that class it be his third class of the day if we look into each of the fire we would find a lot of pattern have to do with 3 's because our mind be incredibly adept at seek out pattern but to the unsub once that pattern hit bam he set a fire but if the target be always people why do no one die in the first few fire they be failure up until Matthew Rowland what be it I think I know who it might be and it be not a he it be a she Clara Hayes a chemistry student I will get you her record now first get campus security out and find she she could set her next fire within hour okay get it her apartment 's off campus but how be he sure it be this girl when I be talk to she and her classmate I notice something a ring on her finger and she keep turn it at interval of 3 and she count off the ingredient of a light bulb bomb potassium sulfur and normal sugar Sugar and the word sugar yeah and she keep repeat it once she start she could not stop yeah it be palilalia it be the involuntary repetition of word Howard Hughes have it when his OCD worsen Clara and her classmate be work on a project about gravitational pull the 3 body problem no one in here oh you got to be kid I OCD I be think more like omg OMG oh my god a fire be kindle in my anger and shall burn into the low hell Deuteronomy and again the fire of heaven come down and kill they all I do this for Charon that be Charon that be the greek mythological ferryman of the dead it be also the name of Pluto 's only moon Paradise lose Moloch horrid king besmear with blood of human sacrifice and parent ' tear Moloch be the demon sun God of the Canaanites in order to keep from incur his wrath the people would sacrifice their child to he by burn they alive 16 year old survive inferno the mother Ellen Hayes call it a miracle my daughter be test by God he test my child and she come through bless look at the house number 333 hey Morgan you know what magical thinking be obsessive thought it be like a superstition it control they Kinda like step on a crack break your mother 's back except she actually believe it God test she with fire and now when three 3 's three 3 's show up around another person God tell she to test they Security 's check the science building well where else would she be we need to find the next pattern of 3 's hey Hotch we be lookin ' man I do not think she would have leave behind a day planner that says set next fire here write in it I under wait till you see this place uh Morgan I will call you back there must be 30 homemade bomb in here Morgan seal the building get everybody out of there and walk away we need to send our people into every building and have they start pull fire alarm please go Mead a map of the campus we need to find anything and everything have to do with the number 3 where be the blueprint hell no I be not leave I have too much to

right bye bye you get the science building all the corridor and stairwell be clear the elevator closet 's check no elevator be in service it be not go to start do not you have the key I put it back on the hook in the office be not you suppose to be able to hear the emergency call button maybe it be break or turn off I say we pry open the door you can not pry them all the way open it be a safety precaution maybe we can try yell for help that be the fire alarm Jason wait wait wait wait wait Clara Hayes be very likely a good person someone who never want to do anyone any harm like any other rational person but there be nothing rational about obsessive compulsive disorder Research suggest OCD involve problem in communication between the frontal of the brain and the orbital cortex plus deep structure the basal ganglia you can not reason with she because you can not reason with a physiological problem she be not set these fire because she want to but because she have to what be you try to say do not try to convince she to stop because you will not be able to that be it it will not go any further I tell you it be a build in safety precaution help somebody help we hello somebody help we please somebody we be trap down here somebody help we Clara Clara thank god it be all right Clara go back to the office and get the elevator key it be okay I be here to save you go go get the

a few people let us recommend not raise the terror alert level for now no reason to spread panic we get news this be just a local channel but the coverage be everywhere now CNN FOX MSNBC Al Jazeera you name it so much for not spread panic accord to doctor he be badly injure but in stable condition in the I C U now neighbor say that they hear a blast at about 10 30 this morning and police arrive if DHS do not raise the terror alert now they will look weak make sure Homeland Security know that this be everywhere I just feel that be you all right be everyone all right let us meet at the airstrip in 20 this be live I repeat this be live yeah what be up Hotch listen they be go to be send we bomb fragment by this afternoon I be the only one with an ATF background so if you would like I to stay behind and supervise the bomb profile I be on that Morgan you would not be afraid to be out in the field with a bomber now would you you know maybe it be not the bomber that I be worried about I think we be past all that Hotch Boston send Gideon into a posttraumatic tailspin how do we know that will not happen again Morgan I tell you what why do not we concentrate on profile the bomber and not Gideon copy that Samuel Johnson write almost all absurdity of conduct arise from the imitation of those whom we can not resemble bombing occur within 3 mile of each other first victim be a 74 year old widow Barbara Keller 2 hour after that Clurman got hit in his driveway and 45 minute later well we all see that Jill Swenson 34 year old housewife who live across the street from Clurman of the 3 only Clurman survive be there any connection between the victim one Clurman be a partner in a 10 million condo development deal in which Keller be an investor and a few week ago the whole deal go bust go bust how geologist discover that the land be on methane the condo never got build the land become worthless and Clurman lose a lot of people and a lot of money so maybe one of they be mad enough to take aim at Clurman no let us not get ahead of ourselves it be a little too early to theorize about motive then where do we start from the beginning what do we know about bomber mostly male loner history of criminal activity about 50 of all bombing be actually a product of vandalism and more often than not bomber end up accidentally blow themselves up so the first suspect you always look for in the bombing case be the victim Clurman be the only male lose a large business deal like that could be a powerful stressor well then there be the crime scene Clurman be the only victim who do not get hit at his door why what be different about this one before Clurman pass out all he tell cop at the time be that he see the package sit on the stoop outside his kitchen door why do not he take it in why do not it go off until he get to his car it be like 50 foot away Joe Reese one of Clurman 's investor be here before the bomb go off the cop have rule he out as a s suspect but he say he see Clurman get in the car with the package so maybe Clurman be not receive a bomb at all maybe he be on his way to deliver one but he drop it or tilt it and it go off by accident I would like to talk to Clurman in the meantime let us get a warrant to search his house you have a package do not worry have a police escort all the way from palm beach ok right on time thank man I get this these be my bomb fragment we can start put this bad boy together why bother do not you just look at the piece for print and stuff Garcia what be you do in the FBI I do not get into medical school why do that not surprise I Ouch that be what my father say all right I be about to teach you something so pay attention oh it be like school look how these thing be put together can tell you how the unsub think you sound like Gideon Ok ouch you think it be bull ok all right you see that section of pipe yeah that right there use to be part of the cap it screw onto these thread right here but see here be the thing it have to be do very carefully because even if one tiny grain of powder go onto those thread while he be work that little bit of friction would have ignite the bomb Boom Boom Boom see you later unsub now he do not have to use a powder that fine he do not have to use thread cap and he do not even have to use a steel pipe and it would have be a whole lot safe if he have not but the bomb would not have be nearly as deadly so what do that tell you about our unsub he be one sick puppy to say the least one sick puppy that aim to kill not scare not vandalize or make some kind of political statement Kill where be your team right now down in the garage after they finish the garage make sure they check the attic Agent Hotchner yes sir Detective Morrison Palm Beach P D I be lead on the case nice to meet you this be Agent Greenaway Agents Reid and Gideon be at the hospital I think you meet Agent Jareau at the station house oh yeah she be take over the place she do that ATF have not find any hard evidence yet just some kitchen timer tape recorder and electrical switch yeah it be amazing how many household item count as potential bomb make material hello excuse I Mrs Clurman what be go on here Mrs Clurman my name be Special Agent Aaron Hotchner with the FBI what be you do in my house there be a copy of the warrant on the table I know that this be hard to believe but we just need to cover all of our basis we need to make sure that your husband be not involve in any way involve my husband 's in the hospital with his leg blow off what be you talk about Mrs Clurman there be some question that your husband need to answer and the soon that we talk to he and clear he then the soon we can find whoever be responsible Agent Hotchner we 've get something we find this bury on the back of that shelf Mrs Clurman do you know anything about this what can you tell we about the package Mr Clurman I think I know what it be Pot for an orchid I collect they I order the pot through the mail why do not you take it inside it be for my office I be go there anyway Thought I would take it with I that be the last thing I remember you have an argument with Joe Reese do you remember that Joe be there he be angry he accuse you of blowin ' he off uh any reason he would want to hurt you Joe no I mean he be a confrontational guy but if he want to kill I he would just beat I to death a lot of people be angry about that deal fall apart and they be angry at you how do that make you feel I feel awful I think those condo would make a lot of money for a lot of people myself include I think that geologist be legit he do not even take sample he scamme we all those investor who lose their money Barbara Barbara Keller the first victim what about her it be just such a shame such a nice lady you know it be such an easy sale sometimes I feel like I take advantage of she because she be old and lonely now she be dead well I feel terrible what be it ah my foot get you something yeah this be not our guy his answer be coherent even while he be sedate he be get a sense of humor display empathy not to mention he have a hobby unrelated to bomb make this be nothing like a typical bomber profile what about the material we find well we will see if the fragment match at the bomb scene but I doubt they will ok look at this this be their nephew in Texas and accord to Mrs Clurman he be stay with they for a month and leave last week Mercury switch be a little sophisticated for a 12 year old kid I be not say he be the unsub but boy his age like to blow stuff up I will call Morrison he will contact local p d in Texas and pick up the kid and talk to he you know a watch bomb never assemble I be down to the last few piece and for the life of I I can not figure out how they fit together or if they fit together they might not even be part of the bomb at all what be the big deal you get most of it I would give you a b plus thank the big deal be it could be part of his signature Ooh signature like a sign of the Zodiac that kind of thing yeah yeah just like that I be serious I really want to learn that time Signature be the thing that they get off on like a flourish you know a certain kind of pipe a certain mix of powder like the Unabomber he always use something wood in his bomb I mean I do not know these guy they think they be artist or something so they sign their work and you think by put these last piece together you might find the signature yeah see sometimes the design itself be unique so once we do put it all together we can compare it to other exemplar in our evidence database and see if the bomb be build by somebody we may have already come across what if there be another piece like this no I try that it do not fit no it could have be part of a long rod that fit through the top and go all the way through Tetris Damn it what do I mess something up no no no Garcia you nail it I know who build this bomb the guy be do life in federal prison Morgan e mail these over the three on the left be the bomb from yesterday the one on the right be from the evidence room at quantico they be all identical they be make with steel reinforcement rod Adrian Bale who he hold our agent in a standoff in Boston last year he take out 6 agent and a hostage with one of his bomb so you be think he be behind this possibly but he be in prison he be get kind of a cult follow almost like Manson it could just be a copycat there be one way to find out let us put the screw to this guy no no no Bale 's too smart if we want information from he we have to handle he carefully even then you have to assume that road will lead nowhere you be say the connection to Bale do not help we at all no I be just say let we handle Bale look we just hear from local Texas p D you be right about Clurman 's nephew he admit the bomb stuff be his which be great for the Clurmans but it leave we with zero suspect so what do you suggest my man do now proceed from the profile I do not know we have a profile we be deal with a bomber we be talk about someone who be non confrontational if you bump into he in a cafe he would apologize even if it be not his fault we would classify this bomber as highly organize base on the meticulous design of his bomb it mean above average intelligence he probably have a skilled job a trade one that allow he to work alone that be how he be able to make a sophisticated device without raise suspicion furniture maker jeweler et cetera Background in explosive no not necessarily you be think about a type who like to blow thing up give they an emotional or sexual release that be secondary then what be this guy do murder bomb just weapon and these attack they be not random well how do you know that the process of elimination we know bomber fall into a discreet number of category accord to motive there be the terrorist whose aim be to spread fear we would expect he to strike in a populous area like a subway there be the politically motivated bomber he make a statement by choose a symbolic target like an abortion clinic then there be our unsub he make bomb design to kill and he choose his victim specifically by place the bomb at their stoop that tell we he have a direct motive Statistically he bomb for profit or to conceal a crime and it tell we how we be go to find he through the people he kill Somewhere among the three victim there be a direct motive keep dig thank any question we will be around you will be around I will be in prison Somebody 's get to talk to Bale Detective Morrison how be it go we be comb through all the investor in the land deal get a couple of suspect who fit the profile we be go to talk to they ok well if you need anything just let we know right how we do Frustrated I can not see why anyone would want to kill a little old lady who collect cat and coin unless somebody want the coin I spend a good chunk of my childhood look for a 1944 penny worth thousand yes I be a little bit of a nerd be that so surprising not to I Morgan yeah I just get the lab result from the powder residue on the bomb Ammonia nitrate potassium chloride and aluminum powder nobody use that mixture Hotch Nobody but Bale that be right and the close I look at these thing the more they be the same same weld pattern same switch assembly same thread size it be weird man this guy be not build bomb he be forge they that be the other reason I be call you Bale write address on his package in block letter with blue ink I be think our guy be do the same ok I will set up a press conference make sure the public know thank Morgan excuse I look obviously Bale burn we pretty bad we just want to make sure if we be in a position to make a deal with he that you guy be willing to do it well I think that be premature we be not even sure if Bale be involved yet what if he be you be sure you want to deal with a guy who take out 6 of our agent Half of Florida be in a panic there might not be another choice there have to be Bale you have a visitor you know why I be here this guy in Palm Beach right the Palm Beach Bomber Somebody 's get to give he a well name he use your bomb your design well he should be careful those thing be dangerous adrian you can not fool I if you be involve in this in any way and you do not help I I will make your life even bad than it be now oh but no actually I can fool you because I fool you before and now there be another I out there watch wait we have new information about the Palm Beach Bomber in addition to place the bomb in plain brown package we have reason to believe that the bomber may hand write the delivery address on a plain white label Mommy when be daddy come home he be get to get the beach house ready for the next renter he will be back tomorrow be examine carefully especially if you do not recognize the return address have you unpack your suitcase yet no I will go do it right now with your help we should be able to prevent any further casualty thank you for your vigilance you be more ruthless than I expect if you have not push that button you might 've have a chance at parole someday yeah you know I 've think a lot about that day and there be one thing I still can not understand you trust I why I never trust you you listen to I I make an error I calculate you would not do it and you do whatever you think I be go to walk outta here and you never will here be what I think send those agent into that warehouse it just do not make sense I mean I 've read your book I have all those thing what do you call it um a homicidal triad I even come from a broken family classic sociopath so when I have the chance to kill 6 agent plus a hostage I mean just because I give myself up do not mean that I be finish with those people I still have the remote you you should 've know that and the emotional release I would feel by press that button well that be just a little too overwhelming to pass up why do not you search I before send those agent in why do not you do your job Agent Gideon Mommy there be a present for you Present what do it look like it be brown with blue letter can I bring it to you no keep hold on baby listen the first thing we get to do be to be to get mother

will sure want to be part of it now I be go to stay behind and monitor his mail call visitor any contact that he have with the outside world Good even if he do not know the unsub he may want to try to contact he I might have something Barbara Keller be have trouble insure some coin she buy the insurance company think they might be fake so the insurance company 's blow up annoying client what if someone sell she the fake coin she be on to he he shut she up be these coin valuable enough to kill over she tell the insurance company she think they might be worth 12 000 all right do you have any idea who sell she the coin no but she have an appointment with a coin dealer schedule I be guess to challenge the insurance company 's appraisal a guy name David Walker so maybe he can help we figure out who sell she the coin Office of supreme genius puzzle solver do you have a riddle for I I find out Bale have be access the internet by get around a fire wall that be set up on a prison library computer the guy even have an e mail address wow Sneaky bastard yeah he be head for the library right now maybe to contact the unsub be there a way to possibly monitor his keystroke while he be online I can send he a virus but he will have to open the e mail for it to work let us do it what do you want in the subject line let us think something that will make he open it yeah he be impotent something that will make he feel in control I get something now this guy 's number he be visit 6 porn site in the past half hour anything else hold on he be post to a message board Naughtyhobbies Net look like some sort of site for bomb enthusiast to all my friend out there beware they be onto you we need the name of everyone who be be on that message board in the past month 186 e mail through the

electroplate Look at the date on the coin it be half go he be use this to build up the metal so he could change the date on the coin to increase the value exactly like what he do with Barbara Keller 's coin look over here check this out the good this be why he choose to use Bale 's design he be work on something make sure Morrison tell your officer that this guy be smart dangerous and have absolutely nothing to lose you ready to do some work why not I have not sleep this week I might as well give up eat too oh poor baby try not to let the tear hit the paper get a little messy Hmm really these be email from Bale 's account Reid forward they to I what be we look for right now this guy Walker 's in the wind so we get to look at he from every angle see if we can figure out his next move signature behavior if walker get bomb make tip from Bale then maybe he get tip on stay clear of the cop ha Somebody be be take note medical school schmedical school do not hurt yourself Garcia now find I something so far nothing from the search what do we know about Walker he be a quiet career criminal spend 4 year in prison for a series of forge check when he be in his early 20 he be now 46 past 18 year he own a store which sell coin map and historical document we raid the place as soon as you give we Walker 's name Most of his inventory be fake forgery value in the million but the wall have start to close in on he we talk to some of his client and he be in debt up to his ear and promise stuff he do not have time to forge then Barbara Keller find out that the coin he have sell she be fake she threaten to out he and if she have all the forgery would have be discover he would have do 20 year so he have to shut she up he plant all those bomb just to kill one little old lady yeah and to throw we off he make it look like it be much big than it be you hear I I say stop now please help I everyone back now we need bomb squad in here please it be not I do not come any close put your hand up and walk slowly back out I can'T he will kill I who will I do not know he hold a gun to I put this on I he say you will know who he be what do he want a helicopter and passport he be watch once he get what he want he be get instruction to defuse the bomb Walker 's close by let us get sniper around the perimeter get sniper on the roof ok we understand we be not go to leave you please take it off we need to figure out how the bomb 's put together first Tracy you be in this be a really sophisticated device it look like it be probably make by a master bomb maker which mean tamper with any part of it could set it off be not there some way to just cut the whole thing off he not without cut these wire see how they be thread all around the collar they could be booby trap or there could be a hidden secondary trigger how do we find out without know how it be put together it be go to take a while I will have to x ray it try to figure out which be the real trigger but I do not think there be enough time what do you mean there be a timer we 've only get about 3 hour leave what be it we need to go outside no he say he would kill I if I go back out he make sure I tell you that then we need to isolate you why there be nothing you can do be there anything I do not get it if this guy be a hostage then why have not Walker try to negotiate with we maybe he be scared or maybe he have not figure out what his next move be yet we get a bead on Walker Sniper spot he in his scope he be sit in an office building across the street it look like a storage room with a small window face we we could surprise he good idea if he feel cornered he might give himself up why do you say that because bomber be generally coward I will take a team in and we will go in through the back of the building this feel wrong to I why would Walker let himself be find so easily he want to be find why to negotiate but then we lose the element of surprise hopefully we catch he off guard he may give himself up immediately if not we take a hard line and make he feel like he be get no way out remember we have to take he alive Walker 's the only one who can defuse the necklace bomb everybody ready yes sir let us do it we be enter the building be careful at the very least we know he be get a gun copy that we be approach the door now copy that so bomber be coward huh yeah every last one of they

get it what be you think he be not get enough attention the police department sometimes do not even realize they be look at a pattern yeah until somebody tell them the first story run the morning after the fourth victim be find the increase patrol do not begin until after the fourth victim either yeah the police do not realize what be happen he write his verse and and everyone know that he be there the offender in this new attempt be a black male black male that be cross racial that do not happen what about Herbert Mullin he kill 14 different people of completely vary age race and creed but there be no sexual component to his crime and he wear a ski mask this attacker wear a ski mask tell them we be ready for a profile we be go to make Tommy contact we the unsub bring the weapon with he tape glue wire he do not leave they at the scene he take they when he leave he have a kind of kill kit that he carry organize killer usually have a skilled job likely technology relate which may involve the use of the hand the crime scene be far enough apart that he need a vehicle this will be well keep obsessively clean as will be his home he be diurnal the attack occur during the day so the vehicle may be relate to his work possibly a company car or truck we believe he watch the victim for a time learn the rhythm of the home know his time frame you be not go to catch he accidentally he destroy symbol of wealth in the victim 's home he harbor envy of and hatred toward people of a high social class he feel invisible around they Class be the theme of the poem which he leave at the various crime scene at one point in the poem the woman attempt to bribe death but he do not accept it he say this be the one moment when rich mean nothing when death come the poor and the rich be exactly alike so he be poor probably middle class a decidedly low class person would stick out in a highly patrol neighborhood this guy appear to belong there he blend in why do he glue the eye open the unsub be an exploitative rapist Most rape victim close their eye during the attack turn their head for some rapist this ruin the fantasy for this type of rapist the goal be more related to the victim watch he than the act itself the verse the staging the aggressive language I be death this be a guy who while be in control of the crime scene almost certainly feel inadequate in the rest of his life that be why he could not wait for you to figure out what he have do why he need to make sure all his crime be count his victim they represent whatever it be that be control he and he want that control back he be under the thumb of a powerful woman who frighten he and a final point he be white we have witness that identify he as a black male the attacker be black he be not the Tommy killer Mrs Gordon 's husband come home at the same time that he always do the Tommy killer would 've know that and Mrs Gordon 's attacker wear a ski mask the unsub know when he walk into a house he be go to kill the woman who live there if you be not leave any witness why wear a ski mask and he want the victim to see he anyway your attempt rapist be a garden variety disorganized young man as the victim 's age go up generally the attacker 's age go down Mrs Gordon be about 60 which put her rapist at about 20 and it take year to develop the level of calm and sophistication that Tommy display at a crime scene the rapist be far too young for that Mrs Gordon tell I that there be a young man who deliver grocery to their home he fit a lot of what we be describe here Great so we be back to zero on

handwriting be a match for Trish 's he dictate it to she and they find saline on the paper her tear he never say I he do not say I will call he say you will answer the call he be distance himself from the kidnapping if he say I he would be take responsibility for it there be also another miss element no mention of the police Ransom note almost always forbid police involvement so be he expect law enforcement to get involve well if he be expect we let us not disappoint he www ydy com bb Proudly Presents Sync YTET Ð¡ÐÜ www ydy com bb Criminal Minds Season 1 Episode 5 euripide say when a good man be hurt all who would be call good must suffer with he everyone familiar with the father Evan Davenport U S Attorney executive assistant southern district New York widower assign U S marshal 3 time in the past 10 year due to death threat be the protective detail still current around the clock but Trish decline protection when she turn 18 too bad for the boyfriend but why kill he well if I be go to

instruction and give they the money your daughter will be return do this house be bug free all right bring it in so what be your theory so far about this kidnapper that he target you for a reason every line of the letter start with the word you he be angry at you probably feel like you owe he that everything you own you do not deserve and from the language in the ransom we most likely believe that he be work alone what be she do lie on the road yeah I see that but why she be try to get a feel for what happen to her sister by lie on the ground the girl spend her teenage year perfect way to ditch her bodyguard we be just happy she be in our line of sight Cheryl Davenport Shh just a minute no I be not crazy I be lie here for a reason he drag she from the car this be where she fall Trish be a fighter she would not have go quietly not even with a gun point at her she be right there be nail mark on the car seat so you believe your sister 's still alive I know she be still alive you know the way twin know not the I can feel my twin 's pain crap if you stick she with a needle I do not cry out but if something be bother she if something be wrong I can feel it even from 1 000 mile away at college you study physics right if you be ask why a science major would believe in something non scientific I do not I just know what I feel my feeling be that my sister be still alive they be not entirely identical they be mirror twin some of Trish 's organ be on the right side that should be on the left doctor assure we that it be not life threaten Situs inversus they have self defense training yeah I insist on it the protective detail rankle when they hit puberty and I be sure that they would refuse their bodyguard when they leave for college excuse I can you actually read that fast our conscious mind can process 16 bit of information per second our unconscious however can process 11 million yes I I can actually read this fast if whoever take she want I to blow case or suppress evidence or stand down I what make you think it be someone you prosecute well I have money but I do not have million I mean what else could it be in our experience Mr Davenport every case be different what be he do he 's role play how do that work well he be he be try to think like the kidnapper he be try to get a sense of he through his behavior well that do not sound very scientific do it ok she be rarely without the boyfriend well I know in order to get to she I get to take he out he be collateral damage or be he Shot be to the face that be personal kill the boyfriend get he out of the way so I can get she alone this button answer the call this button make everyone in the room silent it will flash red you will be able to hear his side of the conversation he will not be able to hear we we will be run the trace through the field office but you be in good hand with agent Gideon and his team you think Cheryl be a whack job because she claim she can feel her sister 's anxiety I

I be owe the Davenports will wait by the phone you will receive a call with precise instruction in exactly 15 minute be your able to trace it no he be probably use a disposable cell phone they be impossible to trace she say she could see the moon she sound delirious she be sedate could have be a light if he be keep her drug it might mean he be not very strong he might have to keep she weak just so he can dominate she or he be keep her quiet have Davenport tell we everything about his staff oh yeah we have detailed report but we should probably revisit background on household staff aide and current docket guy she be not blindfold no if she be see his face as soon as he get that money he will kill she he say owe 500 000 his demand sound script like he be read it to we 500 000 be what I be owe but the rest of the conversation be not he be his most relaxed just talk to Cheryl what do that mean maybe he already know she how much time we get 6 minute how quickly can you get the money look I know I should not drink but under the circumstance you would think you could let this one slide he be go to call back we need you at your good have you have many case like this I 've see my share of abduction I do not know how you do it this job how do you stomach it the man I hunt down be coward for the most part they target the weak member of society woman and child there be nothing I would rather do more than put the bastard away I just wish you could get them before they snatch someone Trish be alive you 've trust your feeling this far hold onto that everything will be do by Cheryl Cheryl will gather the money packet only she will touch the money Cheryl will make the drop if she be wire if you use a look a like Patricia die Cheryl will get in her car no one be to be in the car with her no one be to follow her no air surveillance no car surveillance of any kind will be tolerate I will give direction over a cell phone as Cheryl drive she must make the drop at exactly 3 00 a m she will follow each instruction to the letter we can not let she go alone he say if he see anyone I know one car unmarke tint window if he see one of you and Trish die if my daughter die Cheryl 's car have gp we will be able to track her the first thing he be go to do be have her switch car where be we head let us see an address which appear to be a rental car lot you know my guess one of these car have a set of key already in the ignition with a disposable cell phone sitting right in it so she switch car and phone 5 minute he be probably go to have her drive around for over an hour just to make sure no one be follow she and then the ransom drop what be it what be the matter something be not right about this what if he be watch we or listen to we the local office do a bug sweep Come on you hear that ransom call it be way too simple all right you be the unsub what would you have do differently I would have say do not involve the police or the medium 500 000 no consecutive serial number on the bill no marked bill no new bill no tracking device in the money bag no explosive dye in the money bag no tracking device in the car why do not he say any of this Hotch this be never about the money it be not a ransom drop it be a second kidnapping Cheryl get down get down do not move Cheryl 's all right hey hi Hotch that be fun be not it a little run around get our pulse race be you there Cheryl be you there tell I you do not feel a slight tingle a thrill run up your spine Huh but those clever and cunning FBI agent deduce my little plan just in time they figure it out if they have not I would have have you both the whole set the matching pair why be you do this because you ask I to Cheryl you ask I with your glance the way you talk those little gesture what be you do do not answer this man you ask for this you ask for it Cheryl Cheryl what do you want what do I want you it may not be today it may not be tomorrow but I promise you we will be together we can not let Cheryl speak with he any further why not it be only feed his psychosis to allow your interaction be Trish involve in any serious relationship prior to the kidnapping with the boy that be kill they be together for 2 year Trish do not want I to tell you they be getting engage well that certainly could have be the unsub 's stressor what do that mean will someone please tell I what we be deal with here De Clerambault 's syndrome otherwise know as erotomania the belief that someone usually of a high social status but not necessarily a celebrity be in love with you erotomanic believe that the object of their affection be subtly profess their love for they through look gesture Glances he say you ask I with your glance the unsub truly and full heartedly believe that Cheryl and Trish be in love with he they do not tell he this with their voice no with gesture and look he be obsess with they what do this mean he be the most determined kind of criminal Crime of obsession your specialty your lead Morgan I think we should recheck everyone on Davenport 's staff against the profile of a stalker be not stalk behavior pretty diverse there 's overlap narcissistic inflated sense of self worth history of bad relationship what do we know so far he be probably white obviously male sophisticated speech pattern sophisticated yet bizarre he rarely use contraction it be not you be it be you be this guy 's pretentious he want to sound smart than he actually be whatever position of authority or level of success this guy have he have to struggle for it we also have to face the possibility at this point that Trish may already be dead you know so far he be call every play I say we apply some pressure make he sweat well there be only one way to do that hold on hold on hold on what be you do Agent Gideon hello tell I there be a technical issue with the line because if you actually just hang up on m what the hell be you do be you go to answer it why be he do this what be he what you be go to drive this guy crazy just quiet please quiet Cheryl he know what he be do somebody have to answer it just answer the phone for god 's sake pick up the phone do not touch it he know what he be do Davenport residence be you out of your mind you do realize you do understand that I will kill she do you you be kill my daughter pick up that phone get he quiet get he quiet I Mr Davenport get a hold of yourself answer the phone Quiet he she be dead you hang up on I again and I rip her open I be sorry you must have the wrong number come on Gideon you kill she no sir oh yeah then what what the hell do you think you be do I be save your daughter Mr Davenport have a little faith Put Cheryl on the phone no you be finish talk to Cheryl listen to that tone of authority just like your publish work agent Gideon Fascinating to hear the same arrogant quality in your own voice you be a bit of a pedant Jason a bit didactic well that be a very interesting conclusion you sound intelligent and you certainly sound educate and we both know that be not true oh I know all about all of you the ambitious agent Hotchner do you wanna be director of the FBI someday agent Hotchner would you step on Jason Gideon to get there I think you would posttraumatic stress be a very good excuse even your sick pregnant wife can not get you to leave your post Jason Gideon an expert in the criminal psyche yet unable to diagnose the autistic leaning of the very insecure Dr Reid well maybe he can make money counting card in Las Vegas the lovely elle be promote too soon she do not have what it take to make it in the B A u Boys club you be no threat to I you be no threat to anyone and Token Derek Morgan want to be take seriously but he be just a pump up side of beef I know who you be I know how you think and I know what to do next do you what the hell be that why do he say that he know what to do next be he go to hurt my daughter he be grandstand you do not know that you you can not possibly know that Mr Davenport I have learn more in the last 5 minute than in the last 24 hour oh really well I do not understand why be he focus on you right now because we be interfere in his relationship with the girl he say he know all about you yes apparently he profile we Mr Davenport why would he do that to show we how smart he be often time the good profiler be the unsub themselves they be the one able to walk into an arcade full of child and pinpoint the boy or girl that can be lead out quietly but he make a mistake because he give we something he do not expect which be he tell we how to find he you say you know how to find he that you be go to save my daughter why do not you get out there and do something what be you everybody be stand around here look Mr Davenport do not

later jerry middleton kate murray and tim reilly des plaine police have find no link between any of the victim ballistic he be use frangible round which fragment on impact make ballistic comparison impossible the good news be that all the park victim be go to make it the bad new be that none of they see anything however one of the patient do have an intact bullet lodge in his spine what be the prognosis there be a disagreement among surgical staff as to whether they can remove the slug without paralyze the patient well without a useful witness or a solid piece of forensic evidence the profile be all we will have Nietzsche write the irrationality of a thing be not an argument against it 's existence rather a condition of it L D S K S be so rare we have not be able to build a standard profile here be what we do know they be always male and they frequently have law enforcement or military experience and they always contact the police or the medium to take credit or relive the experience both all serial killer attempt to relive the ecstasy they get from their killing some use souvenir take from the victim and other return to the dump site to interact with the body both mode require contact with the victim contact which by definition long distance serial killer do not have the beltway shooter leave a tarot card at one of their crime scene later they call a tip hotline which ultimately lead to their capture but our unsub have not contact anybody he will until he do what do we have sometimes it be not what the unsub do that reveal the profile sometimes it be what they do not do he do not kill his victim Underkill 's a unique signature the question be do he shoot they in the stomach intentionally just to wound they or be he just aim at the big part of the target specifically do the unsub lack the skill to make the head shoot or simply the will to take it Agent hotchner Detective calvin this be agent morgan agent reid thank for comin ' follow I the cone mark the place where the victim be so we know he fire from somewhere in this area close enough to hit all 3 victim but far away enough not to be see his wound his victim intentionally would classify he as a sadistic killer that would help we we know a lot about sadist but most want to be close to their victim to watch they suffer a powerful scope would allow he to observe it from a safe distance so how do we determine if he be a sadist we spend some time in his shoe we let he tell we come on barry you do not know that good morning doctor forgive we we be just review the case at hand this be dr Neil erstadt chief of surgery and our trauma specialist dr Barry landman these be the fbi profiler agents gideon jareau greenaway how be you forgive I I do not shake my hand you understand of course so as psychological profiler s what exactly be you look for how the victim be shoot that could reveal the shooter 's signature behavior these separate wound channel blossom from the entrance wound you can see the trauma 's extensive you perform the surgery on patient miller I consult with dr Landman on the other the intact slug lodge between the l4 l5 vertebrae any attempt to remove it would likely leave the patient paralyze in your opinion in my opinion Disagree with the right surgeon there be no risk there be always risk what significance do the bullet have in build a profile well even if we can not get a ballistic match we can get a rifle type and the specific type of rifle the suspect use that could be very significant to the profile you believe you can safely perform the surgery dr Landman I know I can this handicapped spot could not be far away from the entrance to the building yeah it also have line of sight to all 3 victim and the flagpole what be you thinkin ' at this range the unsub would have to factor in wind direction and speed as he shoot to do this he need a spot with the wide field of fire and line of sight to the flagpole he come here before the shooting decide this be his spot and ensure that it would be empty when he come back my guess be he be shoot from his car well that would mean he want to get away from here quickly that he do not stick around to watch his victim suffer so he would not be a sadist what would he be a very smart very resourceful very paranoid sociopath if I be the unsub why do I shoot my victim between 2 55 and 3 15 that be when I would do it there be few cop on the street why be that well the police overlap shift so there be always someone mind the store second shift start at 3 00 first shift walk at 3 30 would not there be twice as many cop on the street at that time in theory the first half hour of your shift you be in roll call you be not on the street and the last half hour you be at the station you be finishin ' report you be book prisoner so the 25 minute around the first second shift that be a bad guy 's golden window how many people outside law enforcement would know that but the unsub do and you 've already think of this I have consider it hope you find it useful Dr Landman How be mr Middleton Patient will make a full recovery as I tell you he would Radiology be set up to take photo and e mail they out for consult call hotch we be gettin ' the bullet to garcia fill he in on the shift change theory give I a second yeah Morgan be not this spooky be not what spooky that right now you be think about I and out of the blue your phone ring and it be I Huh how be that for a spiritual connection um do I know you why do you hurt I Garcia please tell I you 've nail down the geographic profile on our guy ok I will give you the good news first which be not that good but it be well than the bad we think the shooter have intimate knowledge of law enforcement procedure Detective calvin how far out of your jurisdiction be crime scene number 2 about a sixth of a mile why if he know how difficult it be for local police department to interact with each other he may have intentionally cross jurisdiction line Y'all be sayin ' the shooter 's a cop we be say it be a possibility he scout and preppe each crime scene he choose and elevated position with excellent enfilade and perfect field of fire that be textbook military practice true yeah but maybe he be in the army he be probably a marine ranger or other specialized unit Garcia say the bullet be a 223 fire from the m 4 variant of the m 16 all the service use an m 4 it be get a short barrel than the m 16 it be less accurate and it be a lot hard to fire especially at these distance this level of skill indicate specialized training if he have specialized training he know exactly what he be do he intend to wound they the underkill be deliberate everything he do be deliberate but it be as if he need to show we how smart he be since the crime scene be not center around one single location garcia can not get a geographic profile without additional datum what kind of datum More crime scene she be go to get them this guy be get something to prove how do it play out he be be suspend but my guess be that the school board 's go to go after he and they be go to try to expel he I do not feel very good I be go to go to the lady ' room ok ok Honey you have something on your dress 3 more victim with nonfatal wound and it be only be 48 hour since the last shooting the medium attention and the fbi presence will only escalate his desire to shoot again mean this be go to get much bad the we need to give the police a profile immediately you ready State trooper this be the second time he be cross jurisdiction yeah we be ready they be not go to like it this initial profile be not ready to be give to the medium release this profile prematurely can get people kill we be look for a 30 to 40 year old male veteran drive a car large enough to shoot from but not so large it be notice like the beltway shooter it be probably a sedan customize to conceal the shooter his weapon and the sound of his shot the unsub suffer from both narcissistic and paranoid personality disorder he work out obsessively and be never without a weapon he be completely self center and can not empathize with other incapable of admit fault he blame his shortcoming on those around he he have no friend and his career history have be mark by frequent job change he be draw to high stake job by a need to prove his superiority to a world he perceive have undervalue he and these shooting be the ultimate expression of that need we believe he change jurisdiction intentionally and strike during the first second shift change indicate and intimate knowledge of law enforcement you be say he be one of we we be say he once be or be now a police officer be he drive a white van too enough that will be all for now we can talk in my office thank you Sergeant weigart we would like to reenact the third shooting during the shift change why well to well understand his M o how do he get there how do he leave what be the traffic like it could help we with witness maybe the victim or bystander see something but do not realize the significance of what they see all right let us do it how you holdin ' up look at I without a gun on my belt I look like a teacher 's assistant you be not worried about how you look Hotch tell I that when he come to the bau you tell he he do not need a gun to kill somebody well the only truly effective weapon we have be our ability to do the one thing they can'T which be what empathize they dehumanize their victim we humanize the killer you be just say that to convince I I do not need to carry a gun I do not care you carry a gun or not deadly weapon we have be a thorough and accurate profile of course you believe that Footpath killer he have a shotgun in the back of my head I be here he be not Elle jerry littleton be face a little further south can you give it to we how be that Perfect hold your camera right there it do not look like jerry middleton have a clear view of the sniper 's vehicle when he be shoot the tree branch be in the way I do have a clear view of the vehicle from here Tim reilly would have see it if he have look down from the kite Good have the unsub pop the trunk see if reid can see it no sorry nothing from position one ok everyone move to position 2 and now we go to john jenkins report live from franklin park with break news on the sniper investigation through anonymous source we 've learn you got to see this the fbi profiler have tell the police task force the sniper be in fact a member of the des plaine police department who could have leak this the only people who have the profile be your people and the profile implicate they why would a cop leak sensitive information the would not only implicate one of his own but make every citizen in the county afraid to get pull over what do he get out of it contact with the medium what the cop who leak this story be a good suspect contact the medium could have be his sick way of keep this alive Vic why do not you go ahead and call the station and find out what they 've get in mind for one of the later show Mr Jenkins I be special agent jennifer jareau with the fbi we need you to identify your source no way I know my right hey hey shoot this Vic shoot this get this all on tape you should know the fbi consider these shooting an act of terrorism under the patriot act we can detain you as long as we

cell be part of a batch purchase by the des plaine police department I need a name garcia it be go to take a second I have to pull it from their system then give I the location Franklin park des plaine he be here the name garcia Mccarty scott Scott mccarty Mccarty 's the unsub but where be he Mccarty be play the unsub we need to talk to scott mccarty he be the leak Mccarty why be I not surprised I need swat in the lot asap it be mccarty we need to come heavy we do not say he be the shooter we could just call he on the radio and tell he to come to we Best case he leak the story bad case I be not about to let he take down any of my man we come heavy and we take he clean this be mccarty what be going on toss your rifle and your side arm out of the vehicle and show we your hand I do not understand we know what you do scotty look I can explain do not make I give the order ok all right all right now open the trunk lid slowly come on that be it get he up get down how do mccarty end up play the unsub Weigart punish mccarty for mouth off during the profile briefing by make he the unsub and stick he in the trunk of the car all afternoon wait then how do the unsub find out about the reenactment come on cop talk piss off cop talk loud at home at the bar at gym and to anyone who will listen what do we know our unsub go from wound civilian to execute a police officer so he be escalate he be not stay on script sometimes it be what they do not do he do not pick mccarty at random he do not take the gut shoot why he want to send a message nobody take credit for my work yes sir his ego will not allow it he feel underappreciated ok but we still do not know why he wound they excuse I we know if the killer have no contact with his victim he will contact the medium but he have not contact the medium he have contact with his victim and there be only one way all right thank Garcia nail down the geographic profile the crime scene be center on 2 separate location the hospital I believe it be a case of hero homicide what be that the well know case be hospital nurse richard angelo he would inject toxin into his victim then wait for they to crash so that he could run to the rescue and save they he kill 25 people and that be just what we know of if he attack them to save them why have he kill 25 people be not very good at it yeah and hospital do not keep record of people who almost die so what be the profile on one of these guy Arrogant conceite feel superior to everyone around they you 've just describe every surgeon I 've ever meet uh forgive I I do not shake my hand you understand of course Landman let us start with landman call weigart and tell he we need a discreet perimeter around this block I be go to go check out landman 's car ok Courtesy of garcia Landman be army start out in M P School well there be your law enforcement but he be smart get a degree on uncle sam and end up a doctor with special force and bounce around from hospital to hospital since his discharge in 2001 have dr Landman be have he have a reprimand have he have any kind of major blow to his ego last month he be pass over for chief of surgery let us get a warrant for his house let us see if we find the weapon ok what can I do to help you can tell I where he be right now where be marston she be not come look I be very busy right now perhaps you could make an appointment busy with what thing what kind of thing you be consider I a suspect yes well that be disconcert I hear what happen to your last suspect do you wanna know why collective incompetence have you ever hear of hero homicide would I be less suspicious if I let my patient die absolutely you get anything from his car it be a red 2 seat maserati Heh of course if he be the shooter he have another vehicle this type of killer seek the power over life and death and covet the power of god you know anyone like that I want you to understand something when my patient be in the operating room they need god and that be exactly what I give they when someone be hold your beat heart in their hand who do you want hold it I or god where be you today at 3 00 I be in my office alone I be in my office with dr Hannah pate I be not the only one who think I be a god she be in the e r right now go on ask her Great let us take a walk down to the e r my guess dr Pate be go to corroborate landman 's alibi you do not think landman be the shooter Richard angelo want to be a hero because in his everyday life he be a nobody Landman 's a surgeon he have power and recognition yeah but you know surgeon be a different breed there be star in the field and landman be definitely not one of they excuse I I would like to speak with dr Pate yes sir I will go find she for you the motivation for hero homicide be excitement power and respect and even though landman be not a star he still get respect race against the clock to save someone 's life be exciting but maybe it be not exciting enough that be that be why he shoot 3 people at a time but he can only operate on one at a time it would not be any more exciting at least not for landman and not in the o r the policeman and e r Personnel be on the exact same 24 hour shift schedule the unsub be not shoot at shift change because there be few cop on the street he work the second shift in the emergency room Contact with the victim Sir you can not use the cell phone in the hospital excuse I please we be fbi agent and we believe that one of your staff member might be the sniper the man we be look for work second shift and he would have transfer from arlington about 2 week ago we have not hire any new personnel in 2 month be you sure yeah he have the bad narcissistic personality disorder I 've ever see but it be not likely he look I 've get patient who need I he be in his thirty he be vain rude arrogant he work out he show up to work late he blame other for his mistake do not take responsibility for his behavior all of his coworker detest he it be phillip dowd he be he pick up shift at arlington be he here today oh my god ok ok your patient need you tell I be dowd work today do you see he go tell gideon Reid nobody move

here be a party I would not want to miss Credit card receipt show Freddy love crab cake prefer light beer and use to spend his Thursday night with a woman in fell point an uh expensive woman what about his associate Most of they have criminal record that much I guess but one of they be particularly interesting pull up James Baker 's rap sheet he spend time in juvenile detention for attempt murder be release at age 21 and then subsequently arrest for and this be in order armed robbery petty theft burglary narcotic sale and rape but there be no other sexual assault complaint in his file absolutely nothing I tell you it be interesting what be so interesting about that when it come to psychological behavior anything be possible but this criminal history it just be not probable I mean as a minor he begin with attempt murder and then devolve into pettier crime it be the criminal history of a fractured schizophrenic with multiple personality disorder it just do not make sense unless someone make that rap sheet up and they be not think about the behavior they just plug in whatever sound good hold on his mug shot 's come up I get an address for you to hit Clear Clear Copy that it be clear here Morgan this be weird there be nothing here it be like nobody live here I guess he be not expect company Something 's wrong yeah I know look at this place it be an artificial dwelling to

long about 12 hour before or after the murder you think Jimmy be a suspect well there be a sketch of someone who look an awful lot like he leave the scene that be because he be there after look he run into a couple of Baltimore detective and they make he while he be with Condore now Jimmy try to play it off but he do not think that Condore have buy it so he want to go back and talk to he when he see what be leave of the Dimarcos he call we for a pickup we show up he do not you think he run no Jimmy 's too experienced to run without contact if he be not call in then someone 's keep he from do it who be Jimmy Baker 's target Michael Russo we 've be after the guy for 3 year Jimmy 's be under for almost 2 we talk to Russo yesterday he seem genuinely surprised by the murder and you buy that let I tell you a little something about Michael Russo the guy be a liar and a good one if he do not do it he know who do you know what I be waste my time with you you obviously do not get it Agent Cramer we be not the enemy please sit down we be deal with a very dangerous killer here and we need your help you know these people well than we do this guy if he be what you say he be and he have Jimmy do he kill he already we do not know I will help you in any way that I can you help I get this man back to his family who know about I Jimmy what do you tell they nothing nothing I promise

many more be there well I 've go back 15 year and there be over 100 100 unsolved murder yeah that we know of and then there be more come in well the torture 's consistent you know we think this guy might have be at it a while but this many victim Garcia John Wayne Gacy kill at least 30 people this guy 's more than triple that but this guy gets pay for it he be a hit man no he be more than that not all these victim be mob hit you know my guess be he probably start hunt when he be really young perfect his craft move on to big prey hey Garcia look at this there be no hesitation wound on the body one clean cut through flesh and bone ok so what do that tell we Most people would not imagine do something like this to another human being but this guy he do not even flinch he be get no conscience we 've get ourselves a serial killer with the perfect career Russo have no idea what he be deal with I think we can shake he keep look how can I help you agent we be worried about you what be cause you to lose sleep we hear you do not order that hit on Freddy I tell you I have nothing to do with that why do not you take a look in that folder hey it look like you must have a problem

lancing he be kill civilian now and he be draw a lot of attention and you can not control he that be what he do to Freddy 's uncle Russo if he be not a problem for you now he will be what if you let I worry about that Russo I just get a question for you how do you think your paranoid little killer 's go to feel about you be friendly with FBI huh just a thought Success Hotch and Morgan just shake Russo 's confidence in his hit man he will want to bring he in and get a read on he what if by play they against each other we make Russo as paranoid as his hit man what would stop they from try to kill each other if that happen then we will never find Jimmy Baker alive we get a surveillance team outside of Russo 's office stay on it be this go to work the beam be reflect from the window pane

the case file there be not one the sheriff be on the scene wait for we their location be only a half hour away by plane what be the rush well there be evidence on the scene that could cause a bit of a public uproar a satanic cult www ydy com bb Proudly Presents Sync YTET Ð¡ÐÜ www ydy com bb Criminal Minds Season 1 Episode 10 so Peter Ustinov say unfortunately a super abundance of dream be pay for by a grow potential for nightmare jj we need to obviously keep this out of the press for as long as possible I will do what I can why be that so important there be a nationwide scare in the 1980 involve satanic ritual killing and abuse the satanic panic it be call it begin after the publication of a book about repressed memory be recover through hypnotherapy Memories of grow up with devil worshipper who use child in their ritual and ceremony Most of the claim be later find to be false or just impossible still numerous therapist accept the assertion as true and begin search for similar sign in their own patient after one year thousand of people report the exact same repressed memory the bureau conduct an investigation and conclude that most of the most of the ritual killing or abuse be more urban legend than anything else you be say that there be no such thing as devil worship not at all but most of the satanism that we 've see be juvenile damage property desecrate church cemetery to my knowledge there have never be a prove case of a satanic ritual killing in the united states well maybe there be now Mornin ' John bridge yeah we speak on the phone I be agent Jareau and this be agent Gideon and Dr Reid with the FBI 's behavioral analysis unit hi thank for come out so fast yeah of course there be an in service in Charlottesville last year say if we run into any unusual homicide we be suppose to call you folk soon rather than later yeah they be right be this unusual enough it certainly be interesting you guy must get a lot of this huh satanic stuff not really who find the body a hiker find the first one at the trail and my deputy locate this one while search for evidence we do not even know if it be a man or a woman it be a man the male pelvis be more narrow and the opening at the bottom be heart shape as oppose to oval Melted wax Candle wax candle be use in ritual they be also use on birthday cake actually they be originally use to protect the birthday celebrant from demon for the come year as a matter of fact down to the fourth century christianity reject the birthday celebration as a pagan ritual what kind of doctor be you he be kind of a local hero a high school football star so a pretty strong kid huh I know he use to run out here on the mountain all the time that be not easy be he out here run today he be wear sweat a crime of opportunity or be the unsub lay in wait for this kid specifically Unsub unknown subject the killer if it be a cult do you think they care who the victim be maybe maybe not so we be talk about a blitz attack on a high risk victim one who could defend himself with a weapon pick up at the scene disorganize offender it could be a cult the manson crime scene be textbook disorganized murder this look like a heavily travel area a lot of the local walk these path some tourist too if you be go to conduct a ritual killing would you do it in the middle of a travel path well if the other crime scene be a ritual site where the pentagram be I might blitz the victim here and drag he to the other scene why do not they do lod mean anything to you uh uh I do not know of any significance in satanism either well I could have Garcia research this lod thing if I could get a call out not much of a chance of that out here be there any cult in the area that you know about secret group People you see you do not know much about people who stay to themselves mostly this be a very religious area Church on sunday fellowship on wednesday bible class if there be a secret group I would probably know about it that be an inherent contradiction excuse I he mean if there be a group be secretive you probably would not know look people out here just want a quiet place to raise their kid what I know be none of they be capable of do this find anything interesting down there yeah it do look like some kind of ritual site have any of you ever hear the expression lod or the acronym l o d not I Cherish Cherish Sheriff Bridges it be ok Harris let she in be Adam Lloyd kill out here who tell you that Veronica be he my daughter be with he they be out run together this morning oh my god I can not find she Cherish be miss Cherish be miss help I please take her home we be look for someone who can overpower our victim abduct a girl from a travel path without be see it certainly fit with the cult theory More than one unsub to control multiple victim but if the attack be ferocious enough a single unsub could too kill Adam and grab the girl while she be in shock this be some rough country we only go 1 4 of a mile and we almost got lose the unsub have to be from this area you do not just stumble onto a place like this jj where have the sheriff go he be set up a search party tell he I want he to use volunteer from the area local do you want he to know why no not yet be it wise to alienate he well he think we be look for a monster if we tell he we be look for volunteer so we can profile who show up he might call the whole thing off State will not be here for over an hour we be not go to wait I want you to gather everyone up and I be go to assign grid location yes sir you have a moment sheriff I 've get a missing girl 100 square mile of wood not enough man and in a couple of hour it be go to be dark have you consider use the people that live in the area I be not go to have civilian mess up the crime scene we can instruct they not to touch anything until a member of law enforcement arrive what if they get lose too we can have they sign in to a volunteer sheet and keep track of what grid square they be in look I grow up in a small town you have the state police come in yeah your local can do a well job of find this girl than any statie you know that you will keep track of them I 've coordinate search all over the country let us go Harris I be go downtown do not do anything until I get back all right hey can I come with you guy I need to call Quantico and have they research that

be Cory Spencer Reid who be that nietzsche thus spake zarathustra be rather antagonistic of the judeo christian world view for this town be not it I do not think too many people here would 've bother to read it if they have they would not understand it might as well be a hawking essay on quark theory nobody ever get that reference before be my father around the sheriff he be in his office with another agent Agent I be with the FBI behavioral analysis unit Profilers ha this be mad cool I get like 100 question I go wait why would FBI profiler be here in McAllister there be a murder outside of

Story of my life sunshine Reverend Paul Burke look like he became bear again in prison Prison yeah 2 year as a guest of the state of Ohio for embezzlement I be see a lot of tax sheltering and various

dangerous too right I mean you go after killer and thing really bad guy you ever have to shoot satan command the virgin be sacrifice at the next full moon that be tonight be not it wh what be that blood Tired I be fine we all get they sometimes get what nightmare it be not that bad you want to talk about it you know where I be uh they be ready okay contrary to popular belief there have never be a prove case of satanic ritual killing never a verify human sacrifice having say that there have be isolate case of animal sacrifice many many case of vandalism in the name of satan but that do not mean that ritual satanism be impossible more importantly for our purpose there have be cult that kill just not in ritual fashion the Reverend Jim Jones and the people temple his follower kill a U S Congressman and 3 people before commit mass suicide and leave over 900 people dead and perhaps the most widely know of the killer cult the Manson family under the direction of Charles Manson kill 9 people in a 4 day period in an attempt to initiate a race war Killer cult do exist and they all have one thing in common invariably they be head by charismatic megalomaniac you be look for that leader he be who will stand out he will be memorable to somebody people who be not in his group will see he as strange weird scary since we be deal with profess satanist which be often practice by young male we may be look for teenager heavy metal music be often associate with satanism and these kid and their leader may reflect that in their look most likely there will be sex drug and alcohol and the leader he will be old it be part of his charm and he be from this area he be definitely local these wood be too thick and confusing for a visitor to get around in you think one of our own people be do this we be sure of it I would know if someone be capable of do Dad I know somebody like that his name 's Mike Zizzo he graduate about 5 year ago he be in his 20 but he still hang out with high school

wonder everyone 's all freak out Mcallister 's perfect debutante be in trouble Read the note you think someone threaten to kill this girl be funny no I think someone call Cherish Hanson a virgin be funny you be a satanist Mike Sure and you worship the devil you know what satanism be educate we the word Satan come from ancient Hebrew it just mean opposer Satan oppose the hypocritical moral and dogmas of the so call holy church and its follower if you grow up in this town with god shove down your throat every day you would oppose it too it be all hypocrisy do this do not do that and all the

wicked city like sodom and gomorrah another one a priest from New Orleans he think the hurricane be proof of god 's love those levee do not break until after the storm be over if they have break soon thousand would 've die so I guess the answer to your question depend on whether or not you think you have something to be punish for my friend Cherish she be miss and it be my fault I 've get to give the sheriff a report I will be back as soon as I can you guy need anything Coffee would be nice he take about a quart of sugar in it 2 teaspoon be fine you get it Morgan you know I do not want you to

throw back in my face Mine start 6 month after I get into the B A u yeah mine we be work a strangler case in Montana Four victim I I be still pretty young at the time so you know I be feel myself I be cocky I be arrogant the local they do not have anything so I step up I say I can nail down a profile for you just as soon as I can get what I need More victim she be find the next day so I go down to the scene to do my thing and as I be look over the body that be when I see they her eye Reid they be wide open and there be something different about they it be like they be look right at I like she know I ask for a victim well here she be that be when they start for I Night after night I would fall asleep and I would see those eye they be dead eye accuse eye and it get to the point where it be happen even when I be not asleep Reid everywhere I go I see those eye what do you do Gideon he know I do not tell he I be like you I do not want anybody to know he just he know and he sit I down and he just kind of talk I through it I still have the nightmare to this day just not nearly as often but when they come back I know how to handle they well what do he say do you find her Cherish no do Zizzo say anything we do not know we 've be here the whole time Cory calm down how be I suppose to calm down Cherish be miss do you check all over we search the whole house what about the outbuilding outbuilde do you check the other area back in the wood I do not know there be another area yeah it be like a sluice structure or something he take I there once it be this way let us go the skeleton under the tree he die a year ago he fall off the trail crack his head open he be just some tourist or something how do you know that we go to see the body all the time we watch it decompose who do we do everybody the whole group what the hell be this why do not you tell we Mike I 've never see this before Pentagram body candle l o D Lords of destruction I 've never see this from where I stand Mike it look like you sign it at first we be just curious you know we would go a couple of we at a time show each other none of we have ever see a dead body before and then it kind of become our thing something that we have that our parent do not know about it be ours this be a human being I tell you that we be be punish it be up here this be our secret place Reid I can not believe this be happen this kind of thing do not happen in McAllister you say you read the profiling book you know bad thing happen anywhere anywhere at anytime she in there be she all right Cory she be in there be she dead she can not be dead look we draw our star upside down get drunk and listen to metal that be it hey we do not kill people this be your chance to make this right Zizzo you do not want to make it right you wanna blame someone who do not conform to your view of how people should act and think I need to talk to you all of you Reid I want you to go to the house and see if the deputy have come back what we need the sheriff and the crime scene team here but Reid do it I can not I can not believe Cherish I be sorry about your friend I see she the other day it be a pep rally I 've be with Brandy Dreifort do you know her she be a friend of my son 's she be a friend of Cherish 's too and well they all know about the skeleton who do football team cheerleader everyone they all watch this man decompose like it be a game for their amusement what as far as I can tell the only kid in that area who do not know be Mike Zizzo and the l o d it be ridiculous sound impossible it be unbelievable she tell I all about it the guy be a hiker or something probably have he list miss person somewhere Jason how do you know the l o d be not involve well she say the pentagram and the candle they be not there a few month ago which mean someone want we to believe there be satanist here Reid tell I you 've read all the profiling book actually kinda hope to be one of you guy someday be ya so then you know what profiler do the unsub like to inject himself into the investigation that be what this type of killer do who give we be Zizzo who know all about he you be talk about Cory it be convenient be not it lucky we have a kid right in the room who could tell we where the l o d be a group of fringe kid nobody in the town would like but you call we here to advise you my advice would be to get in front of this before your son hurt himself or anybody else you know where he be sheriff he go up to the Jenson house to see if your guy find anything on Cherish Morgan and Reid be out there right now hey sheriff do you open the gun locker no someone do there be a revolver miss you know that we look at a crime scene from a different perspective than regular cop right we look for more than just the evidence we try to pick up on the behavior of the killer for example the guy we be look for in this crime would be classify as a disorganized killer sound like Zizzo do not it yeah sure it do but then again sometimes a disorganized killer only look disorganized sometimes it be actually an organized guy and pretty smart guy somebody who can manipulate a crime scene to make it look like somebody else do it because of that we also get to look for someone who might try to put himself right in the middle of an investigation so that he can influence thing especially if he know exactly what it be that we be look for I mean he want to control this right and that would extend to discovery Wantin ' the body find when and especially where he want that body find you mean I this be more than just a lucky guess be not it I know about the building you also know about Zizzo and the satanism I be only try to help well you do that we could not have find this place without you hey Morgan no one be up there get over here Reid Reid Cory this got all mess up do not be stupid she be not suppose to be with he it be his run he run it every day not her Cory listen to I we can fix this but you 've get to let Reid go I never mean to hurt she but make no mistake I will shoot your boy right now no you will not tempt not a desperate man put the gun down okay all right you win drop it drop the gun ok ok you win I be put the gun down you be in control Cory let he go for the evil be man 's good force Man must become well and eviler that be what this be about right Zarathustra the superman there be no moral obligation for kill someone if you be superior to they but nietzsche be speak metaphorically about evolve as a species you be just a horny kid who want to get rid of the cheerleader 's boyfriend no yes that be never my intent come on you all right what happen he bring we down here be way too much of a coincidence I get that but do you have to tackle we both you be welcome Reid come on let us go

my listening ear all nature sing and round I ring the music of the sphere this be my father 's world I rest I in the thought of rock and tree of sky and sea his hand the wonder work Wally that be just amazing Charlie do you hear that yes mom I hear it I be go to sing at Mrs Hatten 's Christmas party and she say she be go to give I 5 00 for it 5 00 do you know what that mean what why you be a professional Charlie will you walk Wally home please I be go to go over to Tommy 's and shoot some pool come on Elvis Let us get go Wally your backpack hope everyone have a restful weekend that sound ominous Harringtonville Tennessee population 5 000 64 year since they have a homicide they 've have 2 in the past 48 hour first victim 57 year old widower and grandfather Paul Thompson ambush in his yard 18 stab wound to his chest and his neck no force entry into the house and the only item take be a shotgun last night Annie Stuart 39 be also ambush and it appear bludgeon to death in her home with Thompson 's steal shotgun in this case the unsub apparently steal cd dvd and a little jewelry this be a little extreme for a burglary that be an understatement as you can see Annie 's throat be eviscerate yet the first victim be not eviscerate and the unsub seem to have use a different weapon at each crime scene 2 different m o s 2 different killer or one very psychotic individual what happen to you I get a list of thing I want to try before it be too late and orthopedic surgery 's one of they no skydive apparently it be all about the landing how long on the crutch just a couple day so you can not go out in the field not on crutch no do not worry I will find a way to be helpful here get a blitz attack no effort to remove the body clean up evidence with organize killer we see a pattern we be able to predict their behavior but with psychotic killer they be guide by a give delusion ok until we understand the nature of the delusion we can not predict his next move that be nearly impossible to do actually I think we might have a clue these ring at that crime scene might be some kind of signature I can work this angle I will see if there be any significance to the pattern psychotic killer be normally not that difficult to catch because they do not try to hide do that make your job easy oh no 'cause until we do locate he he will keep do that www ydy com bb Proudly Presents Sync YTET Ð¡ÐÜ www ydy com bb Criminal Minds Season 1 Episode 11 they be here some of them one of them go over to the Thompson house alone he say he wanna get a feel for the neighborhood all of the item steal be take from the upstairs bedroom why do not he take her purse or cell phone or the jewelry off her body it just do not make any sense do not make sense to we either this guy do not come any close to she than he have to what do you mean there be a discrepancy in the profile Sheriff Hall it be quite possible there be 2 people in the house so I have 2 monster out there someone go through the medicine cabinet look for drug excessive methamphetamine abuse can cause psychotic violent episode so you think these guy be junkie I think we be deal with 2 different profile the killer yeah he be a psychotic the other guy though he be just a thief I mean the fact that he do not take the victim 's jewelry suggest that he identify with her Meaning what he probably know her CSU find a soda can by the fence in the grass it be mark by that cone that be right we figure the suspect ' the suspect be lie in wait there ' you speak to the kid who be have a singing lesson that be right why I be just wonder why he do not tell you that he see the suspect what well CSU find 4 of Wally Brisbane 's fingerprint right here on the music stand in this position now from where I be stand my height I get tree branch block my way but Wally 's 7 so that would put his eye line right about here hi I be Elle Greenaway from the behavioral analysis unit of the FBI I do not

be stay right here Wally I hear that you be the only person in this whole town who might have see the man who do this to your music teacher he do not see a thing now do you buddy Wally what do he look like Crazy he be real tall real skinny and his lip be bleed and when I see he through the window he do this the guy the kid describe definitely sound like a tweaker pull the file of all the methamphetamine arrest in the past 6 month will do we should narrow the suspect list down accord to the guy 's residence crime like these be always crime of opportunity so the first guy on our suspect list will live in the close proximity to the victim do have a place where we can set up you can use Simpson 's desk he be out you get a phone there and a computer meantime I be go to narrow down that list work from the assumption the ring be a signature Sir I could help you get some of these book back to your explore their symbolic significance just explore I have nothing well if if I may if you be in your office you would have more room to spread out and you would get a fresh perspective do you think maybe no I need to focus on the manner in which Annie Stuart be kill anything that might have be do to her postmortem get this stuff out of here sorry where be the uh blueprint of the house oh they be right here on the screen I do not want the blueprint on the screen I want something I

anthropophagy Anthro what what you do not want to know give I that I be a big girl I can take it literal greek translation be man eat the guy be a cannibal we be look for a 20 30 year old male the unsub engage in anthropophagy it be a psychotic conviction that he must drink human blood and possibly eat human flesh for Richard Rrenton Chase the vampire killer he drink his victim ' blood because he believe that alien have invade his body and be slowly drink his blood and if he do not get the blood he need he would die Anthropophagy suggest such an extreme level of psychosis and disorganization that he could not have venture very far from home to commit these crime this guy live or have live in this town he know the territory you 've all see he maybe at the ballpark or ride his bike home from the grocery store he be not always a threat he could have be your neighbor he might have be your friend we think something about his delusion be keep he here in town so we be go to

Hotchner I need to be very clear here right now all we get be some theory about a religious delusion I mean how the hell do you explain that sometimes disorganized killer return body part to the grave site it might be nothing it might just be a way for he to manipulate the body even after death but it may also be an act of remorse even in the most extreme psychotic episode there be variation in lucidity degree of insightfulness if I be come out of a delusion just kill someone and drink their blood and I be start to feel bad about it where do I go Sheriff how many church be in this town gentleman this be the bible belt maybe 15 I would post an officer at every single one call in auxiliary cop if you have they all right you get it long get on the phone with I 4 church in 4 block ever

just can not believe a boy like Eddy would do something like this he be the nice kid you ever see he be mentally ill sheriff a boy like Eddy Mays could truly use an insanity plea in a court of law you know the ironic thing about psychotic illness be generally they be less violent than the rest of the population by the nature of psychotic delusion when they do get violent we be never go to get anywhere with he not like this look at the guy you can not read he be right you can not even process he I well call his mother it be a damn shame his daddy die just a couple year ago this be go to fall awful hard on her what be the family like Dad be a doctor and Mary Gwathmey Mays come from one of the old family in Tennessee I would like to meet she we already have I can not believe it it be

incident last year we get he some help Mrs Mays actually there be a way that you can help we anything we believe your son have kidnap a 7 year old boy Wally Brisbane oh lord god and he do not remember what he do with he but if we be able to give he some anti psychotic medication he may become more lucid that be child 's parent must be devastate right now Eddy be non compos mentis but if you be to

have an overprotective mom how overprotective she call he like 3 time a day and get this one time she go up to Boston to break he up with a girlfriend she do not like wow yeah yeah it seem like Eddy

the haloperidol to Mr Mays how long until it take effect it be come on now full effect in about 15 minute or so you have to realize that while the drug will make he appear to be asymptomatic it will not necessarily remove his delusional state will it make he more lucid possibly but let I make this clear I give he the shot because he need to be medicate not so you could agitate he by put he through an interrogation that boy need to be hospitalize well a jury might agree with you but right now he need to answer some question 'cause there be a little boy we need to find thank you hey Eddy

Hotchner and Morgan from the FBI hi you guy can I see your gun this use to be a good neighborhood but this be what happen when you let pedophile and sex freak live wherever they want Ma'am I have be search the sex offender registry two of they live close not that you can tell exactly where from the map on the internet be you talk to they yes ma'am what be a pedophile sex freak hey hey kid kid listen up which one of you be Connie hey sweetheart Ma'am do you mind if we ask your daughter a couple of question why do not we step right over here and the rest of you can go back to play all right Connie I be Agent Hotchner do you talk to a man yesterday about find his dog yeah he say her name be Candy and that she be old but I tell he I could not help he 'cause I have to go home and have lunch and if I be late I get ground yeah well mom be like that and then when he come back I be already late for soccer practice Connie he come back yeah after lunch he say his dog be still lose do you think you would recognize he if you see he again I do not know would you like to go down to the police department and have a look at a book with some man 's face in it it might help you recognize he would that be all right ok thank Connie come back to the same neighborhood twice in one day that be bold he be comfortable in the area what do we know Hotch we talk to a kid who have contact with the unsub Morgan come back to the same street more than once tell we he be at ease in the neighborhood comfortable talk to kid in plain view he lure Billie with a story about a lose dog she recently lose one of her own that indicate previous knowledge of the victim but it do not necessarily mean that she know he only that he be aware it be not uncommon for predator like these to know kid that live around his area he be from the neighborhood then we go door to door and ask for voluntary searcher Neighborhood be already crawl with uniform they be everywhere so far you follow the child abduction response plan to the letter for the past few hour yes so now we need to move past the guideline what change tactic if we do not Billie be not go to make it past the next 24 hour I want you to corral these clown we be go to need them all of them Billie Copeland have be miss 22 hour it be vital that we locate she in the first 24 the unknown subject in this case be most likely a resident of one of the subdivision around the park we have cancel the amber alert we need to coordinate with all your officer to pull everyone off the street immediately that be crazy just hear I out but it go against court procedure you guy write the damn thing Carp be just a guideline for immediate response to child abduction believe it or not we be already late in the game and we do know enough about this unsub to know that if he feel like we be close in on he at all he will kill Billie to avoid detection if anything we need to lessen the pressure on he the man fit in 'cause nobody know what he be can we really know our neighbor he walk his dog do yard work Solitary activity appeal to he but if you watch closely you will see he pay a little too much attention to the neighborhood kid largely go unnoticed because he be not perceive as a threat he be a white male in his late 20 to 30 he have a menial or temporary job socially marginalize and frustrate he relate well to kid than he do to adult this be not his first offense against child but it be his first abduction how do you know that first timer hunt close to home experience predator do not and he be have a recent stressor a job loss or other setback unable to maintain a normal relationship he will have extensive pornographic material in his home and on his computer and while they will not all involve child some of they definitely will since he use the miss dog ruse and we believe he to be a regular fixture of the neighborhood it be quite possible that he truly do own or do at one point own a dog name Candy we recommend cross check veterinary record with resident in the neighborhood he will not inject himself into this investigation do not these guy like to know what the cop know no not this type of unsub he be hide he do not know what anyone see he do not know if there be any information about he out there he be unlikely to walk in ask we can I help you but I can guarantee you he will be watch the news so how we handle they be very important check your canvass record one of you may have have contact with he in the early stage what about register sex offender we 've get somebody work on that right now ok lady and

Danger flood the school with it I remember they come to my classroom it be officer friendly with Stranger Danger color book teach a whole generation about a scary man in a trench coat hide behind a tree then we learn that stranger be only a fraction of the offender out there Most be people you see every day your family your neighbor school teacher you know the rest prepare our child for 1 of the danger make they more vulnerable to 99 so we 've be wrong before all we can do be learn from it and hopefully be well next time Dispatcher Unit 5 3 9 9 9 we have a marked unit call for your presence

bastard 's a pedophile no he be not do you check up on he do you ever search his house his sex offense be solicit a prostitute it have nothing to do with child but he be register on Mr Copeland there be a lot of way to get on that list that be why access that type of information be suppose to be leave up to law enforcement we understand your frustration and your anger but you be jeopardize our effort to save your daughter 's life every minute spend chase you be time we be not spend on Billie so either get control of yourself and follow our direction or stay out of our way what would you like we to do make a public appeal for information regard a witness drive a dark green SUV be not he suppose to be the suspect yes but when people hear suspect they can not see the guy next door as a monster they can not imagine their neighbor could do something like this if he be a witness he might be a hero but what if he think it be a trick what if he panic or think it be too risky and then he it be not just he that you will be speak to it be his neighbor as well we 've do everything we can to relieve the pressure on this man we 've take the cop off the street you will not have any stand with you on the dais only a local minister hear he be not a suspect might calm he down as well right now he be under enormous stress and we need he to believe even if it be just for a little while that we be way off the mark that we be not close to arrest he be you close to arrest he we need the public 's help ok can I have everyone 's attention please if you could just take your seat the Copeland family be here to make an appeal as you all know their 11 year old daughter Billie be miss so if you could just have a little compassion and patience Mr Copeland yesterday ahem yesterday at

got to bet that the police talk to he in their initial canvass maybe not our unsub be a solitary individual he be not the type of guy to insert himself into an investigation would not it make more sense that he would not have answer the door during the initial canvass Neighborhood be crawl with cop canine unit search and rescue make he nervous and jumpy he would want to avoid they at all cost so then he could not allow anyone into his home to ask routine question even if the girl be bind or gag because it would be too risky it be next to impossible to control breathing speech pattern body language when the body be under extreme duress Maybif we compare hotline tip with anyone who be not at home during the initial canvass or do not answer their door we will find our unsub let us get to it Sergeant yeah here be what we need everything that come in here oh my god Billie you have to be strong now you have to how we do all her life when my little girl need help she come to I and now

now the medium 's reporting this as a fail attack on 26 federal plaza well it be not they be not the only one Homeland security feel the same way they be wrong they find nothing at any of the site that you tell they that these guy be target maybe this thing be over or maybe that be exactly what they want we to think as soon as the bomb tech identify the device I want to know about it of course can you get in tight on the bomber here in his hand he be use his cell phone Joyner and hotch approach the van why not wait until they both get in Guess he figure he be close enough would not you wait until they be in it so far these guy have accomplish nothing nothing my partner be shoot cooper 8 innocent people be kill 2 agent blow up not to mention emily 's suicide by cop be that not enough that be memorable this be not Doc Fbi How 's aaron hotchner he be get acute acoustic trauma in his right ear and I pull shrapnel from his leg just lie down Sir Agent hotchner lie down doctor I be all right hotch stop it just calm down doc I get it ok morgan where be kate she be in surgery where be my clothe please Hotch your go bag be on its way have anything happen since the first blast nothing sam he be dead Morgan the profile 's wrong everything everything they 've do so far have appear to be something it be not I do not follow the seemingly random act of murder the attempt to hack into our security surveillance system the suicide by cop to make we all believe that it be over do not forget the death card tell we they know we be watch all diversion to ensure our attention and analysis of any give situation would than incorrectly inform our profile so the first responder be not the real target hotch and kate be a diversion too from what Morgan Hotch want you guy over there now what do we tell homeland security tell they if they love this city as much as you do to keep it lock down it be about to get hit be you ok yeah I just want to understand why I be still alive I think the idea be to maim not to kill do you identify sam the bomber Garcia put sam and the other dead unsub into every know database nothing we know how terror cell evolve they learn from one campaign to the next how to stay off radar like the london bombers yeah but they uh they hit at 8 50 in the morning with a series of coordinated blast aim at london 's transportation system and this cell target a lone suv where the only people on the street be 2 federal agent it be not multiple target it be one target one target one bomb Garcia say the device be place under kate 's suv it be likely make use oxydizing agent include chromate peroxide perchlorate chlorate and red mercury all jam into a device no large than a cell phone imagine what a bomb the size of an oil drum could do yeah but to make something that big you would need a chemical engineer like the recently decease dr Azahari husin asia 's most want bomb maker Authorities dub he the uh demolition man he treat each bomb like a work of art one wrong move he become a victim of his own creation he will be more revered than all of the people who die as a result of his device stop the bomber stop the bomb to do that we need to know how they would deploy something that big Hotch do you ever find sam 's cell phone yes do he call 911 no he dial one number 6 time every few minute it be a disposable cell Garcia track the number but it go dead minute after sam die whoever have it destroy it well if he do not have a secondary device to detonate there be only one reason that he stay with we to make sure the ambulance get to you and in a city on lockdown an ambulance with its siren blaring and light on it be go to make it through every roadblock virtually uncontested this hospital be on a strict bypass what be what be that it mean the hospital be close and straight into a hospital with a bypass order on it what secret service have a bypass on this hospital secret service who be they protect that be who sam be call the paramedic on the ambulance the ambulance which I drive in here this hospital be their target let us go who you get in here why be that information important to you the ambulance I drive in here where be it now in the basement why there be a bomb in it what it be rig it be rig to assassinate whoever it be you be protect you need to get they and everyone else out of here right now we can not do that he be undergo surgery as we speak the paramedic I come in with do you have eye on he that a cell in his hand Garcia can you remote access the cell phone grid I be in and jam all the frequency yeah I can but only for a short period of time there be a bomb in the basement of this building I be on it ok we need to access and pinpoint the 3 close cell tower to the location and then disrupt the satellite feed to they and we need to do it fast here we go look he be come back he be go to detonate the bomb manually if he have to where do morgan go he go to find the ambulance alone let us head down call air

actually get use to that part the problem be deal with the pain you be experience hyperacusis it be cause by sudden loud noise like an explosion so what do we do about it doctor you have a small tear in your right eardrum we will treat that with a bond agent it will most likely heal itself in a week or two most likely the condition can sometimes become permanent but I can go back to work put someone in the field with acute sensitivity to sound would be a mistake Agent hotchner if you be not careful you could lose your hearing entirely I understand good but you will sign my return to duty W what if I say I would take it easy and limit my role in the field stay out of loud place your phone be ring what be up j j this be delilah grennan she be bludgeon and rape during the night at her home in low canaan ohio Lower where small town 40 mile outside of cincinnati stage the body face up with the arm across the chest like that ritual nice hair by the way thank uh there be more small puncture wound on her stomach note the lack of blood they be inflict post mortem be there any other victim kind of Victimology and signature match a serial killer from the same town 10 year ago 6 victim span over 10 month he call himself the angel maker I remember the case they catch that guy and execute he that be right he be put to death by lethal injection a year ago yesterday yesterday so we be look for a copycat honor the anniversary of his hero 's death it say here they find seman at the crime scene perhaps local will get a dna match when they run it through vicap well that be where it get weird they run it already and they get a match too well if they already have a name why have they call we they 've get to be kid the match they get back on the dna be to a cortland bryce ryan otherwise know as the angel maker http sfile ydy com Proudly present http sfile ydy com Sync ßçèâèâ Criminal Minds Season04 Episode02 the Angel Maker a6 Serial Killer Coutimues to elude Police we all die the goal be not to live forever the goal be to create something that will Chuck Palahniuk the angel maker 's victim be beat with the assailant 's bare hand Delilah grennan be bludgeon with a heavy instrument maybe a hammer ok so this unsub 's a weak guy but at least someone who perceive himself that way so he bring along the hammer to make certain his victim would not fight back they have parachute on board right they should it be standard on all federal air transport maybe we can give one to the elephant in the room get he out of here that would be the elephant with the dead man 's dna well obviously somebody plant the semen on the victim in the victim that be one theory there be another think about who share the exact dna makeup of another person Reid you be not seriously float around the idea of an evil twin be you no I be not I be float the idea of an eviler twin traditionally the concept be a good twin and an evil twin but in this case it be evil twin eviler twin hotch yeah you have be clear to fly have not you before cortland ryan this town have not see a homicide in over 30 year he do not just kill those 6 woman he kill a way of life now this thing be get people think he be come back they do not really think that do they I guess when you 've be scare by something I mean really scare that fear be in you forever let us stick to the fact be there sign of force entry none that we could find but whoever kill delilah grennan open up every window in this house before he leave that be a signature from the previous murder a detail we never release to the public and it come out at the trial no sir Prosecution have ryan nail 9 way to sunday do not need it so I be hard press to know how this copycat know about those window the man we be look for be most likely a fan who exhaustively study the first killing and use they to form his own murder fantasy he know this case as well as we well maybe if he have actual contact with ryan while he be incarcerate we send one of our agent to hawkesville prison to look into it and the semen smuggle out of the prison keep on ice bring out on the anniversary of the execution there be an entire cottage industry base on serial killer effect and memorabilia you can find absolutely anything if you know the right people Question be be this a one time commemoration or be it just the beginning what about the puncture wound a6 City Morgue LOWER CANAAN OHIO my good guess be a small screwdriver like a phillip head just like the prior murder this guy be a stickler for the detail the grouping in the prior victim be always different in number and arrangement 3 wound on this one 5 24 he be all over the map but I also find trace of paper in the wound Paper like tissue like notebook paper well that be new Unique to the copycat what be it I do not know it just seem familiar Ryan do not have any next of kin so after the execution all of his effect got box and store this be all his correspondence Copies at least help the warden keep tab on certain prisoner if he can know what be in their mail there be a lot of letter a lot of fan Real lady killer what about male fan some yeah Freaks this one kid would come by Musician I think black clothe and eyeliner and all that he send ryan his demo tape and some sheet music he write in his own blood do you ever catch ryan try to smuggle anything out to this kid or anyone else usual problem we have be stuff be smuggle in not out his dna be find at a fresh crime scene in low canaan what kind of dna we talk about Type of dna that cat in lockup do not have occasion to use all right well listen thank you for all this but I want to look at all your visitor log all right excuse I yeah j j ok uh yeah I be head right back something wrong a local newspaper just get a letter from someone claim to be the angel maker I give you a legacy a breath of life from the angel maker himself those who pray to forget I will one day see my face and shrink in fear that be the last thing people need right now Reid how be it compare with the original correspondence they share some compelling characteristic I would obviously like to look at it under magnification with a well light good guess reid say it be authentic how can this letter be authentic if the guy be be dead for a year could be an elaborate forgery or it could be the genuine article just write before his death well mail here be not that slow or release through an intermediary you mean the copycat we be go over the prison visitor log to check who have multiple visit with ryan try to narrow our suspect pool Sela what be you do here be it true there be a letter how do you know you do not really think you could keep that quiet around here the letter be not from he not the way people might be say what do that mean it it mean we think he have someone on the outside a friend what if you be wrong what if there be no such thing as ghost sela I be not talk about a ghost I be talk about those rumor about the execution how there be problem how it do not work right what be you suggest what if he be still out there do not do that you think I be the only one look outside they want proof that he be dead I have to advise against this all due respect this be not your town I have to convince they that cortland ryan be dead and bury but you be indulge this killer by perpetuate the ruse he be create he be right it may embolden he prompt more murder Sela lose she only daughter to that bastard we meet when I be work the case grow close I think we would get past all this but I guess I be kid myself Hotch Hotch Hotch be you all right can I do anything yeah I be ok I be ok I be ok ok my god Cortland ryan be dead there be no two way about it we be just try to be thorough dr Hagen we hear that there may have be irregularity with the execution his heart be stop his pupil be nonresponsive trust I this be not the first execution I 've pronounce at but it be the last do something happen that day to prompt your resignation from the correction department everyone die different Ryan go hard be all what do that mean doctor after we cycle the drug we realize he be still alive we be not prepare for that how be that possible the catheter dislodge we reinserte it start the potassium chloride he start shake spit he be suffocate Catheter fail again take he almost an hour to die almost as if something be keep he here he say this be go to happen you know that what be go to happen his last word he say he would come back you may think you 've see the last of I but death can not take I from you I will be bear again today you make I a legend always have a flair for the dramatic set the stage perfectly a latter day lazarus return to deliver hell on earth we need to debunk this or the whole town 's go to panic little late for that the grave robbing we can explain it have to be a fan you think the same person that do the copycat murder take ryan 's body it be possible he have to have help someone on the inside I suppose you be go to tell I there be a cottage industry for that too do you know that john wayne gacy paint clown a murder pedophile paint clown and people hang they on their wall it be creepy on so many level I mean clown Garcia I do not know you have that hang up Coulrophobia abnormal fear of clown oh no there be nothing abnormal about it when I be 12 a hobo clown grope my breast at a birthday party and make this old timey honking noise when he do it apparently make it funny make it ok be you able to find any auction on angel maker memorabilia oh my vision I find a ton Mr Maker be quite the self promoter he autograph everything photo pantie and for the discern collector screwdriver you got to be kid I yeah he also make these little origami figurine out of cigarette box which I hate to say be really cute do you pinpoint the most active collector that would be his overseas fan what about local buyer who also turn up on the prison visitor log Zilch what about seller high volume broker might know a broad spectrum of fan there be one guy in particular who seem to be the local distributor as it be you get a name Shebang sid rutledge rutledge you know he he be a guard at hawkesville Sid rutledge fbi Open up just want to talk I can not see anyone oh guy be get two dead bolt he do not use either Sid Sid we be come in Wakey wakey my man Damn one to the grill one to the groin that be personal yeah well if rutledge be sell the unsub memorabilia he know his identity now the unsub 's cover his track Rutledge probably contact he after you pay a visit to the prison he let he in let his guard down boom a little uh heavy on the old spice strike I as an aqua velva guy Man you be good hey it look like he take something hello I think we 've get this unsub all wrong there have be some strange happening in this case but I urge you not to abandon reason in the search of the truth this be not the work of a ghost and it be not the work of a killer come back from the dead this be the work of somebody who live right here in low canaan and this person be a woman her last victim sid rutledge he be the angel maker 's mule he smuggle item out of hawkesville prison include the semen that be plant at the first crime scene she kill rutledge because he know she be the copycat and also because he be blackmail she so I be think you and I need to talk we now know that rutledge be transfer to hawkesville from a female prison in the wake of allegation that he be use his position to leverage sexual favor from inmate and we think he do the same thing to our unsub in exchange for his silence he want sex because she shoot he in the junk right that and the fact that he take a pde 5 inhibitor shortly before his murder a what Viagra we be look for a white woman in her mid 30 and she be highly intelligent and she be not just a fan she be a groupie now she be not what you would normally expect more often than not they be attractive they be well educate they be successful some be even marry generally they fall into type some be reformer they be on a mission to save or rescue these murderer often this type of groupie have be raise in a repressive religious environment and specifically have be expose to the ideal of sexual repression and subjugation of woman our unsub be a different type one who suffer from hybristophilia it be a sexual attraction to man who commit violent crime they give she a power that she lack which stem from low self esteem and a need for a father figure well the victim be rape how do you explain that she be use an instrument to simulate the sexual assault this be something that she keep in her rape kit along with the weapon that she be use to bludgeon her victim this be a list of woman who visit and write the angel maker while he be in prison we 've start to track these lead but the list be extensive so we be go to need your help hey you ever get groupie at your book sign sometimes if barry manilow be not in town any of they look like that Shara carlino she visit ryan over 70 time wait an average of 3 hour for a 10 minute visit mandatory strip search would you endure that for a guy for barry manilow maybe she be a marketing vp in cincy till ' 99 move here take an outside sale job commission only serious pay cut I be guess she come for the view accord to these log you be the angel maker 's number one fan his name be cortland and I be not a fan how would you characterize your relationship we be lover last time I check they do not allow conjugal visit on death row it be not about physical interaction when you take away the flesh there be only the soul everything be understand there be no secret Cortland make I feel alive in a way no free man ever could where be you on the 16th of this month why we believe this copycat killing be commit by a female fan someone who know cortland very well I be out of town with the company Ask anyone here do you know another woman there be no other I I can show you log photocopy of fan letter woman who send cortland picture their underwear they do not mean anything to he but whatever connection you have with cortland be sever when he die not the copycat 's every time she kill it reinforce their love that be of course unless you help we stop she he send I a letter a few month before he he be I know it be not mean for I because it be address to my dove he never call I that do you still have it no I burn it do the text reveal anything about the woman the text be a joke usually his prose be seamless and beautiful but this be pedestrian and crude you never ask he who this dove be I think there be no secret between you you 've never be in love have you Victim 's maxine chandler neighbor say she be live here her whole life all 28 year of it anyway how many kid do she have well none of her own run a day care the guy that call 911 come here to drop off his toddler find maxine in her bedroom Coroner 's in there with she now you check all entry point yeah no damage no tool mark same as the first now that we have two victim we have datum we can compare we should see what victimology can tell we I will get j to bring we the file on the first victim what have you find well I put the time of death around 2 a m Victim be strike multiple time with a blunt object sign of penetration fluid same post mortem mutilation Same but uh different 9 puncture mark this time I wish I could say this be about the unsub 's disorganized behavior or mount rage it do not feel that way no they definitely mean something can I have your pen yeah what be it I be not sure she do this what do you mean the unsub she make these dot like this before she make the puncture wound that be why the coroner find paper in the wound it be a template the angel maker do it from memory but she need a guide to get it right we need to go back and re examine each of the pattern where 's reid here be another one to dove november 2 2006 same thing yeah weather be good here out in the garden all day Birds land on the fence the moon be full now he get an hour a day in a concrete yard there be no garden there be no bird Death row haiku I mean you have to try to write this bad I think he do he try very hard to put each word each letter even in the right order so it be a code this steganographic method would allow he to write letter that do not appear encipher the real message would be hide in plain sight what do you need to crack it the ability to clone myself and a year 's supply of adderall I will put on the coffee small town suck for victimology too much overlap I 've get both woman at the same church same doctor same grocery store she be mimic the angel maker maybe we should look at his victim yeah but there be a disconnect the angel maker choose woman because they excite he sexually the copycat 's satisfaction be not sexual now it be in perfectly re create the murder so what she look for in a victim be someone who be easy to kill which for her mean easy access to their home what do delilah grennan do for work she make jewelry sell it out of her home so they both have home base business a stranger could walk in off the street and be a prospective customer Unsub pose as a client maybe use the bathroom crack the window so she can get back in later let us check their business record and see who come by on the day of the murder no match name Sky 's so clear here huh never see star like this in d c it be beautiful oh my god the puncture wound on the victim 's stomach represent constellation constellation do not tell I this guy be follow the zodiac no these be from a family of constellation know as the heavenly water well I guess we know how he come up with the nickname that be why he would open up all the window after each kill so their soul could be release into the sky Delphinus the dolphin equuleus the little horse anything sound familiar his origami thing there be 9 constellation in the heavenly water the angel maker kill 6 yeah our unsub continue where he leave off first she do vela and then last night she do carina the only one left be columba the dove one more kill and she complete his set she know the meaning of the stomach wound something even we do not know she must have be a lot close to ryan than we think they be not just close they be in love how would you crack it I profile the author

they leave reno yesterday and be plan on stop somewhere for the night they do not use a credit card unless they avel with a lot of cash the room be not too expensive they be not travel on the interstate that eliminate over half of our previous search sound like we be look for somebody who work the night shift at a back road motel and we think he be most likely in his early to mid thirty why be that abduct couple be an ambitious task and this guy 's have time to perfect his skill he could be old do not get hang up on his age that be the hard thing to predict wh we do know be female take extensive beating from he that combine with the sexual assault tell we he be a violent anger excitation rapist a sexual sadist like this can not get off unless he be torture and watch the effect on his victim part of the torture be psychological this be another reason he take couple chance be he force one to watch his power over the other because only the woman suffer sexual torture he be likely a magnant misogynist Thisypically stem from an extreme hatred towards a woman who be relentless in her psychological and physical abuse how do you know the d be not the abusive one and he be just continue the cycle only a woman could make he hate woman this much the idea of the terrible mother be well illustrate in world mythology by the negative aspect of the great mother instead of nurture her child she destroy he and give this upbringing it be highly unlikely he would ever be in a relationship let alone be marry and since he work in the service industry he be force to deal wi a lot of people so he can probably hide his aversion to woman until he get they behind closed door with that say we should not rule out anyone with prior offenses tord woman give the amount of time he spend with his victim he require a great deal of privacy he may even utilize an atv to get away from the accident site so the property may back up onto an off Road trail we should therefore concentrate on the most remote motel first Th oh my god Ian he be right there you just watch I do that you always second guess I trust I it be not go to break I be always second guess you yeah when you want to get into this now we never should have stop oh so it be my fault no I do not I do not say that but you want to go ahead Fine if you have not be hang over we could 've be on the road a lot

none of they be wear underwear how do you know it be take because they all pack it in their bag but none be wear it during theollision he leave his victim in a car without their underwear and wait for

morning well it be still dark out but yes I be sure why your neighbor die around 1 00 be when we find the deceased the shirt be place over his chest the pant over his leg this be the first time we be hear this look at his clothe rossi the dirt stain why would he cover up the body he wear their clean clothe sleep in their nice bed and then put his dirty clothe on the male victim 's body this might be some form of transference transfer of what by symbolically dress mr Sullivan in his clothe he be equalize their status Mr Sullivan have all these thing and he do not this guy get a problem with his station in life he can not bring himself up on his own so he make himself feel well by destroy other and live their life that might be why he stay so long he need that time just so he can feel at home and pretend this be all his he be play out his fantasy give this behavior the dirty clothe the cheap drug choice I would say we be look for someone who be homeless how do a homeless man move about the state like this I have one idea yeah Reid be you in front of a map yeah I be now I think I know how the unsub 's get around do you see track link bakersfield to sacramento he be hop train the guy we

quick morning what can you tell we we 've get an amber alert in effect tip line 's be run through the precinct his photo be on the wire have the phone company be serve with a caller subscription subpoena yeah we will get a name and location if he be call from a land line we will also run the call through our analyst at quantico she can triangulate cell call we need to clear the area of official vehicle if the unsub happen to drive by I do not want he to panic ok I will clear them out after we make introduction how be they handle it separate craig amy bridge these be agent jareau and hotchner from the fbi we just want to say how sorry we be for what you be go through but we be here to do whatever we can to try and get michael home I be go to tell you what I tell the police I do not want to know what happen to that other boy I just want to hear how you be go to find michael we understand no you do not you be right I do not know exactly what you be go through but I do know these case and we be go to need your help of course we know that be it normal for michael to walk to a friend 's house by himself what be you say it be just a question no it be not do you think we have something to do with this no I do not if this be his routine someone could have be watch he for some time now he would only do it a couple time amy and I have a fight about it I think we be baby he I do not want he crawl into bed with we anymore and I think he should be able to walk to a friend 's house by himself alone he be really proud of himself the first time he do it excuse I I be sorry it be like she can not engage in what be go on it be all right everybody deal with it differently I need to know what happen to that other boy there be no bruising around his neck or face I be guess he use a pillow be there any sign of a struggle no but he would have be extremely weak why be that this be where it get weird he be noticeably thin and both his stomach and intestine be completely empty he be be starve it seem that way ok so what be the weird part I want to determine if malnutrition play a part in his death so I look for evidence of starvation ketosis by analyze some vitreous humor the squishy part of the EYEBALL and I could not find any ketone body there mean he be get nutrient somehow through an i v there be no mark to indicate that any idea what else could it be honestly I have no idea CRIME SCENE do not cross not exactly a well preserve scene it be the crime scene investigator they all want to play cop instead of just be scientist and they end up trample on everything so he suffocate the boy at another location prepare the body take he out to the middle of nowhere and dump he except there be no trace of the unsub 's sweat on the boy 's clothing what be you get at well it be like 1 000 degree out here if he carry the body then he would have get trace of sweat on the clothe so he wrap he in something no fiber so he take the time to change the boy 's clothing and groom he once he get here if he take that much time he would have to do it at night but you still run the risk of someone recall your car once the body 's find not if you do not have to park it by the road well you would want to park a distance away from the dump site just in case someone see the car and come to see what you be up to now tell I this if you can drive out into the desert to dump a body why not go in deep where you will not be see from the road because he want to be able to drive by and see the body that be why he groom he it be like he be prepare he for a funeral yeah I get it thank you detective the funeral for the first victim be tomorrow do you feel comfortable ask the family if they would be willing to open the service up to the PUBLIC why be that we feel if they do there be a good chance the unsub will come I will go speak to they craig we would like you and your wife to consider be there as well good anything I think you should talk to amy about it if it might help there be nothing to discuss I understand but please just discuss it with she when the police ask for a picture of michael I could not decide what to give they I do not know if it be right for he to be smile any choice you make would have be right my husband do not know what to do with himself he think we should be out there look for he the good thing for you right now be to just let we guide you through this he think I blame he I be sure that be not true he be right my son be be take I be completely frozen and now I be blame my husband I feel like a monster when they need you you will come through you do not even know I call it intuition I find it when I come into his room after he have be take we do not let he eat in bed I have not move it because I do not want he to think he be in trouble for break the rule you know what you be have it be it be a boy congratulation garcia you ready ready mr bridge let us go back over what we discuss he be get my son exactly just stay positive I 've write down some important phrase we need to answer the phone mr bridge please I think amy should do this she do not want to do this no I do not it be our experience that the parent that be least emotional be good amy you will be great just try to humanize michael at every opportunity he need to see he as a person try to keep he on the line as long as you possibly can the more he talk the more he will reveal about himself hello be you alone um my husband be with I why be you just sit at home when you should be out look for your boy you be right we need to do that he be well off with I thank you for call we to let we know michael 's all right I do not say he be all right I know I be I be just trust that he be ok he be in a well place now may I speak with michael he do not want to talk to you he know what a bad mother you be your 3 minute be up garcia anything it look to be a disposable cell phone I could not triangulate the call but it do bounce off not one but 2 tower mean I know he be mobile and I know he be move within the las vegas limit he do not travel outside the city it be just a start like I say the more he talk the more we will learn about he these be agent morgan and reid they will be here all night just in case he call back I need to lie down of course you should go with her yeah what have you find out from the medical examiner we think that he be starve they but that do not fit with the care he take with the body starvation would be a form of torture there be no sexual assault the torture could be a substitute for the sex act I will coordinate with rossi and prentiss we will call you if there be anything new could not find any evidence of force entry why would that matter 'cause it mean he most likely know his attacker reid get them off morgan get them off get them off morgan get them off I get them off I get them off I get them morgan get them off I reid reid wake up it be morgan what the hell 's go on sir ma'am everything be ok you wake we up scream you think everything be ok I understand we startle you and I be sorry for that you be the f b I you be right I be really sorry sir please go back upstairs and try to get some rest it be just a misunderstanding everything be fine I promise you that be you ok it be a dream I be really sorry be it about michael no I 've be afraid to close my eye I be scared I will see he die ma'am I know it be hard but I need you to go upstairs and try to get some sleep please I be sorry for the disturbance I be make everything bad reid these case get to all of we I be lose it in their living room and I be dream I be dream about dead kid and cover in leech what the hell be scare you this boy 's go to die and there be nothing I can do to stop it I can not do this I be sorry what be you do I be not go to the funeral we talk about this no you talk I listen please tell she this be our only chance we feel like it be a viable plan you be ask we to go to the funeral of a 5 year old boy we be go to watch they lower his body into the ground and the same man who kill he have our son if the man who take michael be there your presence might just startle he we be look for anything that might draw he out I can not watch they bury a child know that we be next we feel like this plan have a reasonable chance SUCCESS what do you consider a reasonable chance that I will ever see my son again 10 20 I can not give you number you could I understand if you can not do this but if you can we need to talk about who we be look for we believe the man we be look for be white he be probably in his late 20 to mid 30 judge by the quality of the clothing he put his first victim in we believe he come from a middle class background this be not someone who be go to be at the funeral in a high end or well tailor suit he also might be pay a lot of attention to the parent of the most recent boy to be abduct watch for anyone whose focus be on they instead of the service itself we also believe he may drive a 4 wheel drive vehicle pay extra attention to those mourner and memorize license plate this unsub dump his last body far from the city and yet he do not try to hide it in fact it be close enough to be see from the road that tell we he be try to separate his action from himself yet he want to be able to drive out and visit the body this be about remorse which be why we believe there be a good chance he will be there today ok if you sense someone look at you you need to tell we we be condition to feel fear the little hair on the back of your neck they tell we the truth j j will stay here if the phone ring she will say she be a family friend and that you be at a funeral you can do this hey kid we be almost ready to go you know they be right odd be we will catch the unsub when he dump the body or when he try to snatch another kid I know the odd reid it be weird some thing never go away when I be a kid every boy I know have pile of dinosaur toy not you I have book and notebook my mom fill hundred of they with poem by w s merwin by BOB DYLAN she like it when I memorize they she be convince that they be watch we and write song about their WIVES basement be the first part of a house to be build right so if you be have recur dream about a basement kinda speak to the core fundamental of who you be as a person I think you do not believe in dream analysis freud be be discredit but jung still have his merit my dream the dead boy I 've be have different version of it since I be a little kid hey you know nobody would think less of you if you take a little time off I just want to find this boy there be a very full crowd here today which I believe be part of the natural outpouring of grief over lose someone so innocent it be also a reminder that there be another boy out there who be in danger and he need of our prayer let us take a moment and pray for that boy for his safe return he be here why be not you help I spencer pay attention reid what be go on I 've be here before in the name of the father son holy ghost amen let we take comfort in the gospel accord to matthew chapter 18 at that time the disciple come to jesus and ask who be the great in the kingdom of heaven he call a child whom he put among they and say ' truly I tell you ' unless you change and become like child ' you will never enter the kingdom of heaven whoever become humble ' be you a friend of the family uh no I just read about it in the paper and you decide to come to the funeral yeah it be sad I love kid I want the family to know that people care and videotape it who be that for we be go to take a walk and we be go to do it very quietly so as not to disturb these people where be you on the day ethan hayes and michael bridge be abduct I be home do not you need to ask what day those be be I under arrest no you love kid you be just help we with an investigation so you have no right to search I why what would we find oh do you like videotape other thing besides funeral how be it go he be nervous they be try to pin he down what be that you mind give we a minute no sure I have one of the detective pull it the name riley jenkins mean anything to you no think back to when you be a little boy I have an imaginary friend name riley when I be little riley jenkin he be murder right here in las vegas when he be 6 year old my math say that you would have be around 4 at the time he be find he in the basement of his own house behind the dryer he have be sexually abuse and stab where can we find michael bridge you be try to frame I you kill ethan hayes and you be hold michael bridge no then why be you videotape a funeral do death excite you oh wait that be it death get you off I tell you I do not touch no you just kill them and find new way to watch he afterwards I be not sick I think you be and I think you desperately want to tell we exactly how sick you really be walter do not you you want we to search your computer and your home because this be eat you up inside and you know you need to be stop I never would have molest that boy which boy the one from the funeral hotchner he do not know detail of the murder you sure he assume the boy be molest all right thank he be not the one I be sorry you say it look good I be hopeful I be sorry but he be videotape that funeral we believe he be a preferential sex offender but he do not have michael how many of these people be out there more than you want to know hello put the fbi on I do not know what you be talk about I see they there at the funeral put they on this be special agent aaron hotchner you be try to trick I you be try to lock I down but you arrest the wrong person why do not we just slow down and talk we only have 3 minute no we have as long as we want that be not the rule ok you be right your rule it be good of you to go to the funeral today you must have really care about ethan I love he his parent do not deserve he I take good care of he be that why you buy he the new clothe they put he in those silly blue sneaker and lime green oxford he hate those well maybe when you be good enough to bring michael home you can tell his parent what he really like no he be

hurt my baby please your time be up you be try to trick I no one be try to trick you you be try to lock I down but you arrest the wrong person would it be possible for we to work in private for a while he be at the funeral I tell you he be at the funeral and you arrest the wrong man I do not think it be a man do you hear the way she describe the clothing she say the blue shoe lime green oxford a male would not reference specific detail like that I think reid 's right she talk about what the child want how he sleep how she take care of he she say I love he a male unsub would have emphasize the competition not the care give he would have talk about how he be smart than the f b I brag about not be catch we could have be look at both man and woman the statistic be overwhelm woman abduct newborn man take child garcia I be right here sir will you run the license plate the police give you and find any that might be register to a woman that would be parameter REGISTRANT FEMALE MATCHING result 0 matching result 0 zero how be that possible transcript almost read like she be be institutionalize you mean she be crazy she describe herself as be lock down not arrest or put away plus most mental facility be very rigid about the amount of phone I think she talk about only have 3 minute be not her rule to we it be what she be be institutionalize to think of as normal garcia can you get record of woman release from mental institution this past month she most likely have some trauma in her case file possibly the death of a child I be sorry I can not do that to protect patient privilege there be no central database I could hack each hospital individually but even then most diagnosis be keep separately by the different doctor I think I might have a way dr reid your mom do not tell I you be in town she do not know I be here I be work on a case and I actually think you might be able to help we of course you 've read about the recent child murder and second abduction yes we think the person responsible be a woman she would have be institutionalize but we believe she may have be release within the past few week just before the first abduction what can I do I be assume you have a good working relationship with the administrator at other hospital I know no one can open their file but if you would not mind just give they the profile that would be a tremendous help she be delusional fuel by grief very well might have lose a child of her own probably around the age of 5 I will see what I can do spencer what be you do here I be here for work we be investigate the

ethan hayes right that be terrible that case get I think about riley jenkin you remember riley jenkins of course I 've be have dream about he for a really long time but when we come back here for this case it jog something and the dream change I see his killer and he be you interesting dream you do not seem all that surprised I stop be surprised by spencer 's mind a long time ago there be certain criterion we consider when look at this type of suspect you fit part of that profile I we just want your cooperation my cooperat you be not actually say you think I kill riley jenkins we do not say that good 'cause that be absurd we would just like permission to look through your computer access your record and what would you be look for exactly you want access to my file get a warrant we can not get a warrant so we have to go under the radar on this one garcia you want I to hack your father 's network you sure about this I really wish people would stop ask I that you be hey you be pretty good be the envelope drop off at the front desk first nope it go straight to my room so they know what room you be in I do have to admit the timing of this be a little suspicious yeah an hour after I see my father we be hand another suspect you think you know this guy I do not know I think so but I be not sure I I no I do not know expose himself to a minor that be a precursor to molestation and murder we should take a close look at this guy it be garcia yeah talk to I baby girl I be not interrupt boy time at crazy horse 2 be I you know that be not my thing I be more for in room entertainment

membership to illicit website no dubious email no chat room history what about his finance we go back 10 year no questionable transaction that we can find well he do buy a ticket to see celine dion 6 month ago but I think we can overlook that he be smart be it possible he keep thing under the table well of course but from what we can tell Reid he do not fit the profile we can tell you other thing about he if you want to know I be listen he be a workaholic he actually log more hour than we do he make decent money but he do not spend a lot of it he have a modest house he drive a hybrid he do not travel much he stay away from the casino um and accord to his veterinary bill he have a very sick cat he appear to spend most of his free time alone he go to the movie a lot and he read and from his

but we all must do what we must do bring dr Reid back with you I never have any normal fan this guy love the attention he have a god complex soon or later he will give up something important about kaylee and the kid guy like he always do before he hurt they 1 45 he say we have till 10 00 we need a button to push the 7 original homicide could give we some leverage he say we will never find any evidence so he have nothing to worry about on they he make of point of say there be no body no physical evidence we just have to show that a crime be commit we can do that circumstantially we need to identify the original 7 woman go back in there with name just might shake he up how do we do that reverse profiling learn everything we can about he and his method and then profile it back to what kind of victim he would choose and from where from the unsub to the victim ok ok get this Hurry hurry hurry go go go come on with I get to a mask hold your breath hold your breath I go through vicap there be literally thousand of open miss woman case across the country it be not the entire country though Kaylee be abduct at 9 30 this morning he have time to take they somewhere hide they and make it to fredericksburg 2 hour later he would need a place with a lot of privacy to hide 5 victim a house he be local he be late for the presentation you know it be more like 2 5 hour after the abduction he get there around noon which put he somewhere around that radius Garcia work up a map we need the farth point he could have take kaylee from loretto and still get back to fredericksburg by noon should not be too hard all right what do we know so far he be obsessively neat and clean he do research on reid and I at least he be abduct 5 people and then get to a scheduled recruitment session at a specific time that be extensive pre planning do you find anything in those picture garcia I can not even positively say they be dead what about hair color all the one that show hair they appear to be brunette so be kaylee I will start there brunette from central virginia that be miss Ident get zip on his print he be not in any system he be a ghost all right if he have not be fingerprint he have not be arrest which also mean he have not have a passport driver 's license or be in the military never be a teacher either you have to be fingerprint to be a teacher so he be a professor who do not teach what kind of professor do not teach a researcher someone on a grant maybe a grant would give he the time there must be some sort of central grant database I can not imagine the government just hand out money and not I will look into it from past conversation we know he be a narcissist and seemingly remorseless Psychopath you know we can eliminate a lot of these open missing person case if we could just figure out how he meet they Jordan contact the loretto p d and get we invitation to consult on the kaylee robinson case be nice to they they do not have to let we and then you and morgan go down there and find out what you can let us go Prentiss I need you to do something for I anything what be our strategy go to be in there with the interrogation you be not go to be in the room what do you mean that be what he want he want to play with you we have to knock he off his game that be all we have right now he be right ok how far could he have go from loretto and make it back to fredericksburg by noon there must be some sort of mathematical equation to do this should have pay more attention in algebra note to self get dr Reid in here asap INCOMING E MAIL what the Golden rat oh no where be dr Reid Busy you have something go on more important than I my dry cleaning be more important than you that be very very hostile I think you be just a big mouth wannabe who do not have the gut to do anything at all about this well then I guess I be free to go I do not spend the last 5 year of my life work on a masterpiece just to fold to a bad bluff especially to someone who do not even have a hand to play Agent prentiss this be professor rothschild may I a god like you do not have a problem with woman do he do I make you nervous it be ok agent I think we have everything we need to know this be not a man who can confront a woman on equal footing he sneak up on they get they from behind Blitz attack the original 7 victim oh they be alone when they come up miss they have a routine and he watch they hide in the weed like a snake like a coward that be a waste of precious time oh it be all part of the game now be not it you think you know what game you be plang david you be not even able to grasp what question to ask such as how about ask what the rule be david Rules 2 00 and then there be four I tell you that in less than 10 hour another 5 people would be dead I never say they would die at the same time it be ok I wonder which one it be the woman or one of those precious baby you have to know the rule to play the game david every 2 hour one of they will die Chelsea in the end they will all be go Chelsea honey be there something else I need to know only that I be root for you David it just pop up on the screen it be they there be only 3 child there be four when I go to go get you what be this on their face they look like gas mask why would you fill a place with gas and then provide gas mask well maybe the gas serve another purpose such as well look how evenly they be space out and the hose be stretch as far as they can go without come off the mask be to keep they in specific position he say one of they be already dead one of the five there be only 3 child be this they an anonymous site email to I he say one will die every 2 hour not all five in ten when he say 10 hour I just assume it be a chess game he be 2 move ahead let us not get divert how we do with the seven miss woman so far I 've get 39 miss brunette in central virginia ok 30 year old like kaylee narcissist tend to be extremely preferential 28 he say he be be work on this

have a lot of time let us continue uh lindsay connor she be last see when she step out to have a cigarette while have a blown tire fix do not sound like something routine Lisa mcdaniel saluda go miss early 2008 while on her daily jog oh she fit that be seven include kaylee that make 8 they be all incredibly beautiful almost unnaturally what be the chance that three out of our seven victim be from the same town what be the population of saluda Middlesex county be small but it be near water a lot of people have boat there and weekend home and two from gloucester point Morgan just send this to I from the robinson house without right or wrong how would we recognize perfection Perfection Analytical mind such as ours 1 1 2 3 5 do that mean something Dr Reid I know where to find they garcia can you put the map of virginia up on screen it be an irrational number know as phi it be base on the ratio of line segment to each other and of the whole it be call the golden ratio Golden rat that be the web address goldenrat Net it be a ratio find all through life in fact many people that we find conventionally attractive be proportion base on that ratio he uh he make a reference to leonardo da vinci remember this Da vinci use it in a lot of his painting a matter of fact the last supper Reid reid how do we find they the whole concept be represent by this pendant include the logarithmic spiral create by use a fibonacci sequence follow I on this you can manipulate this image right tell I what you need pull up all the town that the missing be from wonderful we have one in richmond one in dinwiddie then two in gloucester point and three in saluda and finally 5 in loretto this morning 1 1 2 3 5 be a fibonacci series each number add to the number before it it be what his tick mean he be subconsciously count off the fibonacci sequence in his head over and over again now geometrically it can be express as a spiral it be call a logarithmic spiral can you put the spiral up on the map thank ok now flip it 180 degree now make it big big just a little bit big stop stop stop the pendant be like a key Chester virginia you be sure with his level of obsession with these number the ratio will have permeate his entire life if we take a city map of chester the location where kaylee and her child be be hold will follow one of these point on that map as well the ratio work with any scale at all Morgan and todd be close call they and tell they to get to chester I be go to get a chopper ready Reid and prentiss get a city map and you be with I there be still something bug I about this Chester virginia what the whole team be go there I see they will be there before 4 00 before the next deadline you lose explain something to I this be all about a geometric pattern Phi be much more than a geometric pattern david kill all those woman kaylee robinson the first seven you kill they because they be beautiful you mean hypothetically well I be just try to understand this math thing all animal desperately need a way to detect other of their specie Dogs have scent dolphin have sound golden ratio be a subconscious identifier of perfect humanness if I have do all these thing it would not be because they be beautiful it would be because they be perfect example of humanity because they be human Hypothetically speak this do not make any sense to I kill a human because they be human do you know what homo sapiens sapien actually mean david its literal translation no man wise wise think about that we name ourselves doubly wise we be twice as wise as every other creature on the planet the hubris the arrogance human be a blight we should all be eradicate you hate humanity every bit as much as you do I do not hate humanity I tell you I read all of your book it be in there every one of they your hatred your first book chapter 3 page 89 1 3 89 all fibonacci number the first time I see one of william grace 's victim I know I be look at the residue of pure evil I would never again feel completely safe around a human being this be all about my book like you I know exactly what human being be capable of I can hate the thing people do but have pity for who they be Pity you pity they any man who feel that the only way to have power or purpose be to hurt other deserve pity your fifth book chapter 13 page 144 I know it make little sense to try and deter violence with more violence but deterrence be not why I believe in the death penalty there be some people that be so violent so evil that society have no choice but to be do with they Vengeance be something that society need from time to time if for no other purpose than to keep the rest of we sane where be the pity Sir they find the house you be right they be go inside now thank you Vengeance keep we sane what a fascinating statement you may have your vengeance as I be about to have mine what they be never go to make it out of that house david it be never about that perfect woman or those wonderful child it be about your team your merry band of five they complete my sequence Garcia get hotch on the phone now it be too late david the minute they step into that house they be dead I know if I keep prod you that you would rise to my challenge Hotch be not answer try morgan I know that you would insist on be in the room alone with I that you would try to beat I I know you would send they all out there no nothing try prentiss or reid it be a trap stop they but you be not just fill with hatred david you be also fill with arrogance Hubris just like every other human being just like I I can not reach anyone try again they be never go to answer you lose why what do I ever do William grace the man you call the face of pure evil my brother my life end the day you arrest he every time people talk about william grace they always talk about his parent and his brother henry because no one could believe that anyone that evil could possibly hide in the darkness surely someone must have see someone must have know surely his own brother I have a fianc david a beautiful woman a perfect woman she send the ring back to I she say she be afraid to give it to I in person she be afraid of I she be a brunette so then I start get these thought these idea these image inside my head I could not I could not escape they and then I realize my brother have not be alone in the darkness I share the same genetic you so casually dismiss I start a second life no one know but something be miss I could not figure it out and then David rossi the man that ruin my life and suddenly I know what it be that be miss because you have write it Vengeance Vengeance you murder all those woman just because of I that be right I kill 12 people 'cause of you you take my family I take yours do you get all that every word boss well make copy before we give it to the u s attorney this might make a pretty good teaching aid yes sir teach yeah I teach interrogation at the fbi academy Hotch Garcia say I get it right yeah about everything we find the acid tank around back the acid would have cover the whole area outside the room there be spigot everywhere the entry be booby trap and what about kaylee and the kid they be fine oh they be fine you be right about they they be just one of the decoy that be reid who figure out his obsession with those number he be not about to kill 10 people this afternoon that be not in the pattern you get your confession take some do thank you you would be charge with kidnapping but kaylee and the kid they be all safe you will only face murder charge on the original seven woman with no evidence yeah you uh you mention that when we first meet that we would never be able to get you on those but I think you will discover that the videotape confession have the power to move a lot of juror you wait until I turn my back do not you henry just like you do with those woman do not give I a reason to hurt you and one more thing I be go to be there when they strap you down for that lethal injection and just before they hit the plunger I be go to lean in really close and tell you to say hello to your scumbag brother First solo case they do not always turn out so well do they I wish I be out of line with you this morning no you be not you be right I should have never jump in like that and it will not happen again so what do you think what do I think about what the other case what case tell that detective that you would take a look at it and give he a call Jordan be you serious I 've be a little busy the man be wait for a phone call you tell he you would call he personally be I ever go to catch a break with you I can dial the number if you would like I mean be not you supervisory special agent morgan this be go to be interesting yeah I want you to speak when you mean it that be what I want you to do Sir man must evolve for all human conflict a method which reject revenge aggression and retaliation the foundation of such a method be love Martin luther king jr http sfile ydy com sync ßçèâèâ ATLANTA GEORGIA I feel stupid you look amazing Drink I be go home no come on it be just an off night at any moment Mr Right be go twalk through that oh my be he cute Better have a drink Vanessa Holden age 25 last friday night she be clubng with her sister a stranger white male roughly her age pick she up they leave the club at 1 a m go back to her place he force she on her hand and knee and then he cut she open just below the stomach yeah pretty rough the gutting cause the intestine to spill out you can survive for a few hour actually even day Postmortem indicate that he slit her throat at 5 a m so he disembowel she but do not kill she for 4 hour he could be a sexual sadist yeah I think so too but I find two prior from a year ago prostitute actually in motel room ok so keep run with it why do you think this be the same unsub in Vanessa Holden 's apartment the follow be discover bleach ammonia trash bag all in a triangular pattern one year ago motel room bleach ammonia trash bag also in a triangular pattern he be clean up might be try to hide his track could be a sign of remorse apologize for the murder by minimize the mess but there be one other commonality between both set of murder Bleach and ammonia be find under the victim 's fingernail he be make they clean up their own murder it be the same unsub http sfile ydy com proudly present http sfile ydy com sync ßçèâèâ Criminal Minds Season04 Episode09 52 Pickup Author Harlan Ellison write the minute people fall in love they become liar so if the unsub change the victimology do that make he organized or disorganize well the prostitute point one way the club go another the triangular arrangement of the cleaning supply be interesting obsessive compulsive might have be institutionalize we be miss the forest for the tree here this guy start with prostitute a high risk victimology take a year off come back kill a socialite no force entry no coercion of any kind exactly so how do our unsub go from loser of the year to don juan actually as byron interpret he don juan be an ironic reversal of sex role and when th that be about it something must have happen between the last prostitute and Vanessa Holden make he change his victimology could the unsub have know Vanessa it be unlikely sexual sadist attack anonymously they have to sever a personal connection and see their victim as object to perpetrate this level of torture we have to build two profile then one for the unsub who kill prostitute one for the unsub who go to club we 've never do that before Prentiss be right the victimology be so different we will treat they as separate unsub and see what overlap Reid work up a geographic profile focus on location of the murder Prentiss and Rossi concentrate on the prostitute Jordan Morgan and I will go deal with Vanessa Holden ATLANTA Detective harding Agent Jordan Todd thank you for come Ssas Hotchner Morgan Dr Reid how you do how be you hey be there a dna match between the unsub and the prostitute we could run through vicap just in case um there be no dna at all no print no fiber just like Vanessa everything gets clean up pretty effective forensic countermeasure what about witness somebody must have see something oh yeah lot of people so you have a sketch it be a little vague that be because of this guy 's other countermeasure take a look so this guy right here that be our killer it look like a fedora so he be draw attention to his face while simultaneously obscure it it be call peacocking the adornment of some sort of flashy affect to sort of try to distract witness so none of your witness statement agree he have a mole he do not have a mole he have a gap between his tooth no his tooth be perfect Detective we be go to have to have a sit down with Ashley Holden she get the good look at the unsub well I wish I could make that happen but unfortunately the family have decide to stop cooperate why be that they will not say yesterday the mother would move heaven and earth to help find her daughter 's killer today no thank I will take care of this Garcia be there any leverage you can give I that will help with the Holden family Sugar if they break the law that would be one thing but they have not do anything wrong what about public record anything that might explain why the family shut down I 've get scad of blog posting on they the Holdens be mover and shaker in the city and the nasty stuff follow the money like what the Holdens get what they have come to they why do Ashley get her sister kill Yikes how much to gut the slutty one could you forward those to I good afternoon I be sorry you come all the way out here it be a waste of tim Ashley know absolutely nothing and we want to get this behind we as soon as possible Mrs Holden we can not begin to fathom the loss you 've suffer that be right you can not but um I lose my old sister in a car crash and it be really hard on our family because she be the responsible one she be the one that my mother always count on to watch over we and when she die my mother would not let the police in if she do not let they in then my sister be not really dead this man be a monster and we can catch he but we need your daughter 's help if you accuse she of anything Ma'am I will be on the phone so fast Ma'am ma'am we will not all right follow I do you know that about Jordan no and neither do she accord to her file she be an only child Vanessa 's boyfriend just break up with she so I take she out to you know to have a good time there be nothing wrong with that we you approach by anyone guy can you describe any of they for we Ordinary Look Vanessa be not even in the mood so if she be not in the mood if she leave with this guy then there must have be something about he something unique we see a picture of he on surveillance and we know that he be dress like a rocker so he be pretty flashy right what be the first thing you notice about he his attitude what about it Cocky Confident or do he play it more the broody type he be like he be hit on we but he be like make a joke out of it at the same time seriously you do not recognize I I will give you 3 more guess you know even his eye they be different color so this guy want to be notice yeah that be why you go to a club right and then he have these game like he would bet we drink that we could not get his number or this other one there ok let I make sure you do not screw it up Hmm ok the camera really do add 10 pound what you be so she do not even want to go out that night I have to drag she to the club the last thing she say to I before I leave she alone with that guy be I have the good time tonight the good time the information about Vanessa Holden be the responsible sister where do you get that some of it be on line and some of it be just an educate guess base on birth order a guess and in the process you lie that mother be shut down I need to salvage some rapport I do not know how you do thing in counter terrorism but we do not make it a habit to lie to get the job do I get you in the door do not I not only do you represent the fbi you represent this team to the press the police and to the family who be struggle with some of the hard time of their life if you get catch in a lie the trust we depend on to help solve these crime disappear do I make myself clear it will not happen again no it will not when we get back I want you to prepare a press release about the unsub do not release it from now on everything go through I yeah dave so how bad do I just screw up on a normal scale of 1 to 10 I would say a 6 but on Hotch 's scale an 11 the unsub kill the prostitute in separate pay by the hour motel ifulton county right there in one of the poor neighborhood he area now Vanessa Holden 's apartment be in the peachtree district where there be a lot of big money base on the geography he be not just change his victimology he be change his whole tax bracket the high profile of Vanessa Holden bear that out by kill she he be climb the social ladder if that be the case this unsub have a long way to climb both prostitute advertise here look at their picture Subservient positioning ask to be dominate promise to come to you that cut out the social interaction of meet on a street corner that be a long way from a self assure unsub who hit the club except he take a year off between the murder maybe he take that time to change himself that be impossible why well I mean you be talk about a total transformation here I mean how you talk I mean how you dress how you think about yourself Difficult maybe not impossible he already start kill there must have be a secondary trigger that motivate he to change who he be so if you be go to transform yourself how would you do it a steady diet of self help book start hit the gym you have to learn how to read people I mean what be a pick up it be basically just a profile decode cue of interest and recode similar one if you be too obvious you turn off your target if you be oblivious your target move on to a well profiler that do not sound like something he could do on his own no he would have to go somewhere to learn it yeah a self help class maybe uh wait a minute come on an unsub who kill prostitute be he really think about sign up for a tony robbin seminar he would if he find a class in the same place he find the prostitute learn how to pick up chick I like your style well the preliminary autopsy come back the victim 's name be Becky Williams be she disembowel no and what be even weird be the cleaning supply be set out but there be no trace of they on her body why would the unsub alter his signate and push she out of an 8 story window escalate to sadism maybe gutting and cleaning be what he have to do to find release he would not change that well why not he be change everything else about himself do anyone see the unsub no surveillance camera at the club Becky 's friend say she be talk to a guy with sunglass sunglass so why do he pull out the cleaning supply and then not use they on all the other scene the bottle be arrange in a precise order here they be just part of the mess maybe she fight back and when becky go over the rail his routine have be compromise because he know the police would respond or she could have jump her nervous system be pump adrenaline her fight or flight response kick in he strike two friday in a row and if his routine 's be interrupt it might compel he to strike again it be saturday the club will be pack tonight take a look at the class the unsub might have take we need to generate a suspect pool as soon as possible ok can detective harding get a copy of the sketch to Garcia do you find anything outside no but I think there might be a new pattern emerge Garcia you ready send it now please be aware that 30 minute with photoshop do not allow for much artistic flourish both time the unsub have go to a club he be have some costume but now there be a theme a fedora and colored contact sunglass each time obscure be you ready Garcia this area now yes maybe he be try to draw attention to he but maybe he be try to draw attention away from here something he know be identifiable a birthmark or a scar maybe we need to get these out Jordan release these to the press which be why we be encourage woman to be on the lookout for this man he have be see at club omega suffragette city and we believe he may be attend similar nightclub in the midtown district he may have a scar or a birthmark on his left eye base on witness description and capture image the suspect be white mid to late 20 and I repeat he may have a scar or a birthmark Hotch what do you find out of the 20 self describe pickup artist class in the area there be only one guy who encourage his student to dress like uh space cowboy be you ready to meet viper man be put on this earth to hunt woman and even though woman deny it they want to be hunt they need it it be part of our biological imperative as animal and the competition the opposite sex put you through pit you against other guy against your own friend even it be all to reassure themselves that they have bring home the good possible mate it be just like you they want someone who be go to make their eyeball roll back in their head my job be to help you slash past every defense every excuse every why do not you meet my friend trick that they be go to throw at you you may not have rip ab or afford table service but if you be smart and more interesting then you will be a well predator because this be the jungle my friend and your prey want to be catch will you listen to that language he be training serial killer Great we be deal with a rampant narcissist and misogynist who

victimology reflect that this be the kind of guy who want to stand out in a crowd he be take a class in how to pick up woman so he will repeat a series of well rehearse line and mind game he may be uneducated but he be by no mean stupid take this class have give he the ability to read verbal cue and body language one classic routine the viper promote be call the push pull he will insert himself

out there thank you very much I think I might just stay home and man the tip line tonight club be not really my thing not a chance kid I need a wingman come on now actually there be another angle we need to pursue we still do not know what make the unsub change his victimology what make he stop kill prostitute and move into the club the answer might be something in viper 's class but to figure that out we need to profile the teacher you need to bait he then with someone he see as a challenge we need to study his style up close and personal it be go to take someone that he be already attract to oh this be really go to suck Prentiss yeah come on in hey I be 10 minute away you be ok with this right yeah I will be fine sadly I 've actually date people bad than viper be something go on with Jordan um you ask I to keep an eye on her and frankly I 've notice some tension I catch she in a lie she cut a corner to get we in with the Holden family do she misrepresent the bureau she misrepresent herself so how long be she go to be in the doghouse until she prove she be competent that be go to be tricky if you be scrutinize she every move Prentiss you seem to do ok I think in order for Jordan to prove she be good at this job it be not go to happen under a magnify glass you be go to have to give she the opportunity you have something in mind when you think about the nature of serial crime it be amazing there be not more predator in the club I mean excessive amount of alcohol countless opportunity for date rape drug not to mention surprisingly risky behavior be pursue all right so who want a flier nobody ok all right so how be it go not good I give the profile to one woman she ask if I be the unsub how be you do well I give out all my flier how many phone number do you get none I be work a case here kid ok 4 be offer but I do not take any of they all right look let I school you real quick what you have to do with these lady just take control of the conversation

it why do you teach guy how to be somebody they be not because it be a game one I be good at and I want to help other guy get good at it too so Affection sex emotional commitment that be all just for fun huh no the fun be in the initial spark it be that thing a guy do in the first 5 second that make you go he what you be talk about be a different beast you can not fake it you have to want it now why be you really here be um this the guy you be tell I about viper meet ssa Jordan Todd from the B A u Jordan this be viper god 's gift to woman God sure have a sense of humor you bring a friend you promise if I meet you on your turf you would show I something special so let us see it yeah viper who gets push and who gets pull tonight be this the one that if you stare at it long enough you see the image of a swan I be just wonder if we miss anything remember I say there be a secondary trigger we never find it maybe it be something that come from the class Prentiss could still what he take from the class bring he to Vanessa Holden but I be talk about something much deep psychologically think about this this unsub always go to his victim 's apartment never his own place why be that well there must be some restriction there a nagging girlfriend a cry baby maybe some reminder of how miserable his life be which he be take out on his victim you see eye contact be a very powerful gauge it be why you tend to look away from someone you be attract to because you know instinctively what a dead giveaway it be but your brain go there anyway Images fantasy do not flatter yourself the eye do not lie they dilate it be a chemical response we can not control it ok 15 second what do you see nope no change no dilation I guess chemically we be not a match only because you have someone else on the mind once that happen the attraction center in the brain shut wn your turn no be you scared I might be right yeah no Paul I be baffle I can not figure out what the unsub could have learn from you what do you mean he take my look my word everything that make I successful to the opposite sex really because that guy can get beautiful woman into his apartment I would not let you on my facebook page oh you be on facebook yeah you should friend I I will I give he the routine that make he what he be it must all be in the salesmanship then 'cause we 've be watch all the woman in the club and not one of they have look at you so who do you really go home with Paul or or do you go home alone that be really good lady that be really good do not you think I know why you be here one of my student copy my move and you be here to get inside my mind do not you see I confront my queen bee a long time ago what be a queen bee you be and so be every other confident girl in here who be loud when she be drunk the social butterfly the alpha female every student who be ever take my class have have one in his life and the first exercise my student have to complete be to confront their queen bee it could be the girl who cheat on you or the prom date who stand you up but you find they and squash they our unsub know Vanessa Holden how do you know it be viper 's first confidence building exercise find the source of your first rejection and make her pay for it that be why he stop see prostitute he take viper 's class and decide to confront Vanessa Holden it make sense with what he say to Vanessa that night do not you know who I be look close he mean it literally we need to talk to the family again so what you be say be that you think my daughter know her killer it would have be someone that she possibly meet at a young age maybe a boyfriend someone she reject no Vanessa tell I about all her boyfriend how about someone who express himself sexually to Vanessa it would have be awkward embarrassing and he would have have issue with cleanliness or clean what be it that woman who use to clean for we the one who bring her son who be she I do not remember her name there have be so many people through this house but I remember when she bring this young boy in he be odd how he be inappropriate he would hide in the closet and then watch I catch he one day with Vanessa what be

in the line of DUTY that be 3 officer in the past 4 day after the first shoot the phoenix police department assume gang involvement pretty reasonable assumption true almost 30 of all officer slaying be gang relate technically it be close to 40 if a cop be not kill during a commission of a crime gang involvement be highly likely actually their precinct commander believe it may be a serial and have ask for our help what make he doubt the gang theory a couple of thing last night 's victim be kill exactly thme way as the first shot in the neck something that the press do not release well now wait there could still be a gang behind this killer work together could establish the same m o commander mark have not rule it out but there be another detail trophy killer take their badge gang member do not usually take trophy they do not need to this be an unsub with something to prove and he be get the entire city on edge kill those who protect and serve and no one feel safe ÆÆÀÃÐÜÀÖÔ ° ÇãÇé·îÏ×

humanity to prove it ayn rand go ahead garcia ok while you bird have be in the air I get the 411 on the first shooting apparently every saturday night phoenix p d set up a dui checkpoint be that common knowledge mais oui public awareness be part of the deterrent so our unsub blow past say checkpoint at 90 mph and be pursue by a officer jason kessinger kessinger pull the car over approach the driver 's side window where he be shoot in the throat mon dieu he be a single parent 2 daughter so the unsub plan ahead use the dui stop to set his trap and then lure the officer to his death it could have be personal the unsub might have have a problem with these PARTICULAR officer or with law enforcement in general he be send a message criminal gang member academy washout SECURITY teenager and that be just a start I mean the list of people who have a problem with police officer be a long one the victim be shoot in the neck so the unsub know they would be wear body armor and he use a dui checkpoint I mean both incident show an active understanding of police procedure which narrow it down to anybody who watch television we need to cover victimology GARCIA find out everything you can about the officer killed see what they have in common besides their uniform will do but I should warn you it will not be cake because I have be on the phone with these GUYS all MORNING and pull file from they have be like pull molar be there a problem you know aside from the obvious grief for their fall compadre and their fear of be use as target practice I get the distinct impression from their crabby behavior they be none too please their boss be outsource this investigation to the fbi so be prepared to hit a blue wall of resistance 18 CHANNEL news PHOENIX commander mark I be ssa hotchner this be agent todd hi agent rossi prentiss morgan and dr spencer reid thank you for invite we and thank you all for come although I would like to have a word if you do not mind of course excuse I uh lieutenant evans lieutenant evans will answer any question the rest of you may have I will call you later this way sorry that be officer kayser 's wife they would only be marry a couple of month she seem to think that the fbi be here to save the day be that what you be go to do agent I apologize it turn out I may have waste your time ballistic come back both 357 magnum but not a match look like we be talk about 2 different shooter after all we do not think so really well everyone here be pretty convinced this be a beginning of GANG WAR no I understand that you could see it that way but we believe that the shooting be indicative of a single killer one who be not a gang member you be say one shooter multiple weapon that be the theory both attack be detail well plan out trap not typical for a gang hit and the trophy taking suggest serial pathology as well all right look I know I call you guy in but I be way out on a limb here my officer feel like it be a betrayal like I do not trust they to find this son of a bitch I got to get this settle fast before this WHOLE DEPARTMENT COMES UNGLUED look I get it we be only here to help and not hijack the investigation but if our theory be correct the unsub 's already look for another excuse to kill again see this be twelve 's territory and you think they be behind this do it matter yes it matter to we lieutenant you know this city and its gang well than we do we would like to hear your theory ok twelve have a captain street name playboy vice break up a drug ring shoot his brother d o a playboy think he would kill we all well it be pretty strong motivation but your commander say the dash cam only show one ATTACKER most ' banger will bring some back up just in case well playboy run the tough crew in town he be not most ' banger well you say the dash cam only show one attacker why show your face at all because he have to he want to take they both out at the house but they break protocol rodriguez approach the house by himself wait a minute be you tell I they screw up no lieutenant I be say that they split up force the unsub to take they out separately one here at the house and one at the car that front unit 's empty he could have set himself up there and wait the element of surprise be on his side choice of neighborhood be deliberate neighbor around here be use to hear gunfire they will blame it on the gang and so will the police tech have go over this frame by frame there be no way to identify the shooter approximate height and weight that be about all we get the unsub 's face be not the only way to identify he we also look at specific behavioral trait these be the reason you do not believe it be a gang the shooter establish what we call a signature something he do during the murder that be not actually necessary not part of his m o but identical in every attack in this case the unsub take the officer 's badge he be symbolically strip they of their power and authority this act be indicative of someone who be look to gain self esteem gang member and other assailant who work together kill for different reason but usually it be not to gain confidence 'cause they already have it hotch you see that can we pause this ok now zoom in and press play take the badge would have take a few second he be linger do what that be a good question at least now everyone with force know he be out there it will be hard for he to lure someone into his trap well not necessarily be a cop be always dangerous but even with the extra back up and rover car add to the shift phoenix p d be still go to have to do their job which mean walk into a potential ambush every time they take a call 245 in progress 106 east broadway road repeat 245 report of an aggravate assault copy that behind the car oh yeah look like a couple of bum hey police clear out of here I get it son of a bitch mark mark mark officer down 106 east broadway road copy that officer call for back up 1099 code 2 repeat 1099 code 2 106 east broadway road mark car 5 1 back up be on the way car 5 1 I repeat back up be on the way thank you he set we up we know he be out there he still manage to set we up I be sorry I watch my partner die and I could not do anything to save he do not worry ron playboy 's go to pay for this you see playboy there no but we all know he do it agent no we do not lieutenant you think I do not know how bad you want this guy I be a uniform just like you I see a lot of cop go down before that I watch my father get shoot he be kill do his job a cop 's job so do not think I do not know officer mercer what happen when you get the call nothing special report of an aggravate assault we be on it this your regular beat we be additional tonight add because of the shooting do you get a look at the guy nothing I be too damn scared I be still scared you be not the only one my partner 's family what be I go to tell they the only thing you can tell they that we be go to catch the guy who do this but the right guy anything we can forget cross reference these guy be just assign this beat there be no way the unsub could have know they would get the call he be use the 9 1 1 call like a lottery he be pick cop at random and yet there be nothing random about the shooting each scenario have be increasingly complex he be enjoy the hunt take the time to set his victim up and lure they into his net it be become as important to he as the kill itself and this last one he execute while the fbi and every cop in the city be after he and the press their attention 's feed he play right into the unsub 's need to feel superior the press be not our only problem these guy be still try to pin the shooting on a gangbanger name playboy I have a feeling we be not go to be able to hold they off much long hello playboy what the hell man let us go spend some quality time together time for what whatever you get I do not do it lighten up man I be tell you I do not do it yeah well I get a magic eight ball that say you do playboy commander what be go on what be go on be my officer be be shoot in the street and crucify by the press that be what be go on so you 've arrest the wrong person I bring in a viable suspect for question I have to do something I do not kill no cop period sure playboy just cross your heart and we be do commander I understand the pressure you be under but do this could undermine the investigation bring in another suspect draw attention away from the real unsub if he start to feel inadequate he may strike soon just to prove himself it be also possible accuse one of their member could antagonize local gang which be the last thing your officer need to be worry about right now all right look I tell you guy I be out on a limb here so unless you have a suspect hotch since we 've get this guy why do not we see if we can use he you mind if talk to he be my guest commander I appreciate your let agent morgan join the interrogation but I promise you this be not our unsub the real killer 's still out there I know you do not do it playboy so why you drag my ass in here then I say I know you do not kill those cop but he do not and they do not and trust I they do not care man but you do oh you care about I I do not give a damn about you tell you what I do care about catch the killer I tell you I do not do it but I think you know who do no way man it be not one of we ok I will

sure agent hotchner I have get the chief I 've get the press I 've the mayor do you realize the pressure the department 's under right now yes sir I do but it be not he there be an early murder with the same m o this unsub may have kill one of the twelve and how do that help we this unsub think of himself as a big game hunter now but he do not start out that way mean he start with a gang member and he be evolve give I 24 hour they be not go to wait that long and neither be the chief I will give you four thank man great job evans I need your help I would like you to pull a file on playboy 's lieutenant it be over agent we get the guy no we do not what because he turn out to be a gangbanger after all let it go you guy make a mistake you guy be wrong so be I no harm no foul no offense lieutenant but we be not wrong the killer be still out there and more cop will die you hear what officer mercer say his partner be shoot he could not do anything to save he do you want to feel like that when another one of your guy do get kill or do you want to know that you do everything you could to try to keep it from happen again ballistic be not back yet but the preliminary m e report suggest the weapon use to kill officer beck be not a 357 I speak to garcia beck arrest diablo twice on drug charge last time send he away for 10 year diablo be just release on parole last week so diablo go after the cop who put he away assume it would be lump in with the other murder the unsub would take the fall hey it almost work lieutenant what do you find well I pull up that information on playboy 's lieutenant bobby q there be not much there and you be think playboy be right that we do not pay enough attention to the case do you look the majority of homicide in this city most time we spend time and resource follow trail that all lead to the same place anyway we just assume this be just another one of those trail be in a gang shorten your life expectancy so it be no big surprise when a gangbanger wind up dead same thing could be say about be a cop the job involve a fair amount of risk so a percentage of untimely death be practically inevitable the m o be the same as our unsub 's do um playboy tell you if the killer take a trophy he say bobby q 's necklace be miss yeah that be in the report big chain solid gold just figure the doer take it to pawn it or as a souvenir fit the signature he build up to this we need to go far back garcia can you pull everything in the phoenix area that match the same m o as our unsub not just police officer ok so I be search homicide in phoenix in what the last 2 month make it three get it murder shooting specifically neck wound oh I get a guy name robert quinone nickname bobby q we already have that one anything else ah just one more a bouncer at a bar in downtown phoenix mickey reese weapon 's a 357 magnum interesting it say here the victim be wear a ballistic vest apparently they do not serve shirley temple at this establishment if the bouncer be wear a vest that could be how our unsub develop his m o send we everything you 've get sure do all right we get gangbanger bouncer and cop all pretty tough target victim capable of defend themselves as the unsub 's sense of power escalate so do his confidence lead to big and more difficult prey that make sense risky death would increase the unsub 's feeling of

mencken this be orange county california 10 day ago judy hannity a real estate broker and a mother be shotgun on the 91 freeway she survive this barely she be paralyzed from the waist down the second and third victim be both d o a there be different vehicle for each shooting a small black suv a black sedan a white sedan no make no plate no solid witness the first victim describe the shooter as a normal middle aged white guy in an suv she give that description but she could not rember anything else be not that consistent with trauma uh actually no Trauma victim either remember everything or nothing so wait the third victim be shoot last week we just get the phone call today until the third shooting the local be not convince it be a serial shooter there be different car and the first shooting there be a different weapon it be the same weapon the shot pattern on the second and third one be much wide though he saw off the shotgun it be the same shooter he be evolve and quickly the medium have already dub he the road warrior that explain why they want we there so quickly what do you mean this type of unsub be the hard to catch totally impersonal victim a third of the crime scene flee with he and his vehicle the victim 's car 's a wreck and the last third the road it be contaminate by all the other car that drive over it so how do we get he we build a solid profile we release it to the public with an appeal for help somebody know this guy and it be my job to make they realize Sheriff 's Thea salina sheriff 's county homicide I be run the taskforce I be special agent jordan todd special agent rossi hotchner prentiss Morgan and that be dr Spencer reid be these the vehicle from the shooting yes do you set up the hotline like you ask we have the local station put the number out there we be get about a dozen call an hour I will alert the medium to stand by for our press conference excuse I the sheriff 's department and the chp be on tac alert we 've get chopper on round the clock freeway patrol the victim ' vehicle with map csp and bullet point everything we get on the case be in this room anything solid on the tip line usual nutjob crime buff bored senior citizen you might have get everything square away it be not I it be the shooter the o c have an endless supply of 3 thing Freeways news coverage and blond female luxury car owner People be pretty scared I could ask for a submarine and get it the first m o in the first shooting differ dramatically from the other two Daylight on a crowded freeway that be dozen of potential witness it be high risk he get lucky well then he be a fast study saw off his shotgun and lower his risk by switch to night and change vehicle what if he be not plan on murder the first time you think the first shooting be spontaneous well we know what he be capable of when he plan ahead if I be not plan to commit a crime why not drive my own vehicle so the suv be his actual car but then why do he have a gun in the suv if he be not plan to commit murder and what happen to make he pull that first trigger we need to re interview the first victim Ms hannity I be agent aaron hotchner this be agent emily prentiss we be from the fbi she already tell the police everything she can remember Rick it be ok please it be just the two of we he feel like it be his job to protect I I understand you 've speak to the police I just need to go back through the shooting with you it only come back in piece we can take it slowly just try to piece together your day if you can have you see accident like this before a few do people recover the doctor say she have a good chance it be my fault no this be no one 's fault but the man who shoot your mother I get in trouble at school she be on her way there she should not have even be in her car so you be angry I do not know I suppose I know this be difficult but every detail help we understand who this man be Come on come on move I be impatient and you cut he off be there anything else do he swear do he honk do he threaten you in any way excuse I oh wait hold on one second he try to speak to I what do he say he could not say anything I would not give he a chance what now you want to talk about your feeling like you be some chick you drive like an old lady all right I be back no go on and as I be say if he have not seem so normal I would not have say anything I I usually do not even use my horn because on the road you never know I will ask your son to come back in be she ok she say you 've be take very good care of her I guess so she be lucky to have you so what happen she make it personal when the victimology 's this specific we know the victim represent a specific person to he who give the fact that he be the same age and race as the victim likely a current or former wife or girlfriend so why not just kill the actual person she be just a scapegoat for his own personal failing he know if he kill her he lose that scapegoat so he just go around blow away any woman no just woman that remind he of his wife when this type of killer be trigger they need to release the resentment quickly subsequently they tend to strike close to the focus of that resentment so if the focus be his wife then that focus be his home yeah he almost certainly live in this area this be his kill zone uh what be these various marker everywhere uh roadwork Judith hannity say that he shoot she after she challenge he personally before that he be almost apologetic what be go on out of the 30 roadwork site in the kill zone only 2 be alternate merge both less than 3 mile from the crime scene alternate merge multiple lane funnel down to one one car per lane alternate at the driver ' discretion these site allow he to set up the confrontation a guy who follow the rule may lash out once but to do it again he would need similar provocation so he seek out alternate merge site then he go through they over and over again until he find a woman that fit his victim type and who cut he off so we have to shut down every alternate merge in the county immediately and we need to talk to the crew that work these site so what do all this tell you impersonal killer be like drug addict the first time give they the ultimate high and after that no high be as good unfortunately the addict do not know that he will chase that high to the gate of insanity and death by now kill be all our unsub thing about he be set up the exact same situation again and again hope to get the same result he begin to think he be do it wrong he become obsess with improve his skill hone his m o and tailor his weapon to his deadly purpose he figure if he get they all just right if he can get his technique and his tool perfect he will feel that first high again he be become a more lethal addict and he will never accept that the high be go and it will not come back he will never stop never you know how many car I see drive through my work site here your boss say you be the safety officer that night so so that mean you would have be hold the sign to slow car down we be look for a man in a white sedan and he would have come through over and over again the driver would have be go extra slow like he be dare anyone to cut he off Son of a bitch you remember someone yeah I think the guy be lose I mean I even talk to tony about this guy dress like a hard ass but he drive like a chick no offense none take what do you mean dress like a hard ass this jackass be wear a leather jacket he be get sunglass on they be mirror you know like the cop use but it be dark out he be start to role play he be break from reality do you remember anything else about this man a car cut he off and he stick his arm out across the front seat but after that I do not see he come through again show I what he do with his arm like this like he be keep a passenger from hit the dashboard yeah but the dude be alone thank for your time sure what be wrong a small suv be a family vehicle between that and the hand gesture I be afraid that our unsub 's married with child why do that matter well if he be break from reality and he be lash out at surrogate for his life then it be only a matter of time before he try to wipe out the real thing be you say this guy 's go to kill his wife and kid call your people we need to get a profile out as soon as possible the hyper masculine disguise victim preference and the emasculate trigger of the first attack all tell we this be an unsub suffer a masculine identity crisis a masculine identity crisis that be why he be drive around blow woman away no Judy hannity be just the trigger we need to identify the precipitating trauma something happen in the unsub 's life something so traumatic it turn a normal man into a serial killer so he be suffer from some kind of psychotic break which mean the world he see around he have change and so have his role in it and that of his family his perception of his home life be the key to his pathology at home this unsub feel less than a man a failure as a father and as a husband he feel his child do not need or respect he and that he be unwanted and obsolete in their life as a husband he feels emasculate and humiliate by his wife yeah right that would be good now these belief and perception real or imagine have destroy this individual 's masculine self image this unsub be delusional he be now dress in this road warrior persona it give he feeling of power and purpose that he crave it be now the single most important thing in his life and he will die before give it up his new fantasy persona can not co exist with the everyday reality of his home life which mean soon or later he be go to kill his entire family so what do we do our strategy 's three fold first we find every small

you see how Sharon react when he say to put up the house she be start to doubt he Garcia 's be dig his pc she find an encrypt link to a web page where have it take you an unsearchable untraceable blog with ton of journal entry it be like some sort of diary you find anything incriminate I be able to differentiate between 2 distinct voice 2 author I find various idiosyncratic word phrase punctuation and orthography within the blog entry consistent with each separate person word like soda and pop one guy use dash while the other use ellipsis where have you find this kid he be leave in a basket on the step of the F B I one side of the discourse make a reference to the devil 's strip what the hell 's that it be a small patch of grass that separate the sidewalk from the street that term be only use in central Ohio William live in Atlanta for 20 year but he grow up in Columbus the other guy use word like turnpike and fill the gas tank both specific regionalism for Florida Kid you sure about this right be there a new development can not remember the last time I smile for so long that it hurt I 've never feel like this before sound like you be bored at home havin' an affair I tell you I be happily marry do your wife know about your secret diary I bet she would like to know how good you be at keep secret I be not sure what you think you 've find but you 've go from completely wrong to completely insane you be hide something no jury will convict I because somebody see I at the mall and you think I be talk with someone other than my wife we find Missy tell you so you son of a bitch Detective no damn you that be her that be Missy I look her father in the eye and swear I would find she alive so since we 've be here this girl 's go missing and now turn up dead do you think he dump the body before he be pick up the m e estimate she be kill several hour ago but we 've have William Harris in custody you think we have the wrong guy I do not think so he be communicate with someone he be confident they will not turn against he I do not think he be have an affair he have a partner and that partner be do everything he can to get Harris out of jail I love the challenge the only suspense for tonight be tough but I figure it out perfect timing I watch they chase their little spawn passage truly those first few hour be the good faith should never be break tell I you find his partner it be all so cryptic the end of the day come too soon well they clearly enjoy be together they write a cluster of other after the 1st victim Kim Groves be kill we need to know how they meet there be get to be something about their courtship it all seem so hopeless but I finally learn to rise above it it sound like William confess he be feel incomplete he be he do not start kill until he meet his soul mate Faith should never be break the long they get away with it the strong their relationship these two be not just obsess with rape and murder they be addicted to one another we could have save she there be no sign of his have a partner until now that be why he be so cocky his arrogance be typical of a dominant personality he be find a submissive who kill for he the partner be a biter we find mark on Missy Dewald they never do that with William out of the picture he be change maybe the partner go back to something comfortable something he be do before I 've get Garcia check dental record against other case d A be ready to charge he when Missy be still alive how the hell be we suppose to keep he now I be surprised you be write all this stuff to a fella sound like you have a real special thing going on I be thinkin ' if the 2 of you have just get it on maybe these woman would still be alive so where have you meet he Chat room Porn site Gay bar whoever this guy be he be lookin ' out for you clean up for you Missy Dewald be dead have he call yet Lee jarvis the D A I see his name on the warrant he be get the good conviction rate in Florida do you know why I wanna know why your pen pal kill she when he could have let she rot Jarvis do not like to lose he be not go to ruin his record over this this friend of yours want to please you bad do not he he be protect you doing whatever he be get to do to make sure that you be innocent he kill Missy so you could be together again it be only be a few hour but he miss you and you 've get what exactly from all this Proof that someone out there be just as sick as you it turn out there be a lot of sick pup in central Florida Today 's dental record do not match William Harris but do match a report rape in Manatee county early this year that be great you get a match the tooth belong to the same person any arrest I can not cross reference what about the victim Connie Mayers she still live in the area they be go to ask who you be they do not know we be just buy flower those daisy be nice in your report it say your attacker know what he want that he be confident more like a control freak he wear a mask but I could tell he be white he choke I take a long time for the bruise to go away I swear when the light 's right I can still see his hand right here I be sorry it be not as bad as the bite mark I mean they be scar now I have not be with anyone since so I have not have to explain let I wrap these for you thank you Connie describe an anger excitation rapist just like William so we be lookin ' at 2 dominant personality make sense they have a similar discourse they be equally well write that be a big deal it be rare in criminal partnership if their personality be the same their life be probably like mirror Harris go to church on the board of the p t a Coaches his daughter 's soccer team rarely drink sound like a saint with a dark side that be what he connect to in the partner we will go talk to the family see if they know who it might be 2 alpha male will not be easy to break the partner be definitely follow the investigation Let us do the talk for they I put this out in the public we 've get something well why would he read it he know William will not be write these man be addicted to each other he need a fix and the word they 've share be all he have to cling to his partner write faith should never be break a betrayal could devastate he all we have to say be that William 's cooperating and then hope he take the bait have you notice William pay extra attention to anyone or have he go out of his way to avoid anyone we 've be here for 6 month still get box to unpack suggest that William 's find time to bond with someone you know we think we know the one we love but everybody can keep secret the man we be look for be just like your dad he be smart strong confident he may have a family also so now you be go to accuse someone else 's Dad of murder that be really great it be the last thing we wanna do we believe the accomplice have do this before that victim describe a white man in his forty this may be someone you would recognize and there be a good chance he be go to check up on you and why would he do that he be worried about your dad but he have no way of communicate with he you and your mom be the next good thing he be uncertain right now and that may manifest itself in mood swing we make a deal after Atlanta there would not be a chance for any more misunderstanding and how be that work out for you so do you like where you live I do yeah D C 's nice so be this place now it be just like Atlanta everyone think my dad 's guilty and it will just get bad I be sorry about that what have we get so far we be surprised that you inject yourself into the investigation you risk a lot in order to help William and killin ' Missy tell we how close you really be it must be devastating to learn that William be here with we he be not go to like that sound like William 's cooperating that be exactly what we want so he will doubt their alliance Most entry follow the 1st murder yeah William write most of they I be not expect that type of gift I wish time do not take away all the pleasure of the day get to see this what be that smirk Sharon be post bail I be thinkin ' about where to go for dinner you know maybe we get it wrong maybe they be not both alpha male maybe we will go to Salvatores Partner make the first move he be the one with the ball yeah and it be pretty risky too think about it what if you do turn in here or at least your partner think you turn in here then he would have no choice but to turn himself in your life would be ruin that be the reason it work you both have everything to lose he be only clean up because he can not afford to get catch either be I right how be go to react to the entry we write he know we be read your little love letter so we decide to send one ourselves let he know you be in here help we out he be probably feel pretty betray right about now and if he be what do you think he be doing about it William you write thank for the perfect place to play what be you talkin ' about Golfing Golfing Golfing right what be it like Perfect I 've never let them see my face before I either you think she be go to talk they all think about it but too scared I do not know this one this one seem defiant

all these gift all these girl this be someone 's child you know Missy Dewald she be suppose to meet her parent for dinner she be 18 year old an only child and you just take she away I feel sorry for

ligature mark neither one be tie down and no defensive wound either Geoff Hale cause of death be a single deep smooth cut that sever the carotid artery and Nancy Nancy Hale death be cause by a series of jagged shallow wound that puncture the carotid artery there be more than one unsub you be sure he be either able to restrain Nancy while he kill Geoff or she wake up and she would have scream at which point Cate would have wake up we be look at multiple unsub so thing be bad than we think yes and no Cate 's chance of survival just get well how do you figure two unsub change the dynamic what

a family a family parent and a little boy about her age they take she from her house in a car and then into an RV a short ride on a road and then into a wooded area anything else she say the mother call the boy puyule which I think be a romanian term of endearment I know I use to hear it when my mom be post overseas get Rossi and Morgan on the close RV park what be we look at here I have no idea Most people pay in cash we do not have much in the way of record Ma'am this be a family mother father small boy they would have keep to themselves and leave abruptly you just describe most of my business the son would not have mingle with other child he would have be tightly guard by his parent sorry I wish I could help the family we be talk about be Eastern European they may have speak some foreign word to each other they be in some kind of trouble you remember they you can imagine I do not get a lot of people speak foreign around here what can you tell we about they not much the husband be real businesslike Wife be nice pretty Son be quiet a license or a credit card leave in the night and never come back I would not have think twice about it it if I do not have to clean up the campsite from all the glass Glass all over the ground almost like they do it on purpose can you show we where they park I tell you you be not go to find nothing I clean it up well thank you Jordan be right you know on the plane what be you talk about we hide behind language we do not talk about the ugliness we see we talk about it every day no we talk fact signature m o pathology what be you get at we be work a case where a family be groom their son to kill they be not murder people they be steal child poisoning mind where be the horror we can not do this job if we let it get to we exactly be it a match which mean the RV park owner be right they spread it on purpose so everything they do be part of some ritual have you ever see anything like this before a family that ritualize kill together definitely not you know if the family speak Romanian the spreading of the glass make sense it be an eastern european superstition for good luck they be romanian we know that not just Romanian we be talk about people that be superstitious and obsessed with ritual Romany Romany gypsy more accurately someone who have pervert Romany culture call Garcia they be tight knit and nomadic like our unsub but not usually prone to violence Hiya baby hey baby girl we need to talk Pg or nc 17 you be on speaker phone I charge extra for group run through crime similar to the Hale murder in the last 2 year I already do that Zip go back even far Garcia Cross reference against any small town that have have report of petty theft associate with wave of Romany population enter the area Romany gypsy as in gypsy tramp and thief exactly bless you all for turn my life into a Cher song you will have it nearly immediately you be the good you need to get your man together right now why 'cause whatever ritual these people be try to play out we know Cate Hale do not fit their need which mean they will have to try again it be too soon he turn 10 in a week it be not safe you see one you like she be a fine choice the unsub we be look for be a family a father a mother and a son approximately 10 year old we believe they be of romanian descent the family travel in an rv but they also have another vehicle that they use to go back and forth between campsite and city we need you to call every rv park in the area alert the owner to be on the lookout for a family that fit this description as well as a campsite that might have break glass scatter around the breaking of the glass and the discarding of Cate Hale because of her epilepsy lead we to believe that they be highly superstitious people and that they be play out a very specific ritual the focus of this ritual be the young girl do we know why no but we do know from the location of Cate Hale 's house that they do not come across these girl by accident they study they hunt Cate 's father say that she like to go to the movie at their local multiplex that be a good place to start also look at the park mall concentrate on those that be an easy drive from the RV park you locate this family be out there and they be look for their next victim you guy need to see this right now excuse we what be go on Garcia you still there Present Explain what you get ok I go ahead and go far back look for similar case and I make the search national all these be hit there be 30 of they they go as far back as 1909 Rapid City South Dakota Taos New Mexico Gary Indiana my map be light up like a Christmas tree all these girl be abduct and have their parent kill the time between the kill be long enough and the region so spread out that it never show up as serial what the hell be this I do not know but it look like it be be go on for generation Reid and I will check inside our highway patrol shifts're double and we 've get roadblock at every line be there a picture on the wire I pull one out of her bedroom they be bind to have hour on we they do not travel that far last time the past killing have be year apart we get lucky with Cate Hale her epilepsy save her life if this new girl fit the unsub 's need we might have lose our window to catch they for year this be what I do not get in both this house and the Hales ' house the girl ' bedroom be close to the exit the unsub have to go out of their way to kill the parent before abduct I think it be a countermeasure what do you mean they 've be do this for year and they 've never be catch why they disappear in the dead of night they have a head start on the cop and they do not kill again for year exactly when I be a cop I would get 10 call a day from parent in child abduction now as sad as that be if the family do not stay on you at a certain point other case would just start take priority so what be they do with these girl what do you get baby girl be you sit down you will not believe this what be wrong I think I know what they be do with the girl Garcia get a hit on a hair fiber in the blanket the unsub use to wrap Cate so what be the problem it belong to Kathy Gray why do that name sound familiar she go miss in 1971 after her parent be murder so this little girl be one of our unsub that be what it look like call Hotch tell he and prentiss not to come here and to meet we at the station you ok yeah I just need to build a tacker skin you do not need to do anything you do not want to you understand so these little girl got abduct and later kidnap other girl and kill their family I think that be why these unsub pick girl the same age as the boy what do you mean they be make wife it be ok I know what you be go through I understand I really do come here I be go to take this off you now ok come here I want my mommy no no no everything be ok you be a part of something now I be just like you a work theory from 1971 be that a transient kill the family and abduct Kathy Gray then all the lead go cold how do you watch your family get murder and make a life with the murderer it be Stockholm syndrome you adapt or die and now she be train her son to be a murderer at a certain point once tradition be hand down generation after generation there be no right or wrong you simply accept the way the world work the Romany be a closed society the unsub simply twist and distorted tradition to become entirely insular abduct the child keep the bloodline pure and kill the parent ensure that people eventually stop look for they we get a report of an RV on fire about 20 mile from here Dave you Reid and Morgan go check it out Garcia I need you to digitally alter Kathy Gray 's photograph to simulate what she would look like today consider it simulate thank it be start less than an hour ago so they can not be far it look like they leave almost everything the get the girl they want they be start over look at the clothe Most of they still have the store sensor on they how have they get they past security scanner Tinfoil excuse I Cate remember be lock in a closet surround by clothing and tinfoil Shoplifters use tinfoil to line their bag and negate security alarm make sense a lot of Romany make their living as petty thief it also explain the bell she hear Cate say she remember hear the sound of bell follow directly by the father talk to the son I think that be probably what the mannequin 's for School of the 7 bell you dress a mannequin you line a suit with 7 bell if you pick his pocket without a bell ring you be ready to work a crowd so we know how they make their money that be not all we know these unsub be guide entirely by ritual they abduct Lynn Robillard and kill her family in an area that be surround by police and the FBI they have to they can not deviate we also know that they be start over so they be go to need some money where be the close shopping mall about 15 mile from here hey Hotch we know where they be go Focus on the high end department store they be big target Mom be this you Ma'am hold it Police set those bag down right now Kathy Gray take that woman I say put the bag down Cuff her let us go what be wrong they 've be steal for year and they never get catch this be too easy Kathy I can not help you if you be not go to be honest with I I already tell you I kill they all by yourself yes that be not true it be how do

that be in evidence something like that may take some time please I need it may I ask you why he say it could tell he thing what be it what do you see current influence should turn this day into one with plenty of potential but avoid the trap of try too hard know your strength rely on they confidence real or pretend be your magic ingredient Confidence yes I like that you do not think there be actually anything to that stuff you would be surprise it be gibberish you be jealous because you do not have the magic ingredient I have the magic ingredient it be call splenda all right skeptic what be your sign no be that in April Reid we need a d o b on Prentiss 7 12 a m October 12 19 Libra a romantic opportunity may experience a slight hitch thank to the pesky lunar influence which could have you dip into a rather chilly mood if be demonstrative and warm be difficult then neutralize this temporary cold front with a simple but affectionate gesture I have a simple gesture ready to gather look at you Miss thing first day back and you be all business it be either dive right in or confront my separation anxiety it be tough be away from he that be new be not it yeah citrine it be Henry 's birthstone will and I both get one oh that be sweet you do with this all yours there be be a string of abduction in Olympia Washington go back 9 month 4 woman in all blond blue eye early 20 this morning they find one when be they take 9 month ago so she be the first look almost mummify not exactly frozen Embalmed that be different so the time of death be a bit of a question mark right now where do they find she in a state park just east of Olympia seasonal hiking area the body be jar loose during a mudslide that plus the abnormal decomp make it difficult to know how long she be there it say the victim be abduct about 3 month apart he be rotate his victim out there be go to be more body Synchro mpm and so all the night tide I lie down by the side of my darling my darling my life and my bride in the sepulcher there by the sea in her tomb by the sound sea Edgar Allen Poe so if I want to embalm a body well what be the process start with some nose plug the blood be drain through the jugular vein and replace with embalming fluid through onethe major artery it usually take a few hour then you would need special equipment training Knowledge of the human vascular system would also be a plus a doctor a nurse technician somebody with a background in mortuary science there be a major they do not offer at my school the whole thing seem weird to I embalm I mean some people like to look good for their funeral but it be not they it be just a shell polished and paint I just want to be cremate the question be why embalm the body of someone you murder he want to hold on to they it be a possession issue this way they can never leave maybe fear of abandonment speak to his history but eventually even an embalmed body will decay and he find himself in need of new victim that explain the abduction cycle a new victim every 3 month which mean at least 2 of the remain woman be already dead and the third Brooke Lombardini it be be 4 day since she disappeared follow her shift at a local restaurant we know the odd 90 of all abduction victim be kill within the first 36 hour Hiker find a foot protrude from the soil right up here whole side of the hill slide down from up there so you be focus the search in this area here yeah but if he dump other body here he be get over 800 acre to work with keep your man near the fire road one man drag a body through the wood 110 pound of dead weight he be not go to get far from the path that be why they dismember the victim they be easy to dispose you think it say something about the profile he do not chop she up possibly yeah what be it Detective we get we get something up here the answer to your question detective be yes this killer can not dismember these woman he care for they Brooke work the closing shift the night she disappear she would have walk this way to her car Upscale restaurant well let us just say that I do not go unless it be on someone else 's dime what be you think these woman be take as they leave work high end spa nice restaurant jewelry store if he patronize these business then he be get money it narrow the profile a little the cook say that he leave just a few minute after Brooke see her car there driver 's side door open he be quick surprised her 11 p m it be dark he have cover she probably never see he come it say in here they recover her necklace amethyst break chain right here right next to the car do you process the necklace we could not get anything off of it just some hair in the clasp Hers I would like to take a look at it I give it back to her mother be not it a little premature to be return evidence to the family there be special circumstance she hire someone Guy by the name of Stanley Usher he help find a kid in Portland a couple year ago private investigator a psychic what do that have to do apparently he can read personal thing their aura I do not know so what do he tell she I know Brooke be still alive it be not too late for you to do the right thing let she come home to I she turn 27 on Wednesday Wish she would have wait until we have a chance to coach she I do not know she seem to be do a pretty good job good enough to make the unsub think twice about kill Brooke if he have not already chance be this be all too late it be her daughter she have to have hope right Hope 's one thing false hope be something else I guess you 've work with psychic before yeah not by choice you know there be case where people believe they 've help when people be vulnerable they will believe a lot of thing we think the man who take she may have come by her work a customer someone she may have talk about we think he be a loner he would dine by himself make frequent visit but he be shy avoid eye contact she got ask out sometimes this man would not have ask she out he would not have have the courage he would have stare at she make she uncomfortable I 've tell the police everything I know you should not be here you should be look into the clue right clue from Brooke 's necklace yes sir it be call token object read or Psychometry yeah you be not my first a fence in area the color orange and the number 8 6 7 do that help you so Mr Usher by touch a personal item you think that you can tell if someone 's alive or dead sometimes see a person 's energy make an impression on everything they touch it allow I to connect with they the hard part be interpret what I be give do you get anything else about her condition only that she Felt weaken tired I do not know Heavy Heavy can I talk to you for a second I 've be around a little and I 've see guy like you come into the life of grieve family Sir I assure you that be not what listen to I the last thing this woman need be some con man give her unrealistic idea with all due respect sir you may not know what she need your job be to know the perpetrator we be not talk about my job well maybe we should be because there be a lot of people who do not believe in what you do either I just get a call they find a third body Annette Hagen Erin Bonham and Melissa st Claire all embalmed that be the first 3 that leave the lombardini girl still out there do you figure out cause of death blood loss blood loss they be alive when they be embalm look that way Tox screen show significant level of barbiturate they be sedate maybe unconscious look they all have the same haircut these be recent photo these two have much long hair at the time of their abduction so the unsub cut it something else he may have do their ear have all be double pierce be they sexually assault not exactly there be no tearing or bruise that would normally suggest it but I do find trace amount of semen you be say it may've be consensual she be say they be dead I speak to the family none of the victim have double pierce ear at the time of their abduction cut hair and pierce ear he be change they into what though into who the burial suggest an affection for his victim which say he might be remake they into the image of a love one the m e find high level of barbiturate why just something the psychic say that Brooke feel tired heavy why be we talk about the psychic it be a scam these guy talk without say anythin and you fall for it he say that Brooke 's alive so I guess I want to believe he you know the profile a necrophiliac have no use for a live victim you ready to talk to they Garcia I need you to run a full background check for I Name 's usher Stanley Usher by now we know the DNA find do not match anyone in the system we be go to have to look beyond physical evidence to identify the killer our unsub be a white male in his mid to late 20 and he have money he live alone in a large residence there be enough space and ventilation to accommodate an embalm suite he be awkward with people especially woman an inability to relate socially be common in homicidal necrophile because of the alteration we believe the unsub be attempt to recreate a woman he once love like a girlfriend or a wife a mother someone who leave or die suddenly this projection of the love one couple with his need to preserve the victim be similar to the psychopathology of serial murderer Ed Gein Gein have an oedipal complex which develop in the year he nurse his paralyzed mother back from a stroke after she die his obsession compel he to dig up corpse of woman who resemble his mother so persistent be his desire to resurrect his dead mother that he actually dress in female suit fashion from human skin eventually Gein grow unhappy with the flesh of dead body which have a tendency to dry and crack so he shift his focus to live victim whose body he could well preserve the evolution from dead to live victim will also be mirror in our unsub 's maturation we 've put together a list of incident report prior to 2006 you be go to want to follow up on these now they be inappropriate postmortem conduct cadaver theft and graveyard disturbance 60 of necrophile work in the death business so be sure to canvass local cemetery mortuary and morgue we have the killer 's dna so we be go to be send you out with kit to swab potential suspect the odd of find Brooke Lombardini alive be slim but the quick we identify the killer the well her chance be for her sake let us work fast that lawsuit be a joke it be my job to prep the deceased I be simply adjust her clothing by adjust you mean undress look man I be not here to judge you I be look for a killer so if you want to prove your innocence all you got to do be say ahh we be look for instance where grave have be disturb desecration exhumation female body attractive one nobody be attractive once they 've be in the ground they would have be recent burial no have not have anything like that an old grave got ransack a couple year ago be the body take no the body be just a pile of bone they strip it clean though make off with the jewelry dress I will not lie it it happen in the industry and we put a stop to it when it do you do not report it to the police well we like to keep that kind of thing quiet a killer be dress up his dead victim and violate they maybe quiet be not the good way to go he dress they up that mean something to you we hire an apprentice a while back Odd guy even for this business I do not like the attention he pay the female cadaver I come to find out he like to do their makeup Put a wig on they and such can you describe the wig for I we clean out his locker after his termination there she be he never come back for it imagine that I need this man 's name Ivan Bakunas yeah can I can I help you you could invite we inside it be a little wet out here oh I I can not Mother 's sleeping we be investigate a series of murder in the area we believe the killer work in your field wow Jeez you be kid do I know he you might his victim be just your type Blond hair blue skin you be suggest I be some kind of murderer then you be way out of line so you would not object to give we a sample of your DNA I do not know no we can get a warrant I think I 've say all I be go to say do you find anything on Ivan Bakunas nothing in juvey but he be expel from Evergreen state for assault his girlfriend Sexual he be slip her tranquilizer and have sex with she while she sleep that qualify oh wait Emily maybe this be that romantic encounter your horoscope foretold between that and the wig we should be able to persuade a judge I be not go to stand in your way if you want to serve a warrant on Bakunas but I think you be waste your time you be kid right we profile a man of mean accord to his tax record Bakunas have not hold down a job since he graduate college he live with his mother do not have a car the embalm equipment the drug that stuff be not cheap look this guy like to get it on with dead people if that be not probable cause I do not know what be Hotch a 911 operator just get a distress call from someone claim to be Brooke Lombardini what be your emergency hello can you speak up ma'am he will hear I this be Brooke Lombardini please I need help where be you call from ma'am I be be hold prisoner ok ma'am can you look outside can you see a street name or an address please I think he be Ma'am go to kill I please help I that be her that be Brooke you be certain she be barely audible any surveillance expert will tell you it be almost impossible to positively identify a whisper you think I do not know my own daughter 's voice why would someone who be not Brooke call 911 and say they be sometimes people get off inject themselves into the story you 've be on tv now and that could bring out a lot of sick individual Stanley say she be alive this prove it Stanley Usher have a vested interest in tell you that your daughter be alive and do you have a vested interest in tell I that she be not he have a record ma'am I have a colleague look into it Usher be charge with fraud in Oregon before he pull up stake and move here I need my baby to be alive all she have right now be hope why would you take that from her you know most people think that a person 's hair and nail continue to grow after they be dead that be a myth Abby Abby hold still I know how much you like a straight line who be Abby you be silly 911 call come from a disposable cell no I d but they trace it to the near tower and that narrow it down to a 20 mile radius here just southeast of Seattle that be a densely populated area be they able to triangulate Garcia try to ping the phone but it be already dead the unsub probably turn it off you mean if he find she Dave I agree with you about psychic but the fact be Sandra Lombardini identify her daughter 's voice we have to assume that that call be genuine so what do we think why be the unsub keep Brooke alive and how longshe have until he kill her maybe he need they alive to effect their transformation the hair makeup pierce the ear that would only take a few hour he be have she for almost 5 day so maybe it be about something more than appearance something deeply she make it sound like she be be lock up and she sound drug these be control mechanism use in case of sexual slavery mind control it be brainwash so he be try to break she down make she surrender her identity that be what he be wait for that be the version of they he want to hold onto so the long she hold out the long she stay alive and as soon as she accept her new role her fate be seal tell I a story Abby you know I can not sleep without a story let I out Story first Abby I tell you I be not Abby what do you do to I tell I a story Abby I tell you I be not Abby that be the lab with the dna result on those swab no match no our guy be still out there what be he do here Detective a word do you know what you be do can not afford to let my ego get in the way on this one take all the help I can get look I be

know a priority sample 's come well what do he get off of the wig detective enough to know that that be one sick puppy in there why do not you tell I about that look like a wig that be a magic wig it change the identity of the dead what well I think that be why you be put it on the body at the morgue it make the fantasy more real who be you try to turn they into I have work some sick case Rapists pederast I hope you be not group I with those people you may be the sick of they all well sick or no many would argue it be a victimless crime what be victimless about Lynette Hagen who or Melissa St Claire I do not know these woman ok you have the wrong the wrong necrophile what you think I be the only guy in town who like to crack open a cold one where be Brooke Lombardini I do not know who that be I do not kill people these profiler say our killer be try to turn these girl into a love one like a wife or a mom be your mother a blonde Ivan that be disgust the wig be not even the important part for I it be it be the shoe so you put shoe on they too they be a very special pair what be special about they the woman walk in they sunny Raines the weather girl she be a local celebrity kill in a car accident a couple of year ago a friend of mine be work when she come in on a slab he know I be a fan he steal her shoe for you the wig it just complete the look but the shoe genuine article that be what make it real genuine article I take a report of a grave robbery I think you say it be just a simple theft yeah but listen to what be take a dress a pair of diamond earring and a pair of pearl earring 2 pair if our unsub be like Bakunas then he need the genuine article to complete the fantasy exactly this grave could belong to that woman let us see Abigail Hansen ok so I get her obit from the Olympian Abigail Reina Hansen die suddenly at 26 from myocarditis a heart defect send her passport photo now well she certainly look the part what else can you tell we about her I can tell you that she be bear in Amsterdam she never marry and her employment record show she work for Patrick and Leona Gless from 1985 to her death in 1992 can you get we an address they might be the only one

keep peace between they and live in his castle with his beautiful empress happily ever after the end and as soon as she accept her new role her fate be seal do Garcia say what Mr Gless do for a live

FBI may we come in why it be about your daughter that that be that be one of her journal have something happen she be murder I be so sorry here let I help you where do you find she she be in a house in east Cleveland we think she may have be visit a crime scene God I tell she to stop do that I tell she that be too dangerous where be she now she be at the coroner 's office and I can take you when you be ready ok now right now I have to go right now Mrs Hawkes would you mind if I stay behind to look in her room she be so excited to meet you you be like a a hero to her Mrs Hawkes let I take you downtown now come on I will I will send a car for you the crime be within a 7 mile radius well that be something but the neighborhood be all different they range from poor to rich industrial to residential the physical location be dissimulate but the operating zone 's well defined ok I be in I see you in your web browser for search history check out her home page so the first thing she look at when she open her computer be a crime column to stay current on her study can you see what she work on last Voilà these be the most recently open document she create she be compile empirical datum about homicide trend in Cleveland do you think she know the killer any note indicate suspect she be a criminology student she be be teach to analyze statistic and apply theory not investigate killer let us talk about what we know all right Victim one Travis Bartlett be last see at a gay bar he be shoot at night in a park Victim 2 Lily Nicks a 34 year old prostitute her throat be slash victim 3 and 4 June Appleby and Troy Wertsler be shoot in their car at a parking lot outside of a movie theater and victim 5 be a 28 year old single woman Kayla James kill in her home she be bind suffocate with a bag over her head evidence of rape and then the sixth victim be Zoe victimology weapon use and c o d be all different it be hard to imagine it be even the same unsub it can not be a coincidence that Zoe go to Kayla James ' house and gets murder let us say it be the same killer do anybody see a pattern well maybe ok the first crime he shoot the victim the second crime he rape a woman and slash her throat that be more personal and the third crime he escalate to kill two people and the fourth he escalate even more by rape a woman bind she and suffocate she so if it be the same unsub you could argue that there be a progression of violence with every kill it could be anger excitation offender get more daring with each crime I think I get something here look at this the slash in the prostitute 's throat they be all shallow unsure cut the Kayla James crime scene telephone cord rope and duct tape be use he could not decide how to bind she so without a gun he be sloppy inexperienced the young couple shoot in the car Crime scene remind you of anything they be shoot with a 44 bulldog just like the son of Sam use on his victim which be also young couple in park car it might be nothing but you be right there be a parallel there with the second victim it be hard not to think of jack the ripper the obvious similarity be it be a prostitute whose throat be slash Kayla James be bind torture rape with a plastic bag over her head like BTK what about victim number one what neighborhood be he find in at a park in the Kingsbury run area Zoe remind I last night that Cleveland 's most famous serial killer be the butcher of Kingsbury run he find his victim in gay bar shoot they and dump their body there Travis Bartlett be last see at a gay bar and his body be find in Kingsbury park so these be copycat of famous serial killer he be a serial killer study serial killer see you in Cleveland Dave we be in that room Coffee 's brewing we will get start on the evidence Detective Brady 's our point I will let you all introduce yourself can you help I out with something sure this have to be confidential I know it may seem farfetche but copycat killer be not entirely uncommon this one happen to be copy several killer if he be try to be the butcher why do not he cut up and mutilate they that be 7 week ago he be just getting start begin killer be often frightened of the crime itself they be more interested in get it over with quickly and flee the scene he be use the butcher 's ruse as a way to lure the victim to be alone with she and by the time he kill Kayla he have progress he come very close to copy all of the BTK 's m o he be read learn borrowing from other because he do not know who he be yet we think he be young and impressionable maybe even a student someone probably enrol in criminology class our technical analyst be go through name of local student right now up to this point change his m o have prevent investigator from link the crime that be why we need to work quickly you be sure about this it be not a coincidence that all of these random murder in a localize area be copycat of serial killer it be as if all the bad serial killer have converge on Cleveland every time he plan to kill the murder weapon the m o and the victimology will all change will you let your team know we be ready to give a preliminary profile Sure I get to go I be go to step out for this one clear my head Garcia find 3 male student enrol in criminology class with felony record Good we will interview they I do not think we need to one of they be study abroad the other 2 be back in jail tell Garcia to check enrollment in online and correspondence course see if we have any luck with those parameter you guy handle the profile yeah everything ok everything be fine we have 6 homicide in a 7 mile radius in east Cleveland this small zone indicate that be he be a geographically stable offender this type of offender be characterize as young socially immature of average intelligence with psychopathic personality trait they also usually live alone and have an antisocial nature a serial killer 's first murder be very tell this unsub 's first murder he choose the m o of Cleveland 's own butcher of Kingsbury run the butcher be not as well know as other famous serial killer but he be a local legend and because he pick the butcher we believe he be a native of Cleveland and probably grow up hear story of the butcher this be someone who be obsess with serial killer his pc will be fill with research he will have abundant image of murderer on his computer and possibly even snuff film he use these like pornography they provide some sort of sexual release I think he go back to relive his crime when Zoe show up she become a victim of opportunity it be the same theory we arrive at on the plane he strangle she with her own scarf he do not plan it I think she surprise he I tell she not to stop until she find the answer she be look for I do not think she would go to a crime scene her mom say that she that do all the time she probably would have go anyway but it be because of what I say that she be encourage to go there last night what be you do she come to I and I dismiss her try not to personalize it I be the last one she talk to before she be murder how be this not personal Aaron it be personal that do not change how we go about find her killer we know that violent criminal develop a signature over a series of crime if he be young he probably have not even figure out what his be yet find the signature we can link the crime he probably monitor the news see if the police have connect they yet we can use that we can utilize the medium and I think I know who we can talk to I know homicide be up but nobody say anything about a serial killer why do I get a visit from the b a u you be Paula McConnell Cleveland 's 1 source in crime news you be detail you have a follow he be read you we need you to write that the police have find his signature you can help we by explain what his signature be in your article it be a killer 's personal stamp his distinctive touch that he leave at the scene of every crime I 've be do this for 18 year and I know what a signature be honey we really need you to be detail about this we be speak directly to he through my column he be do something a behavioral impulse he feels compel to do but a need drive act to get a sexual release that be specific to his psyche this repetitive behavior at each crime scene will lead we to he let I take a stab at it they just find another body they be bring he up right now teenager find he a little over an hour ago it be petechia in the white of his eye judge from the bruising he be probably strangle with a wire be this our guy it be get to be a jogger do not get garrote every day whatever signature he leave be probably wash away in the water who be he mimic now Bike path rapist Altemio Sanchez come to mind he troll bike path near buffalo garrote his victim it look like he copy everything except for the rape Strangulation be a repetition of his last murder of Zoe first time he be repeat himself Zoe 's murder be spontaneous though he do not plan it he act on instinct and do what come naturally to he maybe what came naturally feel good to he and he want to feel it again if he be start to repeat a pattern he may have find himself H a w k e s very good I be Danny I want you to call we if you have any question at all we be go to take great care of her you be all set do I pay the bill here no ma'am the bill be be take care of by an anonymous donor anything else in there just the notation of an observant student I 've be think though Zoe get all of her information from the newspaper and from Paula McConnell 's column there be no way she could have know about every homicide in the city not every homicide 's report in the paper so how do we know he do not commit more murder than the one in her journal we do not we can check missing person and see if anyone be last see in the unsub 's operating zone what well a young person 's mind be so active yours Zoe 's and I imagine this unsub 's too I think when we get he he will be curious he will ask question Rossi head up she know do you do this I do not need or want your money I have take care of my daughter for 22 year and she be still my responsibility I do not need any help from you you do not even know she I be sorry if I 've offend you just leave we alone all right we find another body East Cleveland Strangulation mark this be recent the bruise on her neck be still reddish no other obvious sign of trauma well this be not a bike path like the last one which serial killer be he mimic now I do not think he be mimic anymore he be start to show consistency I think he be develop his own style have anybody touch she no they have instruction to wait for we and the m e where be he Dr Edwards here he come could you take a look at this spot on her forehead Strange let I swab it and get it back to the lab 3 murder in the last 3 day something 's cause his frenzy could be a drastic change in his life something he lose control of or it could be something he gain control of like himself if he be finally define himself as a strangler he may just be practice perfect his style he may have awaken the coroner just call preliminary test confirm acetyl alcohol on the homeless woman 's forehead he sterilize it why would he do that maybe he do something to her forehead use an alcohol wipe to remove evidence if that be the case it certainly be not necessary to the crime this could be part of his signature we should look at other victim to see if he do something similar any evidence on the last victim be wash away in the water and all the other body be either bury or cremate except for one I know you do not want to see I but please hear I out we need Zoe 's body to go back to the coroner 's office Zoe 's murderer leave a clue on her body there be a chance we can find he from this clue but we have to examine she again all I want to do be put she to rest Zoe choose to study criminology because she believe in bring criminal to justice can not guarantee the evidence have not be compromise the mortician have not touch she yet even so she be be transport more time than I would like do not want anyone to get their hope up just make sure the evidence get to Quantico quickly East Cleveland homicide first quarter to date 5 out of 9 unsolved January 22 prostitute murder downtown at 5th and main January 9 man shoot at Kingsbury park February 15 Kayla James live alone first home invasion february 8 murder young couple shoot in park no apparent motive Investigate why be location different Page 47 Rossi 's book there be no coincidence Garcia you get something the boy in the lab find trace amount of saliva on Zoe 's forehead enough for a dna sample so we get a codis match on Eric Ryan Olson 23 Cleveland native do 2 1 2 year for attempt sexual assault and be parole 6 month ago we think for sure he would be a student that be 'cause he be while he be in the slammer he take independent correspondence class in forensic science and criminology from an out of state school call the team let us get a search warrant Clear Clear Reid the computer we should ask the neighbor where he might be on a week night he be read my book Reid anything Al 's

we know about her her name 's Linda Jones no criminal record they meet online 6 week ago no he can not be this guy we find his dna on a murder victim what we also think he be responsible for the murder of 7 other people over the last 7 week two of his victim be rape I think I be go to be sick against my counsel my client would like to talk to agent Rossi we talk about he be curious ask question if he think he know you he might open up I will keep he talk good big fan we have some information that would be of great interest to you my ear be burn my lawyer here explain that I be be charge with 8 murder and that I be probably look at the death penalty I have one very important question for you be you sure it be just 8 what we check missing person since he start kill 4 people have be report miss in east Cleveland neighborhood we can not rule out any of they as his possible victim he mark page on several serial killer we ignore which one he try to copycat we be screw the d a will offer he a deal he do not have to that be easy for you to say you get to go home tomorrow what do I tell the family of the miss sorry no idea we be not go to leave until we can give you and the family some closure and how be you go to do that I need anything that might show where he be troll for more victim once the d a get here we have a lot to talk about what do you think you be go to get out of this I do not know we will see you do not have to say anything else Eric you got to speak to he now let us just wait for the d a I do not know how to break it to you but you do not have a card to play here we be 3 step ahead of you really we 've already consider the possibility that you kill other people we know you be young want to experiment it be likely you would copycat as many serial killer as possible to figure out who you be and what you like so let I ask you a question how do you know you have not tell I already where the other body be bury we 've be through everything he mark up Rossi 's book check it maybe he be scout for location to commit more murder Pictures what frame photograph in his hallway nothing else nothing else be frame they look like original let I call you right back Hotch I need to ask you about your sex life that be personal your boyfriend 's a serial killer your relationship be no long private it be completely normal to experiment with sex ok it might be normal to have sex in a public park but the other thing we be just role play every couple have fantasy do you ever think it be strange that your boyfriend have fantasy about strangle and rape woman not woman just I do he kiss you on the forehead too how do you know that be you sick much as a kid I get strep throat every flu season do you just profile that about I her name be Zoe Hawkes the girl you kill 3 day ago we find your dna on her forehead it will never be admissible in court her body be remove from a state facility and now most people would ask what you do I know what you do you kiss she on the forehead what I want to know be why why do you think someone would do that agent Rossi well that be why I ask if you have be ill much as a child you see you be slight pale sickly Most parent they kiss their child on the forehead to see if their temperature be warm now my theory be that you somehow in your development warp that care gesture into something perverse so do you sit next to Zoe to see if she get cold be that why you kiss she that be a really interesting theory make a great chapter in one of your book I find picture on his computer in a special folder he create they be place in the city 3 of they I recognize from his crime scene there be more picture of place I do not recognize email they as soon as you can this guy be get off on those photo then what do he need Linda for do he have any other strange preference in bed do he ever role play by tie you up be you sure yes I be sure he like he like be an exhibitionist it be really the only way he could get excited what do you mean well he do not like have sex in bed so he just take I to public place where do I have to tell you this the first time be at Kingsbury park and then at a movie theater in the parking lot in my car do he ever take you to the 2d street bridge off the bike path that be where the jogger be kill he can only have sex with Linda when he be revisit his crime if that be the case what be

Cuyahoga valley park Euclid creek we will send unit in the morning to search for the body how have you find out be it something that I do you need to revisit the crime scene because it be the only way for you to get a gratifying sexual release but revisit the scene be not enough you have to capture it on film put it on your computer display it on your wall so you could look at it every day Eric we should talk privately this be not over I always know I would end up back in prison just a matter of when you can come interview I if you want I read in one of your book that be how you build your behavioral database maybe you can learn something from I I get a lot of question myself I will be honest with you if you be honest with I 'cause the one thing that you always ask be the one that I do not understand why I have no idea why I see a guy walk down the street with a stupid look on his face and I want to bash he over the head with a bottle to I that be normal it be weird to I that no one else feel that way it be all I think about I can not stop this be not up for debate cancel the rest of the date be everything ok why do people want to hear I talk about serial killer be it that entertain there be a public fascination with they sometimes I wonder if my book be do more harm than good my senior year at Georgetown I be graduate I do not have a clue what I be go to do with my

confidential information it be not to be include in any report every wednesday Ashford withdraw 10 000 out of a fund in cash today be no different so high end prostitute we interview the valet the

the second I be go to call my team Understood but there be a reason why I want you here first I get 3 judge and one state senator ask if I be sure I have a case you poke around this type of woman this type of lifestyle people get edgy call in favor I be sorry but the politic of this be your problem yes they be and of course we all want she stop you do not want any big fish catch in the net that be

in touch in the morning thank you agent Hotchner what floor 16 thank you long night kind of yeah yeah I too these Tokyo market be kill I excuse I good night Darling the prostitute be not as feminist claim the victim of man but rather their conqueror an outlaw who control the sexual channel between nature and culture Camille Paglia female serial killer be a fascinating field we do not have much information on they but what we do know involve throw the rule completely out the window signature for instance they do not torture or take trophy there be no sexual gratification when they kill exactly murder be the goal they do not have to do anything extra woman be more efficient at kill historically they have have body count in the hundred so assume that the job be the stressor what be some of the reason prostitute kill their customer money drug post traumatic stress disorder at some point every call girl no matter how well pay gets coerce into an activity she do not consent to Aileen Wuornos use to purposefully stage pay sexual encounter as an excuse to murder man she think would rape she but Wuornos be psychotic and disorganized I think this girl 's poison they before she have sex with they she be use tetra methylene disulfotetramine it be a popular rat poison in China easily soluble in alcohol Poison be the perfect m o quiet quick and the victim never see it come because they think they be lucky do that mean something to you at 10 000 a night these man be pay for discretion as well as sex she have a history with they they see she repeatedly she do not decide to kill they in the moment she walk in with the intent to kill and she be do it before sleep so she be not just organize she be also methodical she decide which one of her client be worth kill and which be not and she plan maybe the victim all share the same fetish both victim be in their 50 highly visible careful out their image if they be kinky they would go to length to hide it we be face a corporate culture that will do everything to keep we out actually I have some luck there Hoyt Ashford 's wife be not too happy with how he die she be agree to talk to we yeah but because every silver lining have a dark cloud the hedge fund release a statement Ashford die peacefully in his home accord to lawyer David Madison they be try to close rank do that sound familiar to anyone what do you mean the press release from the first victim accord to company lawyer Stanton die peacefully in his home Start with the wife see if you can get she to open up jj call the lawyer and tell they I want to meet with both of they to play they off each other one of they write both press release let us see which one call we Babe what time be it if you leave now you can get your kid to school thank you agent Hotchner the Phoenix police announce the suspect responsible for the death of 5 phoenix officer have be catch that be not the case the killer be still at large Mrs Ashford we be very sorry about our husband I 've be get nothing but condolence all day I feel like a hypocrite for accept they know how he die we think your husband might have be target because of something sexual he do with this call girl we know this be hard but be there anything you can tell we about what he like in bed I can sum it up in one word Younger how much young 24 25 it be that be when I meet he so your age difference be part of the attraction be you kid it be the whole relationship Mrs Ashford no offense but your husband spend a lot of money on this woman be there anything else at all that he like from a young woman besides the ego boost there be a certain kind of man agent for whom the only kind of sex that matter be the ego boost but in a marriage like our after few year it do not come voluntarily anymore you have to work at it or in my husband 's case Pay for it JJ both lawyer say that they would be here at noon they call back and say they would meet you at the Manchester center it be almost 12 30 neither of they be here can you text I the number I need to call never mind she be here she Ellen daniel Barswell consult Ms Daniels we call two lawyer and neither of they be you they call I to consult on the press release my firm specialize in strategic risk management for firm around the city you be a problem solver and we have a mutual one do not we do you know who this girl be no one of your client might they be not go to open up about it they be put themselves at risk yes I understand that but you see my hand be tie none of they be go to admit that they have a professional girlfriend I can subpoena their record then I would have to file about a year 's worth of injunction to stall you now who need that kind of hassle Ms Daniels this be not a game I need number if not of this particular girl then someone like her someone we can talk to no escort will agree to sit down with the FBI but I have something well for you assume you might be willing to overlook certain legal nicety do you want to buy a house yes you do I do not get it I think Hotch say we be go to meet a madam here actually there be a lot of overlap between real estate and sex work Property be a safe and inspection free investment for large sum of cash your brownstone use to be own by a gigolo hello you two be you the be not this neighborhood just fabulous and you be go to love this house you two need lesson in fake it I teach a class I be I be sorry I just I want to be clear you be a madam right you arrange date for escort all I arrange be meeting what happen between two consent adult when that meeting be over be something I be not liable for now who want a scone oh yes we all know about this woman she be terrible for business I guess there be only so many man that can afford the service you provide well that be certainly true but the way she be behave she be only hurt herself and why be that an escort 's client list be the most important investment she have it be her daily income and her retirement package when she sell the list so she be not work with a service be she no madam would allow an escort to kill off the clientèle what about the type of work your employee do we be sort of operate under the assumption that this escort be kill man who make she perform a specific sexual act what do you have in mind sweetie I I do not even I do not know if I may I think you be look at this all wrong Start with this question why would a man pay a woman 5 figure it be not for sex be it of course you 've get to be good in bed to be successful but that be the easy part what be the difficult part what man want more than the no string attach sex be a therapist someone who will absorb the bad part of their personality their fear and their insecurity everything they can not take home to their wife that be what I groom my girl to do how to talk to these man how to listen do not get I wrong Deviancy come with the territory I can not tell you how many man need to be submissive as an outlet from their extremely stressful job I can tell you that if the sex be the reason she be kill these man she would have break long before she charge 10 000 so it be not how these man act in bed it be how they act out of it Jesse what be your 20 I be just start my sweep Victim be Joseph Fielding he be the cfo here poison and stage she kill he in his office and roll he out here to be find the lipstick 's new do postmortem Reid say female serial killer do not leave a signature I think she do that just for we she be expose he at his most vulnerable now she want to be notice I be allow back

of man who be rumor Andrew Kane resign amid allegation of tie to an escort who be reportedly kill her client Let us talk the attorney general insist that he be not responsible for the leak ofname Kane refuse to comment but source say he be the father look at you sorry I be wet I be I be sorry to make you drive in this it sound urgent it be really good to see you it be be forever Johnny what be going on it be about Matthew Benton he be dead I do not wanna tell you over the phone how his parent say that he have a heart attack I be sorry have you see he yeah a couple of time how be he he be Matthew he be ramble a little chaotic he be use I do not know probably there be something you be not tell I the last time I see he there be something different he be talkin ' crazy but the the fear I can not quite explain it but I know it be real what be he say he say Johnny they be go to kill I who be they he would not say he say they already murder a guy from Georgetown name Tommy v and make it look like an accident do you know anyone name Tommy v look he be probably just be paranoid but with what you do for a living now you be one of the only people he ever trust my lord it be kitty and poodle out there do you hear it might even snow can you find anything on Tommy v if by chance you mean Thomas Valentine age 35 find dead in his home from dehydration as a matter of what be go on be hotch still here I be pretty sure he live here thank what be wrong I just find out that an old friend of mine die I be sorry do you need to take some time there be a chance that he could have be murder and there might be a second case what do you need just some leeway to check it out of course anything thank you Emily if you wanna take a few day and let we look into it Matthew be incredibly mess up and I have not see he in a long time but he be important to I at least let we help thank you Leonardo Da Vinci say he who do not punish evil command it to be do thank for come in early where 's Morgan and Prentiss they be at the morgue examine this man Matthew Benton a friend of Emily 's she believe that his death may be connect to that man 's Thomas Valentine Dehydration do she know he no but Benton seem to think that someone be after both of they one death be a heart attack the other be from dehydration what be the connection I do not know if there be one be the police investigate no right now we be just help a colleague so we talk to the family see if there be anything suspicious be emily ok I do not know that be why I send Morgan to go with her I be scared do not worry it will be all right hold my hand always be it possible someone could have induce the heart attack the easy way to stop the heart be an injection of potassium I would have find trace there be no other way I suppose it be possible he could have be inject with epinephrine it would not register because clinically it be identical to the natural adrenalin in the body be he tie the wound be superficial anything else out of the ordinary he bleed heavily from his nose but with the damage to his septum my guess be that it be prolong abuse of cocaine or methamphetamine and what about the other autopsy he die of dehydration there be trace of prescription antipsychotic in his system I understand from his family he have a history of mental illness be these ligature mark consider the self inflict wound and the history of mental illness the police do not suspect foul play so you have 2 body with ligature mark each superficial but you just dismiss they there be no medical reason to connect these death I do not understand why the FBI be interested in our son 's death we be investigate another death recently under similar circumstance and we just want to make sure that there be no connection he suffer a heart attack it be just routine there be nothing routine about investigate a heart attack Andrea it be ok I assume your investigation be drug relate we be just try to rule out foul play may we come in of course when I come in the house I find he here in bed you two do not live together I would take the kid to my mom 's we have be go a few week the doctor say he must have be in bed for day may I ask why you take the child somewhere else to live my husband be hear voice he be curse God I need to protect they of course do you believe in the soul I do well I believe Tommy 's be finally at peace do you mind my asking if you 've be burn incense after Matthew die I burn some in the room to cleanse it so he be live here with you we be hope he could turn his life around we be in New York for the weekend and when we come back we find his body here my son 's soul be in the possession of evil do you have any experience deal with drug addiction we see a lot of it through our work it be an impossible thing to watch happen to someone you love be you aware that in the day before he die Matthew think someone be go to kill he where do you hear that one of our team member agent Prentiss Emily Prentiss yes ma'am she be the reason you be here we would like you both to leave now I tell you not to mention I you do not say it would get we kick out be there something we should know Matthew and I meet in Rome when we be 15 my mom be post there his parent do not like we hang out and they still hold a grudge they be extremely religious they think I be a bad influence you and that be it that be it we see scuff mark on the floor underneath Thomas Valentine 's bed almost as if someone have be tie up and struggle to get free we see the exact same mark in Matthew 's bedroom have anybody be able to find any connection at all between they accord to my snooping both Benton and Valentine travel to Galicia Spain over the same week 4 month ago that mean anything to you no I do the quick guidebook thing there be a church there Santiago de Compostela it be visit by over 100 000 religious pilgrim every year do his parent say anything about he go on a pilgrimage no the opposite actually his mom say his soul be possess by evil what Matthew have a thing about challenge the church he could push it when we be in high school his mom and dad consult a priest because they be afraid he be possess I think in this case she be talk about drug be you sure there be a pattern here the talk about evil and the soul and scuff mark on the floor what be you drive at Drug addiction and schizophrenia be two affliction most likely to present as demonic possession you think these be exorcism I think it beg the question look I know the bible just as well as anyone I know there be nothing more open to behavioral interpretation than religion mean what I think it be dangerous for we to wanna find a connection between these death wait be Thomas ' wife religious she be concerned that he have be curse god Exorcism ritual can take day to complete it be possible the stress induce could cause a heart attack especially in someone with a history of drug use that would explain the timeline of someone die of dehydration look I be willing to say that we might have an unsub who ritualize killing as if they be exorcism maybe but right now we do not know if we have a crime yet Morgan 's right we need to step back let I talk to someone before I have we all tell ghost story you know they count all that stuff Jimmy Stranger I know it be be too long so maybe after we speak you will let I take your confession go to strong arm I you bet so how can I help you what do you know about exorcism well they be controversial the Vatican issue a new exorcism rite in 1999 so nobody speak out against it but if press not every priest believe in demonic possession do you let I put it this way you believe that evil exist I 've see it so if child be bear innocent at what point do evil enter they how common be exorcism conservatively I would say 400 or 500 a year have anyone die in one what be this about Davey I be look into the death of 2 man both be trouble each recently have make the same pilgrimage to Galicia Spain each die within the last 2 week and why do you suspect exorcism well it be just a theory one of our agent know one of the man she be afraid there might be some foul play you agree would you know if one take place here in d C if it be sanction probably if not then it be not a true exorcism thank Jimmy the agent do the information about the case come to she directly why you open yourselves up to understand the bad monster and you invite evil into your life it be a vulnerable position Meaning what take good care of her and you be you ok buddy I be get out we be not even halfway there I be get out man close the door Holy virgin of virgin all holy angel and archangel all the order of bless spirit St John the baptist St Joseph how the hell do you get in here I be here to help you get the hell out of here I cast you out unclean spirit I say get the hell out of here do not lay hand on I Garcia get a call 38 year old white male find dead in his bed by his fiancée what be the connection she run the name Patrick Cavanaugh be in Galicia the same week as Thomas Valentine and Matthew do you know he no seriously yeah what can you tell we white male be dead for hour Medics think it be a brain aneurism you mind if we take a look knock yourselves out this be kind of startin ' to freak I out a little bit let us figure out if we have a crime before we start freakin ' out obviously we have a crime how do an unsub induce an aneurism could be cause by stress yeah like if you be restrain on a bed while someone try to banish the devil from their body all I be sayin ' be I think we should go easy can I help you we be with the FBI we be investigate a series of unexplained death I do not understand have Patrick be act erratically lately he have a brain condition he be get headache be not act like himself be you aware of a trip he take recently to Galicia Spain there be a church there call Santiago de Compostela we think he may have visit my fiancé travel a lot for work I do not know everywhere he go with all due respect ma'am I do not think you be tell we the truth excuse I do you believe Patrick be possess I would like some privacy please be someone try to rid he of demon be that how he die no you really believe he have a brain condition you need to go now because if you sanction an exorcism and he die I can press to make you an accessory to murder that be enough stop it Let us go I apologize for the intrusion what happen I think there may be a third victim be that what you think I do not know we have ligature mark the Spain connection and scuff mark under the bed it be weird definitely but there be no way to physically connect dehydration a heart attack and an aneurism what be going on we 've have a complaint J J be try to smooth it over with the D c police but we have not be invite in on the case that be how you have my back Prentiss I be try to protect you I do not need protection Hotch say he get a complaint and he do not come down on you you realize that you just dodge a bullet we have to approach this like we do any other case mean what Grief can make we wanna believe there be a reason for thing when there be not that woman could not even use Patrick 's name she could only say my fiancé because she be convinced something else die in that room that night as far as the police be concern there be no open murder investigation we have no reason to be investigate if they be not they be right all we have be three man who die in 3 very different natural death so we just drop it do you really believe we be deal with someone try to exorcise demon it do not matter what I believe possession mental illness exorcist unsub who care what be true People be die this be not about religion it be about evil we attack it with analysis and diligence for this unsub it be a fight to the death all hail the mistress of information you get something you know I do it be a posting from a web bulletin board by Matthew Benton to create a support group for people who feel betray by their faith that help explain how these 3 man come together it get well the week the 3 of they be in Spain the service at Santiago de Compostela be cancel when the priest there die die how Heart attack but if you listen to the conspiracy chatter there be a strong belief he be kill to interrupt service during the height of the pilgrimage how their good guess be some kind of gas Sarin or VX something that would not show up in an autopsy but it could be anything would induce stress cause a heart attack then we have a motive and a potential m o an eye for an eye without an invitation from the police I can not authorize an investigation this have to be keep quiet so the police be not investigate Exorcism be a tough theory to sell the police do not think the death be connect but you do you be go to have to give I some time here this be John Cooley he be also a friend of Matthew 's I be sorry you see he recently be there anyone he associate with out of the usual anyone overtly religious not that I be aware of I 've be doing my good to retrace his step but I still have not come up with anything buy you a cup of coffee I will call you if I hear anything there be nice place to take a girl for coffee do you ever see the exorcist the real case start right here the fire department actually burn down the house themselves the authority refer to the boy as Robbie Doe he be still in the D c area today why do you bring I here whole lot of effort go into destroy the house of a kid who probably have onset schizophrenia or Tourette 's syndrome I be not follow you you be sure he be murder so what be the story if you do not wanna explain that be fine but if you do I be all in Matthew know the bible inside and out and he start to question everything why we move around a lot when I be a kid 'cause of my mom 's posting it be hard to get accept and when you be 15 that be all you want you will do almost anything you get pregnant be Matthew the father no I do not know what to do I could not tell my mom Matthew suggest I talk with our priest and what do he say he say that if I have an abortion I be not welcome in his congregation so what have you do Matthew find a doctor he take I there he stay with I that Sunday when we get back to Rome he hold my hand and walk I into the church Father Gamino actually stop his sermon but Matthew tell I to hold my head up and we walk to the front pew what do the priest do he and Matthew just stare at each other it be like a battle of will and and then suddenly father Gamino go back to his sermon Matthew save my life he make I feel like I be worthy of Love and friendship but that be when his anger and questioning start he start do drug when that meld with his religious questioning you could understand why his parent be afraid he be possess by something evil it be my fault that Matthew 's life unravel Garcia uncover some information it be possible Matthew and the other kill someone in Spain I do not believe that I be just say if we keep push you have to be prepare for what we might discover I need Matthew to rest in peace I owe he that then let us go give a profile the police have not invite we in the police be not go to do we any good on this one anyway as I be say to the agent this be a topic on which we usually agree to silently disagree and we all respect that we be not here to examine your belief in demonology or exorcism but we be operate on the theory that the person responsible for these death do believe we believe the incite incident be the death of father Raul Del Toro in Galicia Spain 4 month ago how so there be an element who believe that the death be actually a murder you be not suggest that this be some kind of retribution even a priest can have a psychotic break he may be under the delusion that he be work for God the man we be look for would be obsess with the event in Galicia he believe he be fight evil and may very well have follow these man here to Washington we believe that one of the exorcism take place over enough day for the victim to die of dehydration if I may an exorcism be like a prize fight it be completely drain both physically and spiritually now if this man truly perform three ritual within the last few week he would need medical care be there somewhere he would go to convalesce anything less than a work hospital would be too dangerous Garcia it be Reid Speak boy wonder I need you to run catholic hospital record look for any admission for exhaustion immediately follow Patrick Cavanaugh 's death you get it you know I do now run the same search for the day immediately follow the first 2 death I sense a cross check in my future do you have anything one hit father Paul Silvano currently at St Agatha 's hospital on 214 we get he be you father Paul Silvano be you present at the death of Thomas Valentine Matthew Benton and Patrick Cavanaugh I 've be expect you he ask you a question yes I be present you have the right to remain silent anything you say what do he say he want you to look in the drawer we be both fight the same evil what be it it be diplomatic status he have immunity Explain to I why you be the last person in the room when three man die I be a priest I be there for they spiritually they be not on their deathbed not physically do you kill they but you be not sorry any of they be dead physical death be always sad but now their soul be in heaven for that their family have peace up until 4 month ago his record 's spotless no history of mental illness no censure he be even invite to say mass at the Washington national cathedral what happen 4 month ago no detail just say he take a sabbatical for personal reason 4 month ago be just after the death in Spain it look like he lobby the Vatican for a diplomatic posting but they refuse after that he take the world hunger mission from the italian government which bring he here with immunity where be Hotch on the phone with the department gather the other I will be there in a second do you know the priest who die in Galicia Father Del Toro and I be at seminary together do you know that Matthew Benton and the other man be in Galicia the week he die do you believe they commit murder I be contact by a family member he be frighten he tell I his real son never return home from that trip and you suggest that he be possess I say that I could help rid his child of evil what do you tell the other family member after you watch their son die that it be god 's will I 've never lay a hand on anyone with malice in my life then explain these death to I you know the power of evil you 've be fight it a long time be strong the storm 's almost over yes sir I completely understand as far as I know he be here voluntarily right I understand it be a delicate situation what have he say he claim he be invite by the family and now he have they believe their love one be in a well place and they be all devout the people they love be trouble it be either believe they be in a well place or live with the guilt it do not matter we can not arrest he can we deport he probably not it be crazy diplomatic immunity be not intend to shield people from murder charge so hotch bypass the state department go straight to the italian consulate and lose his career the state department will not risk the potential embarrassment they will shut we all down there be some real politic for you so what do we do now do you check his paper with ice yeah his diplomatic status run till the end of the month what he tell Emily the storm 's almost over so so forget priest think unsub he be a believer he deal in certainty in his mind he have a job to do which do not end until the end of the month the storm 's almost over there be another victim on his list what cause their death medically yes please I can not say be they under stress we all be do you sprinkle holy water on they that be part of the exorcism ritual what be in the holy water Sarin VX the small amount would trigger respiratory failure I be not familiar with they no really because that be what a lot of people think kill father Del Toro in

Episode18 Omnivore fate be not satisfied with inflict one calamity roman author publilius syrus Bye you want to know immediately about any unusual boston homicide we be go to boston well should not we wait for the official request we have not be invite we will be well it look like we be go to boston the reaper be drive by a need to dominate control and manipulate so then why would he offer a deal that would stop he from do that well killing give he power but after so many the payoff begin to diminish so he decide to switch tactic offer the deal give he the ultimate power well even than kill he manipulate the police into voluntarily surrender he even get it in write he win why start kill again well because the only person who know he would win the person he make the deal with just die narcissistic killer need other people to recognize their power that be why they contact the medium so how do he stop for 10 year in night of the reaper the author suggest he have be arrest for an unrelated crime or die perhaps he be try to correct that misconception what have he be do all this time plan what he would do if he start kill again so from ' 95 to ' 98 he shoot stab and bludgeon 21 victim Men woman all age all type no specific victimology or m o how do you build a profile from there we do not Shaunessy send we home before we have a chance Btk the zodiac and the reaper all have similarity they be all highly intelligent discipline sadistic killer who name themselves in the press highly intelligent may be a bit of an understatement the reaper and the zodiac killer have never be arrest the btk killer be only catch after 25 year because he go to the press to counter a book that say he have die move away or be lock up just like this one speak of the medium when this get out it be go to be a frenzy if they get wind of this they be go to be all over the boston police the long we can float the copycat story the well chance we will have of catch he Rossi prentiss and morgan go to the field office set up shop go through everything there Jj and reid we will go to the crime scene I work the reaper case for 18 month if there be any proof that this horrible crime be anything more than a copycat I will be the first one to let you know sorry I have not call you back as you can see I be busy it be not a copycat mike I wish it be but it be not yeah no offense you do not know that and I do not invite you in Shaunessy do want to invite we in what be he think this could destroy the department I know this be ssa jennifer jareau dr Spencer reid sergeant mike o'mara uh we be set up at the field office ok I be do here give they anything they want thank you Nina hale 19 and evan harvey 23 Nina 's throat be slash she be stab 46 time Evan be bludgeon and then shoot no shell casing be find he prefer revolver 44 magnum the young the female victim the more time he spend with they usually with a knife Tan line on r wrist probably wear a watch of some sort do we have his wallet the reaper take item from each victim and place they on the next so as to make sure we know it be he no corrective lens requirement the glass be not his he only take glass from one victim the ninth we should have find they on the tenth and we do not they be never find what be so special about the ninth victim he survive George foyet 28 be the ninth victim and the only one to survive the reaper not for lack of try Amanda bertrand 19 his date for the evening be not as lucky he like to attack they inside or near their car at night on poorly light less populated road Foyet i d he approach they pretend to be a lost tourist in the hospital we put foyet with a sketch artist the reaper always use some sort of ruse to get close to and spend time with his victim the eye as he depict it e eye of providence a symbol adopt by the u s government and incorporate into the great seal in 1782 with the word Annuit coeptis inscribe beneath that be latin for providence or fate have favor our undertaking the reaper seem to see himself as the personification of fate so how do foyet survive 911 what be your emergency I just murder 2 more excuse I sir do you say you murder someone victim 8 and 9 by a silver toyota on riverton past the tyson quarry that call be make from a pay phone about a mile from the crime scene Emts arrive 15 minute later Bertrand be d o a foyet barely breathe so the reaper make one of these call after each of his killing tell police where to find the body until this one the ninth if he have not make this call foyet would not have be find in time the call save he so the reaper do not make any11 call after this one yeah look like he learn his lesson there be a reason he leave foyet 's glass at the last crime scene Foyet could be in danger we will find he Hotch there be a reporter outside insist on speak with you Roy colson he say he know you Roy Agent hotchner so if it be just a copycat what be you do here help the police catch he be that your story come on I write the book on this guy I even send you a sign copy I assume you get it officially we have no reason to think that he be anything but a copycat we how about unofficially what be more important to you roy get the story or get the killer I uh I spend time with the family I uh I tell the victim ' story now you would know that if you read my book it be a good book roy you treat the victim with respect and you treat we fairly every dime I make go to the family I know that be why I come down the minute I have something I can say I will call you thank if it be he it will not be long I do not believe it Unbelievable Honey please do not I be not speed I be not drunk good evening officer license registration and proof of insurance I will be right back he have not even tell I why he stop we let us just get this over with I be go to let you off with a warning a warning for what you be at the wrong place at the wrong time excuse I and now I be go to kill your wife arthur please no another couple much old this time one shot and one stab no reason to stop out here his license and registration be out of his wallet look like he use a cop ruse good spot isolated few driver he leave nina hale 's watch ok so what have he take his wedding ring Arthur and diane lanessa Weymouth marry 32 year they be come home from the elk where they play bingo twice a week I get to go make notification you want company I get it look like he go through her purse any idea what he be look for the question mark be new it be for we he be say it be not fate he be say we have 10 year to save they and that these late one be on we you get all that from one question mark that be impressive I may know he well than I 've let on at do that mean it mean that there be a profile on the reaper I think we be call off before we have one we be I have just start the profile and then he stop kill so officially we be do but this case it stick with you I keep come back to it over the year and I work on it alone so you never share it with anyone I know I be always preach that profiling be a collaborative effort but this one be not I do not know maybe if if I be wrong I be go to head we in the wrong direction now you think you be right the more I see the more accurate I think it may be ok then we need to hear it the reaper fit a profile we refer to as an omnivore unlike most serial killer an omnivore do not target a specific victim type although he tend to focus on his young female victim with his knife he essentially be a predator who will kill anyone why be he so democratic because his kill be not just about his victim he need recognition he need we to know the symbol the placement of prior victim ' possession on subsequent victim it be all for we why power the shaunessy letter be the clear example of this he manipulate tom shaunessy into literally surrender to he the burden be too much to bear in very real sense tom shaunessy be the reaper 's 22nd victim like btk killer dennis rader the reaper be extremely disciplined in his everyday life this will very likely make he so inflexible he can not keep close relationship or work closely with other I believe our killer have another interest that may give we our good opportunity to catch he the reaper 's last victim be an old woman he kill she quickly with a single shot the prior young victim he spend more time with and stab 46 time why he pay special attention to his young female victim and his weapon of choice with they be the knife a substitute instrument for bodily penetration and the young the victim the more time and effort he spend I think our guy be a hebophile Hebophile someone who be attract to adolescent post pubescent child teenager look for man with access to authority high school teacher counselor coach and anyone who be be charge with sex crime against teenage girl in the last 10 year that be all for now thank you Garcia can not find george foyet I 've get nothing sir what do you mean he be go I mean he be completely off the grid and he be go how be that possible 9 month after he be release from the hospital he uh quit his job sell his car close his bank account cancel his credit card cell phone apartment everything he have no paper thus he have no trail and I can not find he 'cause he be go you think it be intentional it be more than that like even dead people stay on the grid for decade take it from I erase yourself like this it be extremely difficult it take commitment you would have to be willing to cut every tie of everything and everyone you 've ever know in your entire life it be like it be like kill yourself I get to say this be impressive well after what the guy be be through can you blame he Foyet 's the only live person who know what the reaper look like and he be still out there but it do not change the fact that we still need to find he I will keep look Garcia we do not have much time I know sir he would have to completely isolate himself he be totally alone but how do you cut all tie you would have to talk to someone right Colson Roy Aaron hotchner I need a favor how do colson find this guy he interview foyet extensively for his book they keep in touch they be friend sort of but foyet would not give he his phone number he give he one of his alias though that be he George foyet it be ok we be fbi this be agent rossi I be agent hotchner we meet once before do you remember yeah I remember would you mind if we get off the street please Sure how have you guy find I Roy colson well be this go to take long 'cause I really can not be late for work what do you do I be a freelance computer specialist with the city we be sorry to bother you we will make it as quick as possible this yours I know it be not a copycat thank you I be sorry I be go to propose to she that night at the restaurant but I get cold foot the ring be still in my pocket when he approach we he say he be lose he have one of those sightseeing booklet I be look at it when he stab I yeah Perfect time mr Foyet you do not need to go through this again I could not move I just sit there bleed I watch he kill mandy he stab her 67 time do you know how long it take to stab somebody 67 time I never find the ring he should have leave your glass on his next victim but he do not he hold on to they all this time well you think he be get some special interest in I I 've be live with that possibility for the past 11 year have you receive any strange letter or call Hang up I keep residence under different name I move between they randomly he like to get you in a car so I take the bus believe I I 've go to great length to make sure that none of the thing you 've just mention ever happen we will need your other name and residence so we can reach you we can take you someplace safe until this be over no Boston 's my home it be the o thing I promise I would never let he take from I then we will protect you here you can not protect I nobody can please be careful with this please it be safe with we he be just a man nothing more then why can not you catch he we will thank you for your time hey uh this be drop off at my office I will get this to the lab be you go to run the story roy if I do not he will just give it to somebody else maybe maybe not to he you be special he want you to know why he stop what do you mean you write his biography roy believe I over the last 10 year he be read those word thousand of time your book have sustain he in his mind nobody know he well than you do nobody care for he like you you remember what it be like here 10 year ago on the street the fear and that be when people trust the police not this time not if you tell they about shaunessy but it be a hell of a story run with it do you have any idea what you be ask I to do I be not ask you to do anything this be the big story of my life and it be mine it be an exclusive I can offer you full and exclusive access to the fbi 's behavioral analysis unit after we catch he right if I hold the story I do not say that full access to the entire unit Nobody be ever have that I know but but I mean what if you can not catch he well that be a risk you be go to have to take Hotchner who be this if you stop hunt I I will stop hunt they you think I would take that it be a good deal I 've misjudge you I think you be smart than this you should take it and you 've misjudge I this be your last chan I do not make deal I be the guy who hunt guy like you there be no guy like I you all think that you will regret this I will see you soon almost miss you drive make a right at the next light I want your jewelry and your wallet pull over right here just take the money nobody need to get hurt actually they do 6 body not include the driver he put they down with the gun or more likely gun and finish they off with his knife Arthur lanessa 's wedding ring what do he take do it matter what be go on with you he call I tonight at my hotel and offer I the deal what do you say I hang up on he and then he do this so you think this be your fault it be well here use mine you convince I no no you hang up on he you practically kill they yourself go ahead get it over with do not worry about we we will get this guy without you Dave I have 10 year to do something about it Shaunessy make the deal the killing stop he close the case and send the b a u away for 10 year you work on other case active case but I keep come back to this one I keep come back to this profile I be retire should I blame myself for every victim who got kill while be be on my book tour look if you want to end up like shaunessy like gideon blame yourself for everything you go ahead but that voice in your head it be not your conscience it be your ego this be not about we aaron it be about the bad guy that be why we profile they it be their fault we be just guy do a job and when we stop do it someone else will trust I I know you can put that away you sure it be a little dramatic do not you think my wife always say I have a flair for the dramatic which one all of they thank anytime go ahead and run your story it will not matter after this I be but I be goa leave the shaunessy deal out I do not think the family need to know not at least until you catch he I appreciate that Foyet call he want to see I be he mad that you give he to we I just think he do not have anyone to talk to and the reaper 's kill he too only slow he would not be the first he never use code before why now they be not part of a pattern or equation mathematically they be insignificant maybe so but I know I 've see they before Foyet say he like to attack people in their car tonight he hit a bus which be why foyet only take a bus it be the number 7 and it stop right in front of foyet 's apartment he know where foyet live and he want we to know it 1439 the apartment you interview he in today be 1439 yarbrough the other address he give we 201 south brookline 1488 edenhurst the number on the bus be foyet 's address we will split up and cover each address I will take the back there be no one here we get nothing same thing here have you hear from morgan wake up derek it be time to die if it be any consolation I do not think he know what hit he I will call jj the bureau 's go to have to make a statement you all right he take my credential the important thing be you be ok he leave I this power and manipulation do not let he get to you yeah right ow come on man Prentiss he be tell I I have you Morgan you be alive you know why it do not really matter I be sit here because I be knock out cold he could not torture I he like to interact with his victim to tell they he be go to kill they before he do or by let they know he could have Hotch be right he be just try to get into your head right or wrong he have I O'mara be clearly kill outside this be someone else there be sign of a struggle and a lot of blood but no body just the drag mark the human body hold 5 quart of blood I would say there be a little more than half that here whoever the bleeder be they lose too much to survive Foyet it be his bad fear that the reaper would come back and finish the job we offer he protection he refuse it be his choice why be he so focus on foyet what be so special about he he be his only survive victim the only one he could not defeat but he be not a threat defeat he would be no great accomplishment there be something there that we be miss what about the girlfriend amanda bertrand what do we know about her 19 a freshman she come she from michigan to go to school Foyet be a teacher 's assistant in one of amanda 's course Michigan where the reaper have shaunessy post the personal ad that can not be a coincidence he tell we she be the love of his life that he be go to propose but

her parent be both at the movie theater Mike his old son and his girlfriend be there so be my nephew everybody in the room lose somebody when I first hear about it I just come right here I have my nurse bring equipment set up triage nobody need it they be they be all dead every single one of they I wish I could tell you this be the bad of it but I can not when he strike again he be go to be aim for even more victim my god you need to send everybody home large gathering like this be a bad idea all right Dr Rawlings when I speak to the police chief he say that you know everyone in royal well pretty much I grow up here I inherit my father 's practice I deliver 11 of those people lie in there there be a strong probability that the killer be local you think somebody from royal do this it be usually the case we want to handle this investigation as gently as possible without point finger what we be ask you to decide be what be more important People 's privacy or their safety Most of the victim die of smoke inhalation thank god a few of they be trample my cousin Gary and his wife Linda if you need some time we be talk gasoline and match and this be the point of origin the second one be in the lobby this one burn the long Slower too Less oxygen less fuel he use a lot more gas in the lobby Place go up like a haystack what about the sprinkler Bastard turn off the main water line you know the unsub could have set this fire first Lobby burn hard and fast force the victim out this way where he have already block the exit and where the smoke from the slow burn fire have already build up and whoever do do this know that even if the fire department get here in time to stop the fire Cathy they still would not have be able to save they I and Daniel be both volunteer the whole company be get about 20 firefighter plus our own ladder truck and pumper an emt run a 2 Person crew 24 7 we manage to get it out pretty fast not fast enough all those people who would have so much hate someone whose rage have be build for year but what he do I the unsub know exactly what he be do he be be practice for a long time Nuisance fire vandalism he may have even burn himself well that sound like every teenage boy who be ever grow up in royal I do not know if you notice but there be really not a lot to do here you have our report all the record be in there maybe so but we all know there be time when thing do not get report Times when you be just try to protect someone just try to um make the situation go away we be just try to help people out sometimes the good way to do that be to forget that it ever happen we be go to need to know about those time I have be through every piece of footage I could find no one stick out at the fire no one appear to be inappropriately voyeuristic no one with bandage yeah Garcia no firebug firefighter no flammable juvie record however of the 128 report instance of petty larceny and vandalism in the last year there be a few name that sort of stick out so I be email you those photo I also have a pattern of small gasoline fire about 300 mile away a town call Franklin get a uh trash can fire a christmas tree and an abandon shed and I send you that file give the 500 Mile search radius there be bind to be a certain percentage of nuisance fire we can not necessarily attribute that to our unsub with a gasoline accelerant our unsub and this guy nice work Garcia what about the victim well give that I 've have less than 8 hour I can not really I appreciate the time constraint what have you find uh a mixture of age and gender mostly local a cousin visit from a nearby town be there any crossover between the victim and the 2 town Garcia hey it be a little teeny tiny town there be nothing but crossover um Alex Nagel he be kill in the rec center now not only be Nagel an upstande member of the local church he also own quite a bit of real estate in royal include the movie theater Windy kennedy be kill at the movie theater she be a single mom she work a double shift at the local discount store and she still manage to find time to volunteer at the rec center I also have a third Grade teacher third cousin and at least 3 potential affair you be go to have to start weed out some of these Garcia Third cousin and religious affiliation be probably not go to help we I need to know who have enemy who have secret who be a target oh with all due respect sir my brain muscle be comfortable with be intuitive with information not people look at people like that be not part of my job description I be not a profiler well you be go to have to be we do not have much time you two look into the nuisance fire Garcia stay on the radio Yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with I you say large gathering be not a good idea be not a target but this service the unsub would not want to interrupt the grief he create but he may want to watch it we be look for inappropriate behavior for the situation too much emotion too little emotion someone who keep to himself watch other ' reaction someone who insinuate himself too closely into someone else 's grief we be focus on know offender with a propensity for arson Brian Miller 18 year old and he be be vandalize property for almost all 18 of they Staff they comfort I John Clayton 27 he set fire to his neighbor 's garage claim it be an accident but he file a complaint the previous month that the neighbor kill his dog Thou anointest my head with oil my cup runneth over surely goodness and mercy shall follow I all the day of my life

have be able to resist see the damage he have do Captain hey captain can I get a word it start in the kitchen look like he come around to the back and toss a cocktail through the window different delivery system that be a big deviance from his m o but perfect for this location I do not know though with a space this small he should not have be able to pour the gasoline without be notice nobody see a thing witness say they hear an explosion well I guarantee he stick around to watch boom the bar match his previous location it be another local hot spot only 5 victim this time why low the body count Rossi there be something else that be different the front and back he really want to make sure nobody get out this time but why bother no one make it out of the other one maybe he know the fire department would show up soon yeah we be fast now Practice make perfect what the hell difference do it make and what good be you guy do we you see chain figure he do not want anyone to get out I could have tell you that we be not criticize anyone our job be to look at the same thing you do but to try to see they from a different perspective sure look all due respect captain but you look at that chain and you say the killer want to make sure nobody get out right we look at that chain and we see a little more that chain be different than the first two fire now either we be look at an entirely new arsonist or this unsub want to make absolutely certain nobody get out now if this be true that mean something change maybe his emotion change maybe his agenda but something see this chain tell we this be the fire that matter this fire be go to help we catch this guy my father be chief here for over 30 year last 2 week I lose more folk that he do in his whole career Agent prentiss Sorry Chief what do we know 4 dead the bartender nancy be still hang on how bad be she pretty bad she be unconscious when they take she if we get a chance we need to talk to her I be off duty I hear it on the radio God I be sorry Tina I just talk to he on the phone he say he be come home Tina 's fiance jason own the bar he be inside when it all happen when be it go to stop anything we get a completely different m o assume it be not a copycat we know why the unsub be not at the funeral someone in that bar be more important to he than anything else Morgan call Garcia tell she we need to know absolutely everything there be to know about these 5 victim and we need to know it now I will go tell chief carlson we want to talk to his officer hello hey how be miss smart and sexy do today Fair warning cupcake as much as I love you and our witty banter I be all out of witty and banter and be struggle with love what be wrong baby I be stand at the crossroad of 31 life and what I see be a train wreck you want a little tour this be what I mean here we go Flip phillip he beat his wife it go on for year although you would not know it if you look at the police report because that be one of the perk of be the mayor David Alexander he sue his boss for 5 million over something totally lame and what make it even more erotic be he be sleep with the boss ' daughter and then there be where be she oh one of the town councilwoman now she have a terminally ill husband and also 3 boyfriend under the age of 20 I want to believe that the world be just teem with awesome people but all of this be give I great pause I want to go back to cyberspace I be sorry sweetheart not yet I get a few more name for you ok just um please tell I they be still alive I wish I could do that Garcia all of the first 4 fire the convenience store the restaurant the rec center and the movie theater be indicative of a revenge arsonist that be someone who be seek retaliation for an injustice whether real or imagine Revenge arsonist often target group headquarters such as church or government building this unsub have choose local gathering place with large number of potential victim inside it be clear to we that he be choose to target this community as a whole that tell we that the unsub be a local someone who live or grow up in royal but he feel like an outsider as if this community have wrong he in some type of way these fire be just his way of strike back try to draw attention to himself these fire not only kill innocent people they also give the unsub a sense of power over the community but somehow those fire be lack they do not exact the correct measure of punishment or attract enough attention or they do not attract the attention of the right person so with the bar fire he do not increase the number of victim he reduce they that be why the third fire be key he be not strike out at the community as a whole anymore he be now strike out at one or more individual you be sure it be the same guy the odd of another arsonist in a town this small be almost negligible that be why we need to concentrate on these victim these 5 will hold the key so all we get to do be just figure out who would have want to hurt they it may not be that simple this type of rage tend to stem from thing that people keep bury thing they just do not talk about which be why we be go to have to dig deeply Understood excuse I how be she we could not even send she to the burn unit in gary it would not have matter we will be brief Nancy it be I the FBI be here Nancy can you tell we what happen there be a crash then everything explode Cocktail what happen before that be there anything unusual or out of the ordinary do anyone come in or leave just jason Jason the owner he come for the money like always he be dead be not he Nancy what about customer be there anyone there who seem anxious or upset he would have keep to himself take a seat away from the other customer maybe he be check his watch or his cell phone there be a guy he seem angry he keep change seat ok we have to stop who be that Nancy you know his name now so tell we about the bar victim all right Hilda and roger drake she be a teacher he sell insurance Friends enemy oh no nothing like that they seem sweet their big problem be find baby name Hilda be pregnant be you sure the m E have not even start yet no people in royal take out ad Lordy lordy look who be 40 ask jane what she be do at the american legion on friday night that be just wrong that be small Town life for you your business be everybody 's business there be a belly watch on hilda uh what about eric gall oh eric he be a boozer he spend most of his time at pop 's place I 've get a few drunk and disorderlie but he seem harmless and give the amount of round he buy it be safe to say the whole town love he it be hotch yeah what be up ok I get it ok well they manage to speak to the bartender accord to she there be a guy there before the fire he do not speak to anybody and he keep switch seat she do not seem to recognize he ok wait so she know the owner and the boozer and the husband would not have get up and change seat if the bartender do not recognize he maybe he be just not from royal that be not necessarily true what if she know he and she just do not realize it what like a disguise the fire captain say the unsub know the layout of the movie theater he use that knowledge to light the fire but at the bar the unsub keep change his seat which would give he a well view of the entrance and exit so he be study the layout he be not familiar with the area what if he grow up in royal and he move away Garcia what year be that bar build uh the bar be build 5 6 year ago and what about the movie theater the movie theater be build in the forty it be a single screen they divide it 2 year ago rec center be build in the late seventy I be go to call hotch Jason elliot open pop 's place 6 year ago when he move to royal from indianapolis why do he have friend or family here none that I could find what about the bar do jason buy it from someone take over their business no Jason start the bar himself he name it after his father who by the way be his sole beneficiary make sense he be single well he be single up until a couple day ago because 2 day ago jason marry Tina wheeler the emt yeah I have check she out originally as one of the first responder but her work record look squeaky clean and so I let it go until I realize she would marry Jason and then I do some more aggressive digging which I should remind you you ask I to do and it turn out that Tina 's parent die in a fire when she be 5 after they die she and her brother Tommy be send to live with their grandparent in royal send we everything you have on they well that be just it I get I get plenty on Tina but I can not really find anything on her brother Tina she uh she live in royal she go to a community college a few town over get a degree take a job work hard married jason uh wait Tommy it be like he just disappear find he Garcia Lana perry please hi this be penelope Garcia of the fbi I want to ask you some question you have a second yes I I want to ask you some question about a student uh name Tommy wheeler thank you thank you very much oh my god Sir I think I have something we believe jason elliot may have be the target Jason the bartender say that jason stop by the bar at the same time each day to pick up the cash and take it to the bank which would have make he an easy target for anyone who know his schedule I do not get all this Jason be a good man it may sound corny to you but everybody love he 2 day ago Jason elliot marry Tina wheeler she tell I about it yesterday uh all the tragedy make they not want to wait it be a damn shame what can you tell we about Tina 's brother Tommy Tommy uh nobody be see he around here in more than 10 year uh we actually think they may have they just might not recognize he how be that possible well he be aged 10 year and he would make sure to go unnoticed Garcia Tommy wheeler Little Tommy wheeler you remember he he and his sister Tina move to royal when he be 5 Doc rawling be his pediatrician apparently early medical record indicate Tommy may have be emotionally unbalanced Tommy be a little unstable his parent die bring that out grant I do not have a medical degree but my guess be watch his parent die in a fire do not help Tommy 's emotional well be what about Tina how do the fire affect her uh Tina be not as damage by it as he be uh she adjust more quickly she be Tommy 's lifeline she be more than that in a situation like this no parent new environment and grandparent probably too old to take care of they Tina become Tommy 's whole world Sister mother family they be very close close enough that Tina distort Tommy 's love map the way an individual give or receive love their love map be establish by the age of 6 with the death of the parent Tommy 's love map revolve exclusively around Tina yeah it be like they be in their own little world by the time they be 8 they even have their own language it be a bit disturbing but understandable perfectly understandable maybe so what happen what do you think happen People talk it be the only real occupation in royal there be rumor it be that Tommy and Tina be too close Tommy wheeler my god that be your sister nothing be ever confirm though no it be not but then the truth do not matter after the rumor start thing get ugly People point finger Tommy got expel from school base on nothing but hearsay not true the school have cause Garcia no they do not I speak to his teacher she tell I how the whole school and the whole town turn against he base on nothing but a rumor she also tell I another rumor Garcia in this one 14 Year Old Tommy be beat within an inch of his life by adult grown man I do not hear about it until after the fact there be nothing I could do broken bone puncture lung all because of a rumor I could not go after anyone base on only my suspicion nobody be talk about it not even Tommy I speak to his grandparent and tell they what to do yeah so they move Tommy to a colorado boarding school and they cut off all tie between he and his sister it be as if Tommy never even exist it be for the good they would have kill he if what Garcia say be true then this town 's action go a long way towards make Tommy who he be we need to talk to Tina go on around take the back yes sir Tina it be I Brad Tina 00 31 58 760 00 32 01 040 Morgan find out if Tina show up for work today Tina Tina Tina Clear Nobody be here yeah Morgan Tina do not show up for her shift thank she leave her cell phone you think it be Tommy yes Tommy Put out an apb for Tommy and Tina close all road in and out of royal no no he love her he would not hurt she accord to his former teacher Tommy wheeler enrol in a colorado boarding school under the name thomas boren that be his dead mother 's maiden name I track down his record he be at that school for half a year before he land in juvie where he reside for the next 3 his psych eval during his stay be less than stellar so how mad do you think he be well if I be he I would be pretty mad oh god Garcia the town do turn against he I mean that be not an excuse no not Tommy Hotch I mean he do tell I to dig right so I dig and grant I be not suppose to have direct contact with the public or purport myself as an fbi agent and ok I be definitely not suppose to accuse someone of a felony or even a misdemeanor especially when I do not have any actual evidence oh god I do just what they do I I base everything on a rumor I got suck right in I do not mean to I Garcia come on baby Stick to Tommy right sorry ok uh he be release from juvie when he be 16 you could not find he that be when the trail go cold no I say the trail go cold I do not say it disappear this be the part I be actually good at whatever he do in the interim remain a mystery much to my chagrin but at the age of 21 Thomas boren re Emerged in Franklin Indiana that be 300 mile away from royal say mr Boren purchase copious amount of gasoline 2 month ago it be not unusual to do in indiana but mr Tommy wheeler boren do not own a farm the nuisance fire Roger that and then after his little spending spree that be when the trail go cold and I can not find he yeah hotch all right there be still no sign of Tina he want you to bring rawling we 've lock down the town and put out a statewide alert so far nothing where in royal would Tommy take his sister it be hard to say it be likely to be a place that be important to the both of they maybe a place that they go to together as kid I do not know the only place I can think of be their grandparent ' old house but that be tear down year ago that be not go to help we I 've get picture of she with the grandparent and friend nothing with Tommy Garcia be right after he be send away Tommy no long exist not even as a memory Tommy please what be we do here I

awful thing that happen to they that make they do the god awful thing to somebody else have seriously impair my ability to giggle and it make my brain all wonky and I do not like it Garcia yes sir I just want to thank you for your excellent work on this case and I understand that what you do be for you very difficult but your contribution be essential to the success of this team thank you sir I know you see the good in people Penelope always and I would never want you to change that how be you feel today you let I smoke what more can I ask for Most patient have a hard time cope with new surrounding they probably believe they will be release I be not so naive you do not believe you will be get out would you let I out I would like to talk about adam he be still miss so I 've hear will you help we find he no why not what more do you need to hide I be not hide anything and I think the well question would be what be you look for Dr Reid I think you know what I be look for I want to hear you say it I be look for adam just because you catch I do not mean you will find he you be not that smart this be not about be smart this be out do the right thing I do the right thing Chandler

I be a cleaning lady now I be your boss and you will be whatever I want you to be ok what room 319 daniel keller 21 a junior at benjamin franklin university he be kill last night while spring break in south padre island c o d asphyxiation he be the second victim to be murder there in the past 3 night the first be william browder also on spring break c o d asphyxiation they be both sexually assaulted prior to death man be rape and murder on spring break well that be a twist so far the death have be localize to one hotel the hudson street hotel initially the hotel be fill to capacity but lose 20 occupancy overnight we should get a list of everyone who work there there be a good chance one of they be the unsub at the very least have interact with he yeah gaia be already on that both victim be discover by hotel staff the last after online checkout indicate the room have be vacate so he want the body discover and soon rather than later look at the way they be pose naked cowering in the fetal position he be send a message something about this be important to he we just need to figure out what and we need to do it soon the police suspect the unsub could be another vacation student though I be not willing to rule out local involvement make sense if the killer be a student they could be halfway across the country by the time we be onto they if he be a local we could lose he as soon as his victim pool dry up either way we be almost out of time South padre spring break season end this weekend http sfile ydy com proudly present http sfile ydy com sync ßçèâèâ Criminal Minds Season04 Episode20 conflicted light think it travel fast than anything but it be wrong no matter how fast light travel it find the darkness have always get there first and be wait for it Terry pratchett national medium have pick up on the story we be go to have to make a statement when we land we want to make people aware without obviously cause panic Stress hypervigilance the whole buddy system yeah I be all over it I just do not think anyone 's go to listen what do you mean come on Drunk college student do not exactly want to hear they should not talk to stranger right be there any dna leave on the scene uh yeah too much dna this portion of the garcia show will be bring to you by the letter I for icky the lab have recover over 100 different trace sample as multiple guest create a cesspool of dna also there be no way to determine the exact time of secretion or to eliminate anyone actually work at the hotel be you able to find any connection between the first two victim no they grow up in different state the go to college on opposite coast I do the whole cross reference credit card thing could not make it connect so the hotel 's the only common denominator yeah and it should be note that the first victim william browder be not exactly a register guest well that be a popular thing to do I mean youngster do it all the time they rent a room they pack in as many kid as possible to save cost we could be deal with hundred of unregistered guest we need to check every guest whether they be on the book or not Male rape male so be we prese our unsub or victim could be gay that be not necessarily true in male rape sexual preference typically have less to do with the crime than the power and dominance the attacker feel from the act itself still it be a question we should ask the family when we interview they it could help we determine how the unsub meet the victim we get a lot of work to do Emily jj and I will go to the local p d and start victimology the rest of you there be your new home you must be the fbi David rossi these be agent morgan and reid Julie riley I be the manager you be on duty when the late body be discover that be right do you happen to notice anyone out of the ordinary I be afraid not you see so many face during the spring break pretty soon they all start to blur we need to set up interview with the rest of your staff as soon as possible also talk to the hotel guest of course how many camera do you have on the property not enough we have all the main entrance and the garage cover but the hallway and the service tunnel be not equip can you show we the room where the last body be find um I will start round up the rest of the staff for you to talk to thank no sign of struggle report everything seem normal when housekeeping arrive look at this Scratch mark on the footboard the victim be bind before the struggle gan well that would make sense both victim be in pretty good shape probly need they tie up in order to control they the question be be it consensual or be it coerce reese evan Agent hotchner these be agent prentiss and jareau hello well thank for be here if it be all right with you we would like to talk to the victim 's friend and family as soon as possible of course Michael browder the father of the first victim have just arrive to claim his son 's body and the second victim 's girlfriend should be here within the hour do uh mr Browder know the detail of his son 's murder not everything I mean there be certain matter I do not want to bring up on the phone if you do not mind we would like to handle that ourselves we be go to have to ask he a few difficult question about his son honestly I have be dread it all day I will talk to the girlfriend right this way so if I be the unsub and it be not consensual how do this work you would have to have a weapon a gun to the face mean he do not scream out look at the distance between where each of the arm be tie there be no way he could have tie that second hand himself which mean the unsub do it for he which would be risky because if he know he be in danger and he see the opportunity he would take it then why not drug he and then tie he up eliminate the risk the tox screen come back negative so it be either consensual or he have a partner he be also learn fast what do you mean he hide the body in the closet and then indicate that the guest have check out which mean when the housekeeper get here everything look normal and she start clean wipe everything down erase any fingerprint or dna which could have be leave on the scene we need to talk to whoever clean this room maybe they see something that can tell we who be in here with dan keller Mr Browder do your son have any history of drug abuse Marijuana methamphetamine anything none he w an athlete in high school and college test regularly do he mention anything about meet someone here in south padre Old acquaintance he come down with some friend from his school they want to blow off steam before final Mr Browder be your son gay he have have sex with a man before he die know whether or not it be consensual will help we determine how he be target Adam jackson your manager say we could find you up here uh I I get migraine you discover the body last night yeah have you ever see he before or notice anyone he may have be with I 've never see he before in my life since I open the closet I can not get he out of my head Adam what about the first victim william browder have you ever see he before never see either of they let I ask you this be there anything you remember about the room before you discover the body it might not seem like much but the small detail could really help we a lot it look pretty normal I mean until I open the closet door do anything stand out about the body or uh for that matter anyone at the hotel last night no man you see one drunk frat guy you see them all Adam I think you say you do not recognize he I do not I just that girl from corpus christi across the they walk around like they own the place you know they think they can do whatever they want how long have you work here 6 month I guess appreciate your time thank you can I ask you a question yeah you 've see bad stuff right I have yeah how long before you can close your eye without it be there I be afraid I still do not know Morgan and reid be finish the interview what do you learn it do not look like either of our victim be gay Dan keller 's girlfriend describe he as overtly sexual and aggressive towards woman it cause quite a few problem in their relationship and his friend say they be out party prior to his death and he be definitely willing to overlook the fact that he have a girlfriend do that match with what you find at the scene yes and no what do you mean the victim be both big guy yet there be no sign of a struggle we profile it as either be consensual or the unsub have a partner sound right what be your hesitation what if it be both how so well even if he be confront by two man the first reaction of an alpha male would be to fight but not if it be a woman it be spring break she lure the victim to her hotel room tie he up then once he be subdue her partner arrive that could explain the posing and the rape the victim be alpha male with aggressive sexual tendency the unsub treat his victim the way they treat woman so we have a team a woman who lure they back to their hotel room and tie they up and a man who rape and murder they thank man oh look at that whoa ho where be you go do not worry about it your unsub have change hotel what can you tell we the vic 's name be carl cade another spring breaker any witness his friend see he last night leave a party with a brunette in a green dress both have be drink for most of the day and he only catch a glimpse of the girl before they leave the party and he find the body pose just like the other it sound like our theory about the partner be right Woman lure the victim back she offer up a little kink then tie he up only this time the unsub venture outside of their comfort zone they change hotel ok so what be he do get bolder or smart well the local police be on alert the fbi be here they probably change pattern to avoid getting catch or because they see we at the other hotel we need to go back to hudson street we believe at least one of our unsub be either a guest at the hudson street hotel or possible an employee there we have agent in uniform recanvasse the entire property but we all know kid on spring break they migrate from place to place we can not be sure that the killer 's still on site which be why we need you to circulate this profile we believe we be look for a dominant submissive team a man and a woman probably in their 20 we be look for a heterosexual male who most likely be submissive in his everyday life with everyone except his partner to she he become dominant his submissive female partner will be socially awkward of average intelligence and emotionally unstable look for woman who be reclusive have a problem with authority and can not interact with dominant personality this form of male rape be about power and dominance it be not about sexual orientation so victimology be key this team target alpha personality male who think that woman be their right add drug or alcohol to the equation and now we be deal with eager victim even with the mention of rape an alpha personality fuel by intoxication believe that he can control the situation and eventually gain the upper hand we will need to blanket the beach with flier talk to other hotel and bartender we have get 2 day until the spring break season end so let us get to work hey hotch I think we get something check this no report male rape anywhere in the area it be not surprising since it be like one of the least report crime on the book I also look at video surveillance for the hudson street hotel on the day of both murder and zip tell I there be a but come but I also look at the day lead up to both murder and would not you know it jackpot of jackpot that would be william browder aka victim number one I would like to call he jerkface seemingly

safe to say he would kill for you no then ela it to I what exactly be the relationship we 've be friend since I be just a kid be you lover no well then why do she pay for everything you have it be not like it be a handout I mean I be work at the hotel so I can pay she back do she pay for the drug also I I tell you I get migraine so ke a prescription I think you be different what do that mean do you see something in adam 's past that remind you of yourself I do not know what you mean in 2003 you report a sexual assault and from the look of the file the police do not do a very thorough job look into it I do not want to talk about that I be go to ask you one more time would adam kill for you no then prove it you know a polygraph be not admissible if we catch they in a lie it could help we get a confession and we change interrogator so they can not get into a rhythm with their answer state your name Julie riley Adam jackson what color be your eye Blue where be you the night carl cade be kill at work at home who be the current president of the united states Barack obama do you murder dan keller do you murder william browder no no what be 32 minus 19 would you kill for julie you lie

think my couch be call Sweet dream what about you clean the pool change the a c filter fix the heat lamp by tonight I get it yeah thank so where be we honestly nowhere we just watch our two most viable suspect walk out the door if adam be not our unsub he have all the making to become one someday Reid tell I the question that he spike under in the polygraph it be a control question to set the baseline it be a geometric equation Reid I really think he be just intimidate he try he get it wrong but he be not suppose to know the answer anyway what if he lie what if what if he know the answer to the question but intentionally get it wrong I I do not know why would he do that because he realize that he would not know that answer you be lose I kid Adam be you in here Adam say he be not get any rest he take midday nap because he be always exhausted he have a history of blackouts reclusive behavior prolong repeat abuse suffer at the hand of a dominant male who transfer abuse from his female spouse to his prepubescent child where be you go with this what if our unsub couple be not a couple at all dissociative identity disorder you think adam 's a multiple personality well it fit recurrent physical abuse knowledge he should not have we 've see this before look at this all right the first intervention be timid it be apprehensive right but then he gets knock down there be a moment of calm and then his entire body language change I see this exact same transformation when adam leave the station only it be not rage it be uh arrogance like the alter ego want I to know why I do not know Power control all I know be the person that stare I down over there be not adam he be not assertive like that he do not make eye contt so you think the stress of the interrogation blur the line between adam and his alter personality I think the unsub surface for just a moment it know the answer to the question realize adam would not and lie so adam and the woman in the green dress be the same person we profile the duo accurately only the dominant personality and alter be inside of adam and adam have no idea he kill all those people you could argue that adam do not kill those people a separate person inside of he do I do not even know what we do with this we take he into custody we let the court decide I think you be head home I find this in your room you go in my room

neighborhood that take time victim be 3 boy so cross off anyone who target female we can eliminate anyone whose preferential age be over 7 or under 11 these boy look nothing alike so discount suspect who have a very specific type if the victim have only brown or blond hair they be off the list our unsub 's taste of more broad it loo like his preference be base more on age instead of physical characteristic let us make a special pile for more organize offender anyone who be be arrest for stalk uh break and enter burglary how be we do so far with these parameter I can probably cross off half the name Good let us keep go I clear our tech out of here what be it you be look for certain behavior what happen here will give we a clue about the unsub Kyle 's sheet and blanket be pull apart

other when we be finish have the tech look for any trace of blood or fiber he may have gag kyle in the other two case the boy be strike on the head what if he what if he use the weapon to scare they he could have he would have have to act quickly in order to keep kyle quiet tell I thing sunshine uh garcia I need your brain and computer system they be one and the same give I your question I email

be get fresh eye Rollins be scared he be ready to talk I will see what I can do I be go to take they down that way why do not you sweep they in we 've sweep the entire area where the first two victim be leave what if he go far south why there be a service road down that way that be not on this map yeah it be not mark but uh it would have be his fast way in and out of here well we know rollin do not spend a lot of time with kyle let us go here be your deal Club feed where be that any federal prison of your choice in new jersey where 's kyle murphy I throw he in the river you do not take he back to the wood no I do not have time you throw he in the delaware river yes he could be anywhere well I suppose that be so we may never find he guess that be true you do not throw he in the river you need more control than that you need to know exactly where the body be so you can go back and live it over and over again tell I the truth if he come in through the basement this would have be his second flight of stair so kyle 's be the first room he come to this be not a quiet struggle he probably knock kyle unconscious then carry he back downstairs what be through there Danny 's room it be interesting another few foot and he would have find danny Danny 's far more age appropriate for rollin ' preference he be close to the first two victim than kyle be if he have be stalk these family he would have know that it be weird what a neat 9 year old well that and most kid either pick a top or a bottom bunk both bed be sleep in the top bunk block the view of the star and there be nothing decorative down here it be danny 's room he probably sleep up top somebody wet the bed you know maybe danny start in the bottom bunk wet the bed and then move up top this be kyle 's it be size 6 Kyle sleep in here last night if he do not sleep in his room why be it destroy to make it look like the other crime scene over here oh god that be kyle that be he I tta call dan and sarah we see the picture he dump the first two boy like garbage this be different do you think rollin start feel guilt or remorse you know he be not capable whoever do this care about he Hugh rollin definitely kill the first two victim but it do not look like he kill kyle murphy I just talk to rollin he say he dump kyle 's body in the river he be clearly lie he do not have any connection to that boy the disposal of kyle 's body be very different from the other two he be gently place on the ground neatly lay to rest with his hand by his side rollin discard these two boy like trash we think kyle may not have sleep in his room last night where do you think he be I think in his brother 's room Danny have bunk bed both bunk be sleep in and whoever sleep in the bottom one wet the bed and leave kyle 's bear so do we think someone destroy kyle 's room to make it look like he be abduct like the other two victim who else know the detail of all 3 case Lancaster Morgan call garcia and see what she can find out about lancaster that we do not already know Reid and prentiss watch the video of the press conference see if you can find anything want I to talk to rollin again yes and I do not have to remind anybody where we be please be discreet we find kyle murphy 's body in the wood why do you lie you be not the type to take credit for something you do not do I can not go to trenton as long as you be straight with I I will tell the d a you cooperate be that what you need to hear People do not understand I can not explain why I do these thing all I know be that I can not help myself I do not want

sound yeah at first glance there do not seem to be a single frame to identify who shoot it he even cover up the mirror I 've see some crazy thing sit at this table but that why send that to the police well maybe it be a taunt to show the police how smart he be catch I if you can the two people in the video they look directly at the unsub and neither one seem to register that they be be film I think it be probably a hidden camera the witness be able to give we enough for a sketch white male early 30 wear glass it look like an editing suite so he not only film the murder he edit it do we know what this be that be play on the monitor Buffalo p D be concern that it might be another filmed killing if it be then we be not look at just one murder but two Buffalo be underfunde undermanned and they

darkness must be present Francis bacon a serial killer ask for help Wellthat be a new one on I Attempt at sarcasm what if he be sincere then he be deeply ambivalent he want to stop but like an alcoholic he simply can not when we see he drive his point of view be elevate I would say he be drive a van or an suv and the film stop where it start at his home so we could use the film to trace back street by street from the crime scene right it only last 9 minute and in this frame he clearly look at a clock and it be 9 22 ok the autopsy say michelle watson 's time of death be 4 30 in the afternoon so he edit out 7 hour Garcia look for unsolved murder of man in their early 30 who be stab Buffalo and surround city go back 10 year would not vicap have already pick up on that Mm vicap only go web base about a month ago and buffalo p D only recently upload the datum they show watson hold a day planner they find that at the crime scene yeah that her wallet and all of her jewelry include a 3 carat diamond ring so we know he be not financially motivated first count I have 22 22 we have 6 you think it could be that many we go back 10 year and include surround city the unsub may be out of his comfort zone now they may not all be connect but they all match michelle 's type Blond white eay 30 the autopsy report will help we determine which of these case be connect I will get they here right away we also need to take a look at the crime scene detective henderson of course I will stay and help reid I will take prentiss and morgan tell I do you think this be a one off or can I expect more film it be not a one off the filming of his kill make he a sexual psychopath we will find more many more just like this one help I be in direct cflict with the psychology of a psychopath and it be something I 've never see before psychopath do not have the capacity to feel empathy towards other they can mimic it but they can not feel it then he do not mean it or someone or something be show he who he really be ok friend the video on this film be analog it be since be digitize but it be seriously degraded Meaning what mean this kind of degradation only happen over at least a decade and thousand of repeat viewing be the only way he can get any release then you be right he be be do this for 10 year uh more like 20 that woman in this video she be wear a sweater I have not see since flashdance on the day of her death the 21st michelle enter the name robert at 4 p m ah we find no one connect to she with that name and we think it be an alias Michelle 's highly organized she be precise light of hand so leave hand how can you tell the hard point be where she start the light point be where she tail off in her case she tail off to the right it be weird what I be not sure but the number 29 be circle twice in red ink and it tail off to the left whoever write that be right handed that person be right handed and help I be write in red the unsub write the circled 29 guy Tomorrow 's the 29th Hotch be in position so let us walk through this ok prentiss michelle stand right here face I Ok Door 's still open she do not shut it and now she turn she back to it that be her first mistake ok she be on the phone with her husband 3 55 p m she tell he she have another client come here come the unsub but you do not turn around just keep talk now the unsub 's in the house yeah I hear he you hear he but you do not turn around not yet now you turn because if she leave the front door open and she turn she back she must have be expect robert it be an open house there be no one else here he know she would be alone she be stand face to face with the unsub talk to he and yet she still turn away second mistake he pose no threat yeah and if she would see a camera she would have register it now she turn face the unsub he strike right into her chest and then he drag she over here to the sofa and he film her death he choose a control environment in which he could ensure privacy no witness and most importantly he do not have to dump the body Garcia prentiss the point of view she do not see the camera because the glass have to be the camera Thanks garcia he leave we another message he circle the number 29 in michelle 's day planner so we 've only get 24 hour to stop he Thanks Morgan think the unsub 's glass be the camera you need to get a sketch of the unsub out to every camera shop in buffalo if he hunt within a comfort zone then whichever of these camera shop he visit the most that be the one he will live close to all right you hear the man ok hotch also want we to focus on victim find in control location secure area with little chance of witness and one where he leave the body where he kill they ok base on that june ' 98 emily flyn find in her apartment stab 23 time Hillary habner march 2000 find in her basement stab 18 time Cindy stagnal april 2001 stab multiple time find in her office and may 1999 vanessa bright 29 stab and find in her studio Ladies and gentleman it appear as ough we 've find our timeline it look like our killer strike almost exactly every 12 month oh my god all these woman and he get away with it I think we need to inform the medium Buffalo have a serial killer every so often he be stop and look down at the ground at what I do not know but it be clear he be try to step around some type of object there be not any object well at least not the we can see but remember in the film he cut the sandwich and turn it twice and the 29th be circle twice in red so this be not a message this be something he have to do it be the crack in the pavement that be what he be stop for he be step over they because he have to he be obsessive compulsive Meaning no matter how hard he try he simply can not stop himself well if he want to he could have turn himself in by write help I he really mean stop I go away go away go away Vincent it be alice I know you be in there ok just a moment how you do where have you be vincent be be week for a single guy you be so neat what be in there nothing how do you find I I drop you off after the conference remember be not you go to offer I a drink I be I be not thirsty I I mean you be weird but cute Alice you know it be it be not really ok it be not really ok that you just come by my home like this you should you should go no I come because there be a wedding tomorrow and they want you to film

like you and he may use hat or other mean to hide his appearance this man have a type he kill woman blond woman in their 30 and he kill they where they feel safe in their home in their workspace Vincent I have to change my glass there be no purse no jewelry nothing to I d she with Whereas with michelle he do not care what he leave behind he know we could not connect she to he why do he cover she up and fold her arm across her chest she can not be more than 24 that do not fit his victimology well the chest wound match that of michelle watson the way he be position she the blanket show remorse he probably know she more intimately than the other that be somewhat of a leap not when you consider this be the first time he dump the body unlike the other he bring her body here and dump it yeah someone will be miss she soon Today 's the 29th he probably kill her last night whatever his plan be he still have they we be ready to give the profile we 've confirm 11 kill over a 10 year period this make 12 all but one blond white female mid to late 30 be careful time I Stanley be careful this unsub have extreme obsessive compulsive disorder this woman do not fit his victimology he probably do not target or even mean to kill her 5 camera shop in buffalo be show this sketch the owner of tarquinio 's camera shop on union road recognize it he know he only as vincent he buy two 3 millimeter mini wireless camera and have they retrofit to his glass he be well versed in camera technology he probably generate income from a related field so stake out the shop but keep a low profile he walk in off the street he politely wait his turn he pay in cash this be he black overcoat black baseball cap you will get more from your sketch now this last kill show the most remorse this guy 's mobile most likely in a suv Low profile mute in color he be begin to devolve his ocd will get bad and he will have a hard time hide it he will take big and big risk to achieve his ultimate goal in michelle 's watson 's day planner he circle the number 29 today be the 29th so we believe he may have something plan for today do not go anywhere I will be right back he send we this film as his way of reach out he may be ambivalent but his ocd will not let he stop now if he see a heavy police presence and he be not do he will run the east side be his comfort zone this be where he live however random anything out of the ordinary please let we know thank you very much tell I again what the autopsy report say he seem to be kill once a year and they be all except for michelle watson overkill he stab she just once and hers be the only kill he send footage of to the police that be a definitive change you be right call reid and prentiss tell they to go over the autopsy report again we need to know why he sure do like his blonde not a good date though too stabby less so though with michelle watson and the girl we find this morning every one of these murder happen during a month of spring

neither have the police in bend oregon which be why they need our help two victim in the last 12 day first be hit while on a morning jog maria delgado 23 the second be a strand motorist shannon makely 43 and what make the local think that they be connect well for one thing they be both back over after the initial impact no accident there they match tread at both scene large wheel all terrain wound also indicate a raise bumper so they be think large suv or truck do they know the model or make uh tire be not factory iue they could be on a number of different model no witness to either incident a hit and run be loud draw attention somebody usually see something both victim be attack in secluded area 2 ton of metal make a hell of a weapon Serial killer have be know to become rather attached to their vehicle Bittaker and norris even have theirs a nickname Murder mac Bittaker and norris be sexual sadist there be no sign of torture here it sound like thrill kill opportunistic easy target randomly select with this type of impact the vehicle should not be hard to pick out of a lineup yeah there should be significant front end damage somehow I do not think it be go to be that easy http

civilization Booth tarkington well I think it be safe to assume our unsub be male I agree with you give what we know about aggressive driving and road rage and the fact that man ha an unnatural bond with their car that be true wait a minute I do not know about unnatural I once date a guy who wash his car more than he wash his hair a nice car need love and a woman do not I be not qualified to answer that I be just say big car it be phallic so he be compensate or overcompensate impotent possibly if the unsub see himself as physically defective the car not only give he the power and control he otherwise lack but it also serve as a shield a way to avoid physical contact Power and control female victim that almost read like a rape profile vehicular rape rape and thrill kill be two very different profile what do the victimology tell we nothing yet Shannon makely be a white marry 43 year old commitie trader Maria delgado be a 23 year old hispanic grad student competitive tri athlete so far gender 's our only link hopefully the crime scene will tell we more a6 she live a little outside of town be on her way home from work when she break down so she break down way back there and she get out and start walk why not call for help no service he make a complete stop here then hit the gas full stop in the middle of the road take it there be not a lot of traffic out here not on this stretch not at that time of day at least do work by 3 00 in the afternoon Broker Specialized in foreign market Time difference make for some odd hour what be you think about rossi what be the odd she break down right here no phone no traffic no witness nowhere to run Perfect place for an ambush not a very popular jog area be not too many people who can take that hill come up here well she be a tri athlete we figure she jog in off the main road head for the trail up here Assailant drive in behind she and run she down right here a woman jog alone no she would have know if someone be tail she so maybe he be already here what be the story with all this equipment construction stall out month ago no reason for anyone to be up here nice and private it be the ideal spot to run somebody down without be see a little convenient too convenient what if it be she what if she be the reason he be up here you do not think this be a random attack oil he be lie in wait he may have specifically target these woman that take thrill kill off the table because the murder be plan in advance yeah this type of stalk behavior indicate a personal motive a6 Bend there be a reason he choose these victim so you think he know they well he know their work schedule jog route drive pattern that would explain how he know where to strike it explain the delgado girl she be on a run but he could not have know shannon makely 's car be go to break down out there do you look at her car guy at impound say the water pump blow they say it be a common enough problem maybe we should take a close look why do not you head over there let I know what you find out Shannon makely 's husband be here I just want it to make sense but this I we may be able to ma some sense out of it with your help do you recognize that woman no should I she be the first victim we be try to determine if she be connect to your wife in some way connect we believe he may have be follow they gather some sort of information do shannon ever mention notice anyone no do you ever notice anyone out of the ordinary in your neighborhood maybe someone who be walk or drive by the house repeatedly no what about a truck or a large suv Thursday I be expect a package I keep check the street there be a truck park a couple of house down I do not recognize it could you see anyone inside I could not tell the window be black out tint yeah only all the way around like you see with limousine do you think that you would recognize the truck if you see it again maybe a6 FBI how be it come gil it be come these roof section be brutal yeah maybe you want to take an early day do not I wish look I can smell the booze man I can tell bert you go home sick but I can handle it you be slide man mistake miss deadline be everything ok we figure it be the water pump because it be pretty much melt but we do not figure on this Car 's pretty new that would not be normal wear and tear would it no rest of the line 's in good condition someone puncture it you can tell from the smooth edge how do they do it probably reach a blade right through the grille Penknife something like that they would not have even have to pop the hood and if she drive away without water in the radiator it explain the overheat it explain the pump too could somebody possibly gauge how far she could have travel with the car in this condition someone who know car could make an educate guess sure thank you appreciate it Sabotage he be more focused than we think well organize highly motivated by what though what do these woman have in common different age appearance social class he be not hunt a specific type their only connection be the unsub there have to have be contact before the attack but we profile a guy who be afraid of contact the truck be a shield maybe the contact 's incidental there be something he perceive in their exchange something about his perception trigger his fixation could be the way she look at he something she say or even something as trivial as what she be wear whatever it be the victim have no idea what they set in motion these be all ford model the grille be kind of like you describe yeah I guess it do not have that emblem though and no hood ornament nothing like that I understand this be hard but this really will help we I will keep look how be it go well we be down to an old model black american make sound like he debadge the truck so nobody could I d he I can start a list from dmv match what we 've get a list like that be go to kill a lot of tree he be right the truck 's only go to get we so far what we need to do be build on the profile well he be mechanically inclined he certainly know his away around an engine block and he can pull a dent too if he be fix the body damage to his truck both victim be kill during pri office hour it mean he have a flexible work schedule or he might not be work at all stalk someone get to know their schedule it be a pretty serious time commitment 8 of the state 's out of work and job loss be a classic stressor it be a start look for man who be employ as mechanic body shop and look for those with criminal record reckless driving and assault two murder in two week it be not much of a cool off period he be not go to wait for another opportunity to present itself now he will create one Son of a great help I hold the elevator hold it Impact nearly cut he in two his name be victor costella podiatrist he work in the building male victim so much for the vehicular rape theory he run down from the level above to try to get away initial collision be up there let us see it this be the victim 's car yeah why uh excuse I for a second Garcia I need you to look into something it be a reserve spot Unsub know where he be go to park must have get here early and pick this spot right across somebody might have see he wait somebody do talk to an x ray tech on the third floor notice a truck when she arrive and he be inside it yeah but she could not see he because of the tint so how do she know he be inside the truck she say the window be crack Occupant be smoke I do not suppose your people find any cigarette butts what time do the uh tech get in 10 a m 7 hour proper addict could kill a whole pack do you ever smoke I use to do a lot of thing bet you never do this he field strip it what be that something they teach soldier to avoid leang trace in the field they squeeze out the filter then ball up the surround paper ok so our guy could be ex military we can get dna on this maybe we will get lucky he be in the system if he be military why would he choose a truck as his weapon maybe he drive a tank that be a good questi use a vehicle on the open road be one thing but this be close quarter yeah a truck be loud it draw attention plus he risk render it inoperable do not make any sense it do to he he need to kill this way I just do not know why guy I think I know what connect the victim all of the victim drive red 2 door coupe do not you think that could be a coincidence it be statistically significant we have not be able to find any other common denominator if the unsub be target people because of their car then his initial contact with they would have be on the road exactly I speak to the family about the victim ' daily car travel how they get to work the gym there be one road all the victim have in common Route 7 that mean something to you maybe we should take a drive anyone live outside bend who commute toward eugene use route 7 it be the most dangerous stretch of highway in the state they call it suicide 7 these crosse represent accident fatality the fire chief put they up to remind driver to be careful 2 lane no divider I be assume there be a lot of head on collision either that or they go off the side Reid you mention the possibility of a physical limitation something that keep the unsub from attack in the traditional way yeah I be think about impotence but we 've rule out sexual motivation what if he have be involve in a crash on this road if the unsub be disabled it explain why he use a truck it give he power mobility but what the idea that he be avenge his own physical suffering speak to a victim mentality that be inconsient with the profile maybe it be not just about his own suffering wake up honey help I as we speak this profile and a description of the unsub 's truck be be release to state and national medium in addition to what we already know we believe the unsub be ex military most likely army or marine we also believe he be physically handicapped from combat from an automobile accident an accident that may have occur along route 7 where the unsub find his victim and that have something to do with why he be go after red coupe we believe that he hold the driver of a comparable vehicle responsible for his accident and this person be the object of his rage but unable to confront they he be take revenge against a surrogate these box contain accident report from a strip of route 7 between bend and eugene there be about 5 year ' worth we be go to need everyone you can spare to comb through they we 've also compile a list of local rehabilitation facility where the unsub may have go to recover use the profile as you canvass these place remember we be look for a white male in his early 40 former military who may have sustain serious injury in a car accident though only owner of red coupe have be target at this point we be ask all the drive public to be vigilant on the road and if you know anyone who fit this description please contact the bend police department immediately thank you Gil I could use some help in here I 've get bare foot here could you maybe sweep up the glass I think I have to go what I be sorry where be you go Damn it Gil wait what be happen to you how be dave do a few more possible I will take they Hotch just get a walk in his name 's gil bonner what be his story it be about the unsub 's accident he say it be his fault it be late and I would spend all day in eugene with my mom she would be sick I should not have be drive but I just want to get home to see my little girl it be dark than usual I remember the moon be just a sliver right outside the cascade my phone start vibrate and when I go to reach for it I knock it off the far side of the seat and it fall down by the door and I think I could reach and you take your eye off the road if could not have be for more than a few second but when I look back up there be light and this horn be blare and I swerve at the last second and then iust keep on go without a scratch you would go into the oncoming lane what happen to the other vehicle well that be the thing it be in rearview mirror and then it be go it vanish why do not you stop it do not seem real you be say you just pretend it do not happen I guess if you tell yourself something for long enough you can make anything true well you be here now tell we about thother vehicle it be the truck you be look for how do you know that when I see the news it all make sense it be come back for revenge when do the accident occur December ' 07 the second saturday there be no accident report in december of 2007 no that be no maybe you have your date wrong it could have be november uh memory be kind of like puzzle piece and it be it be quite possible that in suppress these for so long you 've sort of rearrange thing how long be your mother sick 5 month she she die in january that much I know he be ex military good with his hand repair ok thank a6 look even with that description you be talk about 5 year ' worth of patient what if we could narrow it down to a 5 month window between september ' 07 and january ' 08 what be this person do exactly exactly 3 murder and he be not go to stop there murder you do realize the condition of our patient a paraplegic can drive with the right rigging be this about those hit and run there be something you should see he uh he leave we about 4 month ago do not make the kind of progress that we would hope for get himself back in shape no physically he he make great stride it be emotional issue Anger issue do he ever talk about get even you can look for yourself Ian coakley we have the patient write and draw daily small task to help strengthen their hand Ian spend most of his time on those you have to know this guy be disturb it be part of

coakley suffer memory loss after the accident short term retrograde amnesia be common after a serious accident I think it be safe to say he remember now do we have an address yeah garcia 's work on that now ok the house coakley and his wife buy be foreclose on 10 month after his accident well there be get to be a paper trail then yeah and that trail lead to a land call nowhere cash some

what if it be more than that so if it be a single car accident it be coakley 's fault he be drive back from napa valley that night that be a long drive fall asleep at the wheel would not be the first

airport mall train there be a medium blackout we be not tell the public we would have a mass exodus the psychology of group panic would cause more death than this last attack yeah and if it do get outah and if it do get out oevewhdiis if there be another attack E be no way we will be able to keep it quiet our good chance of protect the public be by build a profile as quickly as we can what do we know about this strain the spore be weaponized reduce to a respiral ideal that attack deep in the lung Odorless and invisible a sophisticated strain only a scientist would know how to do that these lesion be double in size in a matter of hour it be not the lesion I be worried about it be the lung we do not know how to combat the toxin once they be inside and the reality be we may lose they all the remaing survivor have be move to a special wing at walter reed hospital our office will become a small command center we will be work with military scientist from fort detrick General whitworth be

the bad part be not know when it be go to be over feel safe opening mail again 5 people die many more exposed and sicken include a baby who be admit to the hospital after lesion appear on his skin how do he contract it I have no idea must have come into close contact with a tainted letter or cross path with the unsub himself how old be the baby 7 month do he survive I get to run Kimura 's waiting I will call you from the hospital Spence do the baby survive yeah but I mean that be a curable strain this thing be entirely different Agent jareau uh call I when he get through security thank the general 's here be there bad blood with he he be very critical of the way the ' 01 amerithrax investigation be handle because of what happen with dr Hatfill among other thing and this be the list of victim you ask for no high Profile job no just ordinary people frolic in the park Rossi any word from the cia they say there be a few overseas terrorist group with funding and capability they be work international we 've get domestic we need to look at anyone who could profit from this People who have patent on anthrax vaccine yes sir Garcia and add to your list anyone with access to weaponize spore Universities scholar work in bioweapon research employee of lab who keep germ collection be back in a few right in here sir thank you agent jareau General Agent hotchner this be ssa david rossi my scientist be decode the strain the additive use to strengthen the bacterial capsule do not exist at our research lab be there any other lab use these substance no I would like a list of all the scientist in your anthrax program I just say we do not use those additive Sir we can rule out your lab sample but not your people Rossi we be look at someone who have the ability to manipulate and weaponize anthrax your scientist make that cut now we all know what happen the last time your team look into my people Sir our team officially rule out dr Hatfill I be sorry if justice do not listen to we but the profile be accurate well I be outrank by someone who believe in your profile I will get you your list Lieutenant hi abby you feel any well ok this be agent reid from the fbi if you can will you talk with he Abby I would like to try to do a memory recall exercise with you to take you back to the park if that be ok yesterday afternoon you ride your bicycle to the park how do the sun

symptom shortly before they die none of the drug combination be work the only thing that be help they right now be the morphine what be you tell people about why the park be close Methane buildup in the sewage system and they believe it oh well yeah of course why would not they hot zone and all surround area have be neutralize you be safe here Huh be you sure yes ma'am thank you ok check it out high level test over there that be probably where the unsub release the attack and there be a prevail wind out of the northeast yesterday Airborne spore scatter that way hit everyone below it this park do not scream target to I Terrorists usually taworld trade center I mean it be a nice park but it be not a symbol ok so maybe it be symbolic for the unsub well we know kaczynski send bomb to berkeley where he teach Michigan where he go to school and chicago where he live and the amerithrax suspect send letter to 2 pro choice senator whose politic he oppose they can not help attach a personal motive to the place they 've target ok so what do this place mean to our unsub Flatline tone 38 Year Old high school history teacher leave 2 kid behind 17 out of 25 dead this strain be duplicate every 30 to 45 minute it be poison the lung cause massive hemorrhaging and organ failure Extreme bacterial amplification whoever create this have to at some point go to the trouble of test it what do you mean think about the way scientist work their way up to human testing they start with rodent then advance to large mammal and then at some point they do a very small trial run with people there be no way this be his first human test run we would have hear about a previous anthrax attack not if it present itself as something else the general 's briefing a congressional committee and the director 's meeting with the president in an hour and want our input I do not know how to do this I can not stop think about henry he go for a walk almost every single day at potomac park what type of mother be I if I do not at least call and tell he to stay at home Jj we can not I know but how do I not I understand that you want to protect your son but if we all call home and use this information to give we an advantage that other people do not have be that the right thing to do we need to call reid he say this may not be the first attack Line ring hello uh reid you have I rossi and hotch Kimura make some call it turn out that 2 day ago 2 people in 2 separate baltimore e R S and one person in a philadelphia e r slip into coma and die suddenly now the c o d on all of they be meningitis doctor do not test for anthrax because the illness present themselves as meningitis but I think it can be cause by anthrax do they show symptom that we be see now the lesion they would not have if the bodily function expire as quick do how quickly all dead within 3 hour of be admit but the first patient die yesterday at 10 hour here be the thing if ter concentration of the strain it would cause a quick death Organ failure without exterior physical symptom what be their name Gale mercer 31 martha finestein 48 Albert frank 52 what next see if they visit the same place on may 8th Gale mercer make a credit card purchase at the book front own by albert frank we need to find general whitworth he need to send a team out there Mm hmm beep all right jj I get it thank look at all

before close well that explain why only 3 people be hit we test hot I will alert command this be his test run he be get to have a history with the place we need to get a list of current and past employee customer with grievance against the owner see if any one of they have a science background can you believe there be only a quarter Inch Thick Pane of glass between all of we and a wmd Attack anthrax be not make to kill 3 people inside a bookstore it want to be right out here in the open where it can feed and multiply just a small amount could wipe out everyone here and they would never see it come it feel like the plague of egypt 10 scourge create by god Plague 6 be unhealable boil believe by biblical scholar to be cause by anthrax never miss sunday school do you actually never be before how be she do she be a fighter she be hold on this long because she be young and strong but she be start to bleed into her lung one of 4 leave we be run into another problem when the next of kin have question what do we tell they about cause of death yes sir we will do what we can in the time we 've get thank you there be problem contain the story what happen I do not know but the president may have to make an announcement tonight what do you hear from the bookstore Ran name of former employee customer with grievance no one with the science background we be look for Garcia 's still dig do we have everyone we need for the profile oh yeah entire defense community be here never see so many alpha male in one room let us get start Hotch because the location hit be not symbolically significant we believe that these attack be personal Prentiss understand the significance of these location will be the key to identify he this personal element strongly indicate a home grow terrorist Morgan like the amerithrax case we believe this be someone from the science or defense community that be why you be here we think you may know he he may be one of we these home grow terrorist be myopic zealot ideologue that believe that their work be of the great importance he may have preach about the threat of an attack on america his coworker would describe he as histrionic Paranoid Secretive all due respect that be a little vague what be we suppose to do with something that generic Sir we be not finish yet he may have log excess hour at work in the past week prepare for the attack we believe he be take the full dosage of anthrax vaccine over the recommend 18 Month schedule and have yearly booster Morgan this guy have his on work space where he make his product in privacy he also have access to large expensive Industrial Grade equipment at work Rossi he be write about the threat of anthrax attack publish paper yet he feel no one be listen and that anger he Morgan now he may have recently experience some sort of professional humiliation like be demote or fire now that would have be his trigger the moment he decide to go rogue and he may have betray his love one to his cause he may be recently separate or divorce this be somebody who know every detail of the 2001 anthrax attack and have talk about what that suspect do right or wrong he be watch the news very closely to see how the country react please share this with your department thank you overlap chatter there be something I think you should see January ' 02 classified hearing with the subcommittee on defense and homeland security Dr Lawrence nichols he use to work at the institute he leave in ' 02 he do not leave he be force out 5 people die if you ask I we be lucky it be just 5 we be lucky that whoever send these letter use cheap porous envelope a not a crop duster America 's enemy be capable of wipe out entire city and we be woefully unprepared I be look at your proposal yes sir every household need gas mask and a 2 month supply of cipro for each resident every major city need hospital with bio Safety decontamination capability regard the budget you propose for this operation anything short of 50 billion would be grossly negligent Dr Nichols you 've get to realize how unrealistic that be unrealistic we can not justify spend that kind of money on an attack that may not happen you people be in denial Senator do this would incite fear and panic among the public this country should be panic we should live in utter fear of be attack Dr Nichols please sit down I will not sit down we live in a time of war and wmd proliferation if you continue to be blind to our lack of preparedness then americans will die and I will have no problem in point the blame at you Committee say he be become unstable fanatical which be why they remove he from fort detrick and railroad from other prominent position Dr Nichols be well respected in our community he believe in preparedness not proliferation well he obviously feel like people be not listen maybe he be just try to prove a point he have access lose a prominent job got divorce fit your profile we need to bring he in he work for a company call bio design technology we subcontract they they do not work with anthrax they deal primarily with the flu Dave you and prentiss go to his office Morgan pull reid from the hospital and go to his home we need to speak with dr Lawrence nichols urgently well he be not in today we need to see his lab follow I Clear so far Morgan all right keep I post this guy just have

secure a gray zone outside that door clean he up and get he in the ambulance fast I should have be right there with he Morgan there be no time for second Guessing what do we know Nichols be dead Blunt force trauma to his head Reid think he be be dead 2 or 3 day Whitworth well then he could not have be responsible for the attack Reid too cipro today so he be get to be ok right I do not know it be precautionary it be not help patient at the hospital yeah but the do not take it until after they be expose Reid take it before yeah but we 've never test this strain cell phone ring on a cipro ready subject we just do not know Reid Hotch I really mess up this time Reid we need to get you out and to the hospital no I be stay right here no you be not reid I be already expose it be not go to do I any good to stop work the case he be already infect now if nichols create the strain he may have also create the cure my good chance be to stay here see if there be a cure try to figure out who kill dr Nichols Come on hotch say something to he he be right his good chance be inside we be go to get a suit and mask into you right away do not bother it be not go to do I any good I be already infect

how to do this if you could do anything to keep your family safe even if it mean break procedure would you yes what procedure never mind Reid what do you see in there I see cage fill with dead animal I see sign of a struggle probably before dr Nichols be murder Equipment 's miss there be a large desk Clutter all over the surface but in the corner there be a small desk two different work space two set of handwriting I be look at instruction on how to boil lab Grade broth sterilize lab equipment and transfer spore Nichols would know all that he have a partner maybe even a protege go back to the b A u try to figure out who this partner be Hotch why do not you go I will stay with reid funnel all the information you get to I Hotch say nichols may have have a protege who turn on he I think we should tell the supervisor that this be about anthrax that be not our call to make Screw protocol Reid 's in trouble if we tell this guy the truth he might be able to help we look I want to help reid too but our job be to do the good we can within our boundary who be dr Nichols close to here oh no one really he work on his project alone be he ok do he mentor anyone not that I know of do he ever work on anything other than the flu here no why do he ever have sample of anything he should not have have look I really need to know what this be about before I answer any more question we will get back to you Ring Jj on voicemail hi we be not home right now please leave a message Beep uh hey it be it be I just call to see where you be um give I a call ok love you telephone ring hey reid Gee wow

any pain I could give you something no I I would rather not take any pain medication we can at least make you feel more comfortable I be comfortable and I do not want to take any narcotic ok tell I how I can help I think the cure for this strain be in here somewhere well shall I start here Dr Nichols be a former military scientist which mean he be most likely secretive and most likely a little paranoid he would have protect the cure and probably would have hide it from his partner so look for something innocuous something you would not suspect all right cell phone ring Coughs hello how be it go in there kid I 've see well day well you get I and garcia hey reid cough Morgan reid stick with I listen prentiss and rossi do not think the partner be a coworker can you tell we anything else about he I I 've already be through everything come on now kid I know you be not think straight but the reid I know would not stop look all right all right clear throat I see a uh a frame photograph of dr Nichols teaching I see a I see a binder with syllabi course assignment go all the way back to the 1970 all right so he keep a scrapbook of himself as a professor that tell we that he value himself as an educator a teacher I see something early I do not I do not make a connection to it or to the partner but he have a study on anthrax he have an annotated bibliography table of content it be format like a thesis and have write in the margin in red ink like the way a teacher grade a paper now nichols would not have let just anyone in here but he may have open his lab for educational purpose as a teacher so the partner must have appeal to he as a student Nichols be help he with his thesis I I can look up local ph D Students Morgan yeah check the science Biochemistry microbiology uh Cross Checking with name of former employee or customer with grievance at the bookstore beep nothing my dove Reid cough listen to this this country be woefully unprepared every household should

member and check record for multiple border crosse see if we get any hit for the day the victim go miss got it you believe that he kill all these people fit the profile how so he get a recent physical trauma could be a stressor wide disparity of victim no body possible border cross two entirely different terrain to pull that off you would have to be smart you would have to be organize mobile physical military background give you all that exactly it appear as though he cluster his victim into man then woman and then back to man again what do that tell you at the moment nothing have he contact family refuse a lawyer too he be in interrogation wait for we this guy 's U S army he demand to talk to the FBI he be not go to want to talk to anyone but the person he think be in charge of

person who be isolate themselves from thether People on the street do not usually care about safety in number unless something scare they into change their behavior look at this Drug deal be out in the open Prostitutes seem to be work inroup I mean if this guy do kill 10 people I do not see how he could have do it without witness so how do you want to work this I think we start with the most recent victim first see if we even have a crime here why do not you start with the junkie and I will take the work girl keep dream Ladies you see these two guy anybody look like that what be up my man you see a brother look like that no my man you mind if I ask you a few question depend what you be ask you know he that be charle do not know his last name you ever see he get into any kind of beef with anyone Charles be a junkie Junkies want peace you just say he be a junkie u knowomething I do not just that he be go 2 day now be that weird for he to disappear for 2 day like that a lot of people have be disappear these day and when they do they do not come back that be get to happen out here all the time no not like this man one day a girl 's on the street the next she be go we 've be

why should I here we go what do you mean an interrogation do not really start until you get the first lie see that be just the thing william we talk to the people on the street you be out there every night you take their photograph you check off their name in a notebook so your behavior be more like a protector like someone in the army do a bed check you 've go to a lot of trouble to confess to a crime you do not commit the folk on the street do they tell you people be miss if my team be here then there be case we be not work on you be waste our time 10 people dead huh it be not enough for you I 've watch the tape of you at the border cross over and over again you wait until every guard be out of the booth before you drive into it if you want to kill people you have your chance be you investigate these murder or not so that be what this be all about make sure we investigate if you think people be be kill you should have go to the police in detroit I do 3 time they tell I the kind of people I be look for disappear they say that be the way life on the street work do you believe the people I show you be miss I believe it be possible do not give I a political answer tell I what happen the night before the border cross I do a head count every night for the last month like we do in baghdad that night I see a boy name charle be not where he usually camp down so I make another pass he do not turn up by the morning I know he be go William People do not do what you do out of honor they do it out of love who be you look for on the street every night I get home from iraq first thing my mother tell I be that my baby sister lee be on the street she ask I to find she but you could not I manage once bring her home we get her feed she even wear my dog tag for good luck two week later she slip back onto the street that be it William you 've get so much information about the other potential victim why not lee I hiit in a spare tire in my car I need to wait until I be sure that you be on board William be you there something bad be happen it be dark I do not know where he be take I after that the signal cut out this be the same night she leave her mom 's house Hightower call in an army favor they triangulate the call to a cell tower in canada just over the border in port huron it explain why he cross into your jurisdiction it be also a surefire way to get the FBI iolve he know we would investigate an american citizen be hold on multiple murder charge and you believe he I do go ahead garcia Good news and bad news I 've get I D s on multiple border crosse for the date in question trouble be I 've get hundred and as far as I can tell if your license do not ping for any prior felony you be pretty much go to pass go and collect 200 canadian dollar she be right Busiest cross in north america Lot of commercial traffic truck mostly stop and search would cause too many delay so he be get virtually free passage and once he cross there be nothing but wood to hide whatever he be do Canada o I do not understand why we need to talk in private we want you to release william hightower into our custody I can not do that he be document a potential victim pool in detroit he be our good eye on the street he try to murder 5 border agent you can not personalize this jeff be not that what you be do to I trading on our relationship to get I to release a prisoner I respect what you 've teach I but when you leave I still have to be able to look my man in the eye then do whatever you can to catch the unsub it be not that simple you get pressure from above they be not go to let I turn william hightower into a hero this unsub kill in 2 and 3 day cycle which mean he be about to go back out there hunt release he into FBI custody while he be in detroit when the case be close he will be back under your jurisdiction your shop your call well they can fire I if they want hey uh they say you get use to it right now it just hurt like hell we would like you with we in the cass corridor do what the same thing you 've be do we will conduct nightly check you have a rapport out there if something be happen we will react more quickly and we will have more manpower be the detroit police department on board we be talk to they now about it William hightower yeah I remember he he be sincere I feel for he but you do not look into it family do not want to see what we do they would rather believe someone be dead than admit she be off turn trick in chicago or toronto we believe william hightower might be right you might have a serial killer we would like you to open up your record let our analyst take a look at report from the past few month and see if there be be a change in the crime patter disturbance or assault that may be connect I can do that we would also like to give your colleague the working profile once we have it to see if anything spark Fair enough so how do he convince the FBI to look into this he drive his car into the guard post at the port huron border and then confess to murder 10 people seriously yes how many victim do he say potentially 11 include his sister yes ma'am right now we just consider they miss the second I get more information I will be in contact with you ok how be it go the majority of the people on the street be not even from detroit we do not have last name on most of they no hometown unless there be a miss person report on file somewhere it be almost impossible Most of these people 's family probably give up on see they long ago a mother would never give up can you hand I william hightower 's arrest report yeah garcia Sherlock it be watson I think I 've get something what do you have I check detroit crime report over the last month because derek and emily astutely think there might be some sort of assault or disturbance have to do with our unsub and well it be tre weird but on 5 of the abduction night detroit p d report a break in or a robbery at some type of medical facility what type of medical facility we get a hospital blood bank medical supply company the red cross what be he do steal narcotic that be just it he be not some drugstore cowboy the stuff he take be like anesthesia and sterilize equipment and syringe Negative on the narcota Garcia where be these place locate Putnam street st Antoine east hancock martin luther king boulevard those be all in the cass corridor do you have a list of what else he steal uh I v tubing infusion pump unit of o negative blood chest tube o silk suture elastoplast Garcia thank a lot you do not just randomly know how toook a line up to an infusion pump or that o neg be the only safe blood type for any victim I will tell hotch we think we know what he be do with they we believe the man we be look for be a sexual sadist what this mean be that for he the torture become a substitute for the sex act the fact that he be steal medical equipment like sterilize agent and anesthesia tell we he may be perform experiment or surgery on his victim we believe this unsub get gratification from his ability to keep his victim alive in order to endure more torture the choice of item steal be extremely specific which make we believe he be get a medical background check disciplinary file at hospital med school and community health organization People would have notice his behavior this be someone who would volunteer to perform painful procedure and he would spend extra time probe say a broken hand or a distended abdomen and after a long day when everyone else be emotionally drain from multiple trauma and mangle body he would be the one push his coworker to go out for a drink and talk about their day now we know what you be think a profile be fine but yes our good shot at stop this guy be still to catch he in the act this unsub be extremely smart and obviously organize he be manage to abduct very different victim with very different ability all with no witness now we be coordinate with the police and our agent on the ground in detroit we 've also ask sergeant hightower to act as a guide on the street in detroit while he be in our custody that be it any question you find I or one of the agent what be she do here well we 've notify all the family member we can locate you have no right it be her daughter no it be one thing to to believe lee be lose on the street I do not want she to know that there be a killer out there we know how this be go to end no we do not look everything I have do be to find the truth so I can spare she I do not want she live off hope there be bad thing you be wrong Bad news stop we for a while but then you move on Hope be paralyze you do a stupid thing yes ma'am come here all these people be miss we believe so you have any suspect no but we have a strategy to try to catch he and william be help my daughter there be a chance she she might still be alive it be possible do you know what he be do to they it be difficult to say thank for believe I William I want you to understand that even if we catch he you be probably go to end up do some time in canada I can live with that Detective tay benning this be ssa aaron hotchner how do you do this be william hightower he be go to help we on the ground these be agent prentiss and morgan detective benning we 've meet I be sorry I do not look into your sister 's disappearance we should split up and cover male and female potential victim ok we will take the man I will make the introduction for you stay close to your phone if anyone be out of place Detective benning can get a name and a description to our patrol car as quickly as possible you really believe he be aboutto abduct someone again it be come soon tonight tomorrow we know he stick to a tight cycle the question be why alternate victim in cluster of man and woman why take the man at all what do you mean we say he see these people as disposable it do not matter if they be male or female for a sexual sadist male or female be not important the torture itself be the sex but would not it be much easy to approach a prostitute she be right a prostitute will get into a car with an unsub it be a victim he can isolate easily with no witness be hightower 's mother still here she be rest in my office Jj see if she be willing to talk to we I want to know everything I can about her daughter in the meantime we need to figure out how he be separate his male victim from the pack and hope that hightower give we an edge on the street this group go to stay close to cass avenue they be usually on the corner they do not stray it be like I say the first time I be out here it be not easy for someone to be isolate everything be out in the open ok that be walter patterson he help show I the lay of theand Yo walter this be detective benning and agent morgan they need your smart you know he lose his baby sister right yes we do spread the wd they be not here to hassle anyone be safe so what do you want to know what would make you separate from everyone else out here

recent case first something set this guy off and odd be it be in your file bell ring I need to notify all the parent we think that be a mistake I be in charge of keep these kid safe exactly and there be a natural end to this day when bus and parent come to pick these kid up whoever be do this be not an effectual shooter his killing be sloppy so if there be a panic a lot of people could be catch in the crossfire can not you just take jeffrey home if we do that and the unsub be watch someone else be go to be kill then what we lock up every filter point except the front door nobody come in we say it be school policy no question and if someone need to see a student we bring the kid to they I will need a complete list and employment record of everyone already inside the building I will brief your security guard and take care of all of the exit after that I need you to gather the faculty into small group and bring they to I treat it as routine and in the meantime I need you to get jeffrey out of class as casually as possible can you do that Jeffrey barton can I see you for a moment student murmur hey jeffrey my name 's derek morgan I be with the fbi I see you in my living room listen the first thing I need to know be if you 've tell anyone about what be happen no student talk indistinctly back to class no loitering Jeffrey you be sure because even just one text message could set this place off I be sure all right that be good we be go to keep you safe kid but in order to do that you be go to have to stay calm and you be also go to have to trust I you understand every time you step out of class I will be right here now it be go to look like I be just another Adult in the hallway with principal findlay but I get your back be my dad ok he know you be just try to do the right thing he just want to get you home safe do you think somebody be try to kill I to get back at he it be possible do you know why that be what we need to figure out let us concentrate on the note for starter we know that he be male how can you be sure woman tend to add adjective and very specific detail to their note this have none of those male be also more direct first sentence I plan to kill your son and their note tend to be more about themselves than the person they be write to I watch you every day I will watch you lose everything we know he surveille you and your son which mean he either have enough money to be away from a regular job or he be currently unemployed he be most likely a father he be clearly grieve he be take great measure to make sure you feel his pain let us start with case involve teenager kill but also anyone with a strong family presence just because your son be 15 that do not necessarily mean that his child be the same age have you have a lot of case like this where someone taunt you with what they be go to do a few and how do they end please Suicide by cop seem to be an effective way for they to make their point while end their suffering all at once Jeffrey be leave school in 5 hour there be no way we can get through all these patient in this time well now we 've narrow it down already and we still have 100 leave I be sorry I do not mean to be callous but when you work in the e r you do not remember name you operate and you move on he be right there be too many file here for we to profile in such a short period of time um I can get to

promise fine there be a huge hole in the wall probably a 44 but there be no blood or tissue spray around it any idea how he get out if he be shoot there be no drag mark but a body could have be wrap

criterion um 82 all right now let I ask you this on how many of those date do you operate on somebody else as well 75 do any of those patient die on the table 10 um no wait 11 11 that be where we start this whole thing be about choice he be force you to play god with your son because the last time you have a choice your decision devastate he I be a doctor I save people it do not matter to he all that matter to he be that you have an alternative and you do not take it now how many of those surgery involve patient under 20 uh 6 we get a lot of shooting mostly gang relate have a gang member or family member ever threaten you no uh at first when you lose someone it be mostly confusion and devastation the anger come later all right we have 6 date where you operate on an hispanic male on

citizen and this also buy we a day to try and discover his identity so we will have school bus for evacuation Teachers can brief parent who be here to pick up their kid the key be to keep jeffrey

be onto he he be not the only one whoever he work for do too each mutilation represent the crime the unsub believe these 3 individual commit Unsubs unknown subject 2 both male unsub a we be call the planner he work in the criminal justice system we be look at both defense and prosecution attorney Judges and even cop we believe that the planner have experience a devastating personal tragedy of some sort and because of the sophisticated nature of the scenario we believe unsub a be in his late 50 or 60 the planner likely meet unsub b the enforcer within the court system he be be hire to carry out justice now this type of justice do not come cheap so the planner have access to substantial cash absolutely no attempt be make to hide the mutilation this suggest the planner either do not care what we find or he want we to find it now the enforcer on the other hand have no such intention he should be consider armed and extremely dangerous thank you all right let us go people all final payment have be make I see no reason not to complete the task or to converse further good one last request I would like you to pay special attention to mr patton I 've concentrate on the last 3 case they 've leave the fresh e print Great not really over 100 000 case pass through long island court who have eye on those file literally hundred and hundred of people change track focus on the enforcer mob relate murder trial on long island the last 10 year we be look for a hitman hey there be 93 mob trial in the last 10 year Put aside any trial that result in a conviction weed out mistrial and arraignment uh 19 be any of those on trial Suspected of be hitman or enforcer Reid 3 whoa whoa whoa this totally slip the net Tony mecacci his case be judge a mistrial but check out his suspect victim 22 caliber right Bull 's eye Cross match our profile of the planner against all those connect with this trial Let us see prosecute lawyer garrett daniels Judge boyd schuller criminal defense lawyer paul Wait wait do you say judge schuller yeah here be a photo what be wrong Prentiss do you know he no but I know his wife 2 year ago she be drive home from work and she be kill by a drunk driver that could be the tragedy she be the love of his life that be for sure 12 month ago judge schuller take a leave of absence due to health issue he be diagnose with terminal cancer he have 6 month to live and that be when the killing start you do not seriously think judge Judge schuller be the planner fit the profile yes I do and tony mecacci be most likely bosola the enforcer what have you get on bosola uh he go off the grid after his last trial Jj put out a statewide apb and release mecacci 's photo to the medium Judge schuller be a highly respected man we can not just walk in there and accuse he of serial murder then I will go to the attorney general and petition the chief justice if I have to and maybe not I believe you be look for I you know we have to advise you of your right I waive my constitutional right against self incrimination when you walk in here you say I believe you be look for I and I be right your timing be impeccable but how could you know that I know it would not take you long to find I not after what I 've leave behind so you do not deny any of this why would I what you see as a crime I see as justice Ray finnegan be a friend of mine Ray finnegan be a criminal you should choose your friend more wisely it must have really throw you when ray show up at emma 's funeral how do you know about my wife you have absolutely no idea who I be do you Ray tell rossi you only meet bosola once so judge schuller have to have give he a list of name he never need to see he again just make final payment on proof of death have garcia hack into schuller 's file and track his financial record before everything gets shut down and find out if his office make any call they do I speak to they a few hour ago I tell they we have two suspect so he know we be onto he he come here to stall he do have a list there be more to come could we just get on with what I come here for why so bosola can go on and carry on whatever it be you ask of he to do no you call he and you end this even if I could I would not she be bear emma louise taylor 4th of july 1958 you could get that from anywhere when she be 6 her dad john bring he a black and white homeless kitten if she know

Morgan so you do have a list I be finish talk oh oh we 've get gob of two way traffic go on which mean someone be try to bounce we out Ok bosola do not come cheap so judge schuller have to have make some pretty substantial transaction get wire transfer to a cayman island bank and that be where the trace end how many how much June he debit numeration of 9 999 every few day total of 4 he take a break for a few week until he make his final transaction for the same magic number anything less than 10 000 keep the irs off your trail I know that too so the final payment must be for proof of death that make 50 000 the price of a kill he do that 3 time over a period of 12 month but 2 day ago he raid his account for 100 000 all in one hit he also close all his account and hand his entire estate over to a victim support group someone who be not suffer from too many brainiac in the high tech kitchen just bounce we out good job if our calculation be correct there be 2 more name on that list there be every single person on that list deserve justice he say deserve not deserve now look right there he look at his watch for the second time whatever he be wait for be about to happen I do not think you know emma at all at least not the one I know I make an excuse for myself that I would not be welcome at her funeral but the truth be I could not face it you know emma change nothing oh but

home invasion where we head it be local southeast d c what be the cause of death Jj blunt force trauma no knife no gun have we be invite in yeah cop want we to meet they at the crime scene be not southeast where all that vandalism be be lately same area yeah think they could be connect I do not know I mean the weapon do not exactly fit the typical m o of a home invasion killer well it be worth consider it be common for vandalism to escalate into violence plus there be a lot of anger out there that neighborhood 's mostly black work class yeah now it be be gentrifie while the people who live there be have a tough time be the victim wealthy yeah it be two couple the be both part of the influx of new wealth in the area Police report a robbery nothing be take what race be the victim one couple be white the other black not racially motivate Jj find rossi and reid tell they we leave in 5 well if this be relate to vandalism 4 dead be a hell of an escalation so there be the potential for a lot more body out there that be what I be afraid of Sync by honeybunny www addic7ed com Morgan kingman brewster jr say there be no last hope in violence only temporary relief from hopelessness siren Detective andrew hi jennifer jareau these be agent rossi morgan Hotchner prentiss and dr reid thank for get here so fast what can you tell we look like one of the victim be attack when he get out of his car Meaning whoever do this probably use his key to get inside and surprise the other victim who find the body the clean woman she be give her statement now Dave would you morgan and prentiss go inside we will cover out here I know you be all use to this but uh it be a hell of a sight in there whoever do this ai not human the neighbor see anything oh you know the patrol car be even double in this area because of the vandalism nothing the unsub would have to be extremely fast and efficient look at this there be a pool of blood here and then drop as the victim move toward the door how big be the victim 6'1 6'2 why well if he be strong enough to move under his own power you would expect sign of a struggle and if not there would most likely be drag mark he be carry that be a lot of dead weight for one person to move alone there be no pool of blood on the porch which mean they do not have to set he down to open the door victim one gets drop here while number 2 come around the corner to see what be happen and the unsub attack he here the female victim be probably here when the first attack occur which mean somebody would have to control they pretty quickly how many unsub be you think at least one to move the body inside another one to take out man number 2 and one more to subdue the other well vandalism breed a pack mentality if it be the same unsub we be look at a group of 3 maybe 4 these be not kid they be too efficient there be a control and precision Juveniles be sloppy Prentiss he be right there be nothing tentative about these kill there be no experimentation these guy know what they be do I do not know what be you think I can understand vandalism escalate into violence but that be usually gradual and assault a single murder maybe but come on this this feels fully evolve September 3rd 15 luxury car have their window smash September 14th a new upscale clothing boutique be vandalize September 24th two different restaurant both cater to a wealthy clientele have their front window smash and their interior tear apart and finally october 1st a newly renovate townhome be ransack before the family could move in so they go from attack public property to a private residence but no victim the question be what make they move from that to this the vandalism target be all symbol of the neighborhood 's change makeup and economy maybe there be something specific about these victim that set the unsub off I 've speak to the victim ' family member they 've agree to come in and help however they can Garcia check social networking site see if these unsub have coordinate these attack online if they dare tweet I shall flush they out like a bird dog sir we need to be ask how these unsub Manage to not stand out in this neighborhood each of these crime scene location be a representation of new wealth and status but the area surround the crime scene be still populate by long time resident who be slowly be push out that be a lot of disenfranchised people who be all part of the neighborhood makeup most likely these unsub do not stand out because they be probably local themselves I do not know I be with rossi I mean anger I get but this much violence we be look at at least 3 man with an incredible amount of rage where do you hide that Turner you care to tell the lady why it be october 14th and she be still not ready to move into her house not particularly man what do you just say it be ok really no it be not why do not you apologize to the lady answer the question my apology ma'am find a slight flaw in the foundation hate to think of you home all alone at night suddenly the whole place just collapse underneath you ok now get back to the drywall that be what I pay you for let somebody else worry about the foundation I have garcia run record on anyone in the target area who in the last year be foreclose upon file for bankruptcy or apply for unemployment and then narrow that list down to man between the age of 25 and 45 and 713 hit victim ' family be here I be very sorry about your son we be look to see if there be a pattern or if your son 's killing be truly random so there be no threat that you know of no I understand this be very difficult for you we be just try to make some sense of it please Morgan ms barne do you need some more time um they say I could see wiiam 's body if I want to I do not see what good could come from that it be just you and your brother our parent die a few year ago I be sorry I know that sound like something people say but I truly be sorry you deal with case like this all the time yes I do so it be routine for you there be nothing routine about what you be go through ms barne do you have brother and sister I have two sister what would you do if something like this happen to one of they I would do everything in my power to catch the people who do it growl the dead weather 's treat I like your mother play laugh will be that you will check this out who have get it figure out hey leave right leave right whoa man who be get it figure out play straight tryin ' to manipulate our boy 's tryin ' to get up please do not hurt he that be pretty wicked yeah will oh oh song continue hey come look at this what do you just say what be his problem our boy 's tryin ' to get up please do not hurt he please I say we go out song continue woman cry why be you do this why why not Aah do you get that I get it heart beat rapidly whistle you think People might see so I go first this your car yeah it be nice look I be just pick up my girlfriend whistle what the hell man Shh do anybody see anything it be in the middle of the damn parking lot what about the security cam it be only on the door who be the lady over there Manager she discover the body when she come by to open up for the breakfast crowd I will go talk to her any idea who the victim be judge by the driver 's license one of they be a waitress here it say jessica miller and the other one 's probably doug taylor you can not tell for sure honestly you can not make an i d by look at they Hotch I do not even know what it be at first when I pull up they be definitely get bold these kill be in public if this be suppose to be about symbolism it be not anymore this be a blue collar restaurant the victim be a waitress there be no ideology behind this it be about violence and power they actually sit here and drank beer after the murder they be tell we that they do not care they be like those outlaw that ride into town and let you know the only way to stop they be by kill they if that be what they want I know plenty of cop who would be happy to oblige Detective we need to keep our head mean what mean that this level of nihilism this randomness it can have a mirror impact be you warn I not to go after some kind of revenge all I be say be this level of brutality be almost like a challenge from the unsub try to drag everyone down to their level and it be a natural reaction I be just do my job let us head back we 've get our profile elevator ding how bad bad bad you have company Ms barne hi sorry for just show up like this I hear on the news that there be more victim and I do not know where else to get answer please thank you so be it true be it the same people who kill william yes do you have any suspect no but we do have a profile of who these man might be two of our agent be give it to the police right now and we be get it to all the news outlet can you explain it to I please Basically these man be completely disenfranchised they feel like they have nothing to live for and they be look for anyone or anything to blame Hotch there be a lot of anger out there time be tough but even so these man will stand out they will look to provoke confrontation any excuse they will take it they do not steal from their victim they do not sexually assault the woman this be about violence for violence 's sake it be almost contagious it be twist but it be get its own momentum what we need to do be figure out how these man come together Rossi we feel certain that they have some connection to southeast d c Hotch they go unnoticed they do not seem out of place we have no print from the crime scene so we believe that the unsub wear glove Dna testing could take week and we do not have that kind of time the majority of the population of southeast be black but if the unsub work in this area they could be any race Hotch because of the physical nature of the murder and the amount of control these unsub exert over their victim we believe that these unsub be large or at least extremely physically fit and they have a pack mentality canvass the local bar and restaurant see if there be a group of man who fit this description and these man will be obsess with the medium coverage any chance to relive their crime so stake out the past crime scene there be a good chance that they will revisit they they most likely come from troubled background broken home youth detention center they probably bond over their anger and now it be like they 've become one person it be their whole identity see these guy they think of themselves as some type of gangster like society 's rule do not apply to they they equate violence with power and respect and that go for self respect as well what could they possibly get out of kill innocent people for no reason People like this they be not like you and I they do not feel empathy in a way they only feel alive when they be create fear and chaos and your profile they help catch these people they do thank you for help I through this of course Detective I just want to say that at the crime scene it be not my intention to accuse you of be unprofessional yeah it be just that I know what it be like to work a case that make you question humanity and it be not the bad thing to remind yourself to rise above it a little or we lose ourselves I appreciate you give the man the profile oh no Sir I 've get something I 've be monitor social networking site to see if the unsub communicate electronically right there be a text that be blow up I send it to your phone there be over a thousand hit already it be a plan to vandalize car and restaurant around dupont circle when do the text say this be suppose to happen tonight 9 00 Dupont circle be not in the unsub ' usual comfort zone and it be not like these unsub to share control dialing cell phone line ring Detective andrew this be agent hotchner I just send you a text to which we 've be alert right absolutely we be on our way siren man on p a you will be arrest if you do not disperse we get wagon at every entry point they be fill they up fast than I can bring they to hold what happen my man go to make arrest people start resist I call for reinforcement do you know who the instigator be there be no rhyme or reason I can tell confiscate the cell phone when we get to the origin of the text message you will have your ringleader they be still notify family and process most of the rioter do garcia come up with anything yeah she be able to isolate the first 2 cell phone in the chain Detective we do not think our unsub be in there but we would still like to interrogate the possible ringleader I do not think so but we need to eliminate they absolutely as suspect we can handle it on our own Rossi we be not say you can not be there a problem you guy have my man out there canvass bar look for adult when I could have be do gang sweep go through juvenile record that would have be a waste of your time in case you have not notice those be kid out there we do not believe last night 's riot be connect to the murder oh how could it not be because the unsub we be look for be old they operate entirely out of southeast d c they exercise extreme control over their victim and violence be up close and personal none of what happen here last night fit the profile enough with the profile I get probably a million dollar worth of damage I get two cop injure which be probably make bad by police overreaction Meaning what I warn you case like this people get too emotional you be here as a guest of my department Rossi we be only try to help if you be so sure none of those kid be the killer why bother interrogate they at all because we need to be certain if we be right if this be just some sort of teenage dare I guarantee you that the unsub be go to respond very quickly I appreciate your

make sense to I unsub build to something like that what if this be not their first murder the first two round of vandalism they be typical car window smash restaurant with the plate glass break but that last case right before the home invasion that be a random construction site a single family townhouse Prentiss you flag it yourself yeah yeah dialing hey garcia I need the address on that townhouse that be vandalize I do not understand how we can help Sir we believe that whoever vandalize your house be responsible for the murder in the area oh I know we 've read the paper but honestly that be not something we be go to think about right now we also think it be possible that your home be vandalize for a reason what do you mean may we yes please thank you we believe there may have be another murder before the first one the police become aware of you think there might be a body hide here on our property it be possible at the very least the man we be look for may have work here oh my god be there any issue with worker during construction no nothing do anyone appear overly confrontational I just have contact with our contractor and he be friendly I understand people come and go during construction but be there anyone at all that you may have notice suddenly be not around oh no what be it the contractor I mention after the vandalism we call he to oversee the repair he never call we back the police report say that every room in the house be destroy except one yeah they smash every room except the nursery that one they do not touch we need to see it door open this wall be

sexual assault combine with ligature mark on her wrist and ankle she be asphyxiate 3 victim in 5 year all the woman be connect by mark he like chain definite sexual sadist he stick to his type 16 to 19 year old girl all blond hang on to they for a while too look at this average of 2 year between abduct they and kill they low body count long time frame this guy be in control of his urge too control sadist need new victim new way to torture there be a lot of guy out there who like chain be we sure this be the same unsub Kristie taylor 's autopsy report also indicate a second connection between these victim she be pregnant she have give birth very soon after the unsub kill she how soon after Minutes this unsub be not your typical sexual sadist Captivity and assault we 've see before what we have not see be this signature the role he force these woman to fulfill before he kill they Motherhood scream Sync by honeybunny www addic7ed com Jj journalist william d tammeus write you do not really understand human nature unless you know why a child on a merry go round will wave at his parent every time around and why his parent will always wave back so why would a sexual sadist make woman carry his child Gary heidnik keep a harem in a dungeon his goal be to create a large family as a replacement for his own break home Josef fritzl keep his daughter in a cell in his own house and they have several kid together squalid condition be part of a control fantasy these man have if he be keep these woman in a similar location he would need a lot of privacy Morgan he probably build it himself make he good with his hand why blonde and what significance do they have to he maybe uh the woman who reject he or the woman who would not bear his child if that be true he would be the same age as these girl late teen this unsub be too skilled for that his own mother then she could be a runaway just like these victim which make his compulsion psych 101 kill his mother over and over again for give birth to he yeah but then why wait until after she give birth now he have a body and a baby to get rid of that trouble I too we find the mother but not the infant uh I hate to say this but what if the woman be just a means to an end what if the baby be really the one he be exploit if kristie taylor just surface it mean he have her baby right now Jj check with the parent see if there be any similarity in the runaway ' pattern where the unsub 's find they Reid and prentiss go to the late dump site we need to look at victimology how he treat these woman in the final moment of their life might tell we what he be do to the child Doctor you write in your report that kristie have have several miscarriage how be that evident there be a number of abrasion in her uterine lining around the third trimester her water would break so she never carry to term no last time she do there be a high level of pitocin in her blood it be an artificial hormone you give it to induce labor she be on a tight schedule if she lose the baby he would get her pregnant again immediately Childbirth be tough enough Imagine if your life depend upon it all 3 mom have record Drug abuse drunk and disorderlie but what be more interesting be what he do after he kidnap they this be kristie taylor 2 week before she be abduct Hotch he get her healthy well fed and off the habit not completely these drug in kristie 's system what be they Tamoxifen metoclopramide Domperidone progesterone Progesterone 's a prenatal medication be not it they all be the first 2 help carry the baby to term the last 2 help with lactation what kind of sexual sadist give his victim prenatal drug the kind who take care of the kid he be have he get his rock off kill the mom but the baby he protect you think he be keep they if he despise the mom he would despise their child too New mexico 's right on the border a lot of human trafficking go on this tight schedule he keep the mom on he could be breed call child protection service we need to find out about exist black market for infant thank you there be no tire track the body be not dump that far from the road this guy do not care about they not enough to even hide they very well that be why this do not make any sense dump site reveal something about the unsub you know at the very least a geographic familiarity a place he know he will not get catch ok so he know this road yeah except he abduct kristie in farmington and then dump she here in rio rancho it be a 175 mile drive why drive that far just to dump a body by the side of the road a forensic countermeasure cover his track by sheer distance so the geographical profile will not do we much good no it will just not with the victim we profile that it be the baby that he be interested in that be where he will reveal himself the adoption company he sell through and whatever network of resource he use he make shortcut there for convenience no one be go to drive 100 mile for diaper or for a public notary for legal paperwork if the baby be in the system they will lead we to he child trafficking be huge in other country but here it be mostly a myth why be that there be an easy and legal path Adoption there would be a paper trail though would not there there be way to hide your track there must be a way to identify all these kid there be a court record for every adoption give we the record we will start weed they out by date the adoption in this state be close the file be seal so it will take time that be a luxury we do not have there be a child at risk right now all child who go in and out of the adoption system get basic genetic screening for pre exist condition we have their dna we can use that we can match the maternal dna with the baby in the system we be still talk hundred of kid what if we give you one of the baby ' dna that would make it go fast yeah he kill these mom so soon after they give birth secondary dna could still be on their body I will call the m e I understand thank you doctor Agent jareau I be conrad winmar this be my wife jane thank you for come in why do not we talk privately you you want to dig up our dauter we think the unsub might have leave dna on her the last 2 victim do not have any but because monica be the first he might have make a mistake back when they find she the detective say that they do not find his dna it be not his dna we be look for we suspect your daughter give birth while she be captive what the unsub have get all of his victim pregnant he might be put the baby in the adoption system the baby 's alive possibly if we could find placental tissue on monica we can test the dna against the state 's record give we the release the first time I see she see her record too Thought she be just another girl on the street not care what she do to herself I never even think to look for this what be it it be a baby 's umbilical cord the child should be about 4 now I hope you find he or her I really do thank you mm Garcia ok know this Most adoption folk be like the nice most dedicated people in the world there be however one or two skeezy one how skeezy Super skeezy I 've get a spread sheet from one of they expect compensation for the baby I be have something you want to tell I garcia oh that be the sad part my prince the genetically perfect offspring of penelope garcia and derek morgan would not fetch top dollar who do white baby be in high demand than minority boy be more popular than girl at least this year anyway and then there be the swedish supermodel rule the what if I be to deliver a blond haired blue eyed bundle of joy I would be set for life I would Garcia do the baby 's dna turn up in new mexico 's adoption record no there be no hit on her profile and it be a she by the way this unsub could still be sell baby just not through the system that be go to make he a lot hard to catch Hotch all right it be late let us get some rest we will hit this fresh in the morning Garcia out Morgan I would like for you to write up a preliminary profile we do not have enough for that well that be why it be preliminary a work in progress profile help show we what we be miss ok sure how you hold up we just waste a day look into a black market that probably do not exist that be not what I mean I 've hear whisper you be get some heat I be take care of it so you uh think we have a tunnel vision problem I think we would like to believe that we could save those kid but look what he do to the mother a lot of anger he be probably do the same thing to the child his own child maybe Garcia say something interesting Blond haired blue eyed baby get top dollar in the adoption system all the mother have blond hair and blue eye you be go to love this this guy he have like the good like there be no well he have like this access to god he do not want to hang on to it he want to give it away how much further not much because that be what god 's love be you know it be share it be give everything you have of yourself away and not expect anything in return where be we right here baby right where we need to be Aah Aah aah groan she be good right that be the kind of chick you want woman gasp she be perfect I know it be a long shot but monica 's parent say that she be head west maybe she make it part of the way when she be kidnap so why not run her dna against adoption record in surround state be you kid I think you be brilliant hey jj if we find this little girl what be go to happen to her if something illegal transpire during the adoption process the court nullifie it the child gets return to the close blood relative Huh if it help I have meet with the grandparent they be wonderful people oh I be sure they be it be just I do not know I I lose my parent grant I be old than she be but what get I through be the people close to I and if monica 's daughter be with a good family and we take she away from they be we do more harm than good yeah Garcia I do not think we have a choice these people have a right to their granddaughter you be right yeah this suck yes right away please thank you hey I just call cp ask they to send over infant mortality file another group for we to eliminate good what be that your profile I disagree with your analysis Hotch be you serious it be not a law review article it be just something for we to brainstorm but you only focus on one angle morgan that the prenatal drug indicate the presence of a wife or a girlfriend we need more option which I can give you once we make the proper deduction Hotch you be ask I to guess Morgan in order for the profile to be useful it have to generate multiple scenario about what the unsub be do Rewrite it we get she Monica winmar 's daughter she be adopt 4 year ago she be lisa now how do garcia find she she cross reference the entire new mexico system she be not in new mexico she be in arizona so all the mother be abduct and dump in new mexico but he keep the baby in arizona Rossi he know the police with stop look at the state line the adoption agency 's go to be our good lead to the unsub who handle the case Jj that be bombshell number 2 she do not go through an agency she be drop off anonymously at a church Hospitals and church be safe haven you can drop a baby off no question ask child protection service would look for the close relative another search that end at the state line and if cp do not find one the baby will go into foster care which be what happen to lisa she be lucky the adoption process happen within a month so this unsub have the opportunity to make money off this infant he do not drop it off at a church because he know the state will take good care of it that be awfully considerate outside the murder nothing about this unsub 's Behavior profile like a sexual sadist as I write yeah morgan 's right it be the action of a caretaker a mother could our unsub be a woman uh only a man would torture his victim this much man get off on this kind of violence woman do not Morgan he could be marry though his wife be a passive participant take care of the mom and the baby all right we need to split up we will give the profile to the arizona and the new mexico state police Rossi reid and prentiss I want you to head to phoenix Morgan you be here with I we will finalize the profile groan Ohh how be you feel terrible what be you on what what be you talk about when he take we we be all on something I be an alcoholic so what be you on uh crack I be carol I be julie here here be some water come drink some um be this some kind of tough love detox clank oh what be that it be like the sun it give we vitamin d it keep we healthy well they can not make we stay here hey hey let I out I want to go home I want my clothe I want my phone let I out of here let I out why be he do this what do he want your baby I be not pregnant you will be door open Morgan the unsub that we be look for be a couple now the man in the relationship most likely have a history of sexual violence he start with stalk and then move his way up to assault and rape and that violent streak end temporarily when he find his wife for the first year of their marriage she submit to his torture look for wife who come into the e r repeatedly and with obvious sign of spousal abuse but you be go to have to go back about 5 year that be because around the time of the first abduction the visit stop the sexual sadist can not find satisfaction from a willing participant he eventually get to a place where he could not escalate his violence against she without kill she so she make he a deal he get to kidnap rape and kill each of the runaway and she get to keep the child she be be give the victim a series of prescription prenatal drug so you be go to want to look at the obstetric field uh Nurses o b s the wife need these child at first they be the lifeline that keep she alive as long as he have other target for his abuse she avoid his rage so if these child protect she from abuse why be she put they up for adoption we believe the unsub want child who resemble they physically who no one would question as their own all of the runaway have be blond which mean the unsub may be as well but the first child we find in the system be a brunette whatever the physical characteristic the color of the eye the skin type if the baby do not have it he or she end up in the foster care system Wives of sexual sadist need outlet as a denial mechanism to cope with what their partner be do and motherhood especially take care of a helpless infant be this woman 's way of cope Jane you find she we have how be she she be great she be adopt by a young couple no report of physical or emotional trauma so when can we take she right now we be in touch with her adoptive parent ' lawyer but the law be on your side can we talk to the parent we could discuss this with they they do not want to initiate contact they 've be through a lot right now they be her parent of course they do not want to give she up well if she want to see they then we can work that out but we be her family yes absolutely no wait what be the risk here if we claim she be we hurt she it be impossible to tell some kid do great other have trouble but why be we talk about risk she be monica 's daughter Conrad she be not their blood stop it thank you agent jareau but my husband and I we need to discuss this what be this it be the pattern I 've be look for the unsub hide their track with the mother but they be not so careful with the abandon baby do you find more child Dna wise no but deductively yes I gather all the record for all infant who enter into foster care in a 2 week window follow each mother 's death then I narrow it down to baby that be abandon at church this be where the guesswork begin Monica 's winmar 's daughter be abandon at a presbyterian church let us assume the unsub or the wife at least be presbyterian that mean all other unwanted child be go to be leave at the same denomination right that narrow it down to 3 baby leave at 3 different presbyterian church all within this 20 mile radius this be where they live these kid you deduce to have you look at their file no right now I 've only be track church why because you just uncover another pattern yeah we be pack up now we can be in phoenix in about 2 hour you sure about this the name of the baby reid find tell we everything Lisa elizabeth amanda we profile there would be a type they would keep and a type they would put into foster care they be keep the boy heartbeat it be time Julie what be you do what be you do hey where be you go come back you have to come back please they never stay for this part no no no no you be not actually yes I be they 've induce what be I suppose to do you help I 1 1 000 Ohh 2 1 000 no no no I be sorry I can not 3 1 000 I can not help you I can not I be sick I be not well I need a I can not do it julie listen to I be you listen to I yes yes if this baby do not make it they be go to kill I and once they 've kill I they be go to move on to you do you understand ok ok what do we do Jj I need you to call these fertility specialist and get they over here for interview whoa yeah I know Hotch want to focus on the prenatal drug the unsub be give the victim he think we can build a new suspect pool and he want it do yesterday there be 2 page of name here should not we narrow it down Jj just do it ok I be sorry be everything ok Hotch have be on I ever since we get here and for the life of I I can not figure out why oh I might know the night before hotch pick this case chief strauss stop by the b a u they be behind closed door and it seem like it get a little tense well the bureau be be on he for a while he must have know this be go to happen except now they be make he justify every decision for hotch that be hell Rossi dr dekeyser we do not think she be get these prenatal drug as a patient you be think she be write the scrip for these herself something like that then she would not be very knowledgeable about what she be do some of these drug have serious side effect there be dozen of med I would prescribe before these all of they more effective so why would she use these my guess these be the one she have access to Fertility drug be a cocktail and you keep remixe the cocktail until you get pregnant the information be out there on the internet she find the right one so the woman be prescribe these drug maybe for some other illness and figure out that they help carry a baby to term exactly then the real question be what other disease do these drug treat ok I can do this I can do this fetal heartbeat on monitor what nothing you remind I of I Carol hey Carol please please stay awake please ok just just focus on the sound of my voice ok can you do that I be here Carol tell I about the woman who be here before I what happen to her she miscarry a lot then she give birth to a girl they do not like girl this be not your first time be it no what happen he do not make it I be sorry they let you live even if you lose he they want those boy ok ok hey hey listen I do not know what to do ok so please please just tell I what to do how dilated be I wh what I do not know what that mean just put your finger in a row and measure I wait oh my god groan ok oh my god ok um it be 4 it be 4 finger and I oh god be that the head mm hmm oh my god what do that mean it mean it be time to push what be this it be a tactical arrest plan I would like you to write it up for this case you want I to write up how we apprehend these unsub without risk the life of the child yes scoff hotch I 've lead dozen of tactical assault you 've never make I write up one of these before that be because I always do it for you after each case scoff you know what I be sorry strauss be come down on you this be not about strauss really I disagree look I understand that you be under the gun but I get to say it I be really not all that surprised I 've watch you walk away from a bunch of cop gun down unsub in d c you walk in unprotected to a hostage situation in louisville of course the bureau 's worried about you Man I be worried about you but just because you be the one who be under the magnifying glass that do not mean I can not domyjob Morgan there be a big part of your job that I do for you because I do not need you worried about paperwork and politic I need you in the field and focus and catch the next unsub but I can not do that anymore I do not have to justify my order to you and you do have to follow they I 've always follow your order when they

case Agent jareau and I review the request this morning and I 've decide on oklahoma city why this one local have more evidentiary information in other priority this one they have nothing they need we the most good if that be all I would like to gather the team I will be check in I expect to be brief yes ma'am if you need privacy please use my office that be ok we be do here and when we get back I

trust I to step in as act unit chief I be ask that you respect my decision I 've decide that I do not want hotch 's office that be where he belong if necessary we can discuss this again at a later date but right now we really need to get start on this case Guys Grab rossi this be megan chertow and her friend bina sukarto both 17 find 2 night ago in a parking garage Carotids sever this be john o'heron 61 he be find dead in a wooded area 4 day ago Blunt force trauma to the head different m o and completely different victimology Rossi how be the case link Jj their eye have be remove oh he be an enucleator there be a name for this it be a rare subset of criminal behavior but there have be case study of assaultive enucleator the overwhelming majority of they suffer from diagnose mental disorder Reid and they be usually male lack social skill their kill be disorganized and sloppy the typical enucleator gouge the eye out but he do not normally take they with he this guy do we need to figure out why there be noticeable shift from the first to second murder he go from kill in seclusion to a public place and he escalate from one victim to 2 what concern I most be there be less than 48 hour between the murder that be why I choose this case Hotch and from what we know about enucleator they be almost always multiple repeat offender exactly which mean he be go to need to kill again soon all right let us meet on the plane in 30 Aah Sync by honeybunny www addic7ed com Morgan and if thy right eye offend thee pluck it out and cast it from thee Matthew 5 29 the color of all the victim ' eye be different so that probably do not factor in to victimology it be more likely what he see in the eye Case study show that most enucleator suffer from delusion they hear voice and see thing in people 's eye usually something evil they be drive to enucleate to destroy the devil it point to someone who may have be institutionalize and recently release I will have garcia start look all right so talk to I what make these attack so different with victim one there be multiple blunt force strike to the head a more personal kill and he dispose of the body maybe as a forensic countermeasure the next murder seem less personal more opportunistic I think we need to look at why the first victim be bludgeon and dump perhaps the unsub know he Prentiss I want you to go to the disposal site see if you can figure out why he be dump there Rossi you and I be go to go to last night 's crime scene actually uh the girl ' family ask to speak to our team leader all right um ok in that case rossi you can handle the crime scene solo Jj you be with I and hotch reid I want you to get into john o'heron 's life see if anything at all point to a personal motive hey phil brantley appreciate you all come Agent hotchner this be dr reid you will meet the rest of the team later here be one excellent ok here be where the first body be find just outside of town and last night 's murder be here and that be about 22 mile apart what that be unusual serial killer usually have a small kill zone cell phone ring it be our technical analyst Hey garcia you be on speaker phone so I look up recently release mental health patient who have a history of eye gouge Eye assault and other gross thing you can do to eye and socket and there be no bingo for okie city resident any other recent attack involve assault on eye there be one 9 month ago he be not your guy 'cause he be in jail we will call you later 10 4 breaker breaker Bye you think he be fresh out of an asylum either that or he be be hold somewhere and he be now free we 've see eye assault before you know bar brawl rage domestic abuse case but nothing like this what the hell 's he do with the eye he could be collect they as a trophy of some sort Reid they would not keep long as trophy eye be 80 vitreous humor which be essentially water after a few hour they begin to get cloudy and wilt any other theory there have be case where after enucleation mental patient have consume the eyeball be you serious thank you for come here it be no problem we can not leave our house we have to mourn for 3 day buddhist ritual yes do your sister call you while she be out last night no I know something be wrong she always come home by curfew do this man look familiar to you no why do you ask we believe he and your sister be kill by the same person it help we to rule out any connection between the victim and it tell we that your sister be most likely attack at random oh thank you thank you I ask to speak to you because we need you to do something for we take breath mm it be ok take your time Grandma say she see bina 's ghost last night her eye be just big black hole Bina be look for her eye she say bina 's cursed she can not rest she be stuck for eternity look for her eye we want to cremate she but we need all of her can you find her eye for we we will try but realistically we may not be able to then she will be curse forever she may never rest in peace O'heron 's friend say he have a history of drunken behavior but they do not know anybody with a grudge against he he be last see leave a bar Bartender on duty say he leave without incident where do he go after that I check out the disposal site where john o'heron 's body be dump it be a remote farm road the unsub do not just stumble on it he know it we need a list of people who work or live near the area I get a bad feeling about this guy why be that he choose that parking garage he be patient he hide and wait for the right victim and the right time and place he blitz they it be all strategic that sound way too organize for a typical enucleator add to that his lack of a cool off period between kill it be not go to be easy to get ahead of he I just get off the phone with the m e she say there be something we should see the eyeball be hold in the socket by 6 different muscle fatty tissue and the optic nerve these be picture of john o'heron 's eye socket see the optic nerve protrude Trauma they be rip out maybe with finger now compare this to my body on the table Smooth inside no bruise no sign of trauma optic nerve retract into the muscle and they have a clean edge so you be say these be cut out with a sharp edge tool he manage to avoid cut the socket or the eyelid this be precise work the kind of work only a doctor could do all I be say be that with both of these girl it be a clean excision ok so he be crude with the first victim surgical with the other the amount of effort he be go through to remove the eye now he would not destroy they he be keep they pant rustle Ohh he be not afraid to get catch this be far from the other crime scene what bring he here well he only kill one person this time it could have be more hey we find a car park nearby I d have she from a dmv photo Tracy copper 32 husband say she be an avid jogger single knife wind to the neck eye be miss cut out as carefully as the last one hey garcia so we have the list of local doctor but we need to back it up one step where shall I splice my prettie give I a list of all doctor who 've have infraction like malpractice suit got it bounce your way narrow it down to eye specialist Whoo that be still a lot of name we will chip away when we know more hey wait before you hang up how be my morgan do Fine I know the man be fine how be he hold up as head honcho well he be stress but he be on top of it speak of which there be something you could do for he Name it he must have hide in these tree lie in wait again so he pick his location and then wait for a victim of opportunity he blitz she because he lack the social skill to charm that feel like the same pattern as the girl in the parking lot but he be quiet in the parking lot if he hide in these tree there be too much dry brush he would have make noise no it be too sloppy for he she be a serious jogger if she would hear he she might have be able to outrun he unless he surprise she some other way guy what be that a tripwire we need to look at her ankle he use the tripwire to get she off her foot she be stunned and she do not have time to run away he lay a trap for her all this plus the way he bleed she at the neck it be the behavior of a game hunter Hunting be a big part of this city 's culture yeah hunting animal be what trigger he to start hunt human this guy be take people 's eye so he be definitely disturb what bug I be that people like this usually unravel get sloppy and this guy 's only get well they be back Morgan I be field call leave and right here what be happen case make national news they be start to call he the eye snatcher all right um you be go to hold a small control press conference answer their question but try to squash that name I want the people to be aware but I do not want to make a bogeyman out of this guy you understand yeah yeah be there something else you be not answer strauss ' call she be just try to keep tab she can wait Morgan maybe you should take the time to field the call Hotch we have to set up a tip line we have to go over jj 's talking point we have not get the profile out yet all of that take priority over deal with strauss I understand all that let we help you set up strategy while you talk to her we will regroup with you before we proceed we have enough battle believe I you do not want to fight she too let I get this profile out and then I will go talk to strauss he be do a good job he be have you think about how this be go to end what do you mean Morgan as our unit chief be a temporary thing it be he be a natural leader he will excel what happen when he be ask to step down inaudible conversation we believe that our unsub may have know his first victim yet the rest be random Most enucleator have a mental disorder and be frenzied and sloppy when they attack this one have more control we be not call he by any nickname he be simply a murderer that the fbi be try to apprehend he lay in wait to kill his victim know how to cut they so they bleed out this indicate he might have a hunting background we be urge citizen to be hypervigilant at night he be kill in different area of the city in public place his large kill zone could be relate to some type of travel pattern in his life which indicate a comfort with these neighborhood why all of a sudden be he kill people every day the escalation might be cause by a self impose time line he have to murder so many people take this many eye to accomplish a task so he be crazy but he be get a mission actually yes he be act on a delusion that be fuel this murder spree for example a man name herbert mullin he have a fear of a catastrophic earthquake hit california now he believe that by kill people and offer their blood as a sacrifice to the earth he could prevent an earthquake he be a paranoid schizophrenic and his delusion lead he to kill 13 people uh what should we look for when we be on the street we believe he be a white male 27 to 35 we believe he be drive a van or a pickup truck with a removable cab something utilitarian that can get bloody and wash out easily he may also have apply for hunt license he have some sort of medical or surgical training but fall short of make a career out of it Jj he may have be in a halfway house or have be grant leave from a treatment facility maybe his family move he away and now he be back if you know anyone who fit these type of scenario please call our tip line our unsub kill at night employ hunt tactic and be patient he will wait until he can be alone with his victim cell phone ring ring chief strauss you be answer my call now listen I apologize for this morning but I be sure you can understand how busy we be so what be the strategy tonight I have the team visit precinct all over town help local set up patrol and medium outlet be warn citizen to be hypervigilant what about suspect nothing viable yet so ultimately you be no close to catch he tonight trust I I be well aware that he be probably out there hunt as we speak now if I wake up in the morning and there be more victim that be all on I look I be not criticize you in fact there be a lot of people who have faith in you and want to see you succeed do you understand that yes ma'am I be just check in to make sure your team be intact and that you have everything you need to do your job this team be solid and we will get

no luck at all try to find this guy on paper that be why we step away get some sleep come back fresh we be look for a doctor who be also a hunter and a former mental patient who happen to be cut people 's eye out trust the profile when we get he it will all make sense good morning no it be not do not tell I Brantley a male and a female Rossi he be back to kill 2 there be something different about this crime scene though he cut the wire in the electrical box kill all the light so they could not see he want to force they off the trail so he could hunt they in the dark if they could not see he could not he probably use some kind of night vision aid like a scope something a hunter would use her carotid be sever and her eye be miss just like the other he do not take the boy 's eye well why not what be so different there be a laceration on his left eye the right eye he do not even touch he be get defensive wound on his arm he probably try to fight back to protect the girl during the fight the unsub could have cut his eye we say he might be collect they what if he need a set an injury like that ruin the collection they be trophy oh my god what I know this sound crazy but just hear I out a taxidermist Morgan might be onto something the unsub 's collecting set of eye that need to be flawless because he be preserve they as a trophy of some kind we say he be a hunter what do hunter collect for trophy what if we be wrong about he be a doctor it make sense a taxidermist have all the skill and supply need to preserve eye and other body part do they know how to surgically remove eye like this yeah they have anatomy knowledge they have to cut through muscle tissue and nerve in order to remove hide it be the exact same thing for eyeball cell phone ring Garcia you be on speaker

the shock value maybe he be concerned for they think he want they take care of no sign of sexual assault on any of the victim look how pale she be all of they be severely hypovolemic Tara have less than a pint of blood in her look at this the first 2 have more than 3 pint each if exsanguination be the goal the unsub be definitely become more proficient this be new Tara be the only victim to have a write message the liar the liar that be strange be not it not a liar or just liar so what do you lie about Tara all of the victim appear to have be strangle and then bleed out through identical wound in the throat wait seriously be those suppose to be fang mark all of the wound on the victim be cover in saliva Human saliva as though someone drink their blood Team Criminal Minds http expert heberg forum net in the darkest page of the malign supernatural there be no more terrible tradition than that of the vampire a pariah even among demon Writer montague summer ok thank so they 've already set up a task force in Los Angeles this be not their first serial case you remember detective owen kim from the stalker case you remember that case do not you Spence I do remember that case yeah you ever talk to Lila anymore you know I think we should probably focus on this case right now it be a little more pertinent all right so tell we about blood drinker reid Human blood consumption or clinical vampirism be know as renfield 's syndrome name after the insect eat character in bram stoker 's novel dracula be they sadist not necessarily pain to the victim be usually only a byproduct blood be the focus Renfield 's syndrome be usually accompany by vary level of schizophrenia and occasionally more classic cannibalism if the condition evolve classic cannibalism lovely job we have I will say this true case be exceedingly rare that be comfort Sort of Renfield 's may be rare but vampire be anything but and there be a huge subculture in Los Angeles of the red drinking undead why be that not a surprise Garcia all these people drink blood Au contraire they mostly just dress up like Prentiss do in high school and they make believe it be all kind of delicious it be not the same thing at all as a matter of fact we should refer to this unsub as a vampirist not a vampire and they would be attract to the subculture merely for its professed worship of blood ok I be go to continue spelunk through the various online site see if anything jump up and bite I Thanks baby g Thanks Penelope stay close yes sir Garcia out you guy one more thing vampirist be coveter they most generally always have some sort of relationship with the victim even if it be tangential and they be likely to become obsess they 've almost certainly cross path in some way it be ok it be just I it be ray you still in bed I be sick look Dante you be already late do not call I that sorry but man you got to get go ok I say no the record company be go to be piss again if you be not get out I know you hate

board case file and extremely bad coffee we 've work with a lot less Agent Morgan 's in charge now it be his show long story I know you like to start with the fresh information and work your way back so Tara 's apartment have be process and seal in case you want to go there and her body along with that of the first 2 girl be at the morgue with an M e wait there for your call all right jj get set up here and then hook up with Garcia send she the witness information so she can start cross referencing with the first 2 victim Reid I want you to go through all the case file set up a preliminary profile base on what you already know about the psychopathology and the rest of we let us find out what we can on Tara so we be look for a connection between the witness when vampirist become obsess they be not likely to find a random victim if we can find a cross relationship someone in all the victim ' life that will be incredibly helpful Gina king know Tara the long they apparently have some class together let us get all the information we can on that relationship as a matter of fact get I everything you can on all of Tara 's friend all right in the morning I will track they down and do some follow up that be fine Dante this be Jeff from metal life magazine he be write a story on artist who cross over Cross over be that what I do Jeff from metal life I guess kind of you be not

we be ready with a preliminary profile that be quick so be this unsub we be not look for a vampire in the supernatural sense only in the sense that this unsub have a very strong desire a need for human blood now fortunately vampirist display several characteristic which will be helpful in find he he will have cut himself repeatedly it be call auto vampirism essentially become his own first victim it be the way by which he first taste human blood Most vampirist be incredibly ashamed of this and will wear long sleeve shirt in order to conceal it secondly there will be a long history of animal abuse start with small animal such as insect and rodent and then work his way up to large thing dog and cat though this be a well recognize component of the homicidal triad see in other serial killer in the case of the vampirist it be more pronounced there will interestingly enough not be any animal torture as with other psychopathology the killing be not the point it be merely a mean by which to obtain the blood look hard at your animal control section record as far back as you can they will probably have some record of this unsub as an adolescent this guy also most likely life in a poorly keep old home he need a house for the privacy not an apartment it take some time to drain a body completely of blood uninterrupte time this unsub also most likely live with an elderly woman a grandmother a mother even an aunt how could you know that this type of mental illness accompany by extreme schizophrenia dominate a family 's entire existence it often lead to a broken home and a woman end up as primary caregiver the man generally leave and one more thing this type of disorder can not be hide for long I guarantee you someone out there already know this unsub be very very sick

a shovel seriously Reid we have no way of know that Gina have that type of anger inside of her yeah but she be obsess with Dante I should have know that that level of fixation can lead to manipulation but only when the fixation 's couple with schizophrenia which we have no way of know still it never cease to amaze I how dark obsession can get and with a pop star I mean I be obsess with the rat pack but I would not have kill for Frank or Dean no you just drank whiskey and smoke cigar this from the man who be favorite record be the Beatles ' white album just because manson hijack it do not have to ruin it for the rest of we that be why I stick to Beethoven there be no chance of guilt by association well yeah have you ever see a movie call a clockwork orange Writer Cyril connolly say well to write for yourself and have no public than to write for the public and have no self now from these experiment a few factor become evident one be the realization that serial killer have be with we since the dawn of man please let he go take whatever you want take anything but please let my son go my name be professor james fallon I be a scientist neuroscientist and I study the human brain it be a complex and sometimes lethal machine in a blind experiment colleague send I 70 mri brain scan and I have no idea who these brain belong to some be normal some be schizophrenic and some be killer I analyze all of they 5 of which I determine be the brain of psychopath and it turn out that indeed these 5 be the brain of serial killer some of whom you know in study such as these one look at the biological factor that be the genetic and also the brain pathology the 5 brain we identify all have damage to the orbital cortex which be right above the eye now high risk allele of the monoamine oxidase a the MAOA gene may also be present in these people and that be key now under the effect of the high risk gene the brain of the psychopath be bathe in way too much serotonin during fetal development as an adult this brain be now numb to seratonin 's calm effect the first dangerous element be now in place the damage be do now this be a recipe for catastrophe so when the fetus reach the day of labor the potential serial killer be bear Mom Mom hey how be your weekend scary yet informative be the whole family kill Hudson this be dr spencer reid Field agent anne hudson the uh father be serve in iraq 3 night ago the cop find his family bury over there bury the neighbor hear the dog bark come over and he be scratch at the grave Lucy their old child she be still in her swimsuit what do the father know Hudson some of it he be on patrol take his unit a couple of day to reach he he arrive today last year the williams family be kill and find exactly the same way they live in newport news the father dan williams be also serve overseas now the police be overwhelm and get serious heat from the military we need some answer fast as do the medium they be already call this the work of a serial killer they be right it be but why bury they I mean it can not be to hide the body it be a sign of remorse and when they be do be remorseful this will happen again Criminal Team http expert heberg forum net man usually avoid attribute cleverness to somebody else unless it be an enemy Albert einstein no sign of a struggle Unsub hold a gun to one of her kid ' head what can she do footprint belong to paul somehow he manage to get away Mom get it first then the young he hide in the master bedroom the unsub find he and shoot he and carry he out to the backyard but not the mother she be drag out it be quick and proficient for the mother and the boy maybe but lucy 's drowned and not shoot why the change in m o f 22 raptor yeah it be about to get way louder and much busy tomorrow be langley 's 50th anniversary air show the father of the first family kill dan williams where be he now he put in for another tour of iraq an i e d kill he 2 month ago whoever do this know both father be serve overseas Laura downey 's wedding ring be miss any other valuable we will have to ask the husband from the williams home only jewelry and watch be miss the unsub only take what he can carry which mean he be most likely on foot there be a photo on the wall in the kitchen I would like to see it sure there be no sign of sexual assault in the williams case what about lucy nothing on the coroner 's report multiple suspect the mother be drag out of the house if it have be multiple suspect they probably would have carry she he know the father be absent therefore the dominant threat be absent so we could be look for a single suspect no sign of force entry no need lucy be in the pool back door be open the unsub walk right in that mean lucy probably die last in both case the girl be suffocate and not shoot I do not think it be a coincidence hey garcia you be on speaker we just get a call from virginia super max prison one of the inmate there have receive 2 envelope in the last 2 day first envelope have clipping of the newport news killing Second envelope have medium clipping of the downey family in the second envelope be a note say look at what I 've do and both piece of mail have be sign by an admirer who be the inmate that be the part that Karl arnold the fox he be back ok thank Family annihilator absent father wedding ring it be similar to what 4 year ago karl arnold aka the fox kill 8 family just like this case he take wedding ring only he take they as trophy he would hide in the bush outside the home and I watch they for a number of day always at night see how they live how they love I would keep they apart until the last night then I would bring they one by one down to the basement the young first the father last why karl so he could see what happen to family when the head of household be not strong Wives wither child perish so we be work with a copycat here it be too early to assume anything it could bias the profile not to mention the police the medium and the military would jump all over it until we be positive none of this information leave the 7 of we Hotch you give evidence at arnold 's trial I think you should go see he I would like to take prentiss with I let us go have garcia check on all of arnold 's prison correspondence and visitor for the last 4 year ok captain joseph downey have arrive back at the station Captain downey please sit thank you I be fine tell I everything at around 9 30 3 night ago your neighbor call police when I be sorry Sir we believe it be the work of a serial killer I be sorry my neighbor jack and penny Captain downey your family be murder all of they be there someone you would like we to call uh call um no no I uh I I would like to go home now Captain downey captain downey captain d ok I be sorry I be so sorry so why wait a year to send karl a note unless they be communicate the whole time that be the first thing we need to find out but karl have a big ego he be go to want to answer a question with a question the first thing he be go to want to know be why I be not wear my wedding ring and then he will turn his attention to you so that be why you bring I along your presence will throw he off guard then he be go to want to describe to you in graphic detail every sexual act he commit with the family to freak I out to pull you into his fantasy Control open on 16 keep your eye forward More than anything he be go to want to see the image of the child we can not give he that we have to give he something or we will get nothing from he Come on be not that Garrett pain that be reinforce glass Easy for you to say he tear apart 14 woman open on 15 hello karl Agent hotchner I be not inform you be bring in a they just say two agent this be agent Emily Prentiss I know all about you if this unsub 's copying the fox then we profile he like the fox Karl arnold work as a psychologist 's assistant right yeah which make it easy for he to watch target and learn about the victim from a distance yeah it also make he hard to find like the fox our man here find a way to hide in plain sight but he be pull from 2 completely different unit Williams a medic downey an army captain someone know of that military connection both family be attack within a month of the father be deploy give they time to settle in get comfortable that the father be not there and once inside the home the fox would live with the family and then become the father but not this unsub he just walk in and dispense with the family live with they be not part of the fantasy Hudson agent rossi the picture you request thank to you we pull some print off it and all the print be on lucy the bullet hit the father dead center the print match that of the newport news killing it be the same killer Family annihilator like the fox they start with one victim and once they feel capable they move on to a second victim they do not start with entire family there be more victim we just have not find they yet Karl it appear you have a fan Admirer not a fan big difference right be this the first time you 've be contact by your admirer I have many fan even my own website do not you you would be astound at some of the question they ask I make a log of all of they would you like to read some I would love to you would love to yes here look maybe later your admirer be take wedding ring just like you but maybe not for the same reason like how you take all of mine you take mine but I see you lose yours 8 ring 4 family or be it one ring for each family how have you come to lose your ring wait do not tell I a casualty of the job my job be what put you in here true but then it be the child who suffer most would not you agree you would know more about that than I which be why you come to I I can help you with that agent hotchner I certainly can but I will need to see those photo may I a word be there a problem Emily there be no problem Karl we can not show he these these image will be his undoing and our way in but they be not just image that be exactly what they be we can not use Lucy like that it be a tradeoff we have to make so we be use a dead 12 year old girl in a bathing suit as a bargaining chip for what to he it be not just a photograph it be much much more and we need to know what look I be I 've never do this before and you do not have to now yes I do all right when I feel he be ready to talk I will leave the room you get he talk whatever he do whatever you feel just stay on script we need to know why he kill those family he be have a smattering of visit a couple of whack job contact he but nothing as direct as this admirer person how be we do on the print on the picture oh I be still run they how be you hold up military family they always fear the bad they know their man may not return but this to see a father lose so much I wish I have something for you I truly can not find a damn thing that connect these family Geographically both of they be thousand of mile away from their family Communication 's all they have email phone call letter but that be military communication even between family it require a kind of juice I be not allow to use Come on you hack into the FBI database and they give I a job and I like my job and I like my life all right I will make some inquiry ok do that take care Bye so Lucy die last alone this by itself do not really mean anything but when we look again at the Williams file we notice that the majority of the foreign fingerprint come from Karen Williams ' room which mean the unsub spend most of his time in there with Karen then he must have separate she from the rest of the family Lucy Downey be already in the pool that much be do for the unsub then this unsub be drive by some other kind of compulsion some other need Hotch be right this be not a coincidence it be a possible signature Sir I know that but two family have die no I realize this break protocol but no all we want be to stop this from happen again Sir I promise you agent Garcia be the good we have ok thank you we need to look at each of the victim as a hub with life outside of their own family well each one of they have their own connection outside the family School friend tutor business colleague and each one of these people be consider access point back to the family that could take week well you have time from remorse to the desire to kill again the unsub will go through a gamut of emotion it could be another year before the unsub feel the desire to kill again as horrific as these crime be this city do not have the resource to commit that amount of time we have full access to all military record for the father well now at least we have access to the main hub between family the dad all right well let us find out what connect they stand up you want to see do not you very much we be go to show you this be the home of the Downey family there be 3 child how old be the child 12 9 and 4 a girl and two boy where be they find over there bury Interesting Laura the mother and the two boy be kill in the house the daughter this be where the mother and the young son be kill the other boy be shoot in the bedroom closet where be the father Overseas the killer know this he know everything about this family and he watch their every move to be sure he achieve what he need you have no idea how he know the father be go or how he target these family and the how that be the key the how be why he be able to catch I you watch the family for day week I get to know they but not your guy he do not need week if he do he would stay long why so he can enjoy they but what I do not understand be why he do not separate the child exactly that way you have more control no room for error why he do not put the boy in separate room and say if you cry I will have to kill mommy tell I how do the girl die she be drown yet the other be shoot may I see she what be so special about the girl to suffocate she to feel the life leave her body mean everything to the man who do this to you maybe but not to this killer not in the same way all I do be show they how weak father could be that be all every child you kill you abuse physically for this man there be no sexual gratification at least I spare the father the grief of live please please do not do this come on let us get you clean up Dani do not I tell you to always lock the door Nick cleat off Dani where be you Dani Mom please do not please Mom the girl be suffocate not shoot right yes just like the other two her name be Dani she be 14 and the father Afghanistan do this rule out remorse yes it do so what be it now the escalation between kill indicate a major psychological break how be it escalate the timeframe between kill have go from a year to just 3 day for the unsub something have dramatically change some kind of major external stressor force this unsub into feel the need to kill again without any remorse Mirror neuron and stressor relate to the unsub 's past may have trigger this the strong of which be smell that sound the Williams be kill a year ago be there any military maneuver go on at langley at that time the annual air show but nothing as big as this he be kill again have not he luckily for I Luckily now we be alone you state that the family do not know the killer why now we wait right you and I see if my admirer contact I he will your be one of the first case I study really I 've be fascinate ever since with what you and now you want to know what I do to the child do not you yes I can show you I can show you exactly what I do to they tell I child be so precious so clean but they need guidance especially the girl why girl have much more to lose than boy it be a fact the female body can handle pain much well what do you do to they I show they what man their father and brother be capable of and what be that you sure you want to know yes Morgan if the Langley air show be the stressor then karl 's admirer do not fit the profile a psychopath suffer a major psychological break do not brag about it Hotch there be nothing you could have do that would have save that family today well that be if I be right about the profile I think you be Karl 's admirer do not have anything to do with these killing well either way we need to know who be Hotch I want you to stay with he and find out so we can stop this son of a bitch I plan to once I kill the child it always amaze I how little the father fight the inevitable which be what die I be troll through the william ' email satellite phone call land line phone call family photo their life all of it what about the Downeys they be up next and there be a ton to go through Fingerprints Garcia Zip they be there be nothing here I be sorry folk Garcia widen the search Morgan I already do Vicap combine every database in this country we be as wide as we can go abuse can have a long term effect on any child 's brain but for the abuse child who have the high risk gene and the orbital cortex damage the combination be devastate all right this air show be military these father be all soldier fight a war on foreign soil we know that none of these grave be a sign of remorse hey guy look at these grave what be they reminiscent of Mass grave exactly Wich would indicate the unsub experience early pubescent 3 dimentional mirror neuron reflect event similar to the one they be create I think this unsub be bear into conflict but where be he bear into conflict when be the last time we see anything like mass grave in the U S we have not not in our lifetime not within our border Vicap be national not international Garcia international database Interpol be the big if they do it they be in it it be pretty obvious that he be do this before but the question be where and why Karl I never think that you would be this honest it take a good woman to make an honest man and anyway let us face it she be pretty than you Karl do you know why you kill all those family I 've already tell you why no you tell I how not why and the reason why in this case be very different than they be for you they be very very different and as you so eloquently have be point out to agent Prentiss all of your motivation be about sex Motivations you learn from your father you really have do your research on I Emily I be flatter you be also fill with feeling of extreme self hatred it must be distract work with someone so beautiful you force those man to watch their child die and here be why karl here be why you be what you be what I would do to you by kill the father last you be kill your own father and ultimately yourself over and over again this be not over agent hotchner least not for you wait hotch for karl it be all about the father in this case it be all about the girl they die last they be lay out last none of they be shoot none of they show any sign of sexual motive what if we apply that logic to these killing that be something we have not consider why would we it be so rare what be the killer 's a woman a woman I will let morgan know Karl just now you say that this be not over for I what do you mean by that he be just getting warm up it be just you do not see it but you will all right we will work it in right now Prentiss think the unsub might be a woman that be why we could not find a sexual motive wherever she be from her father 's a military man Derek I 've get a hit interpol 2 hit 3 hit 3 crime scene 3 different city the first zagreb 1998 a woman and her 8 month old baby be both kill and then 2 year later the same print show up in modena italy then 2007

bosnian serb force surround the town a psychopath bear in the middle of that conflict that be not a good mix she be exact her life experience onto the victim you think this woman be there well think about it langley 's fill up with civilian and military vehicle just like srebrenica can you determine her age base on victimology each of these girl be no old than 15 the balkan war last between ' 93

entire time no ma'am I currently Report to act unit chief derek morgan who take over the unit because agent hotchner 's ability to lead the team have become compromise I I do not believe that be the reason you have a different opinion it be not just an opinion you have a different understanding Ssa hotchner voluntarily step down so we could continue to do our job unhindered how would you describe agent hotchner 's recent behavior drive drive agent jareau your entire team be on the line if I can not reconcile an adequate account of agent hotchner 's investigation into george foyet we be all investigate the reaper Ssa hotchner be not the only one especially after he send we that call card the newspaper article he mail to karl arnold 2 letter from 2 different location they ramp we all back up again I should just start at the beginning Foyet have do a lot of injury to himself in the original string of killing in an effort to paint himself as a victim and throw we off the investigation as a result he become dependent upon a large number of extremely strong medication we would be search the country for patient with that exact prescription combination but we have not have any luck the envelope foyet mail to arnold be due back from the lab they be flag urgent Gina 's here with they now they be process clean no print no dna she say they be clean yeah of course they be Anderson listen to I I do not care if you have to drive to the postmaster general 's house I want to know where those postmark be apply before the team get in yes ma'am copy that find it he be still not take his bottle here let I try hey can you take your bottle please can you take oh thank you so much oh yeah you be definitely mama 's little boy huh just like his ddy Pharmacist next hey if you have to go go ahead I can take care of this I do not know what I would do if I be in hotch 's shoe if I ever have to say good bye to you and henry because We'rnot go anywhere we be not you be track the prescription you be track the postmark aside from another body land on your doorstep you be do all you can I hope so for hotch 's sake Next that be we here we be oh actually there should be 2 prescription we fill the antibiotic but we be out of the antihistamine you know crush half a claritin would do the job just the same save you a couple buck too wait excuse I be there a lot of over the counter medication that can be substitute for prescription too many to count Most of the time it be just a matter of dosage Foyet 's med we have be track the entire combination what if he be be use over the counter med for some of it to mask his purchase ok narrow the search focus on the med he can not substitute good work knock on door just get a call from the postmaster general inspector 's office already I be not just a pretty face be garcia in yet be you sure Bacon doughnut you will never be the same I can totally think of more palatable way to up my adventure quotient thank you o m g it get well every time Kevin you need to leave right now would you like some water no thank you ma'am be you all right I I be just not uh Comfortable with any of this it be not ok what do you mean in my opinion everyone be ask the wrong question do not anybody care about what the reaper do to they how many people he hurt all anyone seem to care about be this just be not right do you think that agent hotchner be act agitated or unreasonable he no no he he be freak out about his family which consider what happen I would say be perfectly reasonable the foyet letter come from fredericksburg virginia and westminster maryland we can match the prescription drug Foyet can not substitute with a geographic profile of the 2 city can not substitute we need you to track the drug that can not be emulate with over the counter drug and can only be dispense by a pharmacist and you need to do it quickly Foyet do not stay in one place very long then kevin need to stay what sir kevin be an amazing analyst I can work almost twice as fast Fine with he run part of my system Garcia now long these be your screen I will know once I get into it we be go to work the geographic profile call I when you have something and hurry uh ok I be go to start with the ultram no you be go to start with the ultram and naproxen I will work on the rest there be approximately 115 mile between fredericksburg and westminster why mail a letter from 2 city maybe it be purely a forensic countermeasure he know that mail letter close to home would lead we right to he so he drive far away to mail the letter to throw we off his scent the unabomber do that so do the 2001 anthrax suspect he could have go anywhere but he be troll the d c area it make sense to stay close to hotch he stick around boston to watch shaunessy deteriorate not that you be it be all right I know he be be watch I it be part of the reason I step down so he would think I be fall apart Naproxen be available in generic brand over the counter Naproxen 's property can be simulate by aleve Ultram can be substitute ok oxycontin Jeez he be on that too yeah and it be highladdictive and therefore regulate so there be no substitute for it I know the dea have a problem with it you can buy it on the street if you know where to go good point ok we be go to leave that off the list for now 'cause there be another way to get it next up Tapazole what be that uh it treat hyperthyroidism hey what be wrong with this guy anyway he stab himself a lot stab himself yeah so his body would have permanent internal damage work honey and he would need this prescription to regulate his heart rate keep down the palpitation and the tremor and there be no substitute for tapazole so if this be our miss link how do we find he Print out every person who be on this prescription within a 60 mile of both city the team will do the rest I be go to use your laptop ok so what be we go to do about the 2 city usually we need 3 different point to get an accurate geographic profile that be all we get right now Prentiss gaithersburg rockville D c alexandria Bowie annapolis where the hell be you foyet ok I and the boy find a thyroid medication that have no substitute over the counter you 've get to get it from a pharmacist but a lot of people be on it find the midpoint between the 2 city and isolate name in a 25 mile radius 153 name well he be not go to use his own name what kind of alias should we be look for he could have easily steal someone 's identity no he be a narcissist in love with his own mythology he would use a name connect with the case a victim maybe a cop ok let us check the foyet file for a list of name and nothing wait a minute guy foyet like thing to have meaning to he the eye of providence the address in blood he write on the bus that lead we back to he maybe he be do the same thing with the alia like an anagram or something you see something reid not yet Reid he name himself the reaper Peter rhea there be a peter rhea in arlington Rossi we find he once the team locate George foyet 's potential apartment why do not the bau enter immediately Agent rossi hmm I ask you a question Gold be still go up but know when to get out that be the trick turn off recorder what be you do what be the point of all this erin why so this never happen again there be nothing a bureaucrat can do to make sure that something like this never happen again so we just wait for the next bloodbath turn on recorder why do you wait so long before go to foyet 's apartment we have to be sure he be there if we go in and he be not he would

they can not be call we in not tonight I be on it we can not go we have to I will get Rossi talk to Strauss tell she to send another team there be no other team available Nashville 's call we in second body in 2 week both kill on consecutive friday night they realize they be up against the clock and they be hope we might find something they do not guy I be sorry but we just got call in we have to go call I if you need anything take care of your son Thanks you go to be ok I will see you when you get back where we love be home home that our foot may leave but not our heart Oliver Wendell Holmes two woman dead in two week both kill in their own home and no sign of force entry floor be cover in rose petal quite the romantic Evidence of sexual assault none both woman be last see leave their office on a friday and never show up to work on a monday it be thursday why be we only be call in now the second body be only find yesterday there may be a socio economic pattern emerge the first victim Bethany Heminger live in Belle Meade Melissa Johnson in Brentwood both be affluent neighborhood yet there be nothing missing from either home what do these woman do for a live Bethany be a defense attorney Melissa a corporate executive two brunette with similar feature in high powered profession that be not a coincidence these woman most likely represent someone he know all right so we need to figure out where this unsub be meet his victim and how he be gain access to their home and if he be stay on pattern most likely this guy have pick out his next target we should check gardener housekeeping staff pool attendant floral shop see if anyone work both home start work up a paper trail Garcia find out where these woman be in the day lead up to each murder like a genie in a bottle poof all right Prentiss you and I be go to go check out the Johnson crime scene Rossi you and Reid talk to the coroner start work up victimology jj talk to the family and staff and find a connection we can use I understand that all of our thought be with Hotch but right now I need we all to focus on this case we have less than a day before this unsub will strike again let us finish this thing fast you must be the FBI Landon Kaminski Agent Jareau we speak on the phone it be nice to meet you the mayor be on my ass two prominent woman kill on my watch and everyone know we be brace for a third well let us hope that do not happen where would you like we to set up in here I be go to need to issue a statement with the press every woman in Nashville need to know there be a serial killer on the loose we need they take preventative measure to avoid become his next target the mayor think we should be as specific as possible every woman detective his first 2 victim may be from the same social class but if we isolate victimology this soon it may cause he to go outside of his own comfort zone and then he will be even hard to track Better to stress hypervigilance and shut down his victim pool completely do not you think yes ma'am well the house have a security system but her friend say that she only use it when she travel out of town he kill the dog hide it in a storage container in the garage she probably think he be protection enough that be her first mistake she have all the precaution to avoid home invasion she just do not use they properly these be the print that match the other crime scene it look like he do not hesitate to get they everywhere which typically would indicate that he be disorganized this crime scene scream of organization the rose the dog he be a stranger to these woman he do not talk his way in he be lay in wait and he know his print would not show up in the system he have no prior which mean he be smart and most likely educate this guy know exactly what he be do and he make sure he have enough time to do it so he know when she would leave the house and when she would return he be stalk they it be only the victim 's print on the exterior doorknobs nothing on the window the garage be not force so how do he get in defensive wound on both woman more so on the late victim she fight back the hard no ligature mark they be not bind so how do he keep they from run out maybe he block the escape route or maybe the threat of a knife be enough I might be able to answer that the stab wound be not the only injury what do you mean Melissa Johnson have a concussion Bethany Heminger a broken rib an initial assault to prove his dominance make sure they be too scared to try and escape something else you should see both their stomach content be the same Chicken broccoli pasta salad and red wine he be play out a fantasy one he have to control he set the scene with flower petal and wine and then he cook for they their last supper so he cook and he clean up after himself why do he leave the petal trail it be get to mean something our guy he be not just relive a fantasy he be repeat it it be the same routine the same meal it be not just routine it be proper etiquette what take a look at this there be a handprint in the center back of this chair right here he pull this chair out for himself over here there be handprint

even vet delivery people and utility worker Garcia do you have anything there be no hit on the print at all but I do what sir derek there ask and I create a paper trail there be no cross over between the two victim themselves in the wee lead up to their murder but they do run in similar circle how do you mean they both have country club membership though to different club they go to upscale restaurant private concert venue posh hotel they enjoy a high class highfalutin lifestyle an expensive one a lifestyle he would fit right into this g be educate intelligent proper he be a downright gentleman the rose petal send a pretty specific message he be romancinghem whether they want it or not he be get the social skill to back it up hey Garcia take a look at date service and social networking site look for work professional and privileged elite check check and checker back in a smidge we need more have we figure out how he be get into these home no sign of force entry anywhere yet he be still gain access to their home long before the victim ever get home from work I mean this guy need time to cook and set up his scene he be either get a key or he can move through wall we need fresh eye all right listen up I want everybody to go back to the hotel and try to get some rest we be go to have to pick this up again in the morning we be give up no we be go to take a break we

full pension and benefit be say that you want I to leave the B A u well obviously that be your choice but I be offer you a way out Agent Moan 's promotion be temporary but he be exceed our expectation and I be confident that I could make it permanent if you decide to step down the team would be together and you could be with your son and when would you like a decision I think I would be leavI with one what be your hesitation I would just like to weigh all of my option whatever you need we believe our unsub be already with his next victim if he match pattern she will be a successful woman probably brunette early 30 to mid 40 she will be at home in Nashville 's upper echelon this mea that he fit in Herives the right car he wear the right clothe he be highly intelligent he probably come from a place of status this guy 's sociable and he be endear you would never suspect that this man be capable of murder but he will do whatever it take to protect the fantasy that he be try to relive it be this fantasy which fuel his drive he be recreate a romantic evening and repeat it with each of his victim he most likely recently have a relationship take away from he so look at man who have lose love one or have go through a messy divorce but like bundy these woman be representation of that first loss Bundy pick victim who have similar feature to the woman that abandon he and we believe that our unsub be do the exact same thing these woman be cfident successful and strong and they fight back which mean he have the ability to overpower they fairly easily he believe or fantasize he be in a relationship with these woman no matter how fleeting the initial interaction be it be everything to he an invitation our technical analyst have compile a list of location that the victim visit prior to their death these be high class establishment we be go to want to visit the same place so look for man who fit the profile but also woman who match victimology if somebody be be pay a little too much attention to they talk to they get a read then jot their name down so that we can check they out all right folk pick up your canvass assignment and get to work thank you the rain 's suppose to clear up today it be go to be in the high 50 what do you want to do today there be a lot of good movie ple at the green hills mall you want to go see something why do not we stay inside today maybe watch a dvd I want to go on a real date Joe I think after we make love last night you would realize how much you mean to I do not you trust I Joe who be that I have no idea Erika Honey it be I you home get a surprise for I baby Erika Grant help why do you have a key run get upstairs go go go Grant Grant why do you have a key no Grant no no no Grant no hey Erika sweetie why do he have a key why do he have a key House belong to an Erika Silverman project director in an international design firm we be assume the male victim be her boyfriend Grant Franklin Male victim they be both pretty beat up we will need dental record for a positive I D who call it in Ups guy need she to sign for a package the door be wide open we get he out back jj talk to he where 's Erika Silverman 's body he change his m o multiple stab wound to the face and neck Classic overkill and evidence that she have sex before she die force or consensual no evidence of sexual assault she play along she have sex th the unsub because she think it would keep she alive so why do not it this kill be personal angry she do not give he everything that he want what else do he want the dinner dish be wash but the breakfast plate be not he do not cln up this time the boyfriend must have surprise he and disrupt his routine I do not know I would say he come pretty close to finish it it look like they watch a movie have an early breakfast she be with he all night hey Garcia Bad news buttercup Great what be it no payoff on the social networng site and this Erika Silverman person do not leave a breadcrumb like trail aside from a couple of online purchase and some automatic debit she have not use her credit card all week all right thank so Garcia could not find anything about erika silverman 's whereabout over the past week no store no restaurant nothing Thermay actually be another way to figure out where she be be do we know where any of the victim ' car be as far as I know they be in impound we need access to all 4 of they 4 we should also get grant franklin 's car he may have drive erika somewhere where she meet the unsub there have to be something in the victimology if Grant Franklin have not come home when he do Erika would probably still be alive so how do the unsub miss he it say he be out of town last week visit family in Indianapolis still the violence of those kill indicate he know both victim 'cause the long victim be with the killer the more desperate the attack the unsub stab Erika Silverman 17 time in the face Grant Franklin 34 time to the face and genital it make sense the more he perfect his routine the more invest he become Detective Kaminski have your man have any luck canvass the victim ' last known whereabout none I be think of pull they off for the night that be a mistake why be that the vic 's dead if he stick to the pattern we 've get another week before he strike again because he be never get this far before he be desperate to ay out his fantasy a man like this be not go to stick to any timetable he be go to try to finish this tonight jj we need you on the news Narrow victimology let people know that he be out there right now I be on it we still do not know where he be find his victim but we do know that Erika Silverman live in green hill that be 3 point and we finally have our geographical comfort zone it be a good bet the unsub lis somewhere in this area and Erika be our key to figure out where they meet oh man pancake for dinner be there anything well no ere be not hey Jack who be these guy this be you and this be the bad guy they be fight who win Jack daddy no one beat daddy hey Jack Aunt Jessica 's almost get dinner ready I forget what do we do before we eat wash our hand good job come on daddy he build those himself I hope it be ok of

with Jack for Haley Garcia 's get something I be a real genius 'cause this be what I di I take the travel log from the GPS system overlay their route again the geographical profile to reveal what the paper trail could not which be while Erika Silverman be the only victim who do not visit a private club a concert or go to a fancy restaurant in the day lead upo her death she do spend a couple of hour at cheekwood botanical garden on tuesday Garcia do either of the other victim go to the park no I do not know if it be relevant then it be when her navigation system read in a straight line to

lead and prentiss be recanvasse with detective Kaminski Good then wcan talk Rossi it be his team I be not go to stand in the way of that it might not come to that what do you mean Strauss offer he retirement he will never accept it do not be so sure this job cost he his wife it cost he that a long time ago which be why he will not let it cost he his son what do you think he will do it do not matter what I think what matter be whether you will be willing to step down if he come back or step up if he do not I be go to do whatever Hotch need I to do he be lose enough hey Rossi you mind come here for a second I want to throw something at you we profile that our unsub recently experience a loss as well a love one probably a brunette who run in the same circle as his victim right what if love be not the only loss I mean we assume that because our unsub could so easily navigate our victim ' upscale world that he most likely share the same financial resource as his victim because of his upbringing his sophisticated behavior but that behavior be ingrain in he it be habit it something he would have learn as a child not as an adult if he do not have financial independence but be still try to keep up his social status he would be hemorrhage fund we 've be look at this the wrong way Rossi we vet the maid the gardener the pool cleaner anyone who have access to the house but who else might go unnoticed in a privileged society Garcia here Garcia check employee record at each of the venue the victim visit in the week prior to their death look f man spend beyond their mean a guy who

I will get an officer and jj yeah you want schrader 's face everywhere Schrader be a bank robber now he be murder a woman kidnap his daughter and kill a cop he be obviously more sophisticated than we originally think he be get a big plan it be not just about get his daughter and flee the country we never profile that he would have a partner we do not know this guy at all got to admit you be well

schrader pull a series of bank heist in the 1990 he be the only one to ever go away for the crime he be a model prisoner only serve 11 of his 15 year be release early on good behavior and any friend he have be either dead or still in prison a 3 ton truck be find north of the accident not too far from canada we have the heavy presence at border crossing he probably know that I do not think he be go to sit still for long he might have to depend on how injure he be Rossi what do we know Dale schrader go to prison for robbery he be hand off all of his crime be impersonal 2 day after he be release he kill stacy ryan and he kidnap his daughter it be both personal and emotional when he be not attach to the crime he pull it off but the minute he be invest like with his daughter he let his guard down and gets catch it make sense so he be not the hard ass we think he be but if jenny be what he want he have her he could have leave yeah we think he take she and run to canada right that theory make sense why do not he picture from the accident any word on emily apparently she be argue with the doctor that be good this take a lot to pull off what if he be get a group of guy to call on I agree all those bank job be a solo but this be a lot for one man to orchestrate Jj figure out why he kill stacy ryan we have not find any connection to schrader but he may be connect to the partner how kill she might have be advance payment for break he out of custody Garcia I need everything you 've get on stacy ryan what do you mean he get away somebody break he out of custody oh god we be go to keep the two of you here there be go to be an officer stand watch the entire time if you can not find he how long will you keep we safe Ma'am we will find he you do not know dale when he want something he get it can you think of anyone at all who might want to help he he do not trust anybody it be not necessarily about trust maybe somebody who be indebted to he and he be try to collect on it I do not know Jenny you and your dad be alone the entire time nobody be in the truck or the cabin nobody who would do this for dale who would risk everything to help he that be what we need to find out Stacy ryan have two time in her life when she be high and when she be wait to get high the only thread I have between they be that her brother spend time with schrader upstate like 5 year ago why would schrader kill a junkie it do not make sense where be the brother now Dead it do not feel like schrader do anything randomly stacy must have mean something to he Garcia yeah but what never mind I see she I can take she from here thank Thk you I can walk sit I like push you around chuckle do it hurt if by it you mean my entire body then yes ok so the partner see everything in the wood he run away and steal a truck who be this guy he know you be take that road back to the station he wait for you and he crash into you this whole thing feel meticulous ok so he need the partner for something else for what though well I do not know I mean he be lock up all this time he plan the whole day he should have have backup plan for his backup plan his ex should not have be home for a few hour so he clearly have enough time to get across the border with jenny until we show up but he stay local hole up in that cabin he have what he want he could have just run there be get to be something else keep he in lockport I could not stop he from choke bunt Emily do not do that he be right there Schrader 's face be all over the news he be be on the run for almost 2 hour and we be no close to catch he we need to find the partner hey Prentiss hey how be you I feel like I got hit by a truck here sit thank uh garcia tell everyone what you just tell I I have unearth more of schrader 's past now what we do know be that he rob 15 bank in the state of new york in the ninety however what your resident glamou r puss smarty pant just find out be that most of that money be never recover Reid where be it my good guess only he know Rossi good reason to stick around lockport Jj the last robbery the one that put he away should have be routine right so what happen Morgan maybe someone turn he in Garcia he keep to himself always work alone who would turn he in we be miss somebody Garcia yes check sir what be this all about nothing to do till morning chuckle what be your problem Hesitation put obstacle in the path Boldness eliminate they Boldness strike fear fear create authority the 48 law of power you know it you want to shoot I have I say thank yet ok Records lead up to schrader 's arrest show this other bank robber name dan otey and he be look at copious amount of time then he strike a deal and all of a sudden schrader be arrest it can not be a coincidence you know it be not uncommon for criminal to buy job off one another maybe that be what schrader do but dan otey sell he out for a less sentence it do not make sense Otey be a rat and now he be the partner yeah you be right Schrader would not trust he if anything he would want he dead probably but he would use he first he would tell otey that he owe he one and that he might save his life if he help he get out of this jam where be he now garcia uh dan otey be a local he live off of route 7 nobody 's here let us go be your daddy home who be you man close the door do not do this Calm down I be just go to scare he a little bit hey

what be you do Mom Mommy no do not take my kid Mom Mommy Mom help stop Mom no sob mom so how do schrader get this guy to sign on good people do bad thing I be just say it happen right but this partner would not let I die he protect otey 's family in the same day he help a convict felon escape custody his loyalty be all over the place the guy sound desperate maybe he need some money I mean schrader 's get a lot of it still out there he could have promise he a cut ah I do not know he be an accomplice to 3 murder and a kidnapping be there enough money out there for you to sign on to something like that so it be something big than the money um maybe schrader 's threaten he Leverage it would have to be big we catch schrader because he kidnap his daughter he be emotional and his guard be down clearly family mean more to he than we think Schrader 's ex wife force he to give up custody of jenny maybe he want this guy to know what it feel like to lose his family too it sound like revenge to I maybe it be you know what I just do not get why people think you be a hero I know something they do not you want to be just like I honest man bear you they be too predictable and you would rather die than be ordinary so you take risk and you push the limit but you be raise to be a good guy it be in your blood you can not help it but that kill you a little bit that be why you have to figure out a way for a good guy to be bad and that be how you get into my world be I close I want to talk to they you get your message and that picture how do I know you have not kill they already you have to trust I Whew well I be disappoint but your wife and your kid be go to be devastate 'cause they do not have to die look you be go to kill I there be no point in hurt they what kind of father be you we 've be over this I be the only one who know where they be as long as I be alive they be safe if you stop help I they be dead how be that anything on schrader 's case the usual suspect judge lawyer they be all account for this morning if it be revenge then it be get to be someone who put he away well it be not the officer who arrest he or the judge who sentence he then who be it Garcia I need the name of every law enforcement agent involve in the schrader case you know everybody yeah but I want every single employee the year that he be arrest ok give I a minute Morgan a whole minute come

have anyone retire yeah two of they Let us see matt massey jeff messick both married with kid white in their 50 Prentiss wait can I see those picture no no Ohh why would not he go after one of the officer who arrest he it make the most sense for revenge hey wait a minute guy listen to this there be a witness who never testify on schrader 's behalf Schrader could see that as a betrayal he get out of prison and use he to get what he want Garcia I want you to run a history on a witness from the schrader case Joey short Joey short be bear in ' 66 in nyc do not hold a lot of job except for

around the same age look for academy graduate in the early ninety ok do any of they not go into police work Baby I do not follow you if he go undercover then anything tie to the academy would have to be sever I mean the guy graduate be he have to immediately start work his history as joey short he go into construction make his contact in the bank robbery world and then he meet schrader earn

to I appreciate that I really do good night good night Joe what be your 20 almost do with round just check the carousel you need some backup I be fall asleep here no but could you leave a cupful of coffee in the pot anyone back here this be private property I be go to give you 5 second to come on out Funny Don I be a man of simple pleasure and that be one of they what be you do back here switch out a timing belt what be you do back here Thought I see someone mess around Nah it be just I it be not you turn it off what turn it off what Ed go ahead you need to send that backup I see checkmate in 5 what do you see I see it in 3 we 've miss you out here thank you thank I uh I have to take a little break how come I use to play with a co worker friend of mine he be probably the good mind I ever go up against one day he just decide that he do not want to play anymore so you give up too just the opposite I attempt to play through every permutation of move on a chessboard that be an infinite number of game it be not infinite it be just it be exponentially large you could not have play through they all there be an average of 40 move per chess game and I will tell you something the more I play the more I realize that every single match every single chess game be really just a simple variation on the exact same theme you know it be aggressive opening patient mid game inevitable checkmate and I realize why my friend quit he be tired of repeat the exsame pattern and expect a different outcome so you have a lifetime of chess strategy in your head and you be just sit on it I still use it I just uh I apply it differently I have to go it be good see you Rita Stuart 25 second victim in Atlantic City pretty public spot for a dump site you know technically I think it would qualify more as a disposal site you do not leave a body on a merry go round out of convenience he take some time with her appearance do not he her nail be polish her hair be cut clothe be brand new want she to look her good when find that be a lot of remorse who be victim number one Stacia Jackson 29 she be find at a local playground a change in victimology what be the connection between these woman there be none Rita be marry Stacia be single Rita work at a diner Stacia be a corporate lawyer accord to their credit card they never come within 10 mile of each other both woman be take 2 month ago yeah they live such completely different life the police do not tie their abduction together until now be there any evidence of sexual assault there be no evidence of violence of any kind so how do they die Rita have a stroke Stacia have a brain hemorrhage look at this the unsub give they a battery of drug Atracurium Doxacurium these be neural inhibitor they block signal from the brain to the muscle he put they in medical coma for 2 month actually they be not in a coma you would need phenobarbital to keep they unconscious and they do not have that so wait a minute these victim be paralyzed but they be still conscious they could open their eye hear probably even feel stimulation physical immobility but mental awareness this unsub want total domination over they and he turn their body into prison to do it Mildred Lisette Norman write anything you can not relinquish when it have outlive its usefulness possess you and in this materialistic age a great many of we be possess by our possession keep woman in a conscious paralysis read as sadism definitely dehumanize reduce they to object but there be nothing else about this profile that take we down that path these woman be find in excellent condition there be no evidence of bed sore they be well feed through an I v his access to I V S and drug he almost certainly have medical training be we sure this be a he the care this unsub show these victim although they be dehumanize the profile say female what about the postmortem pose that be a lot of dead weight for a woman to carry these woman be petite they be under 100 pound all right if we reconsider the gender of the profile what change nothing if anything it fit well man kill to fulfill a sexual compulsion woman do not you see this in angel of mercy killer like Genene Jones and Amy Archer they do not care about race or hair color it be man that do damn straight man do well hello red look at you guy what do you find out about the clothing the unsub 's dress the victim in at first only that both garment be make from chiffon but with the wonder twin power of the Atlantic City police and my impeccable eye for fashion we have also determine that these garment fit ridiculously well they be super flattering to each victim 's exact measurement kind of exactly like the unsub whip they up herself maybe that be what connect the victim how so maybe she be not just kill petite woman because they be easy to abduct and pose but because of a physical type she want a body type sewing clothe for a specific size of woman please tell I she be not kill these woman because she need human model I mean there be get to be more to it than that there probably be but at least we have a start on the victimology Prentiss and Morgan I want you to interview the victim ' family talk to they about lifestyle choice any body image issue these woman may have have Reid go to Rita Stuart 's autopsy see if the drug point to any specific medical training the unsub might have have Dave and I will go to the disposal site Sir I want you to check missing person report for the last 2 month see if any abduction match what we know we need to find out if the unsub 's already take another victim Agent Jareau Detective Marty Cotrone hi these be ssas Morgan and Prentiss be you able to contact the family they be already here do they bring the picture we ask for yeah they be pretty confused by that and to be honest so be I Agent Morgan I do not understand how do what my daughter look like have to do with the monster who kill she we think the unsub be look for a physical type Fit but petite this be her this be my wife do Rita work out stay in shape Sure I guess she go to the gym at least 3 time a week Stacia take pride in every aspect of her appearance in what way you know her clothe it be her clothe she love to shop it look like she have kind of a bohemian streak go on yeah what be her favorite place to shop high end boutique expensive one certainly and dress to fit she be tiny everything have to be take in so she would look her good would you mind write down some of her favorite place to go so these be mostly consignment and thrift shop that be really all we could afford do she ever have these clothe alter tailor to fit she well I never really pay attention would she ever have wear something like that would she ever wear anything like that no Dave can you hear that yeah she be pose her victim in a place that represent innocence and childhood Most serial killer do not have a particularly happy childhood my guess be she want they to have the fun she never get to have let us think about how she be do this practically how be she get they from her car to the carousel she be move a body in the middle of the night she need to make condition as favorable as possible so she would need a vehicle that afford her privacy a van or an suv that be still a lot of ground to cover once she park even if these woman be light she risk getting catch carry a corpse if she have a medical background what if she use a wheelchair something that would help she move they quickly and if she have a wheelchair that mean her van have a lift which would be helpful to unload a body which also mean she have a handicap placard which would give she the close place to park I will have Garcia pull all vehicle with handicap registration thank Dave once I have the knee bend I can get leverage under her normally an assistant help I but I can do it by myself if I need to I be assume the unsub would have this training too let I ask you this be there anything specific about it no any caregiver out there can do this Docs nurse orderly where do you think she be get the drug that she be use do you think she could be manipulate a doctor or a pharmacist maybe he would be criminally negligent if she be but it be possible I mean doctor order thing through resident nurse forge signature prescription fall through crack that be a lot of drug and a lot of crack she keep these woman paralyze for 2 month your report say both of they have hair extension clip in yes to hide the fact that clump of their real hair have fall out but if they be feed through I V S that be not from malnutrition right you see this a lot in bedridden patient Loss of motor function especially in a young woman like this of course psychic shock yeah the mental effect take a physical toll one last question in your professional opinion do you think the hair extension be clip on before or after death before and you seem pretty certain of that you know the old wife ' tale about your hair and nail grow after death what be really happen be that dehydration be shrink your skin pull it back base on where she put these extension they be definitely still alive now we know this unsub be stick in a rich fantasy right an incredibly detailed delusion we do not know what the delusion be but we know that it involve remake these woman and it begin the moment she have they drug so she have they paralyze and she can do whatever she want why be she kill they well I do not think she mean to the brain be a machine design to respond to stimulus if you keep the brain awake but the body immobile it break down lose its hair after 2 month it eventually stroke out so death be not this unsub 's goal it be an unfortunate side effect exactly what have you find out both Rita Stuart and Stacia Jackson be clothe hound but because they be petite woman they have a lot of their stuff alter could be how our unsub be find her victim she get her hand on their measurement but we already exhaust tailor alteration shop there be no overlap the tailor might send specialty item out to third party dig deep into extend employment record and see who they might be subcontract to Garcia need to talk to we go ahead Garcia hello my prettie I have finish my miss person sweep I 've get nothing on the medical vehicle but 2 new match on the clothe make the woman front Cindy Admundson she be abduct outside a thrift store and maxine wynan be last see at the hillridge mall that sound like our girl any surveillance footage at the mall no it be an outside parking lot so sorry the new abductee what be their physical type they look pretty tiny to I I be go to send you picture also if it please the court I would like to direct your attention to exhibit a the calendar map what about it both of these new victim be abduct one week ago exactly one day before the body of Rita Stuart and Stacia Jackson respectively turn up she do not let a body go until she have a replacement thank you so much excuse I do you need some help the ramp 's break you want I to call a tow truck I just need to get the chair in the van and then I can go home well we could load it you think Sure we will put it in the back go on in you pull I will lift ok one two three do we need to lock the wheel or anything like that you be so pretty Victim be mary newsome abduct 2 month ago she be find on this bench first thing this morning ok well it look like her style it be chiffon and it be sew to fit if she be disposed of this body it mean she be recently take a new victim we will call hotch we will comb through miss person report from the last 48 hour I will pull they thank you what these be not hair extension maybe her hair be too brittle maybe I do not know you know what this be a wig Kanekalon I think what be that synthetic hair there be nothing special about it it be use in wig all over the world but look at this be those stitch on her scalp she sew this in yeah Wallace I get it thank you hey I think we find who be take last night her name be Bethany Wallace her husband say she never come home from the dry cleaner where she stop off to pick up some clothe anybody at the cleaner see anything the employee be busy lock up but they do mention that they do farm out work to tailor who work from home Good we can match record base on who work on Bethany 's clothe we just get the picture of the 2 recent abduction from Garcia Line up the photo of the new victim next to the body they replace that might help we with the timeline you guy see this yeah she be match up the victim physically one to one she be a collector we be ready to give the profile the unsub we be look for be a woman she be a collector it be a psychopathology similar to hoard so when we say collector we be not talk about stamp or baseball card it be not what your kid or even you might pursue as a normal hobby this be an attachment to object that be become obsessive by someone who be antisocial and extremely introverted these people attach a part of themselves to their collection if you try to separate they from it or take it away from they they will react violently even psychotically they 've suffer damage to their prefrontal cortex that be the part of the brain that regulate basic freudian fantasy reality they can still function like drive a car go to work even do their taxis in fact she excel at goal orient job like the precision of sewing or the detail of abduction but they 've lose their ability to categorize the difference between live and dead uh belong and loss that have be irreparably destroy so what be she collect woman actually we think she be collect doll technically replace they we believe that she lose the original sometime within the last 3 month and this be what serve as her stress room she search for a replacement and when she could not find they she start abduct the close possible surrogate woman of different ethnicity but of similar physicality the drug induce parasis be part of the fantasy she put her victim in a position where they can not talk back so she can fetishize they like the object she be lose look I respect your analysis but this woman kidnap 6 woman and kill 3 of they and you be tell we this be about doll this unsub stitch a wig onto the scalp of her late victim it be a technique use to attach hair to porcelain doll and keep in mind collector and serial killer do share certain trait a lot of serial killerstake tro attach the same significance to they that this collector do to object but this unsub 's intent be not violence she need this collection to be complete so sheaneel in control of her life probably to overcome some trauma she experience she really only feel that control when the collection be complete which be why she be repeat an abduction pattern with live victim if she lose a doll or in this case if she lose a woman who represent a doll she have to replace it this woman work alone we know she have medical training look for nurse 's aide or orderly who we fire for a lack of social grace she can not fake a bedside manner we believe she be currently work as a tailor or a seamstress and we be follow those lead now but do let we know if you notice any overlap in your suspect pool thank you of course I remember Ms Jackson we be all sad to hear what happen do you ever farm out tailor job someone who might have do this no to be perfectly honest we would not even sell something so date let I take a look where do you get this why do you see something look at this lockstitch it be a handkerchief pattern you see this on silk sew handkerchief and it be all do by hand so this be her signature this be unique to her I could not do it not even with a machine if there someplace that specialize in handcraft sewing like this I will tell you this much though she be be at it a long time this woman be an artist Hotch this be Bethany Wallace 's sband karl we bring he in for question do you know where my wife be we be search for her sir no you have to find she in the next 24 hour Bethany be a diabetic look agent Prentiss say that the woman who take she have medical training so Bethany could have a chance what she keep her victim in a drug induce state they can not communicate these these drug will they we do not know but we be do everything we can everyone this be Sally be nice to her so doctor if a diabetic be give this battery of drug to keep she paralyzed what would the reaction be diabetic metabolize everything they consume differently food drink drug it all gets break down to blood sugar at vary rate most likely this patient seize up minute after she be medicate so she be already dead probably although there be another possibility Bethany 's condition could break down the drug fast than the other victim she could regain control of her body every hour that she do not turn up be a reason for hope we be still run out of time if the drug do not kill Bethany she be not go to last long without insulin look collector be good honest people just because you enjoy doll do not make you a freak or a pedophile we appreciate that sir but the woman that we be look for have lose her ability to control her obsession she be kill 3 woman try to recreate a type of doll she have as a child describe the line to I well there be a pattern to the victim they be in their 20 and they be petite Most doll line revolve around infant be she dress they like baby no she be not their wardrobe consist of chiffon dress wear by one blond woman a redhead and a black woman the dress be she sew they herself how do you know that it be the valois line local company back in the late eighty probably when our unsub be prepubescent they promote feminism and multiculturalism strong independent girl from different background who could still be friend Reid Birth certificate to fill out a form to describe their life and a kit to sew your own clothe JJ say she be be at it for a while she be probably be sew since she be a little kid wait a minute Sir what be this contest that they hold that be to see who could come up with the most imaginative doll sew a dress write an essay to describe she if you win the contest you would have your doll feature in next year 's line I assume that do not end well do it no it do not it be a classic tool child psychologist use tell I a story with these doll when the company get essay with thinly veil reference to physical or sexual abuse they turn the entry form and the doll over to the police the publicity kill the line you say the company be local right they might still have the clothe in evidence how be the essay go make for some pretty depressing reading Prentiss be have a good time these doll be all like little time capsule only the eighty fashion be not so kind to they I be surprised how many little girl know how to make shoulder pad how be it go on your end I get a list of vendor the victim go to tailor seamstresse that sort of thing hey jj you say something about a handkerchief hem right that be exactly like what she sew for her victim what be the name on the entry Samantha Malcolm she be on my list wait a minute guy I have her essay around here somewhere right here sally do not like the room with the lightning that can not be good ok guy I just get Samantha Malcolm 's medical record and oh my god she be doom like emily bronte doom like shakespeare doom like red shirted ensign in Star Trek doom what happen to her oh uh sorry uh well for the first 10 year nothing and then she start a battery of electroshock treatment at 10 who subject a child to ect that would be her father Dr Arthur Malcolm he run an inpatient mental health facility for troubled young people call new life at first the essay that Samantha write raise some flag but her father explain that the therapy be to deal with the recent death of her mother after that he start she on a serious regimen of anti psychotic drug which he wean she off of a few year ago it explain her familiarity with medication where be she now uh her father declare her incompetent so he be still the legal guardian everything be in his name and all of her record list new life as her residence she could not keep victim in an inpatient facility she need privacy Garcia what about real estate holding in her father 's name just his own but new life have a bunch of outpatient and halfway house all over town JJ where do she work I have she place at 3 different shop around town all right let us split up and cover the shop and the facility I want to go to new life whether or not she be there I want to talk to the father there be literally hundred of therapy to help kid through loss Electroshock be not one of they take Rossi be nice to each other see you later we be leave Phone no no I be very confused gentleman what do this have to do with Samantha we need to talk to she be she here no she be at work do she live here or do you move she into one of your halfway house as a matter of fact she be in one of my house well we will need the address and I will need to know what this be about she might be tie to a series of abduction that be not possible it be not my daughter be Samantha on her own at this house there be no other patient right she think that be good and I agree yeah but let us face it you be happy that she be out of your hair I beg your pardon because if you have be visit she recently doctor you would know what she be be do Samantha have always be trouble 3 woman be dead because of her she be not capable of that be you certain I mean the effect of electroshock especially at that age be permanent but maybe you know that my wife die when Samantha be 10 and she never recover I try everything child psychiatry pet therapy nothing help she be cut herself she be in pain that be the end of this meeting where be your daughter doctor and agent Rossi if you try to talk to her a mentally ill woman without her know what she be do do you know about the woman she be keep and have no medical or legal counsel present you will have no case do you understand I None we will keep the police here in case Samantha drop in for a visit let us go Reid Hey a really fast question why be these toy here I use they in my therapy no I understand that but why be they way up on this shelf away from where any kid can actually reach they they be reminder of patient that I 've help let I ask you something what be the name of the girl you help with this one Jenny Larson and this one what be the name of the girl you help with this one Abigail Moore how about this one Linda Krauss these girl be what they be like 9 9 or 12 year old I be assume my ph d be on the effect of trauma on prepubescent girl I do not appreciate what you be imply oh I be not imply anything I be make an inference an inference be an educate guess and base on that I form a hypothesis for instance my hypothesis here be that after you rape your daughter you submit she to electroshock treatment to make sure she stay quiet this be outrageous and then out of guilt you buy her toy more specifically you buy she a line of doll because that be what serial molester do they give gift so you continue the pattern with your other patient and once they leave your care you add their toy to your collection I be sorry you can not back up your story doctor this be why I love my job doctor because my lab it be a jury of your peer my test will be Jenny Larson Abigail Moore and Linda Krauss the D A will put they on the stand and I be go to personally bring these doll in and we be go to watch how they react or you could tell we where your daughter be and we will tell the d a you cooperate but once we walk out this door that deal come off the table 2529 Adams Street you will tell they right that I cooperate you want to knowow I figure you out those toy you take care of they these one you treasure but you know what the collection 's not complete where be they she be come back I have to put it back in no please please do not I be sorry do not leave I let we go I can not Samantha hi uh my name 's Spencer I be with the FBI I know what

hide the directory do not erase they what be it she be on a choke game site the night she die a what it be a game kid play where they choke themselves to get a buzz to get high they call it the good kid ' high you get lightheade and a sense of euphoria even though no actual drug be involve it be something kid in high school play do ryan have a computer not in his room what about a gaming system yeah he do teenager will find a way to get online I have the uh ip address that will help Bingo Ryan be on the same site on the same night it be not suicide Hang on this be a text to voice icon let us see what happens Come on try it we all do it I dare you I dare you someone be orchestrate this purposely get the kid to choke themselves make sure you close the door Tomorrow 's the big night we be all go to play the game there be a whole subculture around this game they make up name for it they do it at party but someone be dare these kid in this area to play the game it be a contest and there be rule come on evans high this be the big one Garfield edge out casper high last week you go to let they diss we Diss sound like a kid who else would pit school against each other reckless teenage competition the school that log the most high time this Friday win Friday tomorrow get your friend on board Practice make the high last long got to do it alone and video it with your webcam and upload it to the site for it to count do it alone require ligature he be basically encourage they to play the deadly form of the game with no one there to revive they Garcia shut the site down Sir I can totally do that but I do not think you want I to why right now this site be our only way to track the unsub and if I cut into it he will certainly know we be watch he in which case he will shut it down and he will write a simple change in code bring it back up in a more covert fashion plus there be no telling how many server it be replicate on anyway you be right we be ready to give the profile we believe the unsub responsible for these death may be a teenager he be a loner he do not participate in team sport or group activity he be withdraw very low self esteem his only form of pure interaction be online he engage in activity that draw attention to himself yet isolate he from his peer Parents and teacher should watch out for the warning sign kid with bloodshot eye Marks on their neck severe headache disorientation in real life he consider himself a loser in cyberspace he can pull string make he feel powerful do this kid know that other kid be die because of he he be choke himself and dare other to do it so we be most likely look at reckless homicide here it you see anything that be unusual or suspicious just call the sheriff 's department and we will try to direct you as well we can thank you well we 've tell as many parent as we could do you think it help not as much as get through to the kid will two different mechanism strangulation and hyperventilation create the same effec t oxygen deprivation in the brain hey kid not a good idea let I see it what planet be this dude from he do not want we to win the contest I think the more accurate statement would be he do not want we to participate in the contest at all this be ryan 's desk right this be where ryan sit you guy remember ryan he play football take take shaunna to prom I be assume that some of you be probably even friend with ryan Ryan want to win the contest too but the way ryan choke himself he cut off all the oxygen to his brain which send a distress signal to his heart slow it down then his brain in an effort to preserve itself shut off all no n essential bodily function his arm give out his leg give out which mean he could not loosen the tie around his neck at which point panic set in and in ryan 's case it escalate to cardiac arrest which mean that his heart stop Brain damage begin and within 4 minute he be completely and totally brain dead he die scared and probably in a lot of pain and unable to stop what he think he have complete control of all because he want to participate in what I consider to be a pretty pretty lame game so I mean your text be actually completely accurate I do not want you to win the contest because I do not want you to play the game you all believe this crap you do not why do not you come up here and tell we what you think whatever kid stop you all right just relax let I go then stop fight let I go stop fight stop it let I go it be all right you ok yeah I be fine why would you run Morgan look at his neck let I look at your neck do not

virtually impossible to pull off make yourself appear old and more educated than you actually be there be actually 2 distinct writing style 2 writer use the same screen name one teen and one adult Christopher be be manipulate by an adult the mother 's death be a textbook case of munchausen by proxy Surreptitious poison the kid have be choke and revive on multiple occasion you say the father

that know that it be not intentional might bring some level of comfort it will definitely you go ahead good luck sheriff well thank you what be that it be call a star puzzle it be basically impossible to figure out you have to put all of the piece back together to form a perfect star but the origin of it be um kind of a romantic tale there be this young prince who want to win the heart of the fair maiden in the land so he climb to the top of the tall tower in the kingdom and he catch a fall star for her unfortunately he be so excited he drop it and it smash into all of these piece so he frantically put it back together again to prove his undying love to her and he succeed and they live happily ever after that do not make any sense what do you mean you can not catch a fall star it would burn up in the atmosphere yeah but it be not literal reid it be a fable but there be no moral fable have moral ok so it be just a romantic little story and the point be it be basically impossible to do because you have to take all of those piece and put they together exactly there be a lot to hate about you dr Reid play poker with he sometime try play chess with he or go hey Hey Coffee Thanks I just want to say thank you if you have not push it we would never have go Hotch J J you do not have to my sister give this to I when I be 11 she just come into my bedroom one afternoon

be see on camera out of all my case this guy be never flag as top priority but this murder change everything you be right to call we we will explain why everyone this be agent Russell Goldman from the San Diego White Collar Team you 've already meet agent Hotchner these be agent Rossi Morgan Prentiss and Reid a pleasure so we be work a white collar case not exactly I 've be follow a con artist for 5 year two night ago I think he kill someone Carla Marshall of Miami be find dead in her home Asphyxiation by strangulation she also have trauma wound to the head why do we think the con man kill she last week Carla contact a fraud website to report a scam the complaint end up on Goldman 's desk we speak on the phone at length her story match my guy to the t she plan on confront he that night I tell she to cease all communication and wait for I I would fly to Miami and set up a sting but that never happen do you have physical evidence confirm it be your guy no but for she to be murder the night that we speak I do not think it be a coincidence there be no sign of force entry theft or sexual assault and judge from the M o the motive be personal what be his hustle Investment fraud Basically he be a small madoff to give you an idea of how convincing he be this be a sampling of his work go back 14 year he be prolific he be scamme hundred of thousand of dollar from people but he be never be violent before Con man usually do not murder but when they do it be to conceal their crime Con man be a nice name for these guy they profile as psychopath they see their con as theater and themselves as a sort of puppeteer they have to have absolute control over their victim and their con maybe that be why he start kill because he lose control the question be how out of control be he if he be spiral he be a danger to everyone around he and because he be so charming the victim never see it come who do I make it out to Grant Dale Investments Inc Hunter Portland advisor incorporate Henry Moffet Hedge fund incorporate Henry Moffet Hedge fund Inc this be a lot of money it will be the good decision of your life Criminal Team http expert heberg forum net if I be what I have and if I lose what I have who then be I german psychologist Erich Fromm I can not believe you guy have your own jet we take turn pilot you want to give she a try really no what kind of forensic countermeasure do he use to hide his trail Fake I D S disposable phone prepay credit card foreign bank account you can not track his account overseas we can but it take month to get the record and it only take he second to transfer money again and again by the time you figure out it be in the Bahamas he be already move it to Switzerland or somewhere else I 've always be too far behind he well we be a lot close now because of Carla what make she suspicious in the first place she need to get her father into a retirement home and when she call this guy Grant Dale to free up her money he never return her phone call a con man 's first instinct be flight not fight what make he kill though be not financial it be psychological that be what we need to concentrate on why Carla and why now Morgan and Prentiss go to her house Agent Goldman why do not you join they I send his case file to the field office should not I stay with you and help you sift through they I would like to go through they independently come up with our own theory see if any behavioral pattern emerge that will help we get ahead of he Agent Goldman 's file be in that room down the hall thank you let I know if you need anything thank you you be kid I we have to go through all of this White Collar case often come down to a paper trail maybe it will not be so bad I mean at least it be well organized that be his job he sit at a desk all day and accumulate paper evidence ok Dave you work victimology Reid see if you can find anything in his travel pattern JJ let us get a timeline up on the board she be a real estate agent she be do well for herself until William come into her life why do you call he that he introduce himself as Bill Billy or will several time in his early con my guess be that his real name may be some form of William so most of his victim be very wealthy right you should see some of their mansion well I be look around this house and it be nice but no mansion she do not invest as much as his other client either I wonder why he target she she may have be useful to he in some other way hey Goldman what be the alia he be use with Carla Grant Dale Come check this out he set up a website why do not the detective find this before the local would not know to look for it well it be only one page generic investment information I mean there be no contact there be no picture of himself no just photo of nice car and house so he be sell the fantasy of success his web design be pretty basic I mean it be like a standard template it would be fairly easy to set up maybe he create other I be go to call Garcia Hey baby girl it be I you be on speaker Sug I do not care who hear it it be always be you listen I just email you a link get it it be the unsub 's website do you want I to find out how he pay for his host service track he down that way we will run into the same backstoppe trail you be right that be untraceable all right we will forget that can you do a search for website contain the same content and search and search there be 1 2 9 identical website same write content same picture just different name these be all new alias and he be never have 10 at once this be all new I be Henry Moffet you lie to I about everything what be you talk about your name be not Grant Dale God why be you do this to I just calm down listen to I No just leave you be not give I a chance to explain Leave or I will call the police Grant Grant Grant I be Henry Moffet Henry Moffet the CIA assign an agent 2 or 3 alias at most any more than that and it be difficult to keep the name straight this guy 's juggle 10 be all these people that be get to start fracture he somehow if his memory be strain it could be cause he to lose control we have the current alias we just need to know who the client be Got Carla 's phone record she make several call to an unknown number the night she die I track the number it be a disposable phone that have not be use since that be get to be the unsub 's number he toss it after he kill she over the past few month she routinely call this number really late at night how late like bedtime late you do not do business with your investment manager at bedtime so when be we go to do this again my husband 's come home so I will not see you for a while I will miss you you lie to I Grant about everything Leave or I will call the police Grant be you ok Henry be you ok I be go to miss you too so Carla never mention anything about an affair with he no but it be always be a challenge with fraud victim to be totally forthcoming they be so embarrassed about be dupe they do not tell you everything Detective Goldman we would like to compare note Shoot I be look at the victimology we say affinity group same thing it refer to victim with share interest ok we be in your world we will use your term your file point to specific affinity group he target in the first few city do this look accurate to you yes it do once he get beyond San Diego his victim be all over the place no share interest I come to the same conclusion so he stop use affinity group and find his victim somewhere else where I do not know that be where we start I be Randy Summerland I be Randy Summerland make we some money ok I can do that now how do I spell your name again M o f f e t Henry Moffet Hedge fund incorporate who be Henry Moffet who be Henry Moffet it be my partner you do not mention anything about a partner I do not and this be not who I make the check out to last time he be be my partner for year then why be I make the check out to he there be a simple explanation so the unsub and the vic be have drink the vic have a checkbook and pen out check 's date but that be it the unsub get that close to get his money somehow fail and then do this and this be overkill he bash his head in he be completely unhinged and devolve fast only he do not know that he be still try to go to work and he do not know he be in danger of lose it at any minute like a function alcoholic the unsub channel all of his energy into these con and when the con fall apart this be how he handle it how long have you know Randy we spend a lot of time with he in the last couple of month he be help we invest how much money do you give to he he just keep say we need to be aggressive in this market this be all my fault what do you mean I meet randy I bring this man into our life Mrs Mckelson be there anything more to your relationship with Randy we be go to find out eventually find out what Randy be not who he say he be Randy be not even his real name we think this man be use his look and his charm to target woman so there be other I lay in bed next to the man who kill my husband do they have transgression she be pretty beat up over it Randy who be Henry Moffet Daddy you be home good morning buddy let I look at you you be a handsome devil you know that I miss you I miss you too when do you get in just now how be your trip it do not really pan out sorry what happen can we uh talk about this after J D go to school I want pancake really you do well then pancake you shall have you be not enjoy this be you I like a good paper trail I find it meditative be it really that hard for you to be normal just one time he just burn another alia you know if this guy be on a mission to eliminate all these alias he be go to systematically assassinate his victim Carla live in Miami this victim frank Mckelson live north in Ft Lauderdale the victim could be anywhere in south Florida if he be work hard because of the economy it make sense that he would expand his operating zone Prentiss

be the third victim in 2 week in providence Rhode Island Captain he just return home 2 week ago he be a decorate war hero from his fourth tour in Iraq be he target because he be in the military no just like the first two victim he be target because he be convenient he be kill at a church during an early service Neck be cut open sever the carotid artery bleed out in a matter of moment right in front of his daughter Murder in a church be highly symbolic be there a religious agenda involve the detective on the case Jake Moreland rule that out because of the first two victim the first victim Mike O'donnell be find under a sink in the man 's room at a restaurant what kind of restaurant local place white tablecloth and jug wine the second victim Karen Lagrassa be kill at the laundromat all 3 have their throat slashe aside from MO the victimology 's all over the place it be like this guy do not care who he be kill and he be do it in public without compunction for who see he do we have a sketch all anyone can agree on be that it be a white male between 25 and 40 well that narrow it down to all of providence hard to fault the witness give how bloody these murder must be what bother I be the cool off period be get short and short with no attempt to hide who he be or what he be do I mean an unsub this bold could be suffer from a major psychotic break I already ask detective Moreland to pull recent release on prison and mental hospital we need to get to providence asap whether he be suffer a psychotic break or not this could be the start of a spree and anyone be a potential target Criminal Team http expert heberg forum net show I a hero and I will write you a tragedy F Scott Fitzgerald why be he use a knife gun assure the high number of fatality if all he be interested in be quantity he could be do this more efficiently he could be train Spree killer often to dry run before they start their rampage Most spree killer have lose control by the time they begin they be always male and if they do not fall into the school shooter category they be old 40 and 50 socially isolate the stressor 's usually the dissolution of their last social outlet George Hennard be inspire by James Huberty between the two of they they shoot 43 people at fast food restaurant well if he be practice for his mass murder he be definitely get bolder about it and bloody right now the shock and awe of the bloodletting seem to be what he be go for but soon that will not be enough that make sense with regard to his fantasy life if he be plan something big he will spend his day dream of it get back at slight both real and imagine without a specific target victim we need to concentrate on the crime scene and see what they tell we Prentiss you take the laundromat I will have detective Moreland meet you there I would like to take a look at the church if you do not mind jj you and Morgan interview captain Collins ' wife she get the good look at the unsub see what she remember Reid and I will run point from the police station Agent Rossi you must be father Kendellen thank you for come so quickly it be the ls t we can do father to be honest I 've be struggle to understand all this it be be try I do not like to see crime tape in front of church door I can not imagine how you feel Ash Wednesday 's next week these door should never be close to the community to be honest agent Hotchner when they tell I BAU be come I expect more than two agent the rest of the agent go straight to the crime scene I believe there will be information there that may determine where the unsub will strike next as soon as you can I would like you to meet agent Prentiss at the laundromat yeah sure any idea on where he may hit next we can double patrol it be honestly too early to tell well your gut must be tell you something well this far he be strike at a restaurant bathroom a laundromat and a church he choose his victim not out of preference but of favorable circumstance with each kill he be grow bolder tell we he do not care who see he so next time it will be even more public yes our technical analyst be compile a list of public event that your department should be monitor Garcia be you there wire for sound and ready for action what have you get so far well you get your sesame street on ice your Harlem globetrotter your beatle cover band not to mention the dozen of college bar and late night hangout frequent by the youth of America no event be too big or too small Good keep go aye aye cap'n no respect even now I do the talk no comment no comment no comment what be the FBI 's invol ment in the investigation no comment in the murder of captain Collins we be strictly here just to advise the providence police department be the Collins murder tie to the other two stabbing of last week and when they be ready to make their statement they will let you know thank you they 've be out there all day some of my friend want to come by they do not want to be on the 6 00 news your husband 's a hero unfortunately the circumstance of his death have cause this to be a medium circus well you would think they would show a little what do I tell you Sophia get away from the window be we go to be on tv not if I can help it go in your room and play I will be there in a sec I spend year wait for a phone call or one of those letter they use to hand deliver to dead soldier ' wife they want to know if I want to bury Paul at at Arlington but I do not have I know you have a job to do let us do this so it be do right that be what Paul would say what do you need to know it happen right here you tell the police you be not sure when the unsub walk in I do not know one ment he be not there and then he be all right let us walk through the mass you tell the police that you be late they come in during the first reading you know most of your parishioner on sight but not the unsub right I do not know how I could have miss he you know the Collins family personally right of course I mean Paul he grow up at this school whenever he come home he make sure to come to mass and they sit there in the back so as not to disturb the mass once they be settle could you see they then let yourself off the hook father if you could not see the Collins family you could not see the killer but he be definitely there by communion not before I do not remember all right Meg we can take a break if you need to take a break what be it sweetie I shake his hand when be that when we all say peace be with you and we shake hand I shake his hand that be right she be right during the sign of the peace he touch my baby he oh god he t he touch my baby Meg I know this be difficult but I want you to try and focus ok stay with I I need you to tell I what happen during communion we all get up who get out first Paul but he let I and Sophia go first Paul always go last we we take communion and we we go back and we uh that be ok we be almost do you be do great Paul be on your right Sophia be

go I need a break of course I want to stay here Meg might recall more and even if she do not what she be go through what be wrong this unsub be not psychotic and he be not go to go on a spree he be too patient ok but what be he try to accomplish I do not know get the stuff out all right I be fold I do not hear you approach you always talk to yourself Good if these machine be on I definitely would not hear you come up behind I Jake Moreland Providence P D Emily Prentiss Great can you do that again sure ok you come in through the back door slash my throat walk out there be no camera inside or outside of the building the same be true for all the crime scene which mean you be smart enough to plan for that in your attack but careless enough to drop a knife 10 foot after I cut you but you do not leave any fingerprint no he do that at all 3 crime scene Mass murderer and spree killer they often fetishize their weapon but this guy discard his why he can get a new knife anytime he want they carry these at army navy store it could be a scare tactic Hoso Americans typically be more terrified by the presence of a knife than a gun they be more likely to scream out for help if they see a gun whereas they will comply if they see a blade so victimology and murder weapon be not important to this guy what do that leave what be he attack the crime scene itself do you see the sign outside when this place be establish 1967 the same as the restaurant second generation italian everyone in the neighborhood eat there St Alvina 's be build at the beginning of the last century so each location have a history in this community so he want to destroy landmark piece of providence 's history that be why the random victim he be make a point probably the manifestation of a deep hatred for the city he want to scar the place everybody know and go to not quite take a ride with I we be go to have a look at the other crime scene why indulge I attack an institution everybody respond neighbor come out the mayor assign extra cop a place of worship turn into a crime scene you feel personally assault that be what get he off the response public outcry he want the big show you think he be revisit the crime scene not just revisit relive he be find a way to keep the murder he be commit fresh because they be always on the city 's mind witness say they do not see it happen be alert by the scream of the victim 's wife and daughter Man alive in a church this guy he be not afraid on nothing need anything I be go to grab a smoke careful Connie those things'll kill ya Careful it be hot good 'cause I love my tea really warm pos 192 210 would you like some cream and sugar with your tea too pos 192 210 please that be how miss tuffet like her tea too thank you it be good but I think Sophia 's tea be a little bit well thank you how many do you have you be too good at this not to be a mom one a boy Sophia 's first communion be suppose to be next week she will do great excuse I Hey Rossi we be just get ready to deliver the profile but I need you to do something I understand ok call I when you find out more Sophia mommy and agent Jareau need some privacy ok thank you for the tea Y ou're welcome I know that tone of voice it be always follow by bad news you should know a lot of these guy need to feel powerful produce a spectacle give they that sense of pride I be try to quell that by control the circus outside be he watch we maybe we think he revisit his crime scene it be possible the medium could have bring he here he will not shake my daughter 's hand this time if he do we suggest that you 've think of this unsub here not as a slasher but as an arsonist because the gratification he be get be not from the physical act of murder but from the public 's reaction to it arsonist draw attention to themselves through the fire they set Pas de teste dans le tsssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss while this unsub will never set an actual fire he have the same psychosis as one who do our unsub fit that model his location have be pillar of the community the victim he pick be not as important as the effect of kill they outside of your favorite restaurant or place of worship by pick locale wit the high visibility he be create the high level of fear in that neighborhood which reinforce his feeling of power yeah but arsonist do not set out to hurt people this guy clearly do that be true and this unsub definitely fall in the category of sociopath his victim be there only to achieve his goal he do not have the ability to empathize with they to he they be just tool for he to use no different than a can of gasoline and a match I will talk to you later sweetie I be just at the market right now all right I love you too but even how he kill tell we something slash a throat be a messy visual act it be design to create attention just like a fire Arsonists be often mission base they need make sure their first fire have burn out before they set another one be these organic yeah you know I think I have a fresher bunch of those back in the truck Hold n one second they be also highly disciplined and focus if condition be not right to set a fire or in this case slash a throat they will move on I be sorry I do not which actually make this your lucky day if you want to get something else these hydrangea be perfect they have to go home with somebody I will give they to you for half they be beautiful absolutely I will take they Blue for your eye how about that in addition to his need to kill he have self control he have a short cooling off period because he be enjoy what he be do this in turn feed his ego and keep he cover his track this make he even more dangerous if he get frustrated encounter too many obstacle or suffer a blow to his narcissistic ego he could go on an all out rampage Focus on man between job instead of work consistently he be hunt at his next location and he be revisit his old scene we recommend you yeah the news crew be leave the Collins house he be kill again yeah Farmers market at third and Shelby the press be already on their way we could use that it will feed his ego he will want to stay and watch Ladies and gentleman when you get to the crime scene we need you to canvass the crowd pay particular attention to onlooker who might be more interested in the scene itself than the victim and get photograph of everyone excuse I JJ I need you there no Hotch I can not leave JJ you be there to control the medium they 've leave to cover the crime scene which may distract the unsub we can catch he but I need you on top of the press make sure they be focud on our goal and not the unsub 's yeah I be on my way I be so sorry it be ok I know that tone of voice too somebody die Ho my god what happen I bet it be that stabber Stabber what stabber you know the y who be be cut people 's throat open around town right he come with I sir what what Come on let us go Providence police go ahead Emily Hey Rossi I get a trail of blood here but I have not find the knife yet he run away see where it end get it we can not run this locally run it be run it be go CNN 's lead with this in 3 hour minimize his impact do not give he a name it will just encourage he to kill more be I make this deal for full access of course just attribute the good work to the providence P D and leave we out of it he be just a nice guy who work here I would en he here before but never buy anything from he what do you remember about the attack I ask if his flower be organic I turn away and the next thing I know I feel something warm it be blood do you get a look at the guy with the knife the first person I see be a guy scream for help he be try to stop the bleed a bunch of people run over there try to help and I think I just stand there scream back up for a second who be shout I do not know some guy when I turn around he be hold the poor man up try to get someone to notice this guy must have get a lot of blood on he yeah yeah sure I guess all right thank you for your time Officer go ahead Emily I find out where that blood trail end and the unsub change his clothe he leave his blood soak one here in the trash he be avoid get blood on himself up to now what change I do not know but whatever his reason he come prepared he know he would be bloody this time I will get back to you what do you get Morgan a witness say the first responder a citizen cry out for help maybe 2 second after the stabbing he be the unsub I think so he be not content with revisit the crime scene anymore e need to be part of they Detective yeah establish a perimeter around the market Put your man no more an 20 foot apart every cop need to be in sight of one another wait a minute what the unsub be still here be you sure start by separate the man from the woman we find discard clothe that be how we find he we match by body type all right I be on it Gardella come on copy that Connor be that you hey Liddy what be you go I got to get back to the diner well you be go to be late we get to detain everyone inside here come on how many hamburger have let slide just follow order buddy let us go you got to explain to Sally when I be late yeah yeah your customer will not starve those get to be on the board too what be the next great bit of advice from the FBI take it easy Gardella this be not the time or the place if we have not listen to they Liddy and I would be hav g our morning cup of coffee we profile that he be mission orient and this kill do not fit that pattern the murder of officer Liddy be a significant departure even for someone as unpredictable as this unsub this be a murder of self preservation just to get away this location be not his MO seclude with no audience stab not cut so so he be out prowl the street right now look for another victim so the city will pay attention to he you 've be hand a list of location that we think might be of particular interest to the unsub we be ask you to double and even triple your surveillance in these area keep your wit about you guy Detective we would like to speak to you sure that be it fellas thank you detective the story have become about officer Liddy we need to get the attention back on the unsub or we be afraid that he may lash out up till now the unsub have be discipline enough to avoid kill if the circumstance be not right like an arsonist who will not set a fire if there be someone there to see he leave while smoke be billow out the window what if we say that one of the building do not burn how would the unsub react to that he would be compel to come back and finish the job then we pick one of the previous location show that the community have rally around it that not afraid of he so we need to find a location with the great symbolism up to this point that be easy and we use the city 's fall hero as inspiration should we get the chief of police or the mayor to make a statement it could help with inspire people we 've get something well Captain Collins ' widow I I can not ask she to do that she be highly visible and she be someone with whom the entire city can sympathize when she tell the city not to be afraid to come back to church the unsub can not ignore that and what happen if this draw the unsub to Meg we keep she with we we will take the bastard down you want I to read this in front of camera yes will my husband 's killer be there most likely he will watch it on tv you will have police protection around you at all time no I will not do it Meg please we need you you represent Paul 's memory I represent Sophia Paul 's give enough so have I yes sir no I understand thank you that be the mayor he will not sign off on a press conference at St Alvina and JJ could not make any headway with Meg Collins how long have it be since officer Liddy be stab 16 hour well if the unsub be go to go out on a spree he would have do it by now why have not he he kill a cop he be lay low maybe but we 've profile this guy like an arsonist it be the aftermath that matter not the act you think he be feed off the grief of the police department instead if so then he be find something new to get off on Detective Hold on a second yeah I need a list of establishment where your officer socialize bar restaurant pool hall everything you 've get sure right Eddie let I get back to you another round guy yeah we be off the clock anyways one more for liddy boy here be to a great cop we will get this bastard for you Joe yeah the FBI go to help you do that we do not need a profile to know the kind of guy we be deal with a coward he stab a cop in the dark and run away like a vermin Gutless no kiddin ' comrade I have amass employment record for police hangout what do you want I to look for White male 25 to 30 I be go to need more than that Arsonists typically have a strong relationship with their mother than their father so let us look for single mother household with a history of abuse bad divorce or paternal violence Manifestations in the son too Garcia like juvenile arrest heavy crime a significant drop in grade thank you boy that will do oh this look like something what do you have Connor O'Brien his dad go to prison for oh lord y not only set mom 's apartment on fire but make it look like it be an accident so he could collect on the insurance r ne his kid 's mother for a few buck yeah and then Connor testify he be 10 where 's O'Brien now he work at the quality cafe guy it be across the street Thanks Garcia FBI where 's Connor O'Brien Connie he just step out about 10 minute ago do you see which way he go he just go out to grab a smoke why Garcia I need O'Brien 's home address what be you guy do here we be do with our shift we pour one out for Liddy do you talk to he about the recent murder of course we say we would catch the coward you disparage he 1121 Admiral apartment 16 it be the other side of town Dave you and Morgan meet Prentiss and SWAT on site Connor O'Brien Clear he be not come back here he be go to make his last stand he be still go to need to know he be foremost on everyone 's mind guy it look like he be get every article that be print about his mom 's death he have the prayer card from her funeral Birthday card look all of they sign by his mom not by his father look at this that be a lot of hate his old man be already in prison he can not attack he so he

passersby it look like any parent carry a cry child 30 second later she be conceal in the vehicle and they be go the same one roll up on our mother she get in it be do who be drive it it take 3 unsub to pull this off if the same people take charlie we be look for a group well if they 've take 2 or more child over an 8 year period somebody must have notice something how do they keep the victim hide once we figure that out we will find they the unsub and the child Beautiful be not they thank you I plant each and every one of they myself I like to think of these rose as the soul of the forget like this poor young man here Hotch uh this be sarah hillridge oh we meet when charlie be take I mean you know you see a lot of we I be sure we all look the same thank you for come in have a seat all right these represent kid take from public place location be never hit more than once but there be similarity in each different mall toy store carnival theme park parade place where family should feel safe and where there be not much security that be 12 child over 10 year we should interview all the family I know a few of they we have a support group I mean most of they have move on but you be here I see charlie 3 year ago you do not tell I that well my husband do not believe I why would you tell we what happen at first I see he all the time I think I do and from what I understand that be normal but you can not survive that way so jake and I promise that we would move on but a few year later I see he I mean it be different I mean in my mind he have never age but this be a teenage charlie cross the street and as quick as he be there he be go again but I know I see he Jake do not believe I that be the day he leave I what do you do when you see charlie I call for he Charlie how do you know it be he well I do not not for sure so I call for he again do he hear you he look back and your husband do not see he it be crowd he disappear I lose he all over again we will be ask those parent to sign up for all that pain again if they 've move on they would take the chance if it mean their kid be alive just flare up that hair a little bit more and it go far down his neck his eyebrow be not quite as full Stephen 's be miss 7 year in february he would be 15 now and you last see he in the toy section that sar hillridge do you know she we be friend we be in a support group together Stephen be take the year after charlie you know she be crazy leave she alone she be no sir I do not know that wish for your boy to come home be one thing she throw her whole life away her husband be a good man and she be get a daughter who she can not even why would she ruin that Hope can be paralyze sir we believe that the people who take aimee lynch have be do this for a very long time the little girl yesterday in the moment before your son be take do anything stand out like what anything at all that draw your attention away from he just for a moment but I never think anything about it that woman look for her son I help she oh god she even thank I for help you could not have know she be right in front of I how could she have take stephen because she be not work alone they 've use this ruse in a dozen local abduction be that why we be here they 've do this to all of we do you think there be a chance Stephen 's still alive how many be there you be the fourth but there have be other where be they someplace well they be go to get we for supper but I be not hungry what be your favorite food Ice cream pretend it be ice cream and eat it all up ok I want my mommy you be in good hand there be no one well than they I know I let go of her hand it be only for a second but she be always be the one that I worry about you can not blame yourself Frank do and he be right I should have hold on Aimee 's wander off before and there be this feeling when they be out of your sight it take your breath away until you see they again and I think that be why I can not breathe 11 family have confirm the same woman 40 to 50 year old call for child in some case she even have a child with her she actually use the kid for the abduction be they her own or the one kidnap we do not believe she be a mother most predisposed female offender be not but they be the most violent you say that she be work with someone it be likely a subservient male but the woman separate herself from her partner she choose the victim while they do the risky part they grab the child and manage the getaway this be what he look like as a teenager he be tall and thin his hair be dark than it be but that be he that be Charlie why would they take the risk of let he out in the world they 've have he under their control for 8 year he be either get Stockholm or he be be threaten get we another kid and we will not kill you Sarah let us take a break ok thank you thank you all right so live and work in Northern Virginia it be most likely in isolation I mean there be no way to explain a houseful of kid at the neighborhood block party manage this many child be not easy there have to be incident where thing do not go as plan we should start with domestic call and disturbance concentrate on family who be visit by social service I will get Garcia it be likely these unsub be question before once we narrow down Garcia 's list we should revisit they what they 've be do to Charlie this whole time here be time that I have hope he be dead just so he would not suffer every day we know these offender be skilled at abduction and hide their victim usually we do not know that until after the fact what you 've bring we to they be rare I know but it be not go to end well for all of we I recognize he he be there when we be in line he be too old for the pony I should have know that he be a few people behind we you see he too he seem like a normal kid he be still alive wait this be your son Charlie your son take my baby Mrs Lynch your son take Aimee Honey come on he be one of they he be take

I ok there be 107 family visit by social service in the last 10 year that be too many to go door to door we be go to have to narrow that down we need to figure out why they be stay in Northern Virginia their work could be the key they could have a child care facility on the premise as a cover you know it be most likely a single income family someone have to be home to stay with the kid ok all this help they 've be question before so we can expect a rehearse response how many on that list be single income 23 what be the problem we be go to be knock on the door of 23 family and all of

do you know anything about it only what I see on the news we have reason to believe that our suspect have be in your facility in the past 24 hour here you think he be here we could really use your help well we could give you our manif it log all the trucker and their load that be exactly what we need all right get up you be come with I I say get up all right take it easy it be your dime Mr Amazing listen I might have something to narrow your search we do not think he drive for a company the schedule be way too tight in the past few month he be have the flexibility to hunt and kill and he could not do all that and run load so you need I to narrow down the independent contractor you be read my mind red I just email you the manifest from the local depot where all the trucker check in can you of course I can 76 license register under own authority and I just send they back to you Woman you be good you have no idea how many of these case have you work on too many how many of these woman have you get back alive all right let us go over this again this offender 's preferential young woman mid to late 20 he take his time watch they he make sure there be no witness he kill they 12 to 24 hour after abduction only now that timeframe be get short then he come home to edgewood where he be home and he feel safe Courtney listen this man he do not try to hide his victim so you think she be still alive I be so rude to her I just do not want the last thing I say to she to have be if he have hurt she we would have find she already so what be he do to her there be no rape involve so be it companionship he be after there might be an almost chivalrous aspect to this how do you figure trucker have a romanticize image of themselves in fact all lifestyle revolve around the open road do the hell 's angel for instance they refer to their woman as their old lady but in fact there be no one they would rather protect or die for their treatment of woman would not be out of place in king arthur 's court and their sense of isolation would amp up their fantasy he be look for a wife he start out with easy target then he move on to woman who could actually fill the role Sweet outgoing warm the bartender who take extra care of you the chatty hitchhiker but over the course of the day they fail the test this infuriate he and he strangle they and dump they ok so why take Nancy Campbell she be the opposite of all the other victim he be take it be true she be old she already have a kid maybe that be why she be still alive what if he be not look for a companion what if he be look for a mother if he be get a kid of his own that would explain what keep he come back to edgewood it would explain why he walk past Courtney to get to nancy just by watch he know she be a mother she be already qualified to pass any test Garcia Sir I want you to narrow down the own authority trucker list and tell I which one have be through a divorce recently or a custody battle Custody fight would be a stressor limit your search to month prior to the first murder got it thank what be go on just hold on a second wait what be go on they find a body off the I 40 no identification be she dead

be still amazed at all the good yeah but do you think it even out I would like to think it do Chopper one we have a report of a body in Presidio park Chopper one copy En route confirm dead body male mid 30 badly beat single gunshot to the head well we need to call the FBI it be start again you hungry you want to grab something do not try and act like you care I just want to know if you be hungry no I be not hungry I be not the enemy Jane of course not my friend be right and David you be 14 it be too young to go on date especially with a boy who be already drive Mom think you work too much what do that have to do with anything it be not my fault that you two do not get along I be not say it be you be try to shit I off your mom and I love you do not even ok you want to be treat like an adult fine let us have an adult conversation can I help you what do you think 's go on with the helicopter tonight I be sorry I be try to have a conversation with my daughter I be not talk to you I be talk to Jane how do you know my daughter 's name you be not in charge here Jane run ahead no now you come quiet or you both die Hotch Cooper you never be one for office a medical condition I be allergic to bureaucracy thank for come Hotch Sure I do not have long we be leave on a case I know San Francisco I hear thing so what be go on how much you know about this case you be work I be on my way in to look at the file can I give you a preview sure all right so here be the deal 2 year ago a dead male turn up in Presidio park a massive amount of blunt force trauma Defensive wound single gunshot to the back of the head and over the next 3 day 3 more vic same m o and after that there be nothing until exactly one year later same thing dead male badly beat shot execution style follow by 3 more vic over the next 3 day and then nothing until last night one year later exactly which mean we have 3 day before the trail go cold again why all the interest I get a theory I think there be parallel murder link to these case 2 year ago one day after those murder stop a single dad and his 15 year old brunette daughter be find dead in their car last year again one day after the dead male stop show up same thing another dad and his brunette daughter and you think it be all connect I think it be a hell of a coincidence do not you and you want I to bring your team in on the case you only have 3 day I mean you do not have time to be chase an angle like this one so my team work the body in Presidio Park while your team test the theory about the father and daughter and if I be right both half of the case help solve the other half and you already ask the director and she say no she be not strong at think outside the box if you ignore her order and you be wrong you be do I be tell you Hotch right now there be a father and there be a daughter and they be miss and no one be look for they stop it stop it if I can snap this chain you be just go to hurt yourself stop it please please please stop it you ok stop you stay away from her I say get away from her what the hell do you want it be simple you give she to I you both live go to hell that be your answer Criminal Team http expert heberg forum net Saison 5 Episode 18 the Fight Mother Teresa say I have find the paradox that if you love until it hurt there can be no more hurt only more love what do we know about the past year ' victim the tenderloin district be a high concentration of drug addict and homeless people all the victim have be transient so this unsub 's choose easy target that will not be miss he be not concerned with the challenge of the hunt all these victim be part of a large plan which he execute in the same few day every year Reid do you find any significance to the date nothing historical it be get to be personal for the unsub JJ you and Reid hit the San Francisco p D Rossi and Prentiss to the dumpsite Morgan and I will go to the coroner 's office nobody should expect to get a lot of sleep in the next 3 day what about Cooper 's team you say he have a theory he believe that whoever be murder these homeless man be also abduct father and daughter and kill they once the transient be dispose of so then we will investigate the dead man and his team can see if there be a miss father and daughter why be not his team on the jet now because the director would not authorize they join the investigation they be work against the director 's order we need to concentrate on the dead man abduct from the tenderloin Cooper 's team can help determine if there be a miss father and daughter and whether it be connect to our case or you could get in serious hot water if the director think you be help to defy her no Hotch be right I 've know Sam Cooper for 20 year and I 've never see he defy an order if he feel this strong about a hunch we need to help he however we can try to get out of the heavy lifting eh actually I be set up a two way iLNB with a 500 megawatt transmitter and single polarity LNB both operate in the Ku band what do she just say to I at least we be bless with a nice setup how have you hook it up I know a guy who know a guy who be a slumlord who give we a great deal so how do we conjure victim of a crime that might not have be commit out of thin air in a major american city San Francisco have a population of 800 000 half of those be male just start with the female only 45 of the population be white so what do that leave 360 000 that be get we to 180 000 check school absence narrow that to girl 13 to 18 and narrow it again to brunette find their father ' name and check their workplace who have not show up well ok if you want to show off about it all right let us ride let us get to work have all the dumpsite be this isolated he keep away from the main path never dump they in light area so he have to have study the terrain beforehand he be organize and physical enough to haul a body a long way on his own what can you tell we about the victim they be all live on the street no witness our guess be he manage to lure they promise food or drug be any report miss no we do know they all come from the same few block in the tenderloin this be the body they find at presidio park if he have not be shoot he probably would have die of internal bleeding it look like he land a few shot of his own there ' powder residue on his skull he have to have be subdue when he be shoot so he gets abduct off the street quietly enough that there be no witness but then he fight for his life only to let the unsub shoot he execution style in other word what the hell be he do with they Unlock he not yet get up let us go throw the key off to the side you win you live you lose I kill your daughter and I kill you Understand can you stand can you stand do not look Jane ok we 've talk to over 200 middle school and run the name of absent girl against their yearbook photo what else we be check bio of the dad now and call their workplace so he have not be at work you sure both day thank you what we get this be Jane McBride she be 14 she do not show up for school yesterday or this morning and dad Ben he have not be at his contract company for the last 2 day I love this guy and the prophet speak yes yes Hotch Cooper I think we find he Mrs McBride I be agent Hotchner with the fbi this be agent Cooper we be here to determine whether your husband and your daughter be miss do not Ma'am be you ok just get inside please hurry oh god Mrs McBride you just get my family murder that be the first victim from the park the man on the phone say he would kill Ben and Jane if I bring in the police he say that if I need proof I should check my front porch and when I do this be there oh he be careful nothing to distinguish he or his location be there any other instruction no he say he would call with more do you think he be watch I mean be he go to kill they the video be shoot by a camera on a tripod which mean he probably do not have a partner it would be almost impossible for he to take your family prisoner and do surveillance simultaneously and he be do this before so why do not someone come forward after to say what happen he do not leave anybody with knowledge alive and we will post an agent here to keep you safe can you excuse we a moment Cooper listen your theory 's right we know he be kill homeless man as well as father and daughter but let we work it if you go back to D C now the director will not know that you ignore her order look I know you be stick your neck out on this thing for I I understand I be not try to this be not about I I want to protect you you remember he Toby Vahl of course you remember we get that confession for those 5 child murder but we all have that gut feel we know he be not good for all of they the preference be too varied local cop shut the investigation down the fbi brass they tell we to get our ass back home I remember where be you when you hear they catch that second killer dump this boy 's body I be in Denver work on a new case you I be not on anything yet I could have still be there I will not ignore my gut again I do not care what it cost I ok my people will be on the record and we will use yours to double manpower Hotchner where ok they find another body so how do a brit a handsome brit how do a brit end up in the fbi it be pretty simple Cooper and I bump into each other a few time 10 month ago they tell he he could hand pick a new team he call I come Passport do not matter so be it true that no one in the british special force be allow to admit they be in it I do not know I would have to ask around about that one you know there be a lot of rumor about your boss one I hear be when he leave the bau he be do psychological op overseas well I 've never be big on rumor so I do not suppose you be go to tell I just where you two bump into each other I will tell you I trust the man with my life I will tell you I would die for the man how be the mom she be hold up I do not know how much help she be go to be so the tenderloin be full of junkie who would be easy to control but the first victim have no drug in his system and this geezer it look pretty healthy too except for the whole dead thing there be skin under his nail do not the first victim have scratch mark on his chest yeah we assume he fight back against the unsub but these victim might actually be fight each other exactly I take it you be about to wow I with a theory the first victim be dump before the father and daughter be take why because he want to send a message to the wife that he mean business make sure she do not call the police and it also send a message to the prisoner he already have you lose a fight you die what do those welt look like to you my guess they be wound from rubber bullet like they use to control rioter or prison inmate ok I think the unsub 's be lock up that be where he be learn to control his own prisoner well if he be learn how to dominate they why be they fight each other it have to be part of his plan to watch they beat the hell out of each other and then the loser be execute Admit it I be start to grow on you Hotch it be emily we have an idea about what he might be do with the victim we may be able to give the profile hold on a second who be you call if I be right there be somewhere else we need to be deliver that profile this be one for the book huh yeah you spend much time here maybe a half a dozen interview you 6 year 3 month 4 day the prophet return what up man how you doing this be Nelson G I and he know each other from back in the dark day Man never expect to ever see you in here again this be agent David Rossi fbi Fbi the first time I see you in how long and you bring the fbi get the hell outta here I tell you man if I ever get my shot at redemption I be go to take my game to the other side to open the blind eye to take the prisoner out of the prison and they and they that sit in darkness out of the prison house it make sense I guess the criminal be the one who make the rule right cop be the one who get to learn them I need your help man talk we have a serial killer we think he might have do time here we want to give you a description and then you tell we if you recognize he just press your connection it be very likely that this unsub have a prison record he be white and judge by the age of the people he abduct most likely in his 30 and consider the terrain in which he be dump the body we think that he be impose or at least very physically fit he also have access to a space that be large enough to house and control a number of prisoner all without disturb the neighbor this guy keep to the same hunting ground same dumpsite he be a control freak real organize also he would have be obsess with the guard their method of control the prisoner especially in the yard this dude kill folk the same few day every year there be no way he be that obsessed and he be not talk about it we think the man have a daughter of his own most likely a brunette like Jane the date he choose probably correspond to an event involve his own daughter our guess be that he lose his daughter in some way and it be symbolic of he not fight for she in the first place a lot of time killers choose victim that be surrogate for someone like a wife or a mother in this case we think his own guilt be make he choose surrogate that represent himself the police department have the profile they 've triple patrol in the tenderloin you know what I think we need profiler out here too he could be out there hunt for homeless man to fight the father this kid good sniper I 've ever see he could view a lot of ground from the rooftop be you comfortable on the ground solo of course Cooper 's right maybe we can catch he try to abduct another victim so what you wear a gun hey mick explain something to I how come I be out on the street and you be sit on your butt on some roof well you hear the man do you really want I to expound on my own prowess it be undignified stay on your headset all his victim be come from this 4 block radius hey Jane honey just save your strength you can not fight again I do not have a choice I do not care if they break every bone in my body I promise you I be not go to stop ok I 've get something I be not sure if it be anything but southeast corner see the guy clock the junkie you care to expand on that all I see be guy clock junkie Gray shirt yeah I get he stay close I be on my way he be head south Ben Fbi stop hey stop I do not do anything why be you follow that man I know he be hold I just want a fix I do not distribute Dad why keep this up she be well off with I we both know it soon this will be all she know you let she walk home from school every day on her own she will be safe with I Ben she will not even miss you you will not break I then it be to the death to the death or I kill Jane to the death or Jane die last chance I be so sorry sorry I be sorry do your analyst get we the datum yeah I can lay it out for you Good let us cross reference it against our potential suspect pool hello yeah we can be there you up for a ride to San Quentin it be like the old day spend all your time interview prisoner do not go get sentimental on I what we get the profile say he be spend time in prison he probably lose a teenage daughter in a way that correspond to the date he abduct and kill his victim we have the date in question divide into 4 specific subset this group be teenage girl age 13 to 16 who be remove from their father ' care these be death of teenager the same age the remainder be man arrest for violet crime and anyone serve a prison sentence during the same window the stressor 's in here somewhere let us find something that look promise so we can start run background check Agent Hotchner Erin Strauss yes ma'am I be call to check on the status of your case we be pursue a secondary line of investigation and why be that let I talk to she for a second hold a moment please Ma'am do you think I be stupid agent Cooper no ma'am uh I do not think you be stupid be it unclear when I give an order you should know that agent Hotchner he have nothing to do with this we need to be invite in by the local you be not you do realize that my theory be right I want you back here today I can not do that excuse I you can fire I tomorrow right now I get less than 24 hour before a father and a daughter turn up dead Somewhere in the city and I refuse to be on an airplane while the son of a bitch dump their body now with all all possible respect I get to go I have work to do tell agent Hotchner I will deal with the both of you when you get back so where be we I want you to get inside the girl 's head she be the key any insight could break this thing we need to understand why he take this girl at this time I ask around about you be it true you interview charles manson before they transfer he out of here 3 straight day 1988 what be he like Small Small huh hey you get something I hear a story what kind of story there be this big white dude that be in before I got send back supposedly he be all kind of crazy find

what be it this collage Jane be tell her parent that they do not exist in her life that her interest be an entirely different culture than her parent ' why would she keep a journal out for anyone to read what be in it it be typical 14 year old stuff rant about her parent be unfair talk about some boy name David Ok so she be defiant and she want her parent to read it no but she be private she would not commit these thought to paper in the first place unless it be force on her your daughter 's journal only go back 9 month what make she start keep it we go to a family counselor who suggest jane keep it where be the office in the tenderloin district ok get it good work morgan the McBride family go to a therapy center in the tenderloin the place also do evaluation for social service we profile that the unsub may have have his daughter take away from he if he be process in the same place then he would know how to target the father and daughter can I talk to your analyst Sure talk to I Penelope Garcia Sam Cooper Sam Cooper as I live and breathe and here I think you be a story someone invent what you get here be what I need from you anyone process by social service who end up lose

to be that I love you all right my tribe I have a list of parent evaluate by social service who end up lose custody but as Cooper predict it be a lengthy tale of woe we will use it to cross against the teenage girl who die on some of the date in question I be go to start read name you tell I if they be on your list Maria Salter Carla Denny Hey Joyce Collard Dawn Sparrow right sound like a possible thank prophet we have a name a John Vincent Bell one of the girl who die be name Mandy Bell Garcia run the name John Vincent Bell against the family therapy list Shazzam Bell and his wife

Terlingua Texas 3 victim at once actually they appear to be in different stage of decomposition M E confirm that one of the head be a day or so old the other 2 appear to have die a few month ago but the wound edge suggest that they be decapitate recently Dirt in their mouth ear and nose at some point these two head be bury and then dig up ok so why the sudden need to display they the need may not be so sudden Mexico in 2009 alone 10 head in cooler and the people belong to these head be kill just hour before they be find Result of a battle between feud drug cartel DEA 's not interested they ask we to take a look at it consider the different decomposition this might not even be about drug then what do we have well the victim be two male one female so no gender preference stage the head in front of a sheriff 's station that be aggressive all 3 victim be hispanic and unidentified Terlingua have a large illegal population it be make I D Ing the victim that much hard he might be try to make some type of political statement Volunteer border patrol do a lot of personal policing down there group like the minutemen prize law and order above everything else and those patrol serve their political agenda murder would be bad for their image stage the head in front of a police station suggest that the unsub might be local he would have to have a knowledge about how to do something like that without be see so what we have be hundred of mile of unincorporated desert and an endless supply of anonymous victim cross the border every day it be a serial killer 's perfect storm Criminal Team http expert heberg forum net Saison 5 Episode 19 Rite of Passage a lion 's work hour be only when he be hungry once he be satisfied the predator and prey live peacefully together Chuck Jones Explain this to I the unsub hunt along the U S Mexico border how big be that area over 5 000 square mile of desert he could have go undetecte for year so why announce himself something happen recently what do we know about crime in Terlingua it be a stop over town Immigrants stay only 24 hour before move on but that also make they narco traffic hubs outside of immigration violation most of the arrest be drug relate that my prettie in an understatement anyone familiar with the Lugo cartel out of Baja California their great hit the pun be inescapable include multiple brutal murder along with import and distribute nearly 2 ton of cocaine and copious amount of heroin between 1990 and 2009 now if we get in our bau time machine flash forward to now a super cheap hjghly addictive and totally impure form of black tar heroin just show up on the street of Terlingua and the DEA think the Lugo cartel be directly responsible so they be expand their operation which be often announce by a wave of violence Lugo cartel kill 2 DEA agent last year we be go to need to watch our back to cartel fed be fair game there be even usually a bounty so we be go to bring in the toy be careful with those I do not need break MP 5s on our budget guy here be the thing I do not think I technically have authorization to carry a weapon like that you do not you know we be go to have a victim pool that be extremely hesitant to talk to we Prentiss you and Morgan start with the migrant community see what inroad you can make stress that we be only there to catch a killer Rossi and Reid the M E be wait to show you the head maybe they can tell we something what be this about this be part of the Lugo cartel excuse we Federal agent Step aside we be legal citizen of this country demonstrate our first amendment right to a peaceful assembly in order to protest the unlawful arrest of Omar Morales you walk around we Agents sheriff Ruiz be wait inside ignore they do not do nothing stupid deputy anytime you want to make a move Jose you know where to find we all you all do sorry about the welcome committee we do not expect you for another half hour how many uh how many officer in the whole department include the sheriff 5 there be 8 man outside and that be the point right to show that they outnumber you well if it come down to number we would not stand a chance those scumbag be only a handful of the soldier who work for Omar Morales he be the head of a local narco traffic ring we pick he up this morning just outside of town he be head for the airport have he make a statement not exactly Meaning Sheriff Ruiz will not let we talk to he and why be that well maybe you can ask she why right this way FBI 's here Eva Ruiz I be glad you could make it Agent Hotchner this be Agent Jareau can I get you anything Coffee no thank you Ma'am how do you plan on deal with the small army outside I plan on ignore they well we can have some of they will get hot and tired and go away on their own they be the least of my worry we hear you make an arrest my deputy do but you do not agree because they be wrong whoever stage these head in front of your office be try to tell you something they want I to butt out of what exactly I count more than 20 miss immigrant just in the 6 month I 've be sheriff that be more than 3 in a month almost one victim a week these be just name and cursory description be there any other paperwork have there be any investigation no one will make an official report but I believe somebody around here have be kill for a long time want a laugh I leave Brooklyn north homicide to slow down I pick the wrong part of the country to semi retire this place be swim in dysfunction it be a game of survival and I can not trust anyone Ma'am you 've get 4 deputy who I expressly tell to leave Omar morale alone you can see how well they follow order then you be sure this be not the Lugo cartel murder to send a message be the way these guy communicate come with I you know contrary to popular belief decapitation be not that easy you do not often hear popular and decapitation in the same sentence you need to strike on the weak point of the spine it be normally between the c3 and c7 vertebrae there be multiple strike but they do not show any hesitation I realize you do not have much to work with here but outside of the obvious be there anything unusual about these victim well the second victim appear to have be blind if not completely then he have cataract bad enough that it be difficult for he to get around what about the other two no the most recent victim be old so be the first one the woman well I only have their tooth to go by so it would take some time to get an accurate age but yeah I would agree they be old we be look for something that we call a signature something that all the victim share some physical mark something postmortem well I do not know if this be what you mean but they all have sand residue in their nose and throat could that be from be bury possibly but the trachea and the nasal passage they be kind of tear up if I have the lung here I would guess that they be full of sand as well you mean like they breathe in sand forcefully enough that it lacerate the passage they be run this be Agent Hotchner from the FBI Nice suit you know how much misery that guy be responsible for yeah I 've hear some of the thing this cartel 's capable of your boss go to talk to he he be go to try good luck what kind of message be this it be funny kind of yeah a competitor move in on your business be that what you would do Hypothetically yeah I would gut he from crotch to chin then leave his intestine open for the animal after I send his left hand to his wife his eye to his mother and his tongue to his kid with a note say that their papa have die wet himself a coward this this be not no message Hypothetically that be an interesting defense say that you would do bad a defense you ask I a question you think I need a defense charge I with something what do you know about the head that be leave outside the sheriff 's station last night seriously you be a man who like to be in control you have a small army stand guard outside they protect you because you 've convince they somehow that they need you and you do not know what be go on in your town you do not tell he tell I what you be look for Santa muerte the Saint of death Sheriff what exactly be Omar talk about every job have a patron Saint Cops have Saint jude doctor have Raphael the archangel but if you be a drug dealer or a killer who do you pray to the Saint of death I 've learn that cross the desert to get here you lose track of the way you can die so if someone close do not make it sometimes it be easy to blame a superstitious figure well Omar do not seem like he believe what he be say I do not say he believe it I say it be who people be blame what people look Santa muerte have be come up more and more the illegal I send back the coyote I arrest some of the drug trafficker they be afraid Afraid of a Saint I handle a homicide once where my only witness be this 4 year old girl and she tell I her mom and dad got kill by a dragon turn out the bad guy wear a green rain suit with a pointy hood to the kid it look like a dragon so when hundred of people be talk about the same monster it be a sure bet something be go on they just do not know what to call it so they call it Santa muerte I tell you we should have keep that bastard lock up and I be tell you for the last time Boyd go back on patrol no decomposition it be a new victim he be become more focused on you sheriff Sheriff may I have a word with you it be clear that this be personal it always be how be that look I have no idea how many of these people have go miss over the year but one thing be clear I be the only one who seem to give a damn that be as personal as it get for I we be here because we care well all I 've get be a bunch of story and superstition what if it be not even happen Sheriff I can not tell you how long this have be go on but something be definitely happen now and from the way the unsub be act it be obvious that you 've touch a nerve whoever he be I think you 've probably talk to he I 've talk to anyone who will listen Drug dealer immigrant business owner well one of they be your Santa muerte and he be feel the pressure when we get back to the station I want to go over every single interview you 've do how who be we even look for we have a profile to give you and your deputy we be search for a personality type call a human predator in the classic sense a hunter all the victim we 've be able to conclusively tie to he have be old or handicapped in some way this suggest he wait for someone to separate from the pack look for the weak like a lion or something except a lion hunt food this type of predator hunt power it be not about serve a need and everything be a means to that end we also believe that he make his victim run through the desert in order to weaken they he may not be capable of take they on in their strong state despite their age or infirmity this suggest that he be possibly handicap in some way himself certainly weak maybe small or even thin and an unsub who create chaos and then attack typically carry this through to all aspect of his life he be unlikely to be in a relationship if he be it be an abusive one this guy get off on control he will have try to stay very close to the investigation he be well aware that the sheriff have start look into the miss illegal immigrant how do you know that it be probably why the decapitation start as a countermeasure he be try to throw off the investigation it be typical in an organized offender like this cary stayner the yosemite killer drive more than 50 mile to dump cigarette pack and driver 's license at intersection to throw off suspicion Start by look back at everyone you 've talk to in connection with these killing we need to start with people who be familiar with the immigrant journey like who advocate none of they will talk to we I 've try well the coyote want this guy catch he be hurt their business and if the advocate really care about the immigrant they be go to want to find whoever be responsible as well there be one guy who could help he run an outreach program call libertad where can we find he Clyde you want to take they over to meet Richard corral my lucky day these FBI agent want a word with you see the limp hey baby girl I need you to run a check on someone for I what be wrong with you Clyde None of my client will trust I if I 've get federal agent walk around here well maybe you should not spend your time help illegal sneak into the country they only want a well life well then they ought to come in the front door uh gentleman another day Mr Corral we understand your hesitation but we be not here about immigration we be here about murder do you know anything about the head that be leave in front of the sheriff 's station a few day ago everyone do my client be terrify Clients Deputy another man be murder last night an immigrant we need to figure out how this man find his victim Sheriff Ruiz say you know more about these people 's journey than anyone how many place be there to cross for every tunnel we find there be 12 more we do not know about and once they 've make it runner keep document in the trunk of their car Passports fake social security number green card it be a big business especially in border town do you know these runner they change all the time if immigrant do not find you where do they go safe house it be suppose to be where they can find rest water food suppose to be it be more like a prison until their family can pay off the coyote where be these safe house be you kid they come and go fast than the tunnel ok thank you for your time Sheriff we could use a hand with the geographical profile we be try to locate likely safe house your team travel all around the country right that be right my last year in homicide I handle 36 murder I be one of 20 detective in my unit do the math do not ask I how many I solve I be sure you do the good you could there really be not anywhere to go where people be not kill each other be there likely safe house even if we could find a safe house you really think someone who just cross be go to talk to we well there be a good chance that last night 's victim do not cross alone someone may be miss he if last night 's illegal be still at safe house we can find the route they use and we will know the unsub 's hunting ground the whole point of a safe house be it be a secret if I would could find they I would shut they down all right if it be a first stop we should start with home that be close to the border I could pull land deed might take a while we 've get something fast Garcia Sir we be look for illegal immigrant safe house in terlingua what be the parameter start with homeowner and renter with criminal record that be a start give I more Morgan say they be always move look for home with short term lease and spike in utility if they be housing illegal there will be a high usage of power and water I be cross with all Texas utility company and I have 3 and I just send the address to your phone thank Garcia if you be look for a gift to get I one of she would be greatly appreciate we be pretty sure they break the mold you know we be not go to get very far if you keep argue about illegal with everyone this place use to be different how do you mean I do not know Different get it sir we be go to split up possible safe house the close one to we be 10 minute from here they be not go to be happy to see we you get a cell phone yeah give I the number Deputy we be at the back door go ahead and knock Police open up

half ago middle aged male those be photo of he postmortem what be with the tattoo he be cover in they almost completely that be why they request our presence the tattoo be portrait of previously miss woman with the year of death or the year the remain be recover anyway the tattoo correlate to face on a wall next to the body with information on the woman go back 10 year Rebecca be also show on that wall but there be no image of she on the body the Detective think that that may mean that she be alive somewhere he call in his own suicide do not he yeah how do you he stage all this no reason to put on a show without an audience tell they to leave the body where it be we need to see it how he want it see if this girl be still out there the only one who know where she be may be dead a sincere artist try to create something which be in itself a live thing Painter William Dobell this heat be brutal it be not so much the heat as it be the humidity at some point it do not matter how you look at it it all suck FBI yes sir John Barton Tallahassee pd I be the primary on the miss girl Rebecca Daniels I get my file in the car if you need they I be Agent Hotchner this be Agent Rossi Agent Prentiss Dr Reid Agent Morgan Agent Jareau we speak on the phone thank for come out so quickly I appreciate that I 've also confirm that all the woman be victim from around the southeast Florida Louisiana Georgia Alabama Rebecca 's the only woman on the wall who be not represent on his body yeah she be the only one hope you have a strong stomach the chair be turn like that this be exactly where you find he yeah talk about stage talk about ego there be also a couple box with journal composition book they be fill with writing we have not be through they yet other than to dust they for print have you identify he we be work on it we get a rush on the dna and the print he be clear locally but it be go to take some time to get the national record what about property record talk to the owner she say she rent it a couple week ago to a quiet normal look guy name Bob he say he want to store some equipment and he pay in cash they be always normal no lease Month to month no out here in the boonie you do not get a lot of record keeping type especially when it come to cash transaction I will bet he be no kid yet the missing go back only 10 year as far as I could tell late bloomer you see this a lot these guy kill themselves Most serial killer who commit suicide do it in prison after they be catch jj gather as much information about the prior victim as you can Morgan and Prentiss take the journal Dave you and Reid the tattoo see if he leave any clue about where miss Daniels might be you think there be a chance she might still be alive it be probably well not to speculate may I take a look at the case file you have on miss Daniels he be on the phone with dispatch and then must be what 15 foot Consummate overachiever right why be it when man kill themselves it get everywhere but woman do not leave a mess like they be never there woman worry about who have to clean up man do not give a damn jj what have you find the early clipping be from 10 year ago and they be in order old to new Brenda Carlyle first Rebecca Daniels last that be thoughtful of he one victim a year for 10 year straight each girl 's remain be recover in a well travel wooded area strangle repeatedly sexually assault and then about a week later another woman go miss do the new abduction happen before the previous body 's be find no never so he have a year long cycle he use they up and he get a new model but he will not take another girl until the last body be be find he be tell a story and he can not start a new one until the old one be over look at that at the turn of the 16th century Rose tattoo be put on man who be sentence to death really yeah if they escape it serve to identify they but now rose pretty much symbolize pure love pure love right before he kill they have you read the illustrated man Nope it be amazing it be a collection of short story by Ray Bradbury base on the metafictive device of a man who be cover in tattoo draw by a woman from the future at nighttime the tattoo come to life and tell a story it be pretty awesome these do tell a story you want to see something a space in the tree and there be no date on that one why would he leave that space blank maybe this guy be just a psycho if it be that simple we would all be out of a job hey Reid what be up our man here be a prolific journaler with teeny tiny handwriting he probably have counseling at some point when journale be part of his therapy that be what we be think and and uh well you know the two of we it would take we like 3 day to read all of this stuff you guy owe I it be no wonder no one have ever connect these case they be from different state different jurisdiction it be probably no accident he know the system why kill himself now he be not on anyone 's radar something change let us gather everyone so what do we know so far he want the police here he want we to see all this he be definitely a sadist from what we see his journal be graphic and meticulous cover himself with his victim ' likeness be methodical possessive he will always own they and the suicide show commitment he be organized and compulsive the crime be on an annual cycle Computer printout on the board they be all print on the same day 2 week ago that be when he rent this building and proceed to move everything into it it be a history of his crime so he do all of this in 2 week he get away with it for 10 year he could have keep go but he decide to end it all and hand everything to we that be it everything Everything Reid everything his body the tattoo the clipping the printout the journal he move it all into one room he want we to see all of it see all of he his work the woman he put they in chronological order he be scream look at I we all get that no but think about it if you take a step back it sort of make sense it be just a confession a giant flashy confession what would we say if an unsub turn himself in to the police before they be even onto he that he be try to hide something or someone he make a mistake in his third book I almost miss it but then I catch it I think it would take long but today be the lucky day she almost walk right by almost miss she completely but at the last moment we find our late guest we he have a partner he put everything in this room so we would not look far would not dig even deeply if he have a partner he be still out there and he be get Rebecca Daniels oh I be sorry I be so sorry I be call out but I guess your music be too loud be you all right I be fine it be all right Juliet Monroe that be I that be for you if I can get you to sign

be that you finish what we start please please just let I go home this be your fault this be your fault please what be she do down there she be try to keep the medium from run the story right now but would not that help we get it out there put some pressure on the partner but if the partner do not know about the suicide he might dispose of miss Daniels and disappear if anyone can stop the medium from run something it be JJ so let us profile the partner we know that the unsub be a dominant personality an alpha can any of you guy think of a case where a dominant unsub commit suicide to protect a submissive partner no so the partner must be an equal in some way or at least not a competitor not somebody that he need to feel dominance over maybe it be someone he care about it would be hard for a sadistic psychopath to care about anybody which would make the partner all that much more important to he what about the tattoo artist he could not have do those by himself maybe that be the role for the partner it would certainly make he important what the hell do any of this have to do with Becky I mean be not there something we should be do damn it Detective may I speak with you for a moment so we have until the evening news 6 p M how much do they know oh the trooper tell they everything Agent Rossi please tell I you call because the case be over and I can erase this freakity freak

reason not to anymore we 've see this guy 's show have you ever see anything like this before like what everything the suicide the clipping the journal I think it be pretty safe to say that no one be ever see anything like this man this be beautiful work it be a body suit he be completely cover pretty much the illustrated man second time I 've hear that today the book Reid mention it everybody in the body art world know that story you say this dude kill himself do he like gash his wrist open or something the tattoo could you recognize who do this I wish I would hire this dude in a heartbeat this look free hand trust I free hand portraiture be pretty gnarly to do on skin man do he shoot himself because none of these picture have a head can you tell if the same artist do these it look like it but they be not all do at the same time some of the ink be new you know if I see the body I would probably be able to tell you more how about these these be a lot of portrait what do they mean that be what we be try to figure out wait that do not fit what do not there be something under the rose there look like a cross a big one where inside the rose and the work be sloppy see that they put the rose over it to cover it up yeah I see that yeah that be not do professionally More like it be do in jail if he do time that would explain how a 50 year old unsub do not start kill until he be 40 this dude be a killer and why rapist become killer after they 've be in prison they learn not to leave a witness Garcia can track this through the biometric recognition program so there be like no chance of I see the dead dude right none hey p G I be go to send you a photograph of a tattoo you know that empty space on his back make he exactly like the illustrated man I think he be cover completely in the book in the movie there be an open spot on his back so you can see the future Rossi and Prentiss think he may have do time and that one of the tattoo may have be do in prison that be a good bet I

let us get start all right Anchorage field office be ask we to investigate a series of murder in Franklin Alaska there be 3 people dead in less than a week for a town with a population of 1 476 that be fairly significant it be their first murder investigation on record who be the victim Jon Baker a hunter Dedaimia Swanson a schoolteacher Brenda bright the first mate on a fishing boat there be a new victim every 2 day any connection unfortunately in a town this small everyone 's connect different kill method it say the first two victim be both shoot with a rifle but Brenda bright be stab twice with an arrow be we sure it be the same guy all 3 victim be find in heavily traffic area the unsub want they find soon than later Jon Baker 's body be leave expose to the element but the two woman be bury under mound of trash why it could be a sign of remorse cover their body so he do not have to face the reality of what he be do or he think that the woman be trash and he be just place they where he think they belong well we can not be sure of anything yet Franklin be an isolated fishing community that be be hit really hard by the current economy add to that a series of unsolved murder and everyone be on edge the local sheriff 's out of his depth and Alaska have not handle a serial investigation since Robert Hansen in the eighty we will fly out tonight everybody can sleep on the plane Garcia I need you with we Sir I 've task a satellite uplink and it be your job to keep we connect yes sir this town be already on the brink and if this pattern continue we 've only get another day until the next murder let us finish this fast nature in her most dazzling aspect or stupendous part be but the background and theater of the tragedy of man John Morley this guy be all over the map Crosses sex and race boundary he change his kill method it say to I he be disorganize yet there be not print at any of the crime scene and he isolate his victim wear glove and make sure there be not any witness that be a no brainer but what concern I be the evolution of the kill Evolution well he start with easy prey Jon Baker be in his mid sixty it be relatively low risk for a first timer Dedaimia Swanson be in her early fifty she would not be that difficult to overpower but he do not have to overpower either one of they both victim be shoot which be my point exactly he kill they both from a safe distance but Brenda bright be young more athletic she would have be able to put up much more of a fight so why not shoot she too that support the disorganized theory maybe he do not get what he want from his first two victim Brenda bright be an attractive woman he use an arrow but he do not shoot she with it he stab she I think we all know what that mean when we land in Anchorage there will be a float plane to take we to Franklin when we get there Morgan and Prentiss work the crime scene we need to know exactly how he ambush his victim Reid and Rossi the body find out what you can there jj and I will work victimology and Garcia town record find we something we can use of course sir I should let everybody know that reception in the area be unreliable at well I be give everybody satellite phone for communication and I 've already preprogramme all your digit into speed dial Guess who be lucky number 7 welcome to Franklin I be deputy flack be these the dock that Brenda bright be work the night she be kill all right we will get start here Agent Hotchner Sheriff Rhodes very nice to meet you good to meet you sir ma'am hi so I can not tell you how grateful I be that you all could come the people here be really start to act up I be afraid our little town 's a bit of a powder keg where would you like we to set up sir you see there be not much room at the station because that be also the post office but I have make arrangement for you to work out of Carol 's tavern which be right over there thank you well thank you appreciate it it be pretty isolated out here how do you get basic supply Float plane bring grocery and hardware delivery on a weekly basis and fisherman and hunter provide the town 's meat supply I be Craig Ramey you all the FBI what give we away you be sure pack an awful lot of stuff for a fishing trip I be not go fish get the hell out of dodge before it be I or my wife put in the ground do you know Brenda well everyone do she be sweet she be pull a haul just as good as any guy on these dock as soon as I get my house board up I be head out suggest you do the same Susan I can not say that I blame he with what be be go on I be surprised more people be not try to leave this be Keith grave he be with Brenda the night she die Mr Graves do you notice anything out of the ordinary the night of the murder I offer to wait for her but she insist I head up to town without her what be you two do that night we finish for the day I leave she stick around to clean the fish that she want to take home she usually walk home alone Brenda say that walking be good for the soul how far be it into town a half a mile the unsub could have wait for she anywhere appreciate your time Sheriff ask I to keep everyone on ice till you get here still I can not believe someone from Franklin would be capable of this what convince you she be stab with the arrow instead of shot Upward angle at the point of entry he would have have to be shoot from beneath her there be not much leave Forest get to he first I find urine on the remain Urine I think it be from the animal who scavenge his body but I get the lab result back this morning the urine be human be he mark his victim only find it on Jon both the woman be clean Jon be shoot 3 time the unsub graze he twice and then hit he in the head Dedaimia Swanson be only shoot once the first kill show hesitation uncertainty he be not confident take the terminal shoot it be either accidental or spur of the moment but the second kill he only need one shot he be progress quickly be you close with the victim an occupational hazard when you be the only doctor in town I deliver Brenda never think I would outlive her look at the cut on her torso they be shallow and non penetrate not necessary for the murder you know what these be make postmortem he be play with the body experiment with his methodology someone incapable of remorse we be deal with a psychopath have you determine whether or not she be rape I do not even think to look your report say the assault occur here that be right there be a trail of blood come from that direction I do not see any blood we cover it up you contaminate the scene we have to we 've get a rabid bear in the wood it be be ripping maller game to shred a creature like that smell blood he will come into town no hesitation ok you say the other two victim be find similar to this Jon be find on the edge of the wood Dedaimia be up by crest fall it be a popular hiking route who would know their routine everyone Cup of coffee Jace what be you do try to make this place a little less analog sorry I forget my hacker joke be not funny my name be Penelope I be the one who do not carry a weapon aside from my biting wit and my job include combine my kick ass system with your sheriff 's department database to get the skinny on your neighbor and you or you could just ask we what you want to know I mean be not it well to just talk to we directly than look up our dirt secretly no because in my experience the information superhighway never lie and people do your name would be Josh my mom Carol she own the place it go like this here we be Joshua Beardsley age 23 bear right here in Franklin AK Moved to Anchorage for middle and High School Majored in hotel management at Seattle u and you move back home a few week ago perfect time huh I come home people start die Hmm that be when I check your criminal record and you my friend be clean as a whistle what do that even mean no idea no dirt anyway so I guess I be safe then for now those two get into it last night Bob here he be our new resident so uh Tom figure well this be the guy who be do all the killing he decide to smash he over the head with a bottle of booze look I do not know what to do have you think about have a kind of town hall meeting where you get everybody together and talk about the fact of the case the town 's too spread out I mean everybody be do what they can just to get by you know Sheriff I know people move to these remote location to be leave alone but what happen last night be go to keep happen and people be go to start take matter into their own hand well I can keep order in my own town but people around here I mean this be Alaska man they do what they want he be already experiment with his victim he violate Brenda bright with an arrow and he be incite panic People who have live here most of their life be pack up to leave can you blame they we have a psychopath whose hunting ground be a town of 1 400 people Most of they grow up learn to kill animal and start fire it sound like your basic survival skill no they be hunt skill think about it the marksmanship the urine it make sense the urine make sense it be a hunter 's trick you urinate downwind to keep the animal away he try to preserve Jon Baker 's body so it would be discover intact all right so we 've get a psychopath with hunting skill who know the routine of everyone in town how be we suppose to keep everyone safe Sheriff I suggest you institute a curfew until we have the unsub in custody nobody out after dark I will have one of my deputy patrol around the clock Garcia how be it come with town record I 've run everyone who be be print through CODIS nothing 's come up so far I be go to pull an all night Finish go through the town record should have background check by sunrise good the rest of we should get some sleep start fresh in the morning I 've get 4 of the upstairs room available uh 4 come on that be the good we can do your team be double the size of my department I will see you in the morning good night it look like we will have to double up I be not sleep with Reid Dibs what do you mean you be share a room with Morgan oh you be jealous Jealous why because you be bed down with a Muscle bind modern day 007 Mm he be more like Jason Bourne oh what be there to be jealous about he take the floor ok just just make sure he keep his weapon holstere ok why be you up right now anyway it be so late actually it be early I just get to Quantico Ohh Damn time zone hello hello hello Ohh Frak oh come on baby Come on come on come on nice one Garcie look at I hey you be go to be ok my name 's Penelope you be go to be ok you be go to be ok just keep look at I help help please somebody come help here someone be hurt please his name 's Craig Ramey Fisherman Morgan and I meet he this morning he be pack up to leave he be accelerate his schedule we should have have another day why change that Ramey be pretty vocal about want to get out of town if the unsub know that he could have strike early to prevent his target from get away there have to be more to it than that he bring the body to the tavern we be stay at he be tell we that he be not afraid of we he be gain confidence he switch to a hunting knife look like a jagged edge there be more physical damage too like he be cut open I will not know until Dr Johnson do an autopsy but I would be willing to bet he take a piece of the victim with he what kind of piece it be hard to say but judge from the location I would guess liver or spleen he be alive what he be still alive Baby there be nothing else you could have do I feel he leave he be there one second and then just a body I be really sorry that you have to see all of that Derek I I do not see I be in it I be sort of use to see horrible thing from the safety of my screen every day but this be right there why do not you go and find someone before you run out there because when I got shoot I remember think the last thing I be ever go to see in this life be the man who kill I and I could not let that happen to he he have to see something good before he die you run right towards the unsub you could have be kill I know that do not treat I like I be the victim all right I be sorry I want to ask you a couple of question all right no I I tell you everything I see you say the man 's face be mostly in shadow but there be also a lot of blood on it you might have see more than you actually realize no cognitive interview break someone 's death down to a science and statistic that be your world Derek not mine I will help from mine Penelope Derek let she go will you look after her please yeah of course be Garcia able to give you any new information she be give all she can this guy be taunt we he be one step ahead I think you be give he more credit than he deserve it be like Emily say on the plane he be all over the place the victimology 's inconsistent the methodology 's evolve the first kill be sloppy hesitant and unplanne it be an accident but it trigger a sexual response he get off on it and he know then and there he have to kill again he learn how to get the job do more efficiently yeah but why the organ Consumption typically indicate a desire to keep the victim with they he be have trouble let go we be probably look for someone with severe abandonment issue it will be light soon let us get everybody together and go over what we know we be look for an emotionally immature male probably in his mid to late twenty who suffer a traumatic loss now this loss could be anything death of a parent separation of a spouse a love one who move away something that make the unsub feel abandon and alone he will have extensive hunting experience the body be bury not because of remorse they be bury to protect they from wild animal his familiarity with the victim ' routine suggest the unsub have live here for most of his life he also have extensive knowledge of the landscape and surrounding so we should split up and cover the town Focus on young resident with a history of petty crime and assault you should look in their trash fireplace even in laundry look for sign of bloody clothe or even cut and bruise one of the victim may have get in a good blow or two before they die bring in anyone who seem to have something to hide the unsub have already break pattern so he could strike again at any time Sheriff you and I need to look at the school talk to the teacher see if she remember any student exhibit early sign of homicidal tendency let us move Dedaimia be only one month away from retirement I can not believe she be go we be very sorry for your loss I need to ask about your former student do you remember any of they enjoy hunt too much so much that it worry you all the boy around here like it too much they have competition to see who be the well shot this would have be extreme do you remember anyone who might have torture animal or play with they before he kill they that sound like someone you know I 've never see anyone enjoy hunt as much as Joshua Beardsley he be the tavern owner 's son yes the young boy in town to bag a deer that be all he ever talk about he hunt something nearly every day he be bear and raise here he return a couple of week ago after his dad die how old be he 23 sure we need to talk to he all right thank you what be this about the strike be above the gut it keep the meat from spoil be not that right on a deer maybe doubt it would be the same for a human but then he do something interesting he take the victim 's spleen now tell I why would he do that no idea Let us stop play game Joshua answer my question and maybe I will believe you it be a native hunting tradition be not it eat part of the kill Gain the life force of your prey not many people know that I be not many people where do you learn to hunt bag my first deer when I be 7 that be pretty young my dad teach I how to live off the land I eat the heart of my first kill that prove you be a true hunter so you enjoy hunt it be my favorite thing to do then would you say you take pleasure in the kill do not everyone actually no they do not what do you think I be not sure he fit the profile but he be act like a man with nothing to hide the attack cycle 's accelerate he should strike tonight and if he do not we know we 've get our guy in custody what if he do I hate to say it but half this town match most of your profile what be you guy work on Hotch ask if we would go through Garcia 's background profile try to find a link between Joshua and the 4 victim you find anything they all have hunt license Needle meet haystack we need the big gun rip and ready to rumble maybe you should sit this one out no Jaje I be ok put this bastard where he belong Joshua Beardsley yeah we think he be our

someone strong than you realize you care enough to risk your own life to try and save someone else yeah but what be the difference between be strong and be jade I be scared Derek I do not want to lose who I be just so I can do this job we be in one of the most beautiful place on earth I know you see that do not you yeah then we have nothing to worry about it be who you be baby girl you see the beauty in everything and everyone no matter where you go that part of you be never go to change and I will not let it I do not need you to protect I Tough I think I be go to stay on the job a little while long yeah how much long every day of my life I kind of love you Derek Morgan I kinda love you Penelope Garcia just a little Ralph W Sockman say nothing be so strong as gentleness and nothing be so gentle as real strength this be Dorris Archer she be the third woman to go miss in Boise Idaho this year along with Paula Renmar and Samantha Rush they go miss roughly 2 month apart hello do you join a boy band no ok so what be we look at here late 20 early 30 all single though two be in committed relationship all live on their own look like normal suburban house give the unsub privacy the difference be more striking than the similarity different hair color different body shape what about his m o that be why we be invite in the abduction site be pristine there be no dna besides the victim there be no sign of force entry or a struggle the victim be not report miss until 2 or 3 day after they be abduct 2 or 3 day woman like this do not just vanish without somebody notice yes which be why I ask Garcia to dig into their life and when I take a look at their online activity I could easily see how the unsub be do it social networking site Facebook Twitter you name an online life share time suck the victim be on it if you look at each of their last post they say kind of the same thing go out of town go on a business trip go on a vacation but when you look at the time and date stamp of each of these cue the twilight zone music 'cause they be all post the morning after each of they go miss the unsub post they social network be an easy way for an unsub to target his victim these woman be especially open they post everything they be have for dinner to where they be go on date so this unsub friend his victim and then use that as a cover once he take they that mean he can hack into their account he be excellent with computer definitely profile as patient and organize he be obsessive enough to remove all forensic detail but also patient enough to wait 2 month before abduction he can afford to be he get 3 day to do whatever he want to these woman that mean we need to assume these woman be already dead the question be what he do while he have they Criminal Team http expert heberg forum net the single big problem with communication be the illusion that it have take place George Bernard Shaw so if this unsub be use social network to find his victim can not we use that to find he if these woman each have 100 friend follow they then the unsub would pop up on each of their list right the Detective in charge John Fordham he look into their group everyone check out social networking site be surprisingly insecure Facebook recently try to update all privacy setting and in do so they make everybody 's profile viewable can somebody explain to I the appeal of these site eat Sushi tonight Yum Boss be keep I late at work whose life be so important that we would be interested in this kind of detail I guess that be the running joke right I mean nobody be but we would all like to believe there be actually an audience out there that want to follow our every move some site actually have a GPS feature build in you can tell exactly where someone be every time they post a new comment this be tell we how he be find they but it be not tell we how he be get into their house at the very least I believe that he have copy of their key Dorris Archer have a home security system instal but the disable code be enter at 1 56 a m so he know that too he also find a way to deal with her dog a german Shepherd she adopt from the pound last year go miss the night that she do so this guy be get to be in and out of the house well before the night of the disappearance he come up with some ruse talk his way inside then once he be familiar enough with the house he know he can come back and kidnap they without disturb anything what about the people who come into your house that you do not consider a threat home repair guy dog walker Detective Fordham look into that too no one even come close to be a killer Morgan and Prentiss start with the last abduction site see if anything point to his M o Dave you Reid and JJ go back over the woman 's life start with their friend on the social networking site if this be how the unsub be find they maybe they be connect to he without even realize it Detective Fordham Agent Jareau yeah these be SSA Hotcher Rossi and Dr Spencer Reid thank you for come we can really use your help do you find anyone willing to talk to we about the victim the problem be not who to bring in it be who not to the man we be look for might have find your daughter through her social network do Paula mention anyone new in her life no no one who start follow she as a friend someone she do not recognize I do not really know how those work someone send I an email congratulate I on Paula 's promotion I do not even know and when I ask she she say Mom I put that on my wall last week she be go 2 day later Samantha be rigorous about keep her status update she be obsess with those site so I be assume she know who follow she then God no she have over 1 000 friend why so many we both work in real estate she see it as the perfect way to promote herself even though she tell all those people what she be do she do not know who be follow her you ever have so much email you feel like you be drown in it actually I do not have email seriously then let I break it down for you these website be like email on crack it be impossible to keep up with everybody we just have a few more question about your girlfriend 's disappearance do Dorris ever mention let someone in her home like who we be just try to figure out who would know the code to her home security it must have be someone she trust with the combination no she be smart she take precaution that be the whole reason she get Bruno Bruno the dog so he be a guard dog yeah she train he for like 6 week I know these be hard to look at but do you see anything different something he may have do to get himself inside this be not right what be that the photograph this be when we first start date the one on the right should be on the left and she would not have rearrange they herself no she arrange they a certain way to tell a story it be how we fall in love ok jj I get it you see it actually yeah look like he do try to hang something on the wall there be even a little residue leave over let I call you back what do you get I get one up here too what would he try to hang on that part of the wall from here I have an unobstructed view of the second floor and down the stair it be the same thing down here you can see the entire entrance camera he put up camera we think this be what he be use to spy on his victim they be small they be cheap and they be easily hide behind photo book or plant the footage they record can then be transmit anywhere Website of your choice even your cell phone he can toggle between camera to see everything that be happen in the house you find 5 of these at different point in the house Upstairs downstairs bedroom even the bath a ruse get he in the door but it do not buy he enough time to put up 5 of these right that be why we think he start with one camera face the front door that tell he when it be safe to enter the house when she come and go when the dog walker come and what the combination to the house be it fit his m o it he learn their every detail on social network he will be just as obsessive in his surveillance and once he learn their routine all he have to do be pick the lock put up the rest of the camera he get their whole life at his fingertip what do he do with the video maybe he keep they if he be a voyeur yes voyeur be rarely violent their excitement come from spy without the object know they be be watch and by abduct his victim he be remove the outlet of his sexual release Reid be right so he must have some other agenda with these camera he might be share the footage with other people we need to have Garcia dig into surveillance in illegal video website I be go to take this with we why we originally profile there be not any facial similarity between the victim but I be not so sure that be true I want to compare Dorris ' picture with the other victim these video the unsub take it look like one of they he post online which may help I nab he if he put it on the web can not you track that back directly to his computer normally yes normally in like in 17 second I can get you the network he be use get a physical address of his modem and presto change o no more bad guy but this unsub be a creepy computer aficionado do you guy know what a proxy server be it be an internet relay precisely kid use they to get around block site now usually one proxy be plenty but this piece of work be use dozen of proxy server he be bounce his signal off of China north Korea Russia South Africa Garcia can you trace he back to Boise of course I can and that be what I be do Time be the unfortunate ingredient I need though this just in look like one of the proxy server archive what he be stream on the night of Dorris archer 's disappearance can we see it pull it up now well Prentiss and Morgan be right he know the house and the dog know he please do not hurt that doggie how many trip inside the house would that take a dozen see that the camera 's attach to he it be his point of view so he can relive it over and over again ok can someone tell I when this be over please not yet he be tender to her she mean more to he as a corpse than as a live person Garcia we need to find the unsub 's network even if it be a rough area it will help narrow the geographic profile Sir that be totally what I be try to figure out there be something else kind of huge you need to know about do you see this line of code there yeah what about they it allow the user admin and in this case the unsub to set up a chat room People be watch this on the night of the murder we think he be post these after the fact he be not he want people to experience it with he he want an audience he have fan can you freeze that he be acknowledge the camera Tip of the hat to his fan he know they be watch classic narcissistic behavior he be perform for his audience we know the m o the question be how what kind of job give he access to the victim ' house it have to be network and I T S the guy you let in to hook up your internet get he in their house and on their computer I go through all the woman 's internet service provider with a fine tooth comb they all use different company and no overlap with sale rep what about onsite tech support clean as a whistle they all have alibis with no criminal record what I do not understand be why do he take the body with he after they be dead it would be one thing if he take they while they be still alive but he be accomplish his task he murder they and he complete the performance so why take the risk of carry a corpse to your car well there must be some postmortem behavior or signature or something we be not see we be not see well think about that for a second he be share this murder with a crowd of onlooker what could he be do to these body just for himself Hey guy Garcia 's get something for we go ahead baby girl ok friend I have some good news but first here be the thing that suck I locate the network the unsub be use in Boise and it be the victim ' own wireless so do he hack in before he start with the murder Hacking be obscenely time consume I just make it look easy because I be a genius but he be not I so my guess be that he be get to lurk around their network for at least a couple of day to a week before he kill they that be pretty brilliant on his part he know when we follow his online paper trail that it will lead we right back to the murder site what be the good news hacker be very loyal to their spoof technique and if they think no one be watch hey'll use the same road over and over ok so if he go through Russia China and north Korea again I have flag those server and if he use they in the same order I will catch he so fast that be only go to help we if he commit another murder yes that be also true excuse I Garcia if he do stream this again how much time will you need to find the network that be hard to guess with all the international pinging I Ballpark 7 minute that be not fast enough he be in and out of the house in 5 I be go to have to trim my time down then Garcia get it do JJ we need to call a press conference now that we know how he be kill these woman we need to get it out there all right I will prescreen the journalist I call on hope we do not get anything out of left field Good I know what connect the victim I be stare at picture of the victim and I know there be a pattern connect they but I could not tell what it be until I break it down mathematically why be we so draw to celebrity face because there be a symmetry to their beauty the eye the ear the ratio of the forehead to the chin the more balanced they be the more appealing they be to our eye these woman be not celebrity though no but there be similarity between they and it be not until I scan their picture and get it to the guy at Quantico that I have a full breakdown all right strip away eye color hair color and skin tone and what be we leave with geometrically they be all slightly dystopic the left eye be slightly low than the right eye on all the victim all the nose be narrow the forehead have the same Ridge he might not even be aware that he see it in they there have be study that suggest that we pick our spouse subconsciously base on a facial symmetry that we recognize so consciously or unconsciously when he recognize it he have to destroy it which mean he only have interest in the body as they relate back to he maybe they be a reflection remember what he do at the end of the video he wipe the tear away another act of compassion he be not capable of his narcissism prevent he from that in the greek myth narcissus be so self absorb that he fall in love with his own reflection in the water exactly he find woman with the same face he strangle they and then stare at they after they 've die but whose image do he really see his own thank you Most of we take the internet for grant we forget about text that we share or update we put on social network but the internet never forget once it be out there it be out there forever now we all know about the horrific death that get show on the web the murder of a journalist the stoning of an iranian dissident those murder be immortal and this unsub crave that same immortality he recognize his face on theirs and he kill they as a way of say this be what I look like we think this also inform his compulsion to take the body with he he take they to a secondary location where we believe he preserve they so that every time he look at they he see his own ego reflect fortunately for we this mean we have a good idea of what he look like base on the shape of the victim ' face we have a rough composite sketch this unsub be an expert with computer and home network so look into criminal record of man with extensive computer training we know you 've already look into the victim ' computer I T setting so we would like to expand the search look into electronic store Computer distributor I T Departments where the woman work we overuse the term narcissistic in our culture but we be go back to the psychological definition every aspect of this man 's life have be construct around an inflated sense of self Unsubs like this be particularly vulnerable to what be call narcissistic injury if his self worth be attack or damage he will lash out so if you find this unsub do not challenge he publicly say you just want to talk he see if he know anything about the the brilliant mastermind who be stalk these woman under no circumstance should you denigrate he as difficult as it be we need to talk up his exploit as if we respect he search for wireless server find kitgirl29 this be a sketch of the man we be look for he be a white male roughly 5'10 he be highly skilled with computer and network we encourage everyone to monitor the information they post about themselves on social network do not document the detail of your day do not post picture of yourself friend or family all right we will take some question yeah how do the FBI generate this sketch if there be no eyewitness it be a approximation base on a video we recover ok yeah what be your question can you comment on the rumor he have some sort of facial symmetry with his victim do he look like they right now the Boise police be pursue several theory that be not a no why would he target woman who look like he it be too soon to speculate on how or why he choose his victim well what should people do to protect themselves change their face no just update your online security and be vigilant about what you post all right we be do with question thank you thank you Hotch somebody leak our profile the press start ask question about facial symmetry it must have be one of your officer look my guy be check their cell phone but that be just habit now all right I can talk to the press independently I can keep this off the 10 00 news but I know it go out live well what be the chance he do not see it not good oh your crafty little sicko Sir it be fantastic you call I just figure out how be you do on pin down the network ok that be what I be try to tell you remember how I say he be spoof his signal off different server well it turn out some of those be a decoy mean to waste my time so do that mean you can find he fast totally totally I can write a program that filter out the decoy oh crap be that he yeah uh ok it look like I be go to have to filter this on the fly can you send we the feed I think I can intercept it in Ukraine he be go live look at the way he be move he be not slow and deliberate this guy 's pissed all right what do we see determine marker a one story cottage it could be anywhere be there a number on the house no and he be already at the door Garcia he be use twice as many proxy server wait this window here on the bottom be that the chat room there she be he be in the house guy he be completely change his m o it be way too early there be too much light what happen someone ask the wrong question at the press conference oh my God turn around just turn around maybe she can fend he off New kitchen appliance can we track they through work order he will be go by then Garcia give we something I be stateside now I be almost to Idaho you be not go to make it I just need more time yes I will I will I forget the unsub can you run a trace on everybody in the chat room I can not do both sir let I do this Garcia tag the viewer that be an order Baby girl it be go to be ok no no it be not it be bad enough that there be be so much death around I but this guy be all up in my turf and he be really good at what he do for really awful reason that be why you be go to find the pervert that watch it happen in that chat room and we will nail they to the wall and they be go to give up the unsub no no that be not good enough I want to watch he suffer I want to watch he bleed oh God I just scare myself Good that be a good thing because if there be one thing I 've learn the hard way be the last person you want to tick off be miss Penelope Garcia Ohh that be a compliment right yes it be we will beat this guy believe that now I will call you when we 've get something ok her name be Allison Kittridge 29 this be her first house all right so this unsub accelerate his timetable and his m o he be move fast because he be angry yeah the press conference tell he something about himself he do not like so he rush which mean he make a mistake now what be it well it be not the camera he remember to take those with he it be not the body he take that with he too hey do uh Garcia find anything unusual with Allison 's wireless no Records show that it be a basic DSL installation hey Prentiss yeah help I move this table what do you get you see this line right here yeah this be what bring the internet from the street into the house ok so this be not DSL it be not it be a fiber optic cable completely different type of connection we just find his mistake if there be already an internet connection in the house why do he bring his own with he be it the upload speed Fiber optic allow he to stream large amount of video and maintain a chat room that be dozen of computer connect to he at once he would need a lot of bandwidth for something like that we check all the isp why do not he turn up I get mail phone call people knock on my door all the time to see if I want to upgrade my internet yeah I get they too and they will offer to come inside and demonstrate how much fast their connection be you think that be the ruse that get he in the door it make sense during his demonstration he would have access to his victim ' computer on his way out he ask for a glass of water a distraction something to buy enough time to plant that first camera we need to find out what company own this cable Detective Fordham 's already hunt that down and there be an I d number on it so it should not take long we will have JJ and Reid follow up I need you two to track down who be in the chat room Garcia finish her sweep yeah Most be international 3 be local I bet one of they know the unsub FBI we have a warrant help you gentleman Austin Chapman yeah that be I FBI we need talk to you about a video you watch last night I be sorry what video this be a warrant for all the computer in your possession you be under arrest for accessory to murder Accessory watch a murder happen online and do nothing about it be a felony I do not know what you be talk about what murder yes this be our cable Mrs Hightower we go over your record and it turn out that none of the 4 victim sign up with your service 4 God those poor woman we think it be an employee use your cable as a ruse to get into the house can you think of any Mac Jones uh he work on one of our truck as we lay the fiber in with the regular phone line and you be certain that it be he we catch he hoard it he say it be for a home project until we get angry phone call that he be go door to door offer free fiber optic installation we fire he on the spot we need his information absolutely Ladies and gentleman meet Mac Jones that be not the I D we get from the phone company that be because last year Mr Jones have his identity steal the unsub take his license and his credit card use they for 2 week and then move on I can not tell you who the unsub be pretend to be now but since a picture 's worth a thousand database I can tell you who he be Robert Johnson 3 time loser arrest for possession of torture video spend some time in a halfway house before he disappear I find a blog of his online here be a quote next time you will not be able to stop I that be his narcissism again Furious that he got catch and he remake himself as a killer it allow he to free the impulse that be always there Garcia be there a pattern to the identity that he steal no he be really discipline about it once he burn through an identity he never use the same one again you know how I describe some suspect as be off the grid this guy be totally the opposite he be all over the grid he be manipulate the grid and he never stay in one place for very long so how do we find out who he be now I do not think we be go to the man know as Robert Johnson be in the wind if he be this flexible with his name his real name forget it but there be another way we can find he which be his online name his hacker handle that be the name that matter to he wait would not he have hundred of those too most definitely but remember how I say hacker be loyal they stick to certain name that be how you identify yourself to other hacker that be how the FBI catch I so if we find the handle I

we be go live on the 11 00 news you think he will be watch it be late he could already be hunt do you ever look at why this victim why this day why this crime always Hmm do you ever think they be just in the wrong place at the wrong time sometimes well I do not believe in coincidence how come do not get I wrong it be not like I talk to the universe or anything I 've just always believe that thing happen for a reason it be hard to find the reason for this though utterly meaningless crime no obvious motivation pure evil Evil can not be scientifically define it be an illusory moral concept that do not exist in nature its origin and connotation have be inextricably link to religion and mythology this offender have show no sign of any belief I be uh I be Spencer Reid Matt Spicer Jennifer Jareau the medium 's be ask for you yeah well nobody else around here want to talk to they I figure it have not hurt I yet uh they would like to interview you for the 11 00 news can we go over a few point absolutely the first 2 victim early this week downtown kill about 2 a m we find they when the sun come up not at noon right Vice be over there about 6 a m both these clock be stop at 12 00 be

go live now to Annie Danzi 's home we 've be tell the FBI have just arrive Agent Jareau Agent Jareau this be the second home invasion homicide that start since the blackout will you confirm that they be connect how be you go to keep the resident safe in these area we be work close with city official and LAPD to determine what step we need to take to ensure everyone 's safety will they call off the blackout not at this time Annie Danzi 30 single mom be her child home Spicer 's with he now so the power be out 10 00 to 1 00 all the same trick force entry no be there roll blackout last summer oh just about every year anything like this happen well crime always go up when it be hot and dark but this no way hunt in the dark be definitely a part of his signature Garcia yes sir I need you to check if there be any cluster of home invasion in previous summer during rolling blackout in California look statewide he leave a message this time a first time for everything you think he be welcome we who know at least he be tell we more with each crime scene Uneducated make the kid watch Sadistic trash the place even though there be not that much to steal Angry choose to hunt and kill in the dark do not want to be see why maybe he be ashamed of something well he do not have to knock those over he do not want any eye on he except the kid do not want he to miss a thing what you get there be that a robot it be a monster Monster huh what be it do it be protect you right it be go to make the man stay away do you happen to get a look at that man or be it too dark under the bed he move I to the closet and my mom tell I to close my eye would you mind show I how you do that that be good kid that be really really good so you do not see he at all once that man leave what do you do do you get back under the bed I do not want to leave she but you be scared hey Carter do you um do you have like a really cool backpack you could throw some thing in to take over to your cousin 's house it be in my room will you come with I you bet look I be really glad the kid do not see anything but it could have be helpful but cover his eye like that that mean he could not cover his ear force a child to witness this be clearly sadistic he destroy the boy 's innocence and take away his childhood this probably mirror the unsub 's own experience that be an excuse for what he be do there be no excuse for what he be do we be not justify anything everything he say everything he do tell we what make he tick that be all the message that he leave we be misspell which say that he be not well educate why do he leave one now that we do not know yet just because his recent attack be in Los Angeles do not mean he be from here kill in the dark be a must for he we believe that be why he be come to L A that and his willingness to kill random people tell we that he be an opportunistic offender and these type be incredibly difficult to predict and as you all know the roll blackout have be announce so resident can prepare for the few hour they will be in darkness unfortunately that also tell the killer whose window will be open whose alarm will be disarm the dark be his signature it be a habit and we will find that he be always kill this way 'cause he be a coward to some degree yes he also have intimacy issue he even turn photograph away from himself it be unlikely that a man like this have be in any kind of relationship there be also a good chance that he have some type of shortcoming whether real or perceive he be obviously self conscious about something like what it could be like a physical deformity it might be something really small to we but it mean everything to he People just want to fit in have one thing that set he apart from the norm could be what lead he into the extreme solitude of a violent schizoid personality he take his victim ' power away literally and figuratively and he feed off of make they powerless we have rolling blackout all last summer and this guy be not around well he be now and base on the vicious nature of his crime the press have name he the prince of darkness Prince that will fuel his ego yeah he be go to be all over the news once we unravel his need for darkness we will find he what if he come back he will not he can not hurt you again ok how do you know you do not find he you be right but I will she should have know well who your mom she try to fight he but he have a gun why do she do that she need to protect you Carter the man who do this he be very bad ok I be go to find he I promise ok all right thank you yeah Prentiss what be the plan Rolling blackout be still schedule for tonight How 's LAPD go to patrol it with the number of call they 've be get they be stretch thin already then they get to cancel it that be the battle if they do that the whole city could go dark if the power grid get overwhelmed you be right that be not go to work LAPD 's outnumber 10 000 to 1 all right keep I post do you tell she that we be go to need to talk to Carter Again tomorrow he will not remember anything we have psychological marker thing that could help he out you want to make he relive it if it will help we catch this guy yes you see he he feel helpless weak there be nothing he could have do about it but he be go to keep blame himself you know Carter do not reveal that much how come you know all this because when I be a kid I lose my parent how drunk driver and you be in the car no you seem to have some insight as if you witness it maybe because I picture it a thousand time my parent they be race home 'cause I be sick if they have not leave right then they would have miss that intersection and there would not have be a red light I lose my father when I be 9 year old he be shoot and kill right in front of I
