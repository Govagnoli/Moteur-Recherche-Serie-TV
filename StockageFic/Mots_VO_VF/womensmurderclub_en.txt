questionable the powder I find in reece 's carpet be vermiculite it be a mineral often use in insulation or fireproofing there be no other source in her place so it could have come off which lend credence to the theory that she be murder and she probably know her killer because I doubt that dog of hers would have let a stranger in which probably lead we back to the pacific shores retirement

I also open up pacific shore ' financial record I be go to need a forensic accountant to dig through it all but it look like somebody be make some very bad investment but dennis would not have have access to that no but somebody somebody like administrator alan douglas he be invest money he be suppose to be hold in trust for the resident and keep the profit for himself until the market crash do you know that he use to be a nurse guess where he go to school university of huatulco mexico baby so alan douglas need to reple the money he lose invest why not drug smuggling he have the mexican

down Hell of a temper like his father you think jamie have it in he to uh kill a man like I say apple do not fall far Ben cooper 's false testimony cause a severe miscarriage of justice Seven year ago D d A Tracy welling be a highly respected member of my office I be sorry your honor the d a 's key eyewitness be about to recant an assertion base on a printout from a web page of jamie galvan 's a suppose uh e Mail from ben cooper a man who be now dead and can neither confirm or deny any of this you can not take this seriously somebody take it seriously Ben cooper end up dead last night sorry sorry your honor under the rule of plain error Paul galvan must be grant a new trial Paul galvan 's romantic advance have be reject by the victim on numerous oh I 've be reject plenty of time and that do not make I a murderer Galvan be an ex Con and a blackout drunk with a violent temper and and ben cooper a reliable eyewitness come forward of his own volition and give an exact description of paul galvan leave d d A Tracy welling 's apartment on the night of her murder Ms Bernhardt anything to add I believe my colleague have say more than enough your honor I be inclined to agree Tracy welling 's family have wait seven year for justice Paul galvan have be wait for justice as well your honor I 've hear nothing to suggest that he have not receive it and since this letter from ben cooper to jamie galvan can not be verify as genuine neither can we verify ben cooper 's allege intention to recant application for stay of execution be summarily deny all we be ask be for the time to find out the truth Ms Thomas I would rather not have you arrest for contempt well would you rather go what be you do here oh other than to offer my belate yet heartfelt apology for set up your takedown which I only do because I know that my friend will help you I got arrest for contempt of court we have this total neocon judge he turn down the stay didn he yeah listen tell your friend that I say thank and get I the hell outta here you should be nice to her she determine what happen to you what be you talk about first of all today 's judge be not the end of the road the next stop be the u S Court of appeal Second I do the eliminary blood type on jamie 's d n A and it be not a match to the fingernail scraping from ben cooper 's body prove that jamie do not kill ben cooper last night you see I tell ya so be that pizza some form of apology do you want the breadstick or not she be sorry that she do not believe you whicleave the kidnapping do you want to press charge over a little fake gunplay Nah I be cool thank I have to ask I too be decline to press charge for assault on a police officer so guess what do match the fingernail scraping we get off ben cooper 's body the unidentified blood find in tracy welling 's apartment in 2000 what be the odd unless the same person murder they both which mean that tracy welling 's killer be still out there and still kill people and paul galvan be about to be execute for a crime he do not mmit we have 24 hour to catch a double murderer and to save your father 's life hey honey I be sorry I never come home last night I 've be work on a writ of habeas corpus to try to get an execution postpone we 've get 17 hour leave I will call you later I love you why the guilty look you be not lie to he at least not about work all night on an 80 Page writ support mainly by what hope Chutzpah u know this be a hail mary I certainly do but I can never resist a challenge we need more coffee oh you got to be kid I I be have jacobi track down all of ben cooper 's old drug acquaintance the uni be canvass his neighborhood again meanwhile tom be call everyone who know our lawyer victim tracy well back in the day what be I miss how about a plan from you I be throw everything against the wall not about the case about tom what if you find out you be pregnant oh I be not even think about that right now okay maybe just a little would you keep the baby of course and when would you tell tom before or after the wedding because if it be before you know he will probably call it off I be not try to break up tom 's engagement all right so you be try to improve his relationship with heather by have sex with he we do not even know if I be pregnant so take a damn test it be probably nothing claire and until you know for sure you get to feel like it could be something right I appreciate your help but you can not have it both way be there any chance that I could finish my coffee before you have one of your moment this be a transcript of ben cooper 's deposition from 2000 from the miss court archive it be leave under my door whoever leave the file clearly wish to remain anonymous yesterday d a Pratt say n cooper give an exact description of paul galvan these transcript make it clear that be a lie excuse we Sure now you never hear this from I when tracy welling be murder she be have an affair with d a Pratt and he do not recuse himself from the trial and you know and you do not say anything at the time I be convince by the evidence against paul galvan but the other night when you tell I that Ben cooper plan to recant his eyewitness testimony I remember his eay deposition which d a Pratt take if he suborn perjury from ben cooper then he would want to keep it a secret now Pratt have a motive to kill ben cooper I do not think that I would go that far I be sure you would not because that trial make your career you move into tracy welling 's old office after paul galvan be find guilty but you can not help I try to undo the case and hope to remain unaffected I never claim to be unaffected the reason I know about the affair be because tracy welling be my friend how do you think it feel to sit at her desk and wonder if we get the wrong guy Denise when the truth come out you will not be tell anyone I be your source on this I be sure your doctor boyfriend would hate to find out what happen last month with hanson on your desk our office wall be very thin I know you be a busy man so uh if you have to head out at any point just you know anyway uh I talk to my people and explain that there be no reason for they to go dig into a 7 Year Old murder trial Good I be sorry do you all need the room oh we will not be long you sure uh we can head up to my office do not do it he will start show you his baseball memorabil you will

the bet I do not mind go ahead okay I have a witness in a murder case yeah this witness see the murderer but he do not quite know how to describe the guy be it okay if I jog his memory a little you know suggest specific to he you would be get into murky water there legally speak see that be what I think so if I feed the guy an exact description and have he repeat it back to I chapter and verse that would pretty much be out of the question yeah legally speak but that be not what I say you should do I mean that would be what do you call it witness tamper or or be that suborn perjury I be sure the lieutenant would ver suggest that course of action oh no no no no he be not the one that give I the idea I actually be read a transcript of a deposition that you take in 2000 the witness ' name be ben cooper thank you for the coffee Ben cooper be a witness in the murder of d d A Tracy welling I hear a rumor that you be sleep with she back then in my experience once you find the lover you usually find the killer if you have any other question I will invite my lawyer to join we how long do we have leave six hour I wish I could compel a d n a Sample a look at the back of his neck would do I be think about how our janitor fight with his attacker Claire say that ben have the killer 's blood under four fingernail on each hand but not under his thumbnail like he be try to hold the murderer off you know maybe he get his hand around the guy 's neck that be where ben would 've scratch his attacker I know d a Prt he will not move a muscle till his lawyer get here well he get away with murder once he think he be go to do it again I really should go see claire while we wait I will leave you to it while I gather affidavit for my court petition wish I luck you and I both leave the band aid okay here be what I be think seven year ago ve the band aid d A Pratt coach ben cooper and skew his eyewitness testimony because d a Pratt be the real killer and he be frame paul galvan to take the fall Mm hmm Flash forward to the present Ben cooper know that paul galvan 's execution be only a few day away he finally develop a conscience and want to recant his old testimony maybe he ask d a Pratt about it Pratt go to see he tell he to stay quiet they argue they fight and ben cooper end up dead good theory but hard to prove Ben cooper 's in the drawer over there and d a Pratt be not

nivaldo if he want his daughter he be go to have to turn himself in well he be not go to live that long if we do not get to he first where the hell do he go Morgue now okay apparently I have to go down to the morgue I have to go break the news to denise it be a pleasure know you both I know that look I do not like it Nivaldo quiroga flee the hospital and the ice ent nadia want to take his little girl this just get well I think maybe you could take she on that reporter cindy thomas be all over this you play this right think of the headline act district attorney file an injunction against homeland security to reunite a father and daughter you think you know I so well do not you well I be go to help you anyway I will talk to her thank denise do not bother this be rivero I hear the be on the lookout for nivaldo on my police scanner so I start thinkin ' where do illegal immigrant go when they be on the run from the police Sanctuary church the uni be on it but uni as in guy in uniform as in not the folk that these folk be go to talk to grant they do not really talk to reporter either which be why it be lucky I have cultivate some contact in the mission district one of they tell I about rivero be that a gunshot wound it be through and through he will survive but I be sure it hurt like hell come on the nun at st Mary 's be try to treat he he refuse to go to a hospital because hospital report gunshot wound and we know how that work so I tell he I have some friend who could help without go to the police I be the police yeah I I know but yeah not really so yeah really let us start with how he got shoot a few day ago two guy wear mask glove the whole scary robber bit break into rivero 's apartment on payday and when he fight back bullet to the rib cage sound familiar do he know the man who shoot he no idea but they know he have cash Chico hunter excuse I Chico hunter they be strong arm robber who target illegal immigrant I 've hear of case in L A and in miami but they target people they know will not go to the police that be despicable the hunter know their victim be getting pay right ask he if he be ever work for encinal bay builder there be two guy the construction foreman okay so they pay their worker end of the day then they wait until they get their money and then they put on mask and get the money back at gunpoint and whatever else their victim have manage to save up that be a nice way to turn a profit the foreman how be their spanish uh it be kind of not native Isela say the robber speak funny spanish I get to go what the hell be go on in here nothing you do not see he okay he be just here enjoy fine medical care okay I need to see you now this well be good what do you get right here to I or we be leave Dude come through my neighborhood a couple of hour ago he be lookin ' for a gun why do you think it be our guy he have blood on his shirt and he be wear a hospital bracelet sound like nivaldo he be not run he know who kill javier he be out to avenge his son uçnivaldo have a gun he be out on the street look for you right now tell we what you know about nivaldo I know I have nothing to do with any robbery good then you will not mind read this out loud for I bring she in hi sweetie Ready okay go ahead Dame tu dinero dime donde est su dinero have you hear those voice before Isela be you sure we just need you to

this transition as easy as possible for isela let us go isela I try God that woman be a bitch so isela may recognize their voice she may not recognize their voice which mean I can not even get you a search warrant meanwhile nivaldo be out there somewhere possibly septic with a gun and unlike we he know who he be after plus side he can not be move very fast he be in pain Ice be look for he have I mention how much I hate this weekend and what be that stench Trash can someone must have try to treat rivero 's wound with a homemade poultice yeah it be stinky do not you say that bruja sometimes serve as herbalist yeah you be think encinal bay builder be not the only link between javier nivaldo and rivero a bruja have client throughout the immigrant community People tell she their secret personal and financial she could have know that javier and nivaldo have 5 000 save for the coyote so what a 60 year old witch be the jesse james of the mission district think about it she get secret information from her client pass it on to her son and then sit back while they do the dirty work oh I think it be time I give this bruja 's crystal ball a shake there be a crazy guy in there put them down drop the gun put them down right now my mom he be get my mom put the gun down put it down back away from it nivaldo please I swear I have nothing to do with this put the gun down nivaldo she kill my son no I didn'T I do not know anything about it she be the only one I tell about the money I buy a charm to make the money grow she know it be for pilar to bring she from mexico you do not want to

walk up to you with a gun what do you do take out mine in this case you do not have one you either run or involuntarily back away he do not do either Colin definitely know his attacker so whoever do it shoot once watch he fall then bend down put the gun against his chest Linz tell I there be another suspect besides the girl not yet you just say whoever shoot he usually we assume he shoot he 'cause it be mostly man sometimes we say she if we think it be a woman you say whoever what be wrong with that I be ask you a question and you know it do the girl kill he let us hope not if you be think there be even a chance that girl do it do not say it outside this building I would not do that anyway Jacobi will find out her alibi be good the search warrant turn up nothing and we can all move on How be pete Sleep with he yet do not be shy or anything get it over with you will feel well Jill have you see this your pal cindy on the register 's web site say if kate hammond kill the boy it be because we do not do our job it probably do not say that exactly really Read the article Failure of the justice system should they have prosecute cut she off this piece be irresponsible like some grade b law professor know how to do my job actually he teach at stanford hi I call you for a comment you do not return my call a paragraph in you be say by not prosecute colin morse our office get he kill if it be kate hammond who pull the trigger if she do it have nothing to do with we there be no case to prosecute the rape kit show no bruise Kate hammond she she make out with five guy in one night she drink whiskey out of a shot glass Balanced on a boy 's crotch all we have be a rape counselor who believe she be traumatize and kate you have her testimony I do not have to defend this office to you the system fail kate hammond Cindy even if that be true and and we do not know that it be it do not justify kill the guy and do we put she in that position it sound terrible but what be she think go down to the basement with two boy wait a minute with her blouse half off what be you say she be ask for it that be outrageous okay okay enough round one over let us go she be way overreact that be fairly strange Kate hammond be a suspect right no comment Night linz you okay I be fine hey you remember the kendall case the security guard who shoot the drug dealer for harass his wife yeah you tell I about it on our second date one thing I never tell you about we go to arrest kendall at his house his kid be play in the front hall his wife there be toy all over the place and I look at he and I know that this be a decent guy who make one mistake when he be protect his wife against garbage but it be a homicide anyway I go back to my car and I cry linz I sit there alone behind the wheel and I cry I do what I have to do but I do not like do it you 've be down here for half an hour this be about the girl yeah it be about the girl they rape she and odd be she kill he and if

whether you sleep with your boyfriend yet that be incredibly offensive do you pick yes or no I only bet on sure thing where be we on the girl 's alibi well kate hammond go to a dorm party easily a hundred people we find 41 all of they see kate and our interview put she there until after 2 00 a m 41 drunk kid be something short of an ironclad alibi well out of the 41 only 8 really matter these be take from eight kid ' cell phone each be a photo of kate they be all take before midnight until just after 2 00 not more than 19 minute between any of them how far be the party from the track under half a mile that be plenty of time to leave the party kill he and get back there be one minor problem it be pour rain she be not wet in any of those picture and her hair be the same so she have to walk or drive half a mile if she drive there can not be any traffic she have to shoot he get back not get her clothe wet or change into identical clothe and keep her hair dry and do it all in 19 minute it be impossible I think you believe she do it I do so do I and all I be think be if it turn out she kill he I understand somebody lay a hand on my daughter I would sure want to go out and shoot he which raise a very interesting question Kate hammond 's father be on the news this morning the parent come to town after the rape accusation and they be here again do you own a gun mr Hammond your neighbor in phoenix be not sure when you leave town I coulda kill the little scum but no I do not own a gun I never have you know the death of this young man bring this back for all of we we

move on what be wrong with his confession I do not know I do know we have two shooting one be careful plan the second one be so spur of the moment he do not even know where to point the gun I just do not believe the same person 's responsible for both shooting and he be cover for kate hammond we walk this lindsay there be no way she get from the party to here and stay dry if she walk she be in heavy rain for 15 minute you see those picture she be as dry as a good martini she find a way to get here and back and stay dry how be she airlift this might be a good time to remind you we have a confession what be that what look at what an underground steam pipe there be ton of they they be about a foot high and they do not run half a mile between building if you be think kate hammond crawl through a pipe duct forget it what if it be more than a steam pipe why do you want it to be her I do not want it to be her I just know it be and how do you intend to prove it I can not yet my name be charles gifford and I be make this statement of my own free will I admit that I kill colin morse and I admit hi kate that I attempt to kill jay osborne what be go on my action be my own we be record charlie 's confession I think you would want to watch and I te alone this be about the shooting yesterday I do not plan on kill colin until and colin 's murder he be confess to both three or four week after what they do to kate I be so angry they rape she why be he do that I think the law be go to handle it because he love you my guess he decide to take out jay and take the rap in one big romantic gesture which would be impressive if he know how to shoot a gun this be not right I know you do it kate then you would not let charlie go to jail would you I know it be you I just can not prove it I tell you I be at the party that night yeah and that be a challenge how would you shoot colin and manage to stay dry I should 've know well but a 1950s bomb shelter tunnel that be that be way before my time even the people that we ask they do not even know they be there but I find a story about they in the college archive and as it turn out one of those tunnel go from the dorm basement straight to the field house why do not you arrest I because all I have be a theory Charlie 's confess they finish in there he go to prison it be all over I know something else about you kate about the night you be rape you be drug Colin and jay give you g H B but they test I for that the g H B that they give you do not show up in the test but we know that they give it to you so honey what happen that night be not because you be drunk or irresponsible you be just unconscious bastard yeah that be right and I think anyone would understand you want they dead but hey after all the lie that have be tell after all the lie that people have believe do not you think that it be time that someone start tell the truth N no one believe I they think I want this to happen how have you do it that night I sneak out of the dorm party and go to the field and shoot colin Charlie buy I the gun and then he take it from I afterwards I think it would be enough to sue they I really do then they send I something what do they send you a valentine it say you will be in our heart forever I know I have to do something so you shoot colin I sometimes forget how good you be in that room good huh right I take she in there I
