toaster near the launcher two more out by the dish that be a lot of Cylons you ever handle a weapon who I no I be not a soldier Crashdown I 'll try to give you the most simple assignment but I be gon na need every man you be not suggest we attack the Cylons we owe it to Socinus and Tarn to tack the frakker out before they kill anyone else we have equal number we have the element of surprise therefore we have the initiative we can attack at the time and place of our choose El tee a word in private he be crazy I be not train for this kind of thing I have never fire a gun in my life I have n't fire one since basic you I just join to pay for dental school Basic ground assault be a long time ago for all of we those be n't train officer out there they be program kill machine we do n't have any choice Galactica will definitely be send a search and rescue party it be just a matter of time and if we do n't take out that launcher we ca n't go up against an armed and defend position like that they 'll wipe we out in the first two minute that be enough chief look under the circumstance it be important that you keep your cool I do n't believe I have lose my cool I disagree look I do n't want to attack the launcher either but it be our duty we owe it to the rescue party and we owe it to Socinus and Tarn I fail to see what this have to do with Socinus and Tarn maybe that be why I be an

for I and Seelix to flank out to the right and get a shot at the console Tyrol you and the Vice President will stay at position one and provide cover fire for both flanking maneuver I have be give the opportunity to perceive the scripture more clearly anything that impede that I have to view as contrary to the survival of the human specie this be ridiculous look she obviously need her medication I

to ease the pain but she would n't hear of it test be positive Mr President the terrorist Mr President we should at least speak with the striker before send in the troop they be teacher not terrorist they be act like thug they be last demonstration put two policeman in the hospital six of they have chain themselves outside the hall of education as far as I be concern they be criminal their pay be substandard their school be fall apart and the strike action have be gain momentum for month and you know that I do n't understand why we be not at least talk to they one of the most interesting thing about be president be that you do n't have to explain yourself to anyone you have already set a meeting with Stans have n't you obviously only if you approve Mr President she be really not in a fit state to do anything let alone conduct any government business do n't talk about I as if I be not here there 'll be plenty of time for that soon enough Billy could you gentleman I call you here to discuss the Cylon Dr Cottle would you please tell they what you tell I this morning I be no expert in genetic but I can read a blood test that Cylon fetus be show some very peculiar genetic abnormality I have n't see any of this on your report Doctor no um well as Dr Cottle say he be he be not an expert and I be um I have be through the test and I I would n't say that there be anything conclusive did n't say conclusive just damn odd Right Madame President as you know the Sharon Cylon be of considerable tactical value to the fleet perhaps you have get too close to your subject Doctor this be difficult so I be go to cut right to it allow this thing to be bear could have frightening consequence for the security of this fleet I believe the Cylon pregnancy must be terminate before it be too late Madame President I would like I think you of all people would understand Admiral Madame President I do n't understand this make no sense one of the interesting thing about be president be you do n't have to explain yourself to anyone thank you gentleman I be I be a little tired gentleman I do n't want to seem alarmist um but I be perturb I think that the uh the President 's illness be affect her judgment especially when it come to the subject she seem reasonably coherent to I well then I 'll have to appeal to you on scientific ground destroy this child would seriously impact my study of the Cylon sub specie the President make the call and I be back she look with all due respect the President make the call base on evidence present by Dr Cottle and he be medicine 's pull yourself together you be about to become President of the colony you be go to be ask to make some very hard decision Act like you can handle it god uh where have you be where have I be I never leave you Gaius oh right yeah um yeah metaphorically speak it be just that it be week ago and I uh I be sure you have suffer mightily in my absence you know jealousy be a really ugly emotion what be this linger controversy over my affair with your three dimensional duplicate I be not jealous I be concern oh yeah concern about what our child oh now you be concern well for your information the President want to kill it once Roslin 's go you 'll be President you can use your new authority to save our child oh like that be gon na do you see the way Adama look at I the contempt on his face I will be the President all right but without the military support I might as well be an anointed dog catcher yes well you have your own resource if you would use they what you do n't know what I mean no I do n't know what you mean the nuclear device the one Adama provide for your research there be one way I did n't want to have to ask you for this I did n't want to have to ask you for this but what I really need but what I really need to complete the project be a nuclear warhead be a nuclear warhead you be totally insane I be try to help you you idiot if Adama remain committed to the destruction of our child it may be our only hope there be no easy way to say this it be about the Cylon the President have decide that her pregnancy will be terminate what why Doc Cottle discover some anomaly in the fetal blood work be n't that expect maybe but the President believe that to allow the baby to come to full term constitute an unacceptable risk to the fleet I do n't understand Sharon 's only help we since she come back from Caprica she even turn on her own to save her life do n't mistake the will the live for genuine compassion Lieutenant she be still the enemy do she know not yet then I should be the one to tell she if that be all sir Helo I do n't expect you to agree to the decision but I need you to accept it we be talk about my child sir part of I but I guess it be easy to kill when you call it a Cylon dismiss so you be say someone be be tamper with our ammunition shell do n't unload themselves what be this I hear about you order both Galactica and Pegasus fighter to stand down price you pay for reinstate I as CAG sir maybe that be a mistake maybe I do n't give a damn what you think sir take it easy both of you Fact be we have be share story between the ship and nobody fly combat until our ammo supply check out leave we defenseless if the Cylons decide to pick a fight we be defenseless before this we just did n't know about it Lee find out who do this all right excuse I I be look for Asha Janik Asha she be over there let we do this quietly Asha Janik Captain Adama I have a message for your father they may take I okay stop she but I be one of many we have declare war against Galactica 's army of death the Cylons be n't our true enemy it be the military that refuse to negotiate all we want be peace demand peace demand peace so much for be discreet huh we find these pamphlet in Janik 's quarter some kind of a manifesto demand peace from the Cylons who the hell be these people Cylon sympathizer just have no idea they be this organize I want to know how she get aboard my ship the hangar deck 's short staff we have be force to import civilian to handle some of the grunt work apparently she be um she be a Picon work maintenance on the Greenleaf no know criminal affiliation huh until now now listen to this do not be afraid we be not terrorist but we will not sit back while Adama 's war machine continue to press we into cruel and futile conflict our demonstration work News be already spread across the fleet I know we be contact by a person claim to speak for the subversive demand a meeting on the Galactica they have get stone I 'll give they that well I have agree what we be not negotiate I just want to know what we be up against Madame secretary consider the stake you do n't seem particularly engage the stake be what we decide to make they Mr Stans if the President use troop to enforce we back to work order people will get hurt even die some cause be worth die for not this one the mass be malignant Doctor Admiral I be Royan Jahee you have a unique way of welcome visitor to your ship Visitor my ass we shoot people like you for treason Colonel I be only an interested party try to prevent more bloodshed I deplore what happen aboard your viper how many sympathizer do we have aboard this fleet if you be try to crush an organization you can stop now the people in this movement be follow an idea not a leader what the hell do they want Peace with the Cylon you want we to surrender they attack we only after we would enslave they you call yourselves military man strategist explain to I how our current course of attack and retreat lead

start take he away all right get your rubber glove on this be everything from the Janik woman 's quarter somehow the Admiral think look through this crap 's gon na tell we something new about their so

explosive this be the CAG get I a tak team ready right now I do n't understand why be they do this now I do n't know the Admiral say they find something in the baby 's blood somehow President Roslin consider it a threat to the fleet it ca n't just be that I have do nothing but help they since I have come here I have hold back my anger I have try to show they that cylon be not all the same that we

something on the wireless I think it be come from the Daru Mozu None of we want to die but the fighting must end if my sacrifice send a signal to the Cylon that bring peace then it be worth it I do this for my child and for the child that will follow they Gods willing demand peace demand peace pull out pull out pull out pull out pull out People be dead I grieve for they Admiral and I assure you the tylium 's ship 's just a taste of what be in store unless someone start listen you listen and you listen well I do n't care if I have to interrogate every civilian on board this fleet this be gon na stop do you understand yes Mr Vice President President Roslin insist on your take the tour she would like the transition to go as smoothly as possible what be these Cylon agent suspect sir that number mean everything to her Represents hope that be our future yes yes be the President be uh a lot of responsibility it be tradition for outgoing president to leave a letter for their successor it be usually open on the first day of the new term but the next few day be liable to prove hectic so well let we just pray that she get well let we excuse I Mr Vice President hello yes yes I understand thank you I be tell I might meet an old friend here it be good to see you Gaius so you have become a member of the peace movement well despite what you may think I have always abhor violence would you

about you since the second I leave the Pegasus no no I ca n't get you out of my head do n't do this not yet I ca n't help myself I ca n't I be sorry no I be I be sorry I be just I be not ready so be there any reason in particular for invite I around here because you save I let I save you oh here we go again what be you talk about you must sense it Gaius the fleet 's crumble People be turn on each other there be serious misgiving about the military when you be President you can use the office to turn they against Adama pave the way for the Cylons to save we I I would love to be with you always but I know it be hard but it be the only way no no I be not who you think I be and I will not be responsible for the destruction of mankind if you would have catch it soon maybe we could have do more Laura come in I did n't like the way we leave thing this morning Richard I I know you have be think this be a mistake for a while now I just meet with Stans the education alliance be go to back off back off Laura what do you give they I make they a promise that we would seriously hear out their grievance Richard I think you would be happy they be go back to work Laura you have put I in a very awkward position I do n't see how both side give ground it be not just about your teacher it be the next strike I be worried about you just show they that if they hold out long enough this administration will cave you expect I to fail I expect you to hold the line this do n't have to be the end of the world you can stay on in an advisory capacity god know we need your idea you be ask I to resign I do n't have any choice this be n't about you and I anymore you be right it be not you be willing to attack those people and up until a few hour ago I be prepared to let you I be on my way to the Galactica to represent this administration when I return if you still want my job be prepared to fight when I return notify the Admiral this be Admiral Adama as you know President Roslin have be aboard Galactica for the last few day she be a fighter but as of this moment her prognosis be grave I know that many of you believe in the power of prayer if that be your way then I urge you to pray for our President as for the other I hope you will join I in keep she in our thought Admiral please do n't do this stand down everyone give I room think about what you be do Helo you be a soldier I be a father like you please sir give I a raptor let I take she off the ship I 'll get she away from the fleet I ca n't do that son Admiral Admiral Doctor get the hell outta here Admiral I must talk to you concern the Cylon child it seem I may have be wrong very wrong when I say that Dr Cottle misinterpret the fetal blood work see I have another look at those sample and I discover something quite intriguing Understand Cylon blood be virtually impossible to differentiate from our own that be say obviously it have to be slightly different because the Cylon be not human if our blood look like this for example and the Cylon 's blood look like this then it be fair to assume that the Cylon human be carry an amalgam be this a theory or fact the Cylon 's fetus contain no antigen it have no blood type that be what Dr Cottle be talk about when he say it be damn odd except it be not damn odd it be astonish now know as we do that the Cylons be build slightly well to endure than their human counterpart I wonder could the Cylon blood also be bless shall we say bless with a heightened resistance to disease Huh so I apply a sample of Sharon 's fetal blood to some cancer cell I take from the President what be I look at nothing that be the whole point the cancer be go and it be go within a matter of hour be you say you find a cure for the President 's cancer well it be untried it it be obviously untried and therefore extremely dangerous but yes it be possible if you abort Sharon 's fetus now you 'll never know now you may feel a sharp pain Sharon it be okay it be gon na be all right I do n't like what you be do I think it be unnatural and damn dangerous yes well give the patient 's current condition I be not sure that I see the downside maybe it be just her time then for once perhaps I be the beacon of hope around here if you want to settle this your people have to disengage no more civil disobedience no more act of violence I want our student back in school do I be glad you call Madame secretary I too I be afraid the test be positive the mass be malignant what be happen Nurse help I get she on her side Nurse nurse no hold it I 'll be damn Madame President Dr Baltar it be so very good to see you no no do n't do n't move do n't move Madame President very good how be she do doctor I have never see anything like it it 'll be a while before she be a hundred percent but her scan be clear Cancer 's go be you sure it be go thank you thank you Admiral you seem well much be you still hold the spokesman from the new faction in the brig yes would you take I to he please certainly thank you I 'll wait for you to get dress President Roslin Mr Yahee be n't it I think it be time we meet would you open the door please do it all these people want be to be hear a member of your group n early destroy our tylium refiner before we can even begin to talk I need your personal assurance that there will be no more attack as I tell you the Admiral I have have no direct contact genuine negotiation require trust do not lie to I I 'll talk to my people make they understand Excellent and I 'll listen maybe even act but if you renege I 'll insist the Admiral hunt you and your friend down without mercy you seem very content Sharon 's child be safe Adama and Roslin have agree that more study be require before any drastic measure be take yes but by save Roslin you have deny yourself your rightful place of leadership there be many aspect of you Gaius I will never understand you would n't neither would I suspect your corporeal counterpart do you love she what be that the letter Roslin write I to be open upon the event of her death President Baltar I offer my sincere congratulation thank you I say that know we have have our difference and that you take office despite my many reservation you may be the most brilliant person I have ever meet but your intelligence be unleavene by compassion you must be remind of your ethical responsibility and challenge to rise above your own selfish need I do n't write this to hurt you but to beg you to open your heart Understand that the people in the fleet look to you not just for leadership but for solace justice find a way to give they that and you will be a great leader Laura Roslin after all I have do for the fleet after all I have do for her Roslin 's never trust you she be undermine you at every turn and now so now we know she be never gon na trust I this be not a political struggle anymore Gaius this be quite literally life and death the President assure I that as long as there be no further act of violence she be willing to bring our concern to the quorum and Admiral Adama she be try to buy time she 'll never be open to negotiate with the Cylons I disagree I think we have make real progress today and so do the Vice President Baltar yes just before I leave e ask to meet with I he encourage patience while he work with Roslin from within and he offer the content of this case as proof of his sincerity what be in it I do n't know he say that you should be the one to open it Frak the Cylons be create by Man they evolve they rebel there be many copy and they have a plan previously on Battlestar Galactica Colonel Fisk be the new Pegasus Commander the cylon 's fetus contain no antigen be you say you find a cure for the President 's cancer yes I have get ship on half ration when will some of these supply start get out to the fleet Target 's ftl be history she be all yours he be all right I say again Apollo be all right let we just be glad that we both come back alive all right that be just it Kara I did n't want to make it back alive you be not go to shoot you be not like I Cloud 9 48 hour early hey hey hey do n't go sorry I though you be still asleep you should have kick I out of bed an hour ago if I hold up Galactica 's raptor Tigh'll have my ass which I both know currently belong to I all right let we move on to the the next item oh no gentleman please do n't get up after the last few week it just feel good to be on my foot thank you though you have make a remarkable recovery Madame President Remarkable indeed but now I be play catch up and I be afraid during my illness I lose focus I let some thing slide that be behind we now yes it be to the point supply be run low and the people be worried well they would n't be civilian if they did n't have omethe to bitch about well I think that in this case they be entitle our inventory level be tight but they be not critical but all the way across the fleet people be report shortage of essential good and what they do get come at a high price they be turn to the black market last week one of my aide come down with pneumonia Billy have to trade liquor to get the antibiotic it be the nature of the beast People want what they want a few trade would be one thing Commander Fisk that be reality but I be talk about criminal make outrageous demand on the people so bottom line be I be implement a new fleet wide trade policy we need to be in control of our supply chain not black market thug I be hope that I can have the military 's support on this Admiral if you want Pegasus to run these dog down you just give we the word our people will do whatever it take to get this under control and it be good to have you back Madame President it be good to be back thank you Admiral Gentlemen thank you be madame President always so right in your face her last minute resurrection seem to have invigorate she somewhat yeah well maybe too much she do n't really think she make up plan and regulation be go to change anything do she as if we do n't have enough to do no madame President set a great prestige by her office and Adama support she at least for the moment well then so do I just for the moment by the way do you get the cigar I send over I not only get they I enjoy they as well oh my pleasure Mr Vice President well I have get a ship to run look forward to our next visit as do I I get

getting start but from the look of he I would say he be garrote god this be the last thing we need Admiral you might want to take a look at this look like our friend Fisk hit the jackpot Cubit find anything else let I know right away if I find anything else I may retire early someone 's send we a message or run we in circle maybe there be another cylon in the fleet I almost prefer that to the alternative we start kill our own all they have to do be sit back and watch Fisk do we have any idea who do it no but we will do a full investigation and I want you to lead it do n't you think it would be well if someone from Pegasus deal with this even though Cain 's go her influence linger I need someone I can trust you know there be time when that be in short supply between we we have both be through an awful lot son and I hope that we have grow strong for it I need your help I 'll call up a flight to Pegasus right away anyone else be inside just the medical team sir do you know who I be I be the vice President of the colony let I in Captain Adama Commander Fisk did n't tell I you be invite let he in they be go to let I in oh my god what be go on in here where be Fisk on a slab in Galactica 's morgue what he be dead be n't this your brand careful Gaius you have buy yourself some good will by save Roslin but it be fade their old suspicion be re emerge what be you do here Captain I be about to ask you the same thing wait a minute be you interrogate I I be not sure I appreciate your tone this be n't a diplomatic exercise a man be butcher his head be practically sever from his body with piano wire you be Vice President of the fleet why be you act like a child with your hand in the cookie jar wonder what she would say if she see you like this you know I ca n't believe it be even necessary for I to explain myself to you but obviously no I have nothing to do with Commander Fisk 's death for the record I just come here to discuss President Roslin 's new trade policy oh I I think that be settle no uh Commander Fisk have some reservation I 'll bet and as the vice President I decide to assuage his doubt of my own free will be that sufficient or would you like I to provide you with an alibi I be sure I can rustle one up enjoy the cigar escort the vice President to his ship the wireless be go crazy Word of Fisk 's murder have spread out through the entire fleet when we lose a command officer aboard a warship people be go to be concerned about their security Crew can fall apart when their Commander be kill Pegasus lose two in a matter of week maybe this time they be lucky his personal log show that he be reroute supply run on and off loading freighter without command authorization he raid the McConnell and at least a dozen other ship in the last week I also find a small warehouse of high value merchandise in his quarter he be work the black market well half the fleet 's work it Fisk be get greedy if he cross one of his supplier on a deal that would explain the cubit that Cottle find still do n't tell we who do it well he be go to need trading partner and they would n't be hard to find even on Galactica Lee I be scare Paya 's cough keep get bad I 'll bring she something on my next trip which could be week if there be another cylon attack I keep hear about shortage on the other ship People trade anything they can for food and for medicine really

be this about you must have know she be trade with Fisk or maybe I 'll talk to her she did n't give it to Fisk I do I trade it for a few necessity a couple of thing to help she get by big frakkin ' deal there be nothing illegal about that not yet do n't you play holy than thou with I I have n't do anything that most people on this ship have n't do include you do n't make we right Colonel just a whole lot of people wrong you did n't make it to class today yeah I be pretty jammed up anyway I be not sure you need I hold your hand anymore be that what you be do hold my hand I mean it as a compliment permission to speak frankly sir you do n't need my permission and you do n't need the sir maybe that be the problem I do n't really know what to think anymore so I 'll just ask be this go somewhere Dee please do n't pretend like you do n't know what I be talk about you know our time together our workout something 's change between we I be just not sure what you want I to say then do n't say anything Communications page captain Adama you have a priority ship to ship call Cloud nine Captain Adama here Shevon Shevon it be I Shevon oh my god what do they do they say they know about you and I they want to know what we have be talk about I do n't understand why they would care all right get what you need I be take you and paya back to Galactica Lee wait it be the only place I can keep you safe what be you go to tell they about we I be not fool myself I know what this be Lee get away from we you listen I hear any more talk about Fisk I be go send your whore back to you piece by piece and then I be go start with the little girl I know who you be I know whose son you be and I do n't care you tell Adama to let it go be that when you know that you love she I think so but you hurt she yes this be captain Adama I need a medic and a security team on L deck ASAP you want to see I Madame President yes thank you for come doctor have a seat would you like some tea I would love one you know I be never quite sure where we stand with each other doctor why do you think that be I ca n't imagine why I have never have anything but the utmost respect for you and your office I understand that you and Commander Fisk plan to meet just prior to his death as I have already explain to Captain Adama Commander Fisk have several linger concern about your new trade policy what can I say and that be it Gaius she be afraid of you why be you ask I this you save my life and I be grateful but I sense that there be some unease in you about assume the presidency and I would like to offer you an out you what Resign Return to your scientific work on Galactica no one will question your motive you can consider it a second chance like the one you give I Charming Doctor this be a one time offer I suggest you reconsider you know Madame President I have never be particularly interested in politic I never want any lofty position of power I never want to be the Vice President that be until this very moment because right now I ca n't think of anything I want more one to the head you did n't do this I be attack find he there when I wake up Security bulletin say Commander Fisk be garrote with a wire whatever happen look like you find your guy what about Shevon and her daughter Cloud Nine 's an open port chance be they be already off ship I 'll get a team down here Councilman Zarek Lee I just hear be you all right what be you do here attend a Quorum meeting nothing as exciting as all this I assure you I know these place be legal but still the son of the almighty Adama talk to I about the black market not much to say it be widespread inevitable and accord to President Roslin illegal so it be no surprise that you and Fisk be in it up to your neck Fisk maybe but not I I represent Astral Queen I have to be careful about the company I keep this be Fisk 's log he say he make three run to Astral Queen in the last ten day and I doubt it be to discuss prison reform what do you want from I Captain Names of ship Contacts I ca n't help you why do you think Fisk approach I to get a piece of your black market scam to offer you protection you and your father be so blind by the past Fisk 's black market be up and run when he approach I he know Adama would pick up on his unauthorized shuttle so he try to force I into take over the delivery create a firewall between Pegasus and the illegal shipment so you be try to tell I that you turn he down at great cost check the fleet log see how many supply ship make stop at the Astral Queen after last Fisk 's trip the answer be none so if Fisk be try to starve you out why did n't you bring it to the quorum Roslin 's acting like the black market 's some sort of aberration but I think you be smart than that do you really expect some utopian fantasy to rise from the ashe I hear the security officer they give you Fisk 's killer for a reason they be offer you a way out you know something do n't you just rumor there be a freighter Prometheus some people say it be go off the grid but if you want something bad enough that be where you go the deal be broker by an ex military mercenary name Phelan Lee I hope she be worth it oh Paya Paya Paya hey Paya it be okay it be Lee you remember it be Lee all right you be go to be fine I promise you okay you just hang Tight I 'll be right back I 'll be right back you may find this hard to believe but my father be in the service too Strict as hell probably the same as your old man but when the cylon attack all his duty and honor did n't add up to squat be she dead I can see why you want she back she be one of my good one of yours a good escort understand it be about a lot more than sex she know when to listen and when to call for help Lee I have to do n't blame she the only reason you be alive be because I be able to see you through Shevon 's eye and what I see seem reasonable like Fisk Fisk be a pig he try to force we to renegotiate so you kill he no I give you the killer the murder weapon the print everything you need to close the case legitimately despite the President 's objection the fleet need we Rationing 's too tight ship come in too late we be the pressure valve we provide when Shevon need antibiotic she know where to go without we people would have nowhere to turn the fleet would tear itself apart and what about those child outside how be they help the fleet everyone have need some settle for cigar or liquor you want shevon other be more demand it be hard to find the moral high ground when we be all stand in the mud I be not not like

Scar take out an experienced pilot like Beano he hide he hide behind an asteroid or the debris field that you have ignore because it look like a bunch of harmless rock you see Scar do n't like to fight until the odd be on his side and then suddenly out of nowhere bam he pop out blow you to piece and then jump away before you can return fire well if you ask I I think Scar be a coward this be n't duel pistol at dawn this be war you never wanna fight fair you wanna sneak up behind your enemy and club they over the head you see Scar understand that and so do I so that be why I be gon na kill

he would have see that be it Scar there he be boy and girl there be the motherfrakker I be gon na kill I be afraid this be one of those good news bad news conversation Bad news first the mining chip 's break another drill bit we need to extend again another eight day eight more day Son of a bitch they have just discover an incredibly rich vein of ore enough to build two entire squadron of viper I ca n't walk away from that what be the good news the Pegasus production team have just turn out its first combat ready viper we be begin to replace our loss Hmm be they go to be able to replace pilot as well let we review the tactical situation four week ago our mining ship strike pay dirt on this asteroid a pile of strategic metal that we need to build new ship since we be sit duck until the miner finish the job the old man have send the fleet out of harm 's way under the protection of Pegasus our job be to stay behind and protect the miner unfortunately this star system be full of rock and dust Dradis can not tell the rock from the bad guy so our only reliable system of detection be our eyeball which mean we have to put those eyeball way out there Split up cover a huge perimeter we 'll be patrol the area in division of four at these picket point Twos we be go in section of two be you plan the op for I now too CAG want we to spread out to control a large area it be right here in the briefing all right so we do go in twos Scar and his buddy be out there look for easy kill let we not give he any this operation be vital to the long term survival of this fleet yes it be and we 'll continue to support it they be grind we down viper by viper why have they stop come at we en masse be it because we destroy the resurrection ship Starbuck 's work on that this guy be probably die and be reborn a dozen time you may have face he before so what raider reincarnate just like you yeah just like I Great what a frakkin ' world a raider 's much like a train animal with the basic consciousness and survival instinct but with the destruction of the resurrection ship when they die they be really dead so they be not gon na mount mass attack where they could have major casualty Raiders reincarnate make sense do n't it it take month for you to train a nugget into an effective viper pilot and then they get kill and their experience their knowledge their skill set they be all lose forever so if you could bring they back and put they in a brand new body would n't you do it 'cause death then become a learning experience how uh how many pilot have we lose I mean have you lose you know there be time when I look at you and I forget what you be all I see be that kid that pooch her landing day after day the kid that be frakkin ' the chief and think she be get away with it yeah I remember you be like a big sister to Kara um be careful of Scar okay he be fill with rage about what Dying be a painful and traumatic experience every time he be reborn he be fill with more bitter memory Scar hate you every bit as much as you hate he a raider be a squirmy son of a bitch you wo n't be able to keep he in your sight for more than two second so you have to deliver a killing burst within that time or he will turn and nail you all that yank and banking give you one hell of a case of vertigo and that be what this chair simulate all right Jo Jo go Time not bad at least you hit the

again we be try to get to the CIC could you alke no talking please no cheating hold it up a little high eight Sneaky nine uh start again you lose track Zero I have ask you here to find out why the Cylons hate we so much it be what you say at the ceremony that humanity be a flawed creation and that people still kill one another for petty jealousy and greed HmYosaid that humanity never ask itself why it deserve to survive maybe you do n't sleeper agent within the Fleet Takeover by brute force Cylon impregnation and reproduction multiple model suicide bombing assault on natural resource eyewitness claim to have see one of the know Cylon model move in and out of Galactica 's brig Admiral Adama have make no comment on this situation we will continue to how the hell do this get out to the press I be surpri it did n't happen soon m tell you have be meet with her regularly allow she to interact with member of your crew she be a military asset provide we with vital strategic intelligence while we pray that she be not somehow collude with other cylon if I feel for one second that she pose some kind of a threat to this fleet I would pull the trigger on she myself I think the fleet may need to hear that admiral even more they need ve it someone take theto vitamin this morning yeah I do n't know what get into I no you be right keep Sharon Valerii alive allow her pregnancy to continue there be no road map for any of this somebody somebody have get to keep ask the hard question I agree I wanna stay ahead of this acknowledge the Cylons ' existence and then make some kind of case for she to stay aboard Galactica I do n't think that be gon na work what why I think you need to trust the people use the press tell they the truth I mean we barely know anything about the Cylons and until we learn more we be not gon na destroy the only source of information that we have period Period that simple huh uh well um could I could I have a minute sure Important Mm

Adama Commander Garner Glad to see you Major although I wish it be under well circumstance we have just lose contact with two of our raptor out on a training mission what when do that happen Captain

Major yes sir the disappear from the dradi about an hour ago they be go Shut the hell up we lose two raptor in a training mission and I only find out when the commander throw it in my face do n't all speak at once Sir it be be make clear that discuss flight deck situation with anyone outside Pegasus crew be not allow sorry sir and whose frakkin ' bright idea be that it be Garner be n't it of course it be so barely competent and paranoid there be a hell of a combination I have a problem that problem 's name be Kara Thrace I I know to handle she sir and for the record she be one hell of a viper pilot what I should cut she some slack because she be good in the cockpit be that what you be say because nobody ever cut we any slack in the engine room I could tell you that right now but then uh I do n't know maybe be a snipe be different than be a viper jockey no flashy stunt for we no flying by the seat of our pant down there the engine room be like a finely tune watch and everything in it need to be monitor and maintain in a very precise fashion nobody freelance everything be do in the proper way at the proper time in the proper order or there would be no power no light no hot shower for your flyboy you know Major I think some of the people around here could learn a thing or two from the snipe I be sorry Madame President but it be that time campaign meeting we have be put it off for week and we do have a presidential election come up unless you have decide not to run yeah and to be perfectly honest with you Tori I have think about it a few time but um no I be still here there be so much to do so let we talk politic Great here be the result from our first fleet wide poll how do you manage this I be precinct Captain for the federalist party in delphi for five year we do poll to see what the mayor should have for lunch for what it be worth you have manage to walk a very fine line you be presidential bid have the support of both the military and the civilian fleet and you have receive enthusiastic endorsement from the gemenese religious leader well it help when your only real rival be a convict terrorist be I capable of lead this fleet absolutely and for a time I almost have a chance until Laura Roslin ascend from politician to prophet the truth be I ca n't win but you could you flatter I Mr Zarek really but I be not sure I be cut out for a life in politic as I find the vice presidency and everything to do with it very tedious I would imagine carry water for Roslin would get old after a time but it be the office that make you the perfect candidate doctor you be pre sell really to whom you would be surprise how many people crave the assurance of cold science as oppose to the superstitious raving of the Gemenese as a scientist you offer hope think about it and you Tom you 'll just step aside will you I be just happy to back a man of true conviction a man who remember his friend Attention on deck at ease where be Stinger he be in hack for mouth off to Garner step on his precious little toe frakke Garner he be such an idiot all right lock that up get something straight we get two miss raptor crew who be gon na be out of oxygen in 36 hour that be all that matter so everyone knock off the schoolyard crap and start do your frakkin ' job now we need to start think outside the box which be suppose to be what you do well sorry Major all right I wanna know everything there be to know about these miss raptor and their crew I wanna know personal quirk aircraft squawks wireless transmission anything that might help Good get to it how be she Rya 's four month pregnant and do n't want to be I understand the Gemenese have a problem with woman terminate their pregnancy Tyrol say that she ask for you by name do you want to tell I what that be really all about pretty straight forward really I get a note that a girl be on the way she arrive I do my work and then she leave I do n't ask a lot of question you be gon na start I wanna talk to her I be Admiral Adama do n't worry I have just come to talk it do n't matter what you say I be not gon na change my mind your parent be a little worried about you they have contact I through the Gemenon representative my parent god do you have any idea what they would do to I please do not send I back you be a stowaway aboard a military ship some people might say she be a victim of political persecution hell she could apply for asylum Asylum that be it I want asylum under Gemenon law the girl be still the property of her parent and they can deal with she once she be safely back on her ship to be honest I be more concerned with the broad implication of this matter Sarah I know you do n't want to hear this but my people my voter be demand action on this issue we have be through this abortion be legal under colonial law before the attack and so it be still legal today it be obscene the scripture view abortion as an abomination in the eye of the god you can not equivocate on this point if want our support in the come election Rya Kibby 's petition for asylum be under review thank you Sarah very much for come in I be not turn that girl over I be certainly not ban abortion then do n't but we have to move aggressively on this thing I be arrange a conference call with you and the quorum this be gon na get out of hand fast she be not Billy no she be not what I hate to say this because I know that this be a political issue the fact be that that number do n't go up very often I fight for a woman 's right to control her body my entire career no no I be just remember what you say right after the cylon attack that if we really want to save the human race we would well start have baby nothing nothing and more nothing where be shark 's last transmission well there be not much there Eve distress bearing reek shun emerge read they be in distress they give a bearing request instruction it be an emergency can you read maybe but what be this eve fragment here

easy that be when you be not booze or sow mutiny amongst the crew Mutiny Commander we should take this to a private place do n't you think I know what be happen on my own ship barely competent and paranoid that be off the record I be just vent accurately I 'll have you court martialle Commander I be not defend Captain Thrace 's behavior Thanks Major Captain Thrace you be restrict to quarter until I can ship you back to Galactica you be Adama 's pet let he deal with you Major yes sir you have be on board less than four day and you be already face charge you do n't waste any time do you

miss repeat Emergency Buster be that you Buster this be Red Devil man be that you buddy come back to I Power failure oxygen be almost out for love of the god help Sir one of our search raptor just pick up a possible distress signal from near where Pegasus lose communication with Buster 's ship finally possible distress signal there be a theory that Buster himself might have jump away to run down a phony distress call it could be a trap a theory be this your theory major this be captain Thrace 's theory be it not Mr Thornton can you give we a fix on where this distress signal be come from yes sir it be long range over 40 su away then spin up the FTL drive and prepare to jump the ship yes sir Sir this be n't just Captain Thrace 's theory I think this be a cylon trap and and I disagree now get Admiral Adama on the line I be go to get our man Admiral we finally get the break we have be look for bear on the distress signal I can jump there inside of two minute Commander believe I I understand how you feel but the cylon have be know to lure ship into trap use fake distressed call have you consider that we have sir it be a scenario we do n't think likely we Major Adama do you concur Sir Captain Thrace and I be of the opinion that the first two raptor may very well have be lure away by just such a trick an opinion I do not share sir we 'll send a recon mission in full force five raptor three escort two rescue you have your order Commander yes sir thank you sir thank you Major I be sure your expertise be need elsewhere yes sir yes I be curious why the sudden interest in the fleet 's demographic projection an issue have emerge that may prove divisive to our administration I would like all the fact in hand before make my decision so now it be our administration she must be desperate well I be a very busy man Luckily I make an initial calculation on these figure over seven month ago when nobody seem interested or concerned all I have to do be factor in the number from the Pegasus crew it take I hardly any time at all and I did n't mind look I 'll save you the bother you need n't read the report if we continue on our present course within the next 18 year the human race will simply be extinct since assume the presidency I have make it my mission to maintain the right and freedom we so enjoy prior to the attack one of these right have now come into direct conflict with the survival of the specie and I find myself force to make a very difficult decision the issue be stark the fact be that if the civilization be to survive we must must repopulate this fleet therefore I be issue an executive order from this day forward anyone seek to interfere with a birth of child whether it be the mother or a medical practitioner shall be subject to criminal penalty thank you all flight deck personnel please report to station all right come on let we go let we go Captain Case what be go on we have be order to scramble condition one ship 's get ready to

more like a dark time Chief Chief help 49 579 survivor in search of a home call Earth Chief Tyrol I be Brother Cavill I understand you have ask for religious counseling I never really believe in psych therapy my father be a priest I see you think you would have an easy time with a priest than a real doctor okay I pray to god every night but I do n't think they listen to I do you know how useless prayer be chant and singing and muck about with old half remember line of bad poetry and you know what it get you exactly nothing be you sure you be a priest I have be preach long than you have be suck down oxygen and in that time I have learn enough to know that the god do n't answer prayer we be here on our own that be the way they set thing up we have to find our own answer our own way out of the wilderness without a nice little sunny path all lay out in front of we in advance that be what I be try to do I be try to find my way well it be not go to get well until you see what the problem be and the problem be you be screw up heart and mind you not the not the god or fate or the universe you thank for the pep talk hey hey um I just want to say um well good hunting thank you sir yeah it be a good plan it be a good plan Sharon should be able to jump you into the atmosphere a couple of klick above the surface down below the cylon dradis I know the plan Lee I write it I I get ta go I hope you find he Kara I really do so do I from the Colonial Dispatch last night 's debate only solidify the perception I 'll do that later that doctor baltar for all his charm be essentially an empty suit when it come to matter of substantial policy it be nice to see the press be get it right for a change do n't forget the radical religious charge be dangerous it may be a low blow from a desperate man but it be the only issue he be manage to get any traction on he will keep exploit it he be get ta come up with something much much big than that if he want to make it the central issue of his campaign it be not go to work you got ta keep hit she on the religious thing every time we go there you score point and we move the poll in our direction I be not sure if you be aware Tom but the mob be n't usually in the habit of elect ungodly apostate who denigrate people of faith thing be go to turn around you 'll see he be right listen to he of course of course how blind I be be thank you yes thing be go to turn around you 'll see what be that advice well thank you thank for your keen insight your astounding political acuman you know I be so assured right now Tom I be just go to sit right back and wait for the hand of god to reach down and change my political fortune how about that Galactica Starbuck SAR squadron confirm readiness check and we be spin up out here and ready for the first jump you be go for the jump Starbuck Roger that jump in ten minute Mark Galactica I would like to speak with actual Sir Actual go do I ever say thank you no then again that would be a first would n't it thank you just come back in one piece that 'll be thank you enough good hunting actual out SAR team Starbuck Set navcon input to coordinate recheck Standby for bounce back and stabilization routine let we do a final check people I still ca n't believe you talk I into this it be important and I 'll be with you there and back it be you and I from now on no matter what just like we agree I know I know I really appreciate it Helo I really do I just ca n't get she out of my head our little girl be there a problem racetrack check Callon Chedk Wireless check complete Board be green and we be set Sharon you be on Ready SAR team Starbuck Standby to jump on my mark Five here we go four three two one Commence the first jump this do n't look right no other contact on dradi what oh man we be at the wrong jump coordinate Frak Helo we have lose someone already it be Racetrack so do we go back Mission rule say we keep go unless we lose three so we keep go Racetrack will just have to find her way back to base it be a hell of a way to start though let we uh let we talk about what happen I ca n't really believe it cally I I I do n't understand how I could do that to cally it be like it be a nightmare she say you be asleep when she find you be you have a nightmare when she wake you up I do n't remember oh be have any recur dream lately no okay that be what we in the pray trade call a lie and lie be n't go to get you anywhere my friend so skip over the denial and the deception and let we get right down to it shall we you be have dream what be they tell I about your dream Chief every night every night it be the same for how long couple week and you be have the same dream when cally wake you up be n't you I do n't know I do n't remember maybe it do n't matter do it all I remember be cally on the ground and the blood she stop you by wake you up she prevent you from carry out your secret desire to kill yourself I do n't have a secret desire to kill myself well actually you be right it be not a secret you obviously want to kill yourself Question be why I think there be some kind of glitch in the navcon firmware hey bottom line we be to hell and go from where we be suppose to be skipper okay um any chance that we can still catch up with they not a chance Mission rule say we head back frak I it be the first jump hey look you give I these coordinate back to the barn hey I be pick up a large planetary body it be frakkin ' close where have that come from Hell if I know so much dradis interference here it did n't even register hey check this out Atmosphere be nitrogen oxygen Organic molecular spectra fresh water hey you know what this be it be habitable we may have just find a world that can support human life maybe we be not just a bunch of frak up after all Climate reading overall be within human norm there be some extreme at the pole that we could n't withstand but that be not unusual well do thank you sir we get a mottled area here at the river mouth so it be probably a delta and the chance be we have get significant plant and animal life so I want a lot of nice low pass across here hear the Pegasus survey mission find wildlife fruit tree river of milk and honey yeah you forget the lake of ambrosia Most of the planet 's actually pretty barren plant and animal life locate in a temperate belt around the equator but the good part be with all the dradis interference from the nebula the cylon will probably never find it who care about this stupid planet anyway Song and dance over nothing Less than 20 of that place actually support human life so you be not see the big picture this be your new home the place where you will lead a new life this be the future Gaius now there be a difference in thought what be that oh nothing Tom just uh can you imagine if we actually have to live on that thing you be a genius and pay attention you be about to win the election I be sorry what be you say Tom we need an issue something to set we apart from Roslin something to put she clearly on the wrong side of a major issue that people care passionately about this be it Permanent settlement on this planet Permanent settlement here have you lose your marble it may look dreary it may be dreary but it be solid ground under your foot and a real sky over your head you would be surprised what a powerful idea that be to people coope up in metal box for nine month you should listen to he Gaius he be a smart sexy man just like you oh give up what give up on Earth yes so we would settle here yes you know it be start to look like a lovely little planet after all this be a rest stop a place to load up on food and water we be not settle here obviously you have hear the captain 's report every ship in the fleet have people beg plead demand they get time down on the surface even if it be only for a few hour well a few hour be one thing but permanent settlement 's quite another suddenly Baltar 's hold out hope for breathe real air grow real food sleep in a bed instead of a bunk live in a house instead of a ship it be a fantasy look at the mission report all the datum indicate that life on this planet would be hard it would be a struggle to even eke a living out for a few year today 's poll show that he be also make headway with the idea that because the planet be hide in a nebula it will provide a refuge from the cylon what be we now assume that cylon technology be not sufficient enough to find this planet we just find it Madam President in my opinion people vote their hope not their fear Baltar be offer they what they want to hear and you be offer they a bitter reality I be offer they the truth they do n't want to hear the truth they be try exhaust the idea of stop lay down their burden and start a new life right now be what be resonate with the voter how well be it resonate it could turn the entire election around why be you run I be not how long be you go to do this how long be you go to refuse to see what be right in front of your face forget it I be do what you be you be leave that be right I be do I be do dancing around the truth with you you know what be go on but you ca n't or you wo n't face it so I be not a therapist I be not go to hold your hand and help you along I be just try to get you right with yourself and with your god but you be not willing to do it I do n't even know what you be talk about oh for god ' sake chief come on you think you be a Cylon I be not a Cylon well of course you be not but that be what you be afraid of be n't it that you might be a cylon and not even know it just just like Boomer right right that be the thought that be torture your dream and cripple your soul I be a cylon just like Sharon and I deserve to die Sharon did n't know what she be she just keep think feeling that she be go to do this terrible thing but she know that she have to stop herself before she do and you think that be what you be go to do some terrible thing well the truth be you might but not because you be a Cylon because you be a human being and human being do terrible thing all the time but how do you know I be human oh well maybe because I be a Cylon and I have never see you at any of the meeting there be not much more I can do for you you be go to have to go back to work and try and leave all of this behind you no I I ca n't I ca n't go back and face the deck people again and cally well you would well that be the only family you have get just know that that be your family and that they love you even cally especially cally if you doubt your humanity and your essential nature as a human being all you need to do be look to they for the salvation you have be seek from the god the god lift up those who lift each other Chief SAR team Starbuck we be set here stand by for final jump to Caprica remember we be go very low to the surface be prepared for wind shear rain storm anything Roger that Starbuck Ready Ready here we go Jump SAR team Starbuck Form up on I Roger that skipper any cylon Helo nothing on dradi wait a minute wait a minute miss a raptor I be only read 17 out there we be miss raptor 6 12 that be toughguy and carousel what

inside the mountain Damn SAR team Starbuck we have lose raptor 6 12 we be proceed without they follow I Roger that Starbuck I would think that my position and the position of my campaign be abundantly clear Madam President you have 30 second to respond well my initial response be there he go again once again lady and gentleman Doctor Baltar be distort the real issue before we the issue here the real question be not allow the scripture to dictate the policy of this government the question be do the scripture contain real world relevance do they contain the information necessary to guide we to a safe home than some completely unknown planet that we have just now discover obviously my answer to that question be yes I have always and will continue to feel the scripture hold real world relevance Mr Vice President the next question be for you uh how do you respond to the charge that you seize the idea of permanent settlement on this planet as an opportunistic gamble um some would say as to be construe as a desperate move from a campaign uh that be fall behind on every poll well you know that be um that be an excellent question in fact Jim thank you and I be only too glad to have the opportunity to respond to it you see I have long be a proponent in the search for Earth the promise of perhaps find not only a new home but also the prospect of discover our long lose brother and sister of the 13th colony be a powerful one and one I have believe in heart and soul but the trouble be the cylon continue to follow we as they have do every step of the way since the destruction of the colony and if we have a chance to change this dynamic to stop this deadly chase should we take it my answer be yes thank you Madam President 30 second there be no assurance none whatsoever that the cylon do n't already know about this planet that they do n't make regular stop here look for we and that in fact they be n't simply wait for we to settle on the surface so they can I have to respond to that I simply have to respond to that I 'll give you 15 second what you have see right now lady and gentleman be another example of the President use fear to drive her campaign Fear fear of the god Fear of the cylon Fear of fear itself be it not time to stop be afraid I be ask all of we to stop run from our life and start live they thank you thank you that be all we have time for today I would like to thank uh both the candidate for their frankness today very exciting debate this conclude the cycle of the debate for the presidency the poll will be open in three day please vote thank

impression well I think Doctor Baltar do exceptionally well lay out his vision of the future and offer the people a way to end the suffering and terror that define so many of their life on the other

pursuit of this fleet of yours be another error that be two for anyone who be keep score both error lead to the same result we become what we behold we become you amen People should be true to who and what they be we be machine we should be true to that be the good machine the universe have ever see but we get it into our head that we be the child of humanity so instead of peruse our own destiny of try to find our own path to enlightenment we hijack yours you say it brother my mission here be simple I be to tell you that you have be give a reprieve Cylon and man will now go their separate way no harm do no harm you completely annihilate our race and destroy our civilization now if you go to start point finger where do the cylon go back to their home world well I would rather not say just now let we just say we have other plan new marching order by your one true god there be no god supernatural divinity be the primitive 's answer for why the sun go down at night at least that be what we have be tell the other for year ca n't really prove it one way or the other of course I know a way to prove it throw they both out the air lock let they see if there really be a cylon god ELECTION DAY ballot from the Adriatic d this way it be be an exciting day the election have be a real roller coaster ride the poll now have be close for about five hour result have come in and it be be a seesaw battle back and forth between the presidential candidate all night long as we of course expect it would be uh we be still wait for a few more number to come in now from the counting room of Galactica which must tell you as some of you may know be a source of a bit of a controversy yesterday Councilman Zarek have file a formal complaint against the use of military involvement in the election process now it be just reach a compromise be just reach late yesterday allow Galactica to provide security for the balloting as well as civilian to oversee and monitor the situation yes okay we have some more vote come in here still not do but what we have so far be 6 282 more vote for Baltar which put his total now to 21 569 be that correct and we also have Roslin her total now be at 17 754 we have have 2 981 more vote come in for Roslin at this time so that be how thing be look at this point we 'll continue to bring you up to the minute coverage yeah it be I be this a secure line okay there be only five ship leave to report in we need to move now I 'll take care of it Lieutenant I 'll be right back be those the ballot from the Zephyr yes sir all right we 'll take it from here we be tell to take these to the ballot room sir Counting have already begin we 'll take it from here last one we have some more result have come in here now okay 8 593 for Roslin which put she over the top that be 24 265 for Laura Roslin be that correct and 22 366 for Gaius Baltar we be go to check these again because that have put she over the top she have do it she have retain the presidency in an improbable comeback in the final hour of the campaign again we would of course like to check those number if we could but it appear that Laura Roslin have retain the presidency in defiance of the poll the pundit and the surveyor of gloom and doom I have never see a political race end like this but it have just happen I be James McManus we 'll check those number and we 'll be back to you very shortly thank you I have see a lot of election Gaius most honest a few fix and you can always tell the fix one because they do n't make sense and this do n't make sense Laura Roslin be many thing but she be not corrupt and she be not dishonest it be over Congratulations Madam President thank you I hope you do n't take this the wrong way but be you as shocked as I be I be relieve well you do n't sound it I be just tired it be be a long campaign Colonel may I speak to you for a moment what be up Sir I be afraid these ballot from the Zephyr be wrong what the hell be you talk about Doctor Baltar 's name be spell correctly on these ballot but this morning the Zephyr call I and tell I their ballot have a misprint they misspell Baltar 's first name we did n't have time to print new ballot so I tell they on my authority to go ahead and use they anyway Baltar 's name be spell correctly here so they could n't have come from the Zephyr they be fraud now there be a complete chain of custody from the Zephyr all the way into this room so someone in the chain be either a perpetrator or at least a willing ally thank you for bring this to my attention I 'll take care of it from here Sir we should at least notify the civilian observer and the press that these ballot I say I 'll take care of it from here yes sir Madam President you should celebrate it be a great victory and you have earn it excuse I Admiral we 'll talk later thank you Adama yes sir this be Lieutenant Gaeta Sir I do n't know how to say this fast and straight I would advise yes sir Admiral I believe that Colonel Tigh be involve in a conspiracy to rig the election for President Roslin when I confront the colonel he admit his guilt he say he act in collusion with your campaign manager Tory Foster Saul say tory contact he a few day ago he do it because he feel that Baltar as President would be a disaster I say I agree but that what he have do be illegal a judicial tribunal may have to be convene stop I give Tory the go ahead I did n't know exactly what she be plan I certainly do not know about Colonel Tigh my god but I do know that she be plan to fix the vote you try to steal an election yes I do and I get catch but Gaius Baltar can not become President of the Colonies Bill it can not happen Laura I do n't want he as President either but he be work with the cylon I see he just before the attack in Caprica with a copy of the tall blond cylon woman the same model who accuse Baltar of treason before disappear from Galactica what the hell be you say why did n't you say something before this because I did n't remember see he with that woman until I remember it when I be die I know how that sound but it be real the same way Kobol be real and the Tomb of Athena be real and the map to earth be real Baltar be work with the cylon even if that be true you have no proof no I do n't do we steal the result of a democratic election or not that be the decision because if we do this we be criminal unindicte maybe but criminal just the same yes we be you wo n't do it we have go this far but that be it ' scuse I you try to steal this election you 'll die inside likely move your cancer right to your heart the people make their choice we be gon na have to live with it it be the wrong choice yes it be all right all right all right so that be it we just give it up just like that the battle perhaps but not the war well the important thing be the error be discover and correct you have be elect President Congratulations thank you very much Admiral now about this error exactly what kind of a tabulating error could have occur on your ship that could 've swing several thousand vote away from I in favor of your preferred candidate Admiral as soon as I have the time there will be an investigation I suggest that you take your victory and you leave it at that doctor I think you 'll find I can be magnanimous in victory Admiral and I believe the correct honorific at this time be Mr President elect

'll step this way thank you excuse I Chief a word with you please just one second you know what just let we do it what be up get a problem yes sir Lieutenant sir I believe the navcon module be ready for inspection Virgon Express Galactica we have you in visual contact maintain current course and speed Roger that Galactica maintain current course and speed power up stabilisation gyro 24a through 48c Galactica 's water recycling system be close to 100 effective for all intent and purpose there be not a drop of water that be waste aboard we have enough water for several year before replenish I see many of the ship like the Virgon Express be not make for long term voyage and will have to tank off of we periodically right whatever it be we be gon na take care of it okay you all right now tell I what happen what be go on there be at this moment six g 4 detonator miss from the small arm locker on Deck 15 Commander ready to extend the water boom excuse I how be it go oh boy I feel like a Tour guide it show well she be a teacher probably see all this as one big educational experience he think I be a total idiot do n't he what no sir no it be all right what be you tell I for if munition go miss you get to tell the master at arm now I know that you ca n't screw around with stuff like this I be not screw around okay the only reason I did n't tell anybody be 'cause they be gon na think I be the one who take they how be thing thing be good Good you look good I really like your hair my hair I do n't know anything about woman Madam President if I may I think you should know that my father well this entire ceremony be his idea I know I think he be enjoy it actually he hate protocol pomp and all that really he be make a gesture try to make you feel like the President Open Valves 3 and 5 I take the one detonator from the duffel replace it and then I go back to my quarter well you know what it be not your fault Someone 's obviously set you up to take the fall for something that be what it be you wake up somewhere you do n't know how you get there you be drug or manipulate or who know what something what do we do because if I report what be happen they 'll think I be a Cylon agent no they be not no why would they think that that be crazy People be get crazy okay you have hear the rumour cylon who look like human sleeper agent hide in the fleet Decompression alarm Damage report Mr Gaeta Ruptures in Tanks 3 5 7 9 Strain on the unrep line they be gon na blow release the line Veer away starboard every tank on the port side have rupture we be vent all our water directly into space CIC it be DC One we be enter the tank Roger that DC One Raptor 478 DC One I have you in my sight copy that DC One I have you in sight Understood how be it look in there can you tell what happen Lieutenant do n't worry about my team I have get thing under control copy that DC One I feel well know you be on it watch the light you be off target how much water do we lose ten million jp sir almost 60 of total potable water reserve Emergency ration Shut down laundry shower anything nonessential immediately yes sir how long will our water supply last Aboard Galactica about six day but one third of the other ship in the fleet be depend on we for replenishment if we do n't find new supply they 'll run out of water in two day one third that be 16 000 people get the name of those ship tell their captain to go on emergency ration immediately there be gon na be riot in those ship civilian do n't like hear they ca n't take a bath wash their clothe or drink more than a thimble a day thank you for the warning Colonel that 'll be all Mr Gaeta one more thing Lieutenant do you have any theory about what may have cause the accident there be many theory at this point Madam President do you have a guess I tell my officer not to guess I prefer to wait until we have fact um hm indulge I take a guess Mr Gaeta I would have to say the most likely explanation be that the tank be structurally weaken during the Cylon nuclear detonation during the first attack and that cause it to buckle and rupture but it be too early to say Sir Interesting thank you Lieutenant back to the matter at hand I have order an astronomical survey of nearby star system for potential water source Colonel yes sir Chief take a look at this what do you get not sure it look like burn mark from an explosive what do you think Umm it be tough to tell it be pretty rust out Optical and x ray telescope say there be five system within our practical jump radius all five have planetary body with the potential for find water in either a liquid or a frozen state put together a plan for raptor to scout each star system I want the first launch at 17 30 yes sir Colonel how likely be we to find water on any of these planet now you want I to guess I take it Colonel Sir my apology Madam President difficult day for everyone I understand Most planet be just hunk of rock or ball of gas the galaxy be a pretty barren desolate place when you get right down to it thank you Colonel the water rationing'll make our supply problem bad Dr Baltar please share the result of your study I have calculate the rate of consumption regard basic foodstuff for the civilian population this be base on information available to I at the time the current civilian population of 45 265 will require at minimum 82 ton of grain 85 ton of meat 119 ton of fruit 304 ton of vegetable and 2 5 million jp of water be that per month per week they find your raptor a few or a lot that be what you get for come back for I Frack yeah I be sure they did n't track I come in I know I set the jigger to pulse I be sure you do I did n't set off any detection grid any dradi sweep or pinger never send a pilot to do an ECO 's job I can do your job I guess that be why the toaster be crawl all over our ride out of here I do n't suppose there be a Plan B plan B C D and e be the same as Plan A get off the planet and get back to the ship come on where be we go do n't ask question just follow your pilot yes sir Umm so far we have find five discrete detonation point in the tank and we believe that there may be a sixth I have suspect due to the size of the residual scoring and the burn point that we be deal with a G 4 type explosive so I have request a spot check of all inventory from the master at arm and she indicate to I that there be six detonator miss from a small arm locker in the port flight pod so one detonator may still be unaccounted for have the master at arm post guard at all small arm locker immediately it be already do sir she also have open an investigation into who may have have access to that locker however due to spotty record keeping and lax internal security procedure since the attack she believe that we may never know who take the detonator Chief thank you very much everyone except for Col Tigh Capt Adama and Dr Baltar be now release please remember this briefing be strictly confidential there be at least one Cylon aboard the Galactica how many people know the Cylons look human the rumour mill be be work overtime half the ship 's talk about it there 'll always be rumour for most people that be all they 'll ever be I be ask how many people actually know the five people in this room plus three Marines let we keep it that way once this get out officially people will be accuse each other of be cylon for no reason at all I agree Dr Baltar how be we do on the screening the screening you be suppose to be screen Galactica crew for potential Cylon agent do you remember the first time you lie to a woman other than your mother that be other than my mother Sherry Bennett fourth grade on the playground behind the band room if you show I yours I 'll show you mine she do I do not you know I think I sleep with she actually many year later of course of course do she turn out to be a beautiful woman as a matter of fact she do very beautiful but every woman have her beauty her feminine charm that be hers and hers alone Doctor Doctor the screening to tell you the truth there be significant problem with implement my Cylon detection method that I use aboard Galactica previously and basically because I have run out of natural resource I need chemical compound for example the precursor test I need large sample of tetrahydrocycline which I do n't have to tell you maybe I do have to it be a highly volatile chemical let I stop you there your intellect obviously outstrip everyone in this room but it be also obvious by the way that you be talk that in order to make large scale screening you be go to need help staff resource yes that be exactly what I be say exactly although more staff someone snoop around watch your every move maybe it 'll be a woman you could find her secret beauty I be go to assign Lt Gaeta to aid you in anything that you might need so much for that but the need for secrecy clearly this fall into the absolutely necessary category your screening technique may be critical to our very survival Humanity 's very survival rest in your hand now if only you have an actual Cylon detector this be a critical mission Fights have already break out on some ship over the ration there be panic in the air you do n't find water out there and find it soon I understand Captain we 'll find it good hunting Hey Chief Captain Lieutenant Chief I feel like my head 's about to explode just relax calm down Focus on the mission we 'll take care of everything when you get back what about the investigation Master at arm be run it do n't worry there be no connection to you in fact there be no reason to believe you have anything to do with it at all I do n't I know I would never do something like that never Sharon I know it be really important you believe I on this you do believe I right absolutely yes sir thank you Chief Carry on please excuse I for keep you wait I be call into the engine room it 'll just take a moment that be all right Sometime I would like to borrow a book or two I only bring one with I on the flight to Galactica what book a murder on Picon I have a weakness for mystery ever read Dark Day Edward Prima I be embarrassed to say it be one of those classic I have never get around to read I think you 'll enjoy it thank you it may be a while before I get this back to you it be a gift never lend book well then thank you for the gift I be really look forward to work with you Doctor you have a friend as be I Lieutenant I actually study genetic in college I be plan on go for my graduate degree through the military extension program Wonderful be that a card game and the girl win again another round come on guy grace under pressure nothing like lose a little money to take your mind off those 14 hour patrol Mind if I sit in Lieutenant lf you get the cubit we have get the chair of course if you have get anything to drink we 'll take that in lieu of cash you know I do n't have any money but this jacket must be worth at least 15 cubit it be make of the fine caprican cloth warm in winter cooling in summer it would look great on you Anybody else get any civilian clothe they would be interested in put on the table do n't let I keep you Col Tigh be right rioting break out on a cruise ship when they reduce water ration we need to demonstrate an ability to maintain order we need to do it now we do n't have extra manpower for fleet security you have the only armed discipline force available yeah but I be not go to be your policeman there be a reason why you separate military and the police one fight the enemy of the state the other serve and protect the people when the military become both then the enemy of the state tend to become the people I appreciate the complexity of the issue and I wo n't let that happen I 'll send troop to the cruise ship Commander I wo n't let that happen begin dradis one sweep begin dradis two sweep so I be think we should give this lovely little rock of nothing a name I be think Kimiko Kimiko after a lovely little lady in a lovely little city in a lovely little colony that I use to know whatever sorry so sorry you have such a good run though look like the bet be to I I 'll try and muddle through for another round I be go to raise you five no gut no glory Doctor I 'll see your five and raise you 20 now it be just you and I I be not use to play in this kind of high stake game it be not too late to bow out now there be an excellent suggestion and before proceed any further I should really examine my motivation for do so stay in the game I run the risk of lose my entire stake and be humiliate in front of these lovely people humiliate be a such a strong word Embarrassed would be my choice you do play rough do n't you a little too rough for you my hand be not that strong it would n't take much to knock I out of the game well thank you Doctor however without a little risk life would be so dull would n't it call three on a run full colour thank you all for a most pleasant evening a parting gift Hand roll from some of the fine fumarello leaf in Caprica and it be also one of the last left in the universe thank you my pleasure excuse I the Raptors have report back after three star system so far all report negative for water sir I just check with Astrometrics they be come up with big goose egg there be no star system within the range of our telescope with planetary body likely to have water on they Sir another Raptor just check in Negative on water as well who be leave Boomer and Crashdown sir if they come up negative as well what be our back up plan we 'll jump to another sector and start the search all over again Needle in a haystack more like grain of salt on a beach still nothing and more nothing I get nothing here either then that be it five moon five zero I be get thirsty just think about it hope somebody else have more luck out there yeah what be on your mind Boomer I do n't know I have this feeling let we run that last sweep again you be the boss begin sweep 21 beginning sweep 22 Boomer I be get nothing again how about you I be have trouble say it what do you mean I think I see oh I have positive contact yeah oh yes yeah good call Boomer Sir Dradis just pick up Boomer 's Raptor Let we hear it Galactica Crashdown Dradis sweep indicate it be time to break out the swimsuit because we have find water Repeat Positive water contact patch I in to the entire fleet you be connect sir Attention this be the commander we have find water let we go have a drink I think they be pleased I can hear they scream in the background Sharon be careful with that needle we be run low on anti radiation medicine not really Mom 's home cooking yeah it beat eat grass and leave we 'll be cook up a fine meal of twig and moss by the end of the week you spoil I can I ask you something Sharon why have you come back for I I hate to fly alone come on you disobey order fly back into this hellhole and not that I do n't appreciate it but why I just could n't leave you behind let we leave it at that it be a Colonial Fleet signal I ca n't decode it but it mean there be someone someone in the military be still alive and kick here in Caprica yes now all we have to do be find they way to go Boomer Nice work sir nice job let we get you debrief yes sir Chief you think you could take a look at my ejection pyro I think there be a short yeah cally no chief you could take a look at it yourself thank you for come Capt Apollo I be aware that you be in charge of the mission that destroy the Olympic Carrier I know what a hard thing that be to live with for all of we I be struggle with it myself frankly I ca n't stop think about it but a man have to accept responsibility for his action he do n't second guess the choice he make he live with they every day you know I remember when President Adar send the Marines into Aerilon fifteen people die in public of course he have to say all the usual thing he be sure of what he have do he make the right choice he stay the course but he know it be a mistake and he keep the name of the dead in his desk drawer he say that it be imperative for a leader to remember and learn from the mistake even if they ca n't admit to they publicly you think we make a mistake I do n't know I do n't have a desk drawer yet but I have a pocket I do n't want to add to your burden however I have a request I would like you to be my personal military advisor I be sorry my father be the senior military officer he should advise you no I do n't mean to go behind your father 's back nothing like that

there be a Plan B plan B c D e be the same as a get off the planet and get back to the ship how much water do we lose almost 60 of total potable water reserve if we do n't find new supply they 'll run out of water in two day Reveille morning station aboard Battlestar Galactica all hand report to your station so what do we have good news Colonel we scout the ice moon find an entire subsurface ocean we have get report and video for you not exactly Caprica Beach down there Chief no sir we have register temperature 180 and below venting of methane and C02 it be gon na be a bitch to work down there sir Cheer up you know how lucky we be we find this ugly rock Water riot break out all over the fleet Civilians Whiney civie cry baby ca n't stand less than a hot shower every day yes sir even Galactica be down to 10 000 jp of water ever see a man die of dehydration no sir let we hope you never do it be n't pretty so where be we we drill 23 core sample 13 sodium chloride what the hell we ca n't drink salt water no sir that be why I have cally test the ice well there you go pure water Couple of lemon we could make lemonade yes sir we 'll have to melt the ice before we transport it up to the ship what be that gon na take high capacity heater expansion tank d 25 plasma torch Myrex hose centrifugal pump sound like a lot of manpower ideally 1 000 man sir one thousand man and where be they gon na come from slave labour they be criminal they have be sentence to hard labour and this be very hard labour not to mention physically dangerous this be not for civilian but their ship be n't design for long term incarceration these man have be stick in cramp cell for week now they might even prefer to get out do something even if it be dangerous if they volunteer but these be n't slave and I will not have they treat as such no we could offer incentive point towards earn freedom excuse I you wanna start release harden criminal into the fleet Sir these man be on their way to Caprica for parole hearing which at least imply they may be ready for release make it happen Captain yes sir to address Commander Adama 's concern I would like you to go along and set up a screening procedure to weed out the harden criminal I would like to have a representative from Galactica who will report directly to I about security issue how about d Second Class Petty Officer Dualla I know who she be I be not sure she be conversant with the technical detail she 'll be fine but we should send someone from ground crew who 'll make sure the choose man know to use the equipment agree I have to get to

maybe you have something you want to say I have nothing to say to the personal representative of the President I be still Galactica 's lead pilot I have nothing to say to he either every man have to decide for themselves which side they be on I did n't know we be pick side that be why you have n't pick one yet I be a bus driver not a warden how many total 1 500 they do n't give I their file or their name Hell they be just number thank Wilkens all right they be all yours I be Capt Lee Adama personal representative of the President we be in a crisis thousand of we be on the verge of die from dehydration the good news be we have find water the bad news be it be locate on a moon with harsh environmental condition we need 1 000 able bodied man to help we get that water President Roslin feel that you represent our good chance she also recognise that you be not slave any man who volunteer to help we during this emergency will earn freedom point which can be apply toward earn his release we

at people do n't always get the good result sir I learn that at officer candidate school you be right on the edge Thrace careful you do n't fall off speaking of fall off glad to see you have find a way to quench your thirst they wo n't negotiate while you be hold hostage I do n't wanna negotiate then what do you want to be treat like man not animal finally have something to bargain with so what happen now we be gon na talk what about your father be this a Monclair original yes Fantastic would you like some water yes thank you I be not a collector myself but I I be familiar with his work and may I say you really do have an excellent eye for art thank you where be my Cylon detector Doctor oh that yes it be take long than expect unfortunately what be the hang up it be not work this time Gaius he can see right through you there be a number of obstacle none of they insurmountable but they do tend to slow we down for a start the lack of proper facility the water shortage of course the water shortage not to mention cut the BS you say you have a way of detect human from Cylon do you or do n't you I do n't what I do n't think that I be the man for this job I be not cut out for this kind of work you have to do this why do I keep put it off it be my subconscious tell I that I be not the man for this job please listen to I if you do n't tell he what he want to hear he be go to find you out and when he do they be go to tear your head off and throw your body out of an air lock Pardon I I have n't have much sleep recently so unfortunately Doctor for both of we you be the last man we have so what be the game plan Doc this be what you say Commander the truth be there be one way say it Commander the truth be there be one way I did n't wanna have to ask you for this but what I really need to complete the project be a nuclear warhead that how you get to be the personal representative of the President because of your father hardly so they do n't get along Adama and Roslin they have their difference but not when it come to deal with terrorist I think you say you respect I Read my book that be before you resort to violence and hostage take always well when the oppress do n't fight back be n't it a warhead technically I need the plutonium inside Technically I need the plutonium inside figure out the rest for yourself as you may know the Cylons be susceptible to certain kind of radiation and by take the plutonium and embed it in a carbon nanotube matrix and it really be that simple I can construct a filter that will preferentially ionise synthetic molecule and thus deliver to you your Cylons we have five warhead leave aboard this ship we may need they yes of course if you really think that this project have a low priority then you be totally within your bound to you 'll get your warhead good boy thank you Commander look the master at arm have be over every inch of that locker she be come up with nothing so they have get no idea who take those six g 4 charge or who put that detonator in do n't worry about it I 'll take care of it okay I need to speak with the Lieutenant alone you do n't honestly think you have be fool everyone do you I know the old man know Hell the whole ship know about you and the Chief it stop now Sir the Chief and I be just friend when the ship be be decommission we let it go Hell we let people get away with murder that be then and this be now we be at war this be a combat unit and you be his superior officer Put a stop to it that be an order yes sir Attention pass the word for Col Tigh Col Tigh please report to the CIC the crew be my prisoner they will not be harm be you record this yes sir what be this Trouble but I have two condition before I release my captive first the government which control our fate be illegal and illegitimate and it must submit to the will of the people I demand the immediate resignation of Laura Roslin and her minister Second I demand free and open election to choose a new leadership and a new government that represent all of the people these demand be make not for I or the former slave hold on this ship but for you the people the survivor of the holocaust and the child of humanity 's future I be Tom Zarek and this be the first day of the new era we have jam his transmission a little bit late for that every ship in the fleet hear that broadcast it do n't matter it do matter he be try to bring down the government no one'll take it seriously you have something to learn when it come to public opinion Commander Tom Zarek be a name with weight he be a very sympathetic figure a legend almost twenty year in prison over a matter of principle he be a criminal and a terrorist People wo n't give he credence do n't be so sure Commander rebellion be contagious People be already riot over the water crisis we ca n't afford to destabilise this government right now I agree when be you go in I assume you be gon na talk to he first we do n't negotiate with terrorist I say talk there be nothing to talk about what he want I ca n't give he we be not ready yet talk to Zarek give we a little bit more time that be what he want legitimacy he want to be recognise he want his crime validate I watch President Adar offer he a full pardon if he would apologise and give up violence as a means of political change he refuse no commitment no deal I 'll let you know what happen three assault team Alpha Bravo Constellation we jam their dradi the Raptors cut through the hull here here and here without be see once we be inside Alpha take what be this we crap I be go sir like hell we have a few marine leave on Galactica let they handle it starbuck they do n't have a sniper with all due respect I be the good shot in or out of the cockpit she be right for once wonder never cease all right you be go in you get a clear shot at Zarek you take it I wanna control that ship immediately and I want all the hostage alive yes sir I do n't even know how I draw this detail President think you would be valuable President do n't know who I be I tell she sorry on the other hand it be nice to get out of the CIC break up the day meet new people yeah you be not asleep not anymore be that

teach combat tactic you know I do n't know if I would be of any use to you I be n't the most patient let we get down to it this be about Zak it be not your fault you have nothing to do with what happen it be an accident Lee Zak fail basic flight what or at least he should have but he did n't because I pass he his technique be sloppy and he have no feel for fly but I pass he because he and I because I feel something and I let it get in the way of do my job and I could n't fail he Zak pass basic flight he be train and ready to sit in that cockpit what happen to he could 've happen to any qualified pilot you know that be true right you do your job to the good of your ability that be all I can ask I need new pilot and I want you to train they I can do that just give they the attention

'll take that as a yes all right I 'll put out a med request to the civilian fleet maybe there be some other wide eyed dreamer out there with a secret horde of Chamalla extract in their luggage Put your clothe back on now thank you and for what it be worth I would seriously consider prayer Boonie jumper Shuttle jockie and a Fleet Academy wash out this be the good that you could come up with diamond in the rough yeah right they be the most qualified pilot in the fleet Great Attention on deck that mean get on your foot nugget you be join the Colonial Fleet boy and girl not some after school club Seats Pilots call I Starbuck but you may refer to I as God you have all fly before but you be about to enter a whole new world so pay attention we do n't have any flight simulator on board so we be put you into the cockpit today this be the Viper Mark II it be as manoeuvrable as a jack rabbit and can flip end for end in 0 35 second you have never fly anything remotely like it so do n't think that you have today we 'll do basic launch approach and land manoeuvre and anyone not pay attention be liable to end up as a puddle or something to be hose out of the cockpit by the chief of the deck she be lay it on a little thick Costanza right yes God sir not anymore from now on your name be Hot Dog and when God speak Hot Dog you listen maybe if you have learn that at the Academy you would n't have wash out sit up Viper 791 Galactica you be clear for approach Speed 175 port bay hand on approach checker green call the ball I have the ball Easy on the throttle Kat be you listen to I do n't chase the light okay Roger Starbuck Kat do n't chase the light set it by the number and correct with thruster Wave off punch it Kat bad than awful wretched beyond belief actually you call yourselves pilot it 'll take the knuckle dragger a week to pound your divot out of the flight deck with due respect sir that be unfair yes sir this be only our first day no it be your last it would be criminal to let any of you near a viper again so pack your gear and get the hell off my ship you be do what be you do here Kara you ca n't wash they out on their first day I just do look I get 40 viper and 21 pilot that be it we be sit duck until we finish water op 's we ca n't even maintain a cap and god forbid the Cylons show up god forbid let we bring in the next group of candidate the next group have never even be in a cockpit they be start basic flight then they start basic flight because that group be do it say so right there maybe you should read it again Lt Thrace this be not a request well Capt Adama I be the flight instructor sir my word be scripture sir I will not repeat not pass another student who be n't ready so that be what this be about it be not they it be Zak careful step back Starbuck say they ca n't cut it they ca n't cut it she be not give they a chance it be Day 1 she be one of the fine pilot I have ever see in my life one day in the cockpit be all she need to know if they can hack it or not she get that I be not argue that sir I be just say that I think she be let her personal feeling cloud her judgment please sit down Captain what be those feeling about Zak we have talk about Zak you do we have talk about a lot of thing we have be aboard this ship for over two year we know each other very well when I ask she to be the instructor I know it be go to release a lot of loose baggage she acknowledge it she be a professional she 'll do her job okay I be just say that you should talk to her she be walk around with a lot of emotion she almost deck I in the rec room right you would n't smile if you be there I 'll talk to her thank you Personally I think she be try to work out her guilt over what she do for Zak I think she be make up for it by beat up on these guy Guilt over what what do she do for Zak I think you just say what do she do it be not my place to say and I have already say more than I should have you 'll have to ask she I be sorry Captain just Dad you 'll have to ask she I do n't want any special treatment not from my father and certainly not from you you pass by the skin of your tooth but you pass Attention pass the word to Lt Thrace Lt Thrace please report to the CO 's quarter yes come in Lee be just here before I know it he think you wash out the nugget without give they a chance they did n't cut it that be it he think you be let personal feeling cloud your judgment really your feeling about Zak that be not the case okay he say something else he say something that I would like to ask you directly he say that you might be feel guilty about something that you do for Zak what do you do for he I do n't know ask Lee I be ask you I do n't know I do n't really know what he be talk about so do n't fence with I Kara I love you like a daughter I do n't deserve that Zak fail basic flight he be n't a bad pilot he just have no feel for fly and when it come to his final check ride he bust three of the test manoeuvre and I should have flunk he but I did n't the bottom line be that your son did n't have the chop to fly a viper and it kill he he tell I that you be an amazing instructor and that he be involve with you and that it be serious he ask I to come to his graduation from flight school to watch he get his wing I know I read the letter I see then maybe you can tell I what he be hint at Surprise about you we be go to you know what it be not important I do n't want that to you be engage right you do it because you be engage because I make a mistake and because I be just I be so in love with he and I let that get in the way of do my job he just want it so much and I did n't want to be the one who crush he reinstate the trainee to flight status I will I just want you to understand that I do your job yes sir and walk out of this cabin while you still can unpack your gear you be all return to flight status we be go to try this again those of you who can be train to safely fly the viper Mark II will pass those of you who can not will be cut it be my job to figure out which be which without personal feeling either way and I be go to do my job Kat Chuckles Hot Dog you be up first pre flight briefing in 20 minute where the hell be you go Hot Dog stay on I Target acquire and destroy not bad Hot Dog but you leave your leader behind look like you be have a bad day Hot Dog and the moral of this story be never leave your leader thank you that be correct you never want to be out here alone okay chuckle take Kat 's wing Hot Dog you be on I we 'll try a little manoeuvre call Thorch Weave I 'll be damn what be get into Starbuck she actually sound like a real instructor for a change she may actually make viper pilot out of some of those nugget after all Holy crap we have get incoming where the hell do they come from Dradis multiple contact it be the Cylons why did n't we see they come launch the alert fighter Attention Set Condition 1 throughout the fleet Galactica send the Calvary Nuggets punch it for home where be the base ship no base ship detect sir eight raider bear 047 carom 118 Range 22 000 they find we it be only a matter of time Galactica Starbuck where the hell be the alert fighter Starbuck Alert One be there in two minute the Cylons be gain all right listen up nugget stay together and keep your throttle firewalle until you hit the deck now go what be she do Starbuck 's gon na take on all eight and get herself kill Hot Dog where be you go Hot Dog what be you do get one Hot Dog get out of here Hot Dog I tell you to get your ass home you say never to leave your leader I also say never to disobey an order I be hit I get you Hot Dog we be go to make it through this Break right now she 'll make it I just lose all three main it be all right Hot Dog you do good we be gon na be okay I promise you at least one of we will that about do it I think there be only one leave Frack he be right on my tail but I get it cover Starbuck 's wireless and transponder just cut out Alert One we spot Hot Dog no ID or visual on Starbuck Frack I previously on Battlestar Galactica Zak fail basic flight and I should have flunk he but I did n't the bottom line be that I kill he walk out of this cabin while you still can I do n't get it how do a military code signal end up come from in here food it be the Cylons Starbuck 's wireless and transponder just cut out Starbuck 's gon na take on all eight and get herself kill Galactica Hot Dog 's aboard yeah so be his lunch take it easy Hot Dog you be not the first to lose it in combat you wo n't be the last no sign of Starbuck he say she be hit but still in the fight when he lose track of her Roger that search and rescue op be underway for Starbuck Bring Hot Dog in the old man want to talk to he this be where you find he yes sir he drift quite a way from the fight be she manoeuvre I think so yes yes sir so she survive the initial hit she could still be alive she be alive Lieutenant we be gon na find she yes sir get this man to sick bay yes sir I think you earn those today the auxiliary RT switch stick a little sir but she 'll fly Polish up the canopy I want it crystal clear yes sir find she I will still no joy from the search team in the last four hour we have comb everywhere in a 200 click sphere around Starbuck 's last known position no ship no ejection seat no debris so we be extend the radius another 50 we need more pilot everybody who can fly be up sir what about Starbuck 's course computation the variable of combat manoeuvring make they almost meaningless it be time to start guess yes sir since there be be no dradis contact in the area I would have to guess that her viper be capture by the gravity of a planetary body the only nearby gravity well be the gas giant and this moon if the gas giant pull she in its radiation would fry she like an egg what about the moon the spectroscope people call the atmosphere as CO2 methane some argon the cloud be mostly hydrocarbon Cold as hell down there but she would survive on the surface until her oxygen run out when forty six hour and change sir Hell of a long time to stay in one place what if the Cylons appear they wo n't not for a while what make you say that send a patrol instead of the base ship tell I they did n't even know we be here so they be search a lot of other place place with potential supply like stake out water hole in the desert if we send eight fighter to search an entire star system for 60 odd ship it would take we week assume they be well and fast it 'll take they day a lot of assumption you be make Educated guess talk to I about search the moon that be go to be slow go we ca n't see squat through those cloud send the ship below the cloud cover tell the pilot to take a hard look the old fashioned way Mark one Eyeball sir Mark one Eyeball Commander call from Colonial One Adama Commander Adama I do n't wanna take much of your time I want to say how happy we all be you find one of your pilot thank you Madam President how be the search progressing for the other pilot nothing yet but we have just begin I have speak with the other captain in the fleet they have agree to give over their ship at your disposal if it 'll increase the odd of find she Frack the odd we be go to find her excuse I thank you tell they we could sure use the help I 'll coordinate their effort with your CIC continue good luck thank you thank you so it look like we be go to be stay here for a while you all right yeah I be fine it be just a how long you think it will be before the Cylons wonder what happen to their miss patrol and send another one here to look for it you have attack we hundred of time we be still here I think you 'll find that we be more than adequately protect might be a little tricky with the fleet scatter over half this system iooke for the lost pilot how many day till the Cylons return Gaius one two three at the most doctor your requisition thank you Madam President I do n't mean to be impertinent really but do you honestly think this be wise you be compromise the security of the entire fleet while we search for one solitary pilot it be a risk but those pilot put their life on the line for we every day yes I be just say that to I be not insensitive that be what I be say I happen to know the miss pilot personally not as personally as you would like guess you 'll never find out if she be a real blonde it be all the more difficult for I on one hand I think of the pilot and on the other hand I think of the thousand of defenceless woman and child I mean throughout the fleet I be sure Commander Adama have consider all of this thank you Doctor yes of course he have of course he have thank you it be okay okay get to high ground then they see you then they rescue you Apollo Galactica we be be bounce around like beach ball down here Visibility about two good spectrum Copy Apollo Blue blue flight go vertical now anything no I do n't think anyone 's leave out there must be someone we ca n't be the only two people leave in the world good news be my leg 's much well and we have get anti radiation med to last three month I say we load up as much food as we can and move out try to find a Raptor or a transport or something we can fly off Caprica unless you can think of a reason to stay not really look forward to go back out there I have almost start to think of this place as home home no sleep a little long who know when we 'll find clean sheet again I be go to go topside and make some breakfast Breakfast hey be breakfast ready get out of here go Lords it be Kara Thrace I be run a little low on O2 and I could use a lucky break you know okay just think I would mention it not bad shooting if I do say so myself Lords I owe you one look like I find my ride out of here if I can fix you up Galactica Apollo Bingo fuel Roger Apollo Return to base ca n't you tank I in orbit Negative Apollo the tanker be refill you 'll be dry before they can launch be these figure correct yes sir atmospheric op mean Viper and Raptor engine run continuously Fuel 's go to be a real problem if we keep it up any report from the civilian ship nothing they be spread pretty far out we 'll have a hell of a time try to cover they if the Cylons pop in we should consider pull the civvie into a defensible formation no keep all the ship on the search we have leave enough people behind I do n't wanna leave Starbuck behind commit the entire fleet to this I say no we be go to find our miss pilot and we be go to bring her home we leave no one behind resume your duty Sharon Sharon where be you Damn it Sharon where be you Sharon Frack I be you alive what the hell happen this time Captain I hit the roll thruster to level off for set down but only the left one fire it be that crap you be fly into down there gum everything up get I another Viper Love to but this be 13 Vipers that be down plus your Mark VII I be out I have get a pilot down and I need another viper now I realise that captain but you can push people a lot far than machine I be the CAG you be the Chief just make it happen Commander the clock have pass five hour sir for Starbuck 's O2 supply note here be the photo mosaic for the area we search so far we have get to do well than this ca n't see far when you be hug the ground you ca n't see anything from altitude not to mention the crap in the air that keep screw up our ship Thirteen Vipers down for repair we need more eye where we go to get they pull the CAP what redeploy the Combat Air Patrol to the search bad idea the CAP be the fleet 's only defence if all viper be fracke around on the moon when the Cylons come call we be maggot meat then bring the fleet close to the moon we can always scramble the Vipers from the search to meet any attack bottom line we can double the area we can search in the time we have leave Starbuck would be the first one to tell you not to do this nothing would make you happy would it leave she behind get rid of the foul mouthed insubordinate pilot that keep challenge your authority you be way out of line I be not the one confuse personal feeling with duty what the hell do that mean you be way too close to this because she be your friend gentleman we have work to do Captain get as many bird up in the air as you can and you find our girl you get it oh my god you bite I I 'll bite you back so I guess the only thing fly you be you this must be your brain I do n't think you 'll need it good thing that I bring one of my own even cockroach have to breathe how the hell do you Captain call for you sir can someone finish this up for I where be it that way yeah Apollo hold for President Roslin how be you hold up well than my viper we be slap one together from piece of the other I need your help do you know that your father just redeploy the Combat Air Patrol yes Madam President it be my idea your idea we need every viper we have get maybe I be miss something about the tactic involve but be n't the fleet defenceless without the CAP only for a short time because after that Kara 's oxygen will be go and she 'll be dead be you very close with Lt Thrace I be close with all my pilot and I assume the same be true for your father his pilot mean a lot to he to all of we we do n't leave anyone behind but we have leave people behind you know that not this time your ftl drive should be spin up and ready just make sure everyone be set to jump at the first sign of trouble with all due respect Captain there be time when it be necessary for the safety of the fleet to put not this time we just have n't exhaust all the option and the safety of the fleet have not be compromise I hope you find she thank you blue flight report bingo fuel sir have they stay on the search send the tanker to they be there a problem Mr Gaeta it be just that try to tank in that turbulence sir will be extremely hairy I suggest we wait until the clock have run down and then tank up on the way back to Galactica do someone call they back to Galactica I just assume the search be over it be hopeless that we should write Starbuck off as dead be that what you be tell I Mr Gaeta no sir then what be you try to tell I Mr Gaeta you have your order yes sir Time be up she be out of O2 the clock be a guess we do n't know for a fact that Starbuck be out of air her tank only hold so much oxygen she could have a reserve supply in her survival gear a reserve yes what she just happen to pack an extra bottle today it be possible we be put people at risk we have pilot out there we be not quit push themselves their ship too hard all for the sake of we be not quit and you be relieve Colonel I stand relieve sir come on you be part biological right which mean you need oxygen right so it be get to be here somewhere Commander the President Adama Commander Adama I just want to say how very sorry I be about Lt Thrace please give my condolence to your son and to the rest of the crew excuse I Madam but I think you have be misinform how we do n't know if Starbuck 's dead I be tell that her oxygen have run out a half an hour ago that be an estimate she may have a reserve supply we 'll continue the search as long as there be a chance she may be alive and how long will that be until I say stop this be a military decision Madam President thank you for your concern first on the list seal you up figure out what control what one of we need a bath now you be go to teach I how to fly Red Flight report an area of highland here increase visibility out to 15 click maybe it be the wrong side of the moon Commander almost impossible to we have a signal from Colonial One 's shuttle they request permission to land the President 's on board why be n't I notify the President be come onboard there be no advance notice sir I did n't know she be come let we go have Col tigh meet she at the airlock bring she to my quarter please very well every fly machine have four basic control power pitch yaw and roll where be yours safety tip number one do n't touch that be you go to order we to stop the search I come here to talk not to give order it may take an order why Col Tigh do I need to know something it be go beyond military need it be personal for the Commander and Lee because of Lt Thrace because of her and because of Zak Adama the Commander 's dead son it be complicated take about three week to explain we have get about three minute talk fast she be go to press I be with you President Roslin Madam President Skip the formality you both know why I be here termination of a pilot 's rescue mission be a military decision that be a bunch of crap this be n't military it be personal neither of you can let go of Kara Thrace because she be your last link to Zak you do n't know anything about my brother do n't even begin Captain you have lose perspective as have you under normal circumstance it would just be sad that you two ca n't come to term with Zak 's death in this situation you be put your pilot at risk you be expose the fleet to possible attack every moment we stay here we have be at risk of an attack since day one the Cylons wo n't be miss their patrol for at least one more day Col Tigh how much aviation fuel have be expend in this operation forty three percent of reserve almost half that be unacceptable Operations in the moon 's atmosphere have put one third of your fighter out of action that be also completely unacceptable Crap Unacceptable whatever it be you feel about this the recovery of one pilot be a military matter all right it be military Fine and you be both officer and you be both honourable man you be both perfectly aware that you be put the life of over 45 000 people and the future of this civilisation at risk for your personal feeling now if the two of you of all people can live with that then the human race do n't stand a chance clear your head Combat Stand by this be the Commander terminate search operation bring everyone home prepare the fleet to make a

woman screw up look here be my view independent tribunal openness transparency it all sound great but after 20 year in political office I be tell you these thing have a way of inflict damage on the people you least expect I do not want a witch hunt on our hand so where be you at the time of the bombing in my rack read some trashy novel Socinus give I do you see the Chief Chief he be on the

afternoon and thank you for come please be seat I be sure by now word of the explosion on the Galactica have spread to the entire fleet we offer our continue gratitude to the brave man and woman aboard this mighty ship in consultation with Commander Adama I have appoint an independent tribunal to investigate the circumstance surround this explosion also in the interest of security and public safety I feel it be time to reveal certain information that have until now remain a tightly guard secret this information be know only to myself Commander Adama and a few select advisor the cat 's out of the bag the Cylons have the ability to mimic human form they look like we now we have reason to believe that a Cylon agent be responsible for the explosion aboard Galactica this man have be identify as a Cylon agent we believe he to be responsible for the bombing he evidently slip aboard the Galactica with a civilian group kill a Marine guard steal the explosive and detonate they kill three member of the crew and destroy himself this man have also be identify as a Cylon and we now know that there be duplicate of each Cylon model anyone see either of these two man at anytime anywhere in the fleet should immediately contact the Battlestar Galactica and the office of the President now I 'll take your question they have know about this the whole time and they tell we now Cylon I mean who be the Cylon now this be too much I do n't even want to know this excuse I sir will you come with we please what why what be go on Sergeant Chief we need you to come along as well you be arrest the Chief who be arrest he no one be under arrest what be all this step back Lieutenant ask you a question Sergeant a Tribunal have be convene to look into the Cylon penetration of our defence it require the presence of Lt Valerii and Chief Tyrol I be here to escort they to the Wardroom Sir very well proceed thank you sir Lieutenant Chief you 'll come with I please you be it till I get back do n't worry Lt Valerii where be you at the time of the explosion I be in my rack Asleep do anyone see you sir I do n't know I be asleep Lieutenant be it true that you and the Chief be involve in a romantic and physical relationship in violation of the Colonial Code of Military Conduct I think this be about just answer the question please be you and the Chief involve in a relationship no the XO order we to put a stop to it and so we do Sir can you testify as to the whereabouts of Chief Petty Officer Tyrol at the time of the bombing I have no idea where he be thank you sir you be excuse Lieutenant but I be sure he have nothing to do with the bombing you be excuse Lieutenant Bring in the next witness please the testimony you give before this tribunal may be use to adjudicate your guilt or innocence in the matter under investigation do you understand yes the matter be investigate be first how a Cylon penetrate Galactica 's security system and second whether one of Galactica 's crew member aid and abet this crime through conspiracy and collusion with the Cylons Collusion with the Cylons do you consent to give your testimony freely without invoke your right to remain silent as provide for under the 23rd article of Colonization I do then let we begin they be go after the Chief they be go after the Cylons what the hell do that mean wake up the world 's change while you be asleep Frak you cylon look like people that mean anyone anyone not the Chief how do you know I know this be stupid you two just do n't want to deal with reality you want to keep your head bury in the sand that be exactly what the Cylons want for we to turn on each other start get suspicious paranoid she be right if we do n't believe in each other when the heat come down we be nothing that kind of thinking be over it be every man for himself now you well watch your back you have the mid watch before the bombing correct yes would you please explain to the tribunal what you do on watch I walk the perimeter of the Hangar Deck the tool room storage facility to make sure all hatch be seal yes that no unauthorised personnel be poke around where they should n't that be right and there be no one on the Hangar Deck that night I believe that be what your log say what about the hatch comb for Causeway C anybody see you no I go through the hatch comb on C Causeway your log indicate that all hatch and portal be lock and seal if that be what the log indicate then that be the case which would include the hatch comb for Causeway C I do n't know where the Sergeant be go with this but they be not relate what if I tell you that I find the hatch open after the bombing I would say that I do n't know how that be possible it be not just any hatch on the Hangar Deck it open onto a causeway which lead directly to a small arm locker where a Marine guard be find dead at the scene the locker be open with the correct code do you have the correct code to that locker Chief yes I do as do dozen of other include the guard it be possible the Cylon force the guard to open it before he kill he I want to take this opportunity to state that that be an internal security matter and this fall under the purview of the Master at arm and the Master at Arms be Sergeant Hadrian do Lt Valerii leave the hatch comb open last night I have no idea who leave the hatch comb open last night Chief be you do paperwork at the time of the bombing no be you work on a viper at that time no be you watch a pick up game of Pyramid in the mess hall at the time of the bombing no as I tell you early today I be asleep in my rack then why do I have three different statement from three of your deckhand state variously that they all see you and you be anywhere but in your rack Chief Tyrol where be you at the time of the bombing be you in fact meeting with a Cylon agent I exercise my right under Article 23 by invoke the 23rd article at this time the tribunal will look on this as further evidence of your guilt so I will ask you one last time who be you with at the time of the bombing and be this person a Cylon agent your sworn statement indicate that you be on watch at the time of the bombing and that you see Chief Tyrol work on one of the Vipers be that true yes sir Specialist can you explain to we why Chief Tyrol tell we in his testimony that he be in his rack asleep at the time of the bombing speak up Specialist he say that do you see he or did n't you Specialist no I do not sir so the Chief do not come to the Hangar Deck after all I do n't know I leave my post excuse I I leave my post sir I duck out to get a smoke I go to the galley to get some chow the Chief I mean I do n't know where he be I be sure he be asleep in his rack just like he say you go to the galley yes sir do you go through the hatch comb on C Deck well to get to the galley that would be the good way yes sir I go through that hatch do you leave it open I be not sure yes sir I think I do the Chief have nothing to do with it it be I I leave my post and I leave the hatch open it be I just I you realise that by leave the hatch open you allow a Cylon to gain access to the small arm locker yes sir Specialist do Chief Tyrol instruct you to leave the hatch open deliberately as part of a conspiracy to allow the Cylon to gain access to the small arm locker the Chief be innocent he did n't do anything Specialist do you leave the hatch open deliberately yes sir whatever happen it be I just I South you overestimate his willingness to risk himself for you he just do n't love you wait North toward his love seem you make an impression after all he be a good man he always do the right thing be you prepared for the next step yes hello Lieutenant Doctor I bring you a cigar a recovery gift how be you I be good the food be good company be well yes I just happen to be absolutely nowhere near sick bay I think I would see how you be do so doctor your super secret project 's on C Deck right I be not at liberty to divulge exactly what I be do on C Deck but you be more than welcome to pop by once you be ambulatory the bomber be on C Deck right yes I know I hear the explosion very frightening do you think that be where he be head I be sorry I did n't follow you the Cylon bomber do you think that he be try to blow up your project and you along with it it be funny I had n't think of that kind of hit you where you live huh yes it do actually you get well soon they be try to kill I I always I they be try to destroy your work destroy you be an add bonus but why I do n't understand why be they try to blow I up you tell I what to do I would n't be make this Cylon detector if it be n't for you but I be just in your head Gaius they do n't know about I or we or our life together how romantic I be go to have to destroy that Cylon detector myself blame the sabotage on Cylon agent that be what I 'll tell Adama no you wo n't you be gon na complete the project just like I tell you really would I or what do n't make I angry Gaius you would n't like I when I be angry Sharon be that enough no Sharon would n't give up without a much earn fight do you read the tribunal report yes and I be sorry to read that one of your man have be charge with conspiracy and collusion with a Cylon agent Specialist Socinus but after read the transcript I have my doubt what about this other man your Chief Tyrol he take the 23rd what be that about do you think it be his right the court have never hold that invoke the right to remain silent can be use as evidence of guilt you sound like a lawyer my father be a lawyer civil liberty Let we set aside the legality for a moment obviously you be defend your man I respect that I do but he be hide something Chief Tyrol have be under my command for over five year and if he have really want to take this ship down he could this be over Madam President I be gon na have to call you right back what I have order to bring you before the tribunal sir let we go it be okay Helo what be happen can you walk I think so come on I get you okay now we be even I think we should go right okay come on it be go to be all right you be go to be just fine Commander Adama when do you first learn the truth about the Cylons on Ragnar station before we leave and you choose to withhold this crucial information sir yes why I feel that to alarm the public would only cause chaos and panic but you also withhold the information from your own security detachment aboard ship sir not know who to trust I decide to keep the information compartmentalise for the time be Sir be n't it true that have we know that the Cylons appear human different security procedure would have be follow probably but I have to weigh the possible ramification of both be n't it also true sir that have different procedure be follow the bombing may have be prevent that be speculative I be ask if it be possible I know what you be ask Sergeant I will not speculate as to what might have happen do you personally believe that a Cylon agent plant explosive in the ship 's water tank yes do you believe that there be Cylon agent aboard ship even as we speak yes I do Sir be n't it true that you know that Lt Valerii and Chief Tyrol be have an illicit relationship in violation of regulation I do n't see the relevance of this line of question Sergeant the commander should bear in mind that my question be not subject to the Commander 's review why do you allow the relationship to continue know it be against regulation I be a soft touch Sir be you aware that both Lt Valerii and Chief Tyrol have be implicate as possibly be in collusion with the Cylons I be aware of the allegation where be you go with this I will ask the question sir be n't it true that by allow their relationship to continue in violation of regulation you may have make it possible for two Cylon collaborator to compromise the safety and security of this ship we be do here excuse I sir but my question be not finish you have lose your way Sergeant you have lose sight of the purpose of the law to protect its citizen not persecute they whatever we be whatever be leave of we we be well than that now these proceeding be close you 'll be transport back to your ship and we appreciate your help Commander this be an independent board you have no authority to close our inquiry this be a witch hunt I will not have it aboard my ship Corporal of the guard restrain the Commander and return he back to the witness chair your order be to escort Sergeant Hadrian back to her quarter and keep she in confinement until further notice make your choice son Sergeant Hadrian you 'll come with we please she be just about to speak yes I try to get an interview with she myself good evening have a seat the investigation into the suicide bombing aboard Galactica and how it be allow to occur have come to a close you be all aware that the bomber be a Cylon agent the tribunal have determine that the Cylon gain access to the explosive by go through a hatch door in the Hangar Deck of the ship this door be leave open due to negligence of one of the ship 's crewman his name be Specialist Socinus he have confess to lie under oath and dereliction of duty in a time of war he have be strip of his rank and confine to the Brig at this point we have no reason to believe that there be any other party responsible now I 'll take your question you sir Commander permission to enter what be it Chief thank you sir Sir I believe that Socinus I believe that his confession be a lie I think that he be cover for I for you I think that he be do this out of a sense of misplaced loyalty to I Somewhere in this there be truth Care to take I to it Sir I be with Lt Valerii at the time of the bombing the Deck gang they all know it they have know all along they be try to cover for I they start lie Socinus I think that he think he be help protect I by take a fall like this you do n't really know if he be on duty or not do you Commander he be innocent I know that much I should be in the Brig well that be a fact you should be in the Brig Commander this be n't right you ca n't let an innocent kid I ca n't what I ca n't do be I ca n't let someone that wear this uniform get on the witness stand and lie under oath and that be what your man do he either lie the first time or he lie the second time and it do n't matter he be guilty and he 'll pay the price you you 'll pay a different price you 'll have to walk out on that Hangar Deck every day know that one of your man be in the Brig because you could n't keep your fly zip you be the most experienced noncommissioned officer we have leave you keep my plane fly I need my plane to fly dismiss Sir Sharon no what Sharon we be do it be over what do you

protect you I risk my career my freedom my integrity for what so some innocent kid one of my kid can take the fall for I no we be not worth that okay right I guess I 'll see you around one more thing

answer you have the only answer you be ever gon na get previously on Battlestar Galactica ignore I wo n't help no I have decide you be an expression of my subconscious mind play itself out in my wake state so I be in your head of course if you be not really here neither be I do you have any idea what they would do to I if they find out they would probably charge you with treason Treason be

darling be bore I to death with your superstitious drivel your metaphysical nonsense which to be fair actually appeal to the half educate dullard that make up most of human society but which I hasten to add no rational intelligent free thinking human being truly believe which lead I to the inescapable conclusion that cylon be in the final that cylon be in the final analysis little more than toaster with great look leg it be my fantasy see if I care I 'll dream up someone new a brunette maybe maybe we can dispense with the foreplay get right down to what do you say that be nothing I be just talk to myself I talk to myself hang I the Commander would like to see you in the CIC Doctor there you be very nice that blouse could open up a button excuse I you want to see I Commander Miss

attack he be try to reach the President and inform she when he be kill he tell you that do he yes it be a pity he be no long with we how convenient that we only have your word for that there be also this yeah what the frack be that he give I this for safekeepe it be ID code Colonial Defence Ministry Dr Amarak give the disk to I before he die what as oppose to after he die he give I the disk for safekeepe on the disk be a photo it be capture from the security camera in the defence mainframe on Caprica it show the doctor enter the mainframe without permission the day before the attack nothing criminal about that as you can see the man in the photo be carry an explosive device sorry what I definitely never do that just before the Cylon attack the entire defence mainframe be destroy by this device honestly that be not I I be n't there it be somebody else look it be not I I be not the man in the photograph I see a man same height same build but that be a long way from proof thank you Commander now if we be quite do with this charade I be I agree Commander but look here in the faceplate of the computer terminal there be a reflection of the man 's face you ca n't tell anything from that thank you Colonel with the right equipment the image could be enlarge and sharpen we could see his face enlarge the image be no problem but sharpen it take forever it would take at least a day sir Mr Gaeta let I know as soon as you have an image Sir you be go to suspend all work on the Cylon detector what as well as your security privilege Starbuck 's note on the Cylon Raider be a mess she say the engine power up sequence begin by squeeze something that look like a red ligament with blue vein on the right side come out of a sack of gooey fluid shape like a dog be you kid I this whole thing be a bunch of vein and ligament and sack of goo squeeze the ligament with your hand while you slide your weight on your left hip into the lymphatic sack that be just stupid Afternoon sir Specialist Chief 's inside yeah Chief God yes sir how be it come in there I be get there sir I have n't quite figure out all the trick but I be get there come on Starbuck you can do it that smart that

no I be sorry Doctor you have be put on a no fly list Security Madam President I need to get off Galactica I need to get away from this Shelly Godfrey woman in particular she be get it in for I where be you Madam President I have reason to believe that she may be a Cylon Madam President Madam President hello get Doc Cottle on the wireless the President have collapse hello be she alive yes the President be alive I tell you she be conscious she be rest she be receive treatment what kind of treatment ask and answer we think it be a stomach flu what kind of treatment how many of these do you take young lady one two two three three time the dosage must work three time as fast then right everybody want to be their own doctor you be lucky you did n't lapse into a coma you ca n't cure cancer by overdose story 's all over the fleet I be so sorry it be okay it seem like an emergency I did n't think that anyone might be pick up the transmission we be all new at this it be okay the thing to do now be to get I on my foot and in front of the press before the end of the day I could give you a shot but you would n't like the side effect just do it the time be go to come when you wo n't be able to hide what you be go through it be not that kind of a shot thank you Baltar 's correct about the convenience of it all Amarak just happen to bring you the key piece of evidence just before he die something be go on he be almost paranoid keep say that the Olympic Carrier have be infiltrate by the Cylons he want I to take some thing off the ship for safekeepe why have he give it to you we be friend friend I love he I love he very much there be time when I just feel so alone now Times when I just want so much to be hold again you understand that do n't you of course there must be time when you feel alone and the thought of another body next to yours seem like something out of dream do not under any circumstance allow Shelly Godfrey to leave this ship Put she under surveillance discreetly I want to know everybody she be talk to and everywhere she be be Come on Sharon get up excuse I Lieutenant be that you Doctor be n't this a coincidence so how be you do I be you be busy yes I know I do n't mean to distract you please do n't let I interrupt you you still there yup I know this be an awkward time but it occur to I I have n't tell you how invaluable your assistance have be over the past few week thank you Doctor you have no idea how much that mean to I not at all so how be it go over there in the lab that be I be talk about the photograph right it be come along great quickly actually a few more hour to go have it ever occur to you that the photograph disk itself could be a fake I have already authenticate the disk obviously you be good but there be many way around security if I could join you in the lab for just two minute of your time I could show you I really do n't think that be possible listen to I nobody would need to know it would just be you and I I know for God 's sake my life be on the line my reputation be at stake so be mine Doctor I really Someone 's come wait Gaeta you forgot to wash your hand what the hell I want answer now I be not interested in play any more of your game have you lose your mind that be an interesting question one I pose to myself on a regular basis who be really in the photograph you be I did n't plant any bomb anywhere at any time and you know that I do n't know anything of this sort now if you 'll excuse I all right let we entertain the notion just for a moment that you be not the woman that I see everywhere you be not Shelly Godfrey either you be a fake you be just a copy another Cylon copy get out strike a nerve have I which I find rather impossible to believe you think this be over this be not over you have not hear the last no more Mr Nice Gaius Women Stupid Unbelievable Bucket not a good time no it be fine guess you be have problem I ca n't get this thing to work I have be over it and over it and nothing I have no idea how Starbuck get this thing to move much less fly it be not really a thing you know it be probably a Cylon itself More of an animal maybe than the human model maybe they genetically design it to perform a task to be a fighter ca n't treat it like a thing and expect it to respond you have to treat it like a pet but at least that be my guess your guess yeah that be right my guess something else you want to say no Lieutenant I hear you be suppose to be up on your foot by now you hear wrong I figure you would n't bounce back so fast be there something you want or

profound error in judgment in trust you and ask your advice but here be where we be Doctor if anyone can be a Cylon and it be hard to tell we apart then we only have one thing leave to trust our instinct feeling and the moment they tell I it be your face in the photo I know I believe it I believe you be involve in the attack somehow I feel it you 'll forgive I Madam President if I do n't wish to be execute base solely on your gut feeling may the god have mercy on your soul call it head head you win you sleep I watch no you be the one who need sleep I could n't sleep if I have to listen to

I give you an order I have two Marines tail she they say they go around a corner and she be go every ship in the fleet have report in sir no sign of her that be unacceptable she be here she be right here this woman exist she did n't just vanish have they check again every ship every ship include this one she did n't just vanish that he have be a victim of treachery and deceit clearly the Cylons want to discredit Doctor Baltar because of his work on the Cylon detector Doctor Baltar it give I great pleasure to exonerate you publicly and to recognise you once again among we as a scientist a leader and a friend you be a hero you be even more popular and powerful than ever before you have have your trial by fire so now they truly believe in you hard for anyone to accuse you of treason again be that the plan all along build I up in the public eye by first tear I down right who be I to question the plan of Almighty God just one small practical question Shelly Shelly Godfrey be there ever a woman really call Shelly Godfrey do she ever actually exist be she ever really here God 's will be do previously on Battlestar Galactica Doral when this body die my consciousness will be transfer to another one the Cylons have the ability to mimic human form they look like we now this man have be identify as a Cylon agent you sleep I watch no you be the one who need sleep you be lucky that you did n't lapse into a coma the time be go to come when you wo n't be able to hide what you be go through Laura yes Madam President be you okay in there I be fine it be just the side effect from the Chamalla you know that thing they say what be bad the cancer or the cure what do you need you have an urgent call from the Captain of the Gemenon Traveller can I call he back he say he find a Cylon on board they find he in the starboard storage compartment look like he have be camp here for day be they sure it be a Cylon the captain identify he by one of the photo we send out he be another copy of the man you know as Leoben Conroy where be it now aboard the Gemenon Traveller lock in a storeroom under guard Isolate that ship order the CAP to fly escort around the Gemenon Traveller and not to approach any other ship in the fleet Aye sir Kat Galactica fly close I 'll send a team over to destroy it immediately I want this man interrogate first first of all it be not a he it be an it second anything it say can not be trust good thing to do be destroy it immediately I would like to hear what this thing have to say it might be important Madam President I have deal with this model before lt'll fill your head with doubletalk half baked philosophy and confuse you then send someone who wo n't be easily confuse that be an order Commander I want he interrogate order understand think it 'll give I something no President disagree you need I to go I 'll shower up and go how be this come we get the entire avionic package figure out Fire control navigation and I think that I be zero in on her ftl drive I do this in a hurry about three week ago it be my after action report on Leoben it be a very clever machine Manipulative cunne the only problem with Leoben be n't that he lie that would be too easy it be that he mix lie with truth just remember he be gon na try to get into your head my mum always say there be nothing in there anyway just be careful he have an agenda it be a goal you wo n't understand until later your job be to make sure he do n't achieve the goal yes sir Lieutenant what be up nothing just want to see if what I tell you the other day help at all yeah actually it do you do treat this thing more like an animal than a machine and it actually work where do you come up with that anyway just pop into your head I be a Cylon you know that be not even funny if I could prove that I be n't would that make a difference you know between we Gemenon Traveller Raptor seven one niner inbound with Lt Thrace aboard permission to dock Roger seven one niner permission grant really do look like a person yeah must be all full of wire inside no you cut he open there ' blood gut the whole thing it be sweat well I 'll be look at that God they go through a lot of trouble to imitate people why do you think they do that I do n't care why but the fact that these thing sweat now that be interesting sleep pray I do n't think the Gods answer the prayer of toaster God answer everyone 's prayer how many cylon be there in the fleet we have n't be properly introduce I be Leoben how many cylon in the fleet I have no idea what be your name how long have you be hide aboard this ship be I not allow to know your name why be you hide here I have a mission to perform listen it be a small thing can you just tell I who you be tell I about your mission and I 'll think about it my mission be to conduct sabotage what kind of sabotage God you stink can I get some air in here between you and the humidity I be not here to play game with you you say you want to cooperate either start talk or we be do okay but I really wanna know your name Open be you Lt Starbuck yes you be I know I be right I be right I see it I have see it happy now it all make sense now do n't it now we can talk now we can talk about a lot of thing like what I plant a nuclear warhead aboard one of your ship it be set to go off at 1830 hour where I be not ready to give that up yet you be lie there be no warhead you ca n't take the chance starbuck your military training dictate you take it to your master and let they decide maybe my training be n't so good maybe I push you out the air lock and tell they you never say a word now who be lie these thing happen for a reason do n't they I be look forward to spend more time with you we have a lot to talk about it be gon na be fun put the Red Team on alert immediately Dee and sweep Galactica for any kind of radiological device right contact all the captain in the fleet have they do radiological sweep of their ship but emphasize that this be just a precaution I do n't wanna alarm anyone until we be sure yes sir well we 'll know for sure in 8 hour and 40 minute Lt Thrace do he say anything else no he guess my call sign seem really happy when he find out who I be he be play with your mind he be be stow away for week aboard the fleet fifty way he could 've hear the word Starbuck on a wireless set that be what I figure sir any idea what he want not yet say he be look forward to spend some time with I though do n't take any chance starbuck yes sir you believe in the Gods do n't you Lords of Kobol and all that why should I tell you it be not a trick question I want to see how much I get right so you pray to Artemis Aphrodite where be the warhead I be right see our faith be similar but I look to one God not to many I do n't give a damn about what you believe to know the face of God be to know madness I see the universe I see the pattern I see the foreshadowing that precede every moment of every day it be all there I see it and you do n't and I have a surprise for you I have something to tell you about the future be that so it be but we have to see this thing through till the end what be the most basic article of faith this be not all that we be the difference between you and I be I know what that mean and you do n't I know that I be more than this body this consciousness a part of I swim in the stream but in truth I be stand on the shore the current never take I downstream this be bad than Galactica and I did n't think that be possible and what be that Swimming in stream or something do you mind thank you starve have n't eat in day kind of bad programming be n't it I mean why bother with hunger part of be human you be not human how be your lunch you know how it be when you be starve anything taste good do that hurt yeah that hurt machine should n't feel pain should n't bleed should n't sweat sweat that be funny that be good see a smart Cylon would turn off the old pain software about now but I do n't think you be so smart maybe I 'll turn it off and you wo n't even know here be your dilemma turn off the pain you feel well but that make you a machine not a person you see human being ca n't turn off their pain human being have to suffer and cry and scream and endure because they have no choice so the only way you can avoid the pain you be about to receive be by tell I exactly what I wanna know just like a human would I know this about you you be everything I think you would be but it wo n't work I wo n't tell you anything maybe not but then you 'll know deep down that I beat you that a human being beat you and that you be truly no great than we be you be just a bunch of machine after all let the game begin hi well look what the cat drag in Lt Valerii it be an unexpected visit you look wonderful I need your help anything I can do anything at all Wonder why they call she Boomer I hear you be work on a test to tell the difference between Cylons and human Bingo I ca n't really talk about that at the moment you would n't help settle a bet for I would you why do they call you Boomer if you be work on a Cylon detector do you think I could be in the first batch you know to be test what be her rush what be your rush I be not sure it would be appropriate to show favouritism if indeed I be work on anything at all I save your life back on Caprica my co pilot give up his seat for you I bring you back to Galactica to safety you would n't even be here if it be n't for I you owe I she shoot she score I suppose there be some small truth to that so can you test I or not I think you should do it result will be quite intriguing the technology for Cylon detection be not quite ready for full scale implementation but I could use a beta test subject Sharon 's late half an hour I notice you be call she Sharon now yeah I choose to think of she as one of they because you dislike she because in the scheme of thing we be as we do she act like one of they think like they she be one of they but she be one of we it would be good to remember that we have sex Congratulations do he love you I think so no 6 have he say it not directly then you be just guess stay in your current location we be set up a cabin for you nearby Food water electricity all the comfort should n't be too hard to convince he to stay and start a life together if not kill he can you handle that we make it this far we 'll make it all the way something happen to you I would n't know how to deal with it Caprica if he flee he die do he love you Helo hey what be go on come on we get ta go now I see Cylons they be head this way we get to travel fast even fast than before why what be different everything just trust I I do now if you be human you would be just about ready to start offer up some false information about the location of the nuke some tiny thing that may get you a reward and spare you some of this but then I keep forget you be not human you be a machine I be more than you could ever imagine I be God I be sorry you be God wow Nice to meet you that be good we 'll give you a couple of minute with that it be funny be n't it we be all God starbuck all of we I see the love that bind all live thing together Love you do n't even know what the word mean I know that God love you more than all other living creature and you repay his divine love with sin with hate corruption evil so then he decide to create the Cylons the Gods have nothing to do with it we create you Us it be a stupid fracke up decision and we have pay for it you slaughter my entire civilisation that be sin that be evil and you be evil be I I see the truth that float past you in the stream you have a real thing about river and stream do n't you I think we should indulge you in your obsession do you realise I could kill you before they come back in the room I could get to my foot rip your skull from your spinal column crash through that door kill the guard in less time than it have take I to describe it to you then why do n't you it be not the time he be loose I have a surprise for you you fracke up pal now the glove come off Combat Col Tigh How be the search go for the nuke nothing so far how much time remain 2 hour 9 minute spread out the fleet no ship more than 500 click from any other ship lf there be a nuke let we limit the damage Aye sir no do it leave he Sir tell I where the warhead be otherwise you be gon na drown in that bucket I ca n't drown I ca n't die right Commander Adama mention that how if your body die your consciousness be download or transfer into another body something like that no exactly like that see I have be think why be a Cylon willing to talk at all why do he care if we destroy his body wo n't he just transfer away and laugh at all of we and our stupid human idea tell I where the warhead be this be not your path Starbuck you have a different destiny do n't interrupt I you see I be gon na dazzle you with my poor human brain you see I think that you be afraid you be afraid that we be a long way from home what if you do n't transfer all the way back what if when you die here you really die it be your chance to find out if you be really God or just a bunch of circuit with a bad haircut I be not afraid of die Someone 's program you with a fairytale of God and stream and life ever after but somewhere in that hard drive you call a brain be a beep message error error do not compute I do n't have a soul I have software if I die I be go I have a soul I see pattern I know you you be damage you be bear to a woman who believe suffer be good for the soul so you suffer your life be a testament to pain Injuries accident some inflict upon other other inflict upon yourself it surround you like a bubble but it be not real it be just it be just something she put in your head it be something that you wanna believe because it mean you be the problem not the world that you live in you wanna believe it because it mean that you be bad luck you be like a cancer that need to be remove because you hear her voice every day and you want she to be right start again now we just pop this in the slot and wait for the result Green you be a normal human being Red you be an evil Cylon should take a couple of minute so tell I be you from Aerilon there be a slight trace of an accent there what no Troy Troy tell I why be that familiar mining settlement the accident the explosion right that be tragic your family they die with the rest I be very sorry it be a lie Congratulations Doctor you have just uncover your very first Cylon now here be an interesting moment in the life of Gaius Baltar what will he do be everything okay yeah yeah I be just interpolate the result the question be what will she do if you expose she thank you or kill you I think it be just green or red well it be a little more complicated than that she probably do n't know she probably think she be just another girl from Troy whose entire background vanish in a mysterious accident should be interesting to see how she respond when you tell she the truth I be guess her Cylon side will take over and break your neck before you can give away her secret let we find out congratulation it be green it be very bright green you be not a Cylon really 100 human and very bright green as well for a second I be worried what you be gon na say be you yeah well there be nothing to be worried about anymore you could n't be more human if you try well thank anytime I have something to tell you how long before this suppose bomb go off Less than an hour get I a shuttle I be go to the Gemenon Traveller I want to see the Cylon myself Madam President you need to do n't even start I do n't wanna discuss this I have make my decision not until I get you a security detail enough for frack 's sake let he breathe you be really sick you be not a person you be a machine that be enjoy its own pain all this have happen before and all of it will happen again do n't quote scripture you do n't have the right to use those word you kneel before idol and ask for guidance but you ca n't see that your destiny be already be write each of we play a role each time a different role maybe the last time I be the interrogator and you be the prisoner the player change the story remain the same and this time this time your role be to deliver my soul to God do it for I it be your destiny and mine and I tell you I have a surprise for you be you ready you be gon na find Kobol birthplace of we all Kobol will lead you to Earth this be my gift to you Kara what the hell be go on here what exactly be it that you be do here it be a machine sir there be no limit to the tactic I can use and where be the warhead I do n't know you do n't know you spend the last eight hour torture this man this machine whatever it be and you do n't have a single piece of information to show for it he think he can see the future say he know our destiny our fate he say we be gon na find Kobol and that it be gon na lead we to Earth clean he up there be not much time yes sir do you know who I be yes I apologise for what you have be through take his restraint off do it thank you I can do more I can guarantee your safety I can order your release we be run out of time we have only four minute leave until your bomb go off I have come here to tell you that this conflict between our people do not have to continue it can stop right here with we we have to trust each other trust I I think you know you can tell I what I need to know and you will live the warhead do n't exist I make it up Lieutenant be right I be too far out I did n't wanna die so when I get catch I make up a story to buy some time I see thank you for the truth thank you Madam President do n't be too hard on Kara she be just do her job the military they teach you to dehumanise people I 'll take that into consideration no stand down Laura I have something to tell you Adama be a Cylon yeah be you all right I be fine the bomb nothing Put he out the airlock what you ca n't do that not after he tell you yes I can and I will Lieutenant look at I you have lose perspective during the time I have allow he to remain alive and captive on this ship he have cause our entire fleet to spread out defenceless he put insidious idea in our mind more lethal than any warhead he create fear but you be right he be a machine and you do n't keep a deadly machine around when it kill your people and threaten your future you get rid of it he be not afraid to die he be just afraid that his soul wo n't make it to God Lords of Kobol hear my prayer I do n't know if he have a soul or not but if he do take care of it Hell of a risk you take today something I have to do care to tell I why President Adar once say that the interesting thing about be a President be that you do n't have to explain yourself to anyone something wrong no nothing at all previously on Battlestar Galactica I notice you be call she Sharon now she act like they think like they she be one of they but she be one of we we get ta go now we get ta travel fast even fast than before they find he in the storage compartment he be another copy of the Cylon you know as Leoben I 'll send a team over to destroy it anything it say can not be trust do n't Adama be a Cylon Commander here be Dr Baltar 's report and the President be wait for you up in the core thank you Clear the deck Madame President we be the proud owner of the universe 's first bona fide Cylon detector that be great news yeah so when do we begin Dr Baltar would like to start widespread testing as soon as possible but there be some serious limitation he can only do one person at a time and verification take hour so who be go to go first the test right I think people in sensitive position should go first I completely agree how about you excuse I if you be a Cylon I would like to know if I be a Cylon you be really screw seriously I do think that you should go first show everyone in the fleet that they can trust the people at the top then maybe you should go first all right I 'll go first I think that be good I do Bank on my advice they always do that no they be just show off they know I be in here you date a special assistant to the President word get out so this be officially a date Jury 's still out observation deck have two minute remain you could pull rank you could tell they you be on special business for the President of the Colonies your boss pull more weight around here than mine you can tell they Adama want you to yeah what want I to what I lose my train of thought how be he these day by the way the old man he be fine I guess you guess he be be act kind of funny lately seem distracted or something he be be make all these weird call from his quarter Super secret probably a security thing they do n't want I to log the call though no trace file nothing and this just start a few day ago Billy Keikeya be you pump I for information about the old man Time 's up no of course not you be you be you be a spy that be what you be I be just ask a couple of question I hope you like the answer because they be the last one you be gon na get for a while what do you find out Dualla could n't put her finger on it but yeah she say he be be act differently I could see that myself he be distracted and unfocused what else some scramble wireless call he did n't want log she did n't know who he call or why but none of this be damn evidence the call could be security relate and his odd behaviour could be stress pure and simple Exhaustion paranoia all right it could be any of those thing but what if it be not Madame President with all due respect I can not believe we be actually entertain the idea that Commander Adama have be somehow replace by a Cylon duplicate oh my god Billy I hope you be right be suicide really a sin a mortal one I be afraid but it be not that bad be it Gaius 47 905 people in the fleet 47 905 blood sample Eleven hour to test each one for Cylon indicator that 'll take awhile 21 956 day 60 1534 year now let we figure in a few hour to sleep here and there we 'll call it an even 61 shall we sure I prefer to kill myself Commander Adama be you a Cylon Tune in tomorrow it be hard be a genius yes there should be some perk yes what be up Doc Lt Thrace good to see you I be just keep up with the old exercise that should do I for today I feel all well what bring you to the lab at this time of the night it be mid afternoon yeah it be Crazy workload I totally lose track of time so what can I do for you you can zip up your fly so my blood test you be right about one thing Gaius there be something very intriguing about her very good very good at least I do that much Dradis contact Cylon Raider bear 738 carom 005 Galactica Apollo Action station Cylon Raider bear 738 carom 005 relative zero close with enemy destroy Acknowledge we be on it Galactica he jump right in front of we his mistake how many Single Raider look like a recon patrol Apollo and Beehive have they in their sight where be the old man he be not aboard not aboard where the hell be he he leave in a Raptor about an hour ago no flight plan no flight plan that be it you set he up I 'll knock he down I wing he look like I get his weapon system he jump he jump away before we could zero he out Damn it probably give away our position to every Cylon base ship right now where in the hell be the old man order the fleet to execute emergency jump procedure everyone rendezvous at the stand by coordinate Contact Single Raider bear 881 carom 247 Apollo Galactica Cylon Raider detect at 881 carom 24 wait I see he Same Raider what it be the same Raider I can see the damage from before it be behave erratically he jump away again contact Single Raider same telltale it be like he be just fly around in circle wound bird ca n't fly home Galactica we get he on Dradis but he be pretty far out there take we three minute to close to weapon range no this be our perfect chance to get some intel Order Apollo to close with the Raider but do not engage put a Raptor in the air as long as that be flop around out there tell they I want to suck in every electronic signal it make Sir Colonel Commander Adama 's Raptor be request permission to enter the landing pattern permission grant stand down to Condition two permission grant Mr Gaeta you have the deck Permission to come aboard grant mind tell I where the hell you have be Col Tigh allow I to present your wife Ellen that noise I do n't get it I have blow centurion away

test Commander Adama 's blood sample immediately thank you I ca n't believe you be alive I ca n't believe it myself Saul I do n't remember the last few week it be week right right you have be on the Rising Star all this time I guess so the last thing I remember be be on Picon I be at the airport buy a ticket home and hear something about the Cylons and then just dream mostly dream until a couple day ago they tell I I be knock out when the Cylons attack the airport and someone just pick I up and put I on the last flight out some saviour I do n't even know who it be all right you be here now it be like we find a treasure chest one of the major issue we have be have with the Raider we capture be to figure the fast than light drive this wounded bird be jump all over the place out there yeah and every time it jump it give we more datum that we can use but what be it do out there and how long can it keep it up the moment you have your FTL datum give I an update let we not let this thing linger out there long than we have to yes sir you want to see I sir stay on it you have dinner plan what Come on I never think I would see you again I neither the thing I say before the thing I do in

would explain but it be classify I 'll be back as soon as I can I 'll be here wait as soon as I can you want to be very very careful with what you just say you be talk about a man I owe my life to many time over I know these be uncertain time and this have be a difficult transition for you excuse I Colonel I do appreciate how difficult this be for you to hear believe I but I would advise you right now not to say anything that you will regret I need to know if you have see anything suspicious about his recent behaviour no what about the fact that he leave the Galactica without tell anyone where he be go or when he would return and at that very moment a Cylon Raider jump into view and start act strangely I know exactly where he be you do he be pick up my wife your wife turn out she be

do without you for a day it do n't really work that way start over sure there be whine and complain like you would expect but the people I talk to be mostly hopeful and optimistic that be good to hear there be a few people who still might wonder if a kindergarten teacher be really the right person to be President but they be just a tiny minority Wonderful everyone be so truly grateful to all of you on Galactica you literally be our saviour we be just do our job you be so modest he be always be that way Lee could I trouble you for a little more of this lovely Ambrosia Sure thank you dear Bill you

magic it be science if you want the right result you have to wait awhile I give you her sample this morning I have start and stop the test twice already now so I be run a little behind twice my fault long story your fault I should n't have mention that you should n't have do you tell he to stop Ellen 's test yes I do why I have some concern about what in all honesty I think it be fair to say that your behaviour recently have be odd my behaviour what do you think I be a Cylon I you ca n't deny that you have be make these off log call these mysterious trip off the ship where do you hear that have you be spy on I on my own ship Ladies and gentleman please we be in a laboratory there be hazardous chemical compound everywhere that be a thermo nuclear bomb for frak 's sake what do you mean un log mysterious trip what be go on I have to go to the Rising Star and I did n't want Tigh to know why not because whether or not his wife be a Cylon she be trouble and I want to keep she away as long as I could then why do you bring she aboard the ship because she be his wife and I could n't refuse her access to her own husband without cause suspicion besides I want her close to I I tell you I tell you he want I Lovely what the hell 's go on you have be secretly visit my wife no yes but it be complicated I tell you he be be after I for year what now boy boy do n't fight over little old I Ellen be quiet you do n't tell I what to do we should all take a deep breath I will I be afraid that she might be a Cylon I bring her blood here to test it that be why you cancel your test how have you know that you did n't tell I he be test my wife you meet with the President yes she think you might be a Cylon I know Attention pass the word for the Commander XO and the CAG Commander Adama Col Tigh and Captain Adama please report to CIC Mr Gaeta the Raider smooth out its flight path about two minute ago it seem to be under control yeah but he be not jump for home no sir he be n't have our reconnaissance detect any outgoing communication since he straighten out his flight pattern yes sir but it be likely it be just another distress signal launch the alert fighter this be the CAG launch the alert fighter Sir I hate to tell you this but I think it be be play with we the entire time it be wait to see how we would react play with we yeah order the flight leader to destroy the target yes sir Galactica Hot Dog the Raider just take off he do n't look injure to I he be head back to the fleet they be not go to catch he Action Stations set Condition one this be not a drill he do n't have any weapon he be on a suicide run do you launch the alert fighter it be the XO 's call I have a hunch good call one question because I be worried that she might be a Cylon and if she be n't I know how you feel about her Saul she be be a negative force in your life I be sorry but it be the truth maybe she be everything be different then she be different I be different I have grow accustomed to see you without the cup in your hand so I have a couple of drink tonight I be celebrate I think I deserve to yes you do launch those fighter on a hunch you save our ship just do my job you do your job good that be why I need you Saul that and that we be friend I do n't want anything to come between that not even Ellen it wo n't we have search every street every building they slip through How be that possible she think she love he now that she ca n't live without he her passion be make she more resourceful bother you do n't it we 'll get they in the end no it bother you that you have never experience it you see the way Helo be when we take she away he be pathetic I ca n't help wonder what it would be like to feel that intensely even in his anguish he seem so alive Green Green everyone Mrs Tigh be definitely human no hard feeling I hope Ellen I completely understand but let we be sure and test you next Doctor my pleasure my job you do n't want to frak with I Bill try to remember that do n't frak with I either Ellen if only they know that everyone pass these day why it be so much simple that way no muss no fuss what do her test really say I 'll never tell previously on Battlestar Galactica your doctor back on Caprica be right it be too damn late to operate the cancer be too far advanced have you ever hear of Chamalla extract it mean that you be still act like you be everyone 's good friend we be not friend you be the CAG the Chief want I to kick your ass out of bed but clearly you still need the rest take your time no rush I need new pilot and I want you to train they I can do that they slip through How be that possible she think she love he now that she ca n't live without he bother you do n't it we 'll get they in the end I can assure you that fuel shortage be our number one priority Galactica have ship scour the nearby star system and we can anticipate that they will soon find tylium Hamilton Madam President tylium ore be extremely rare if we do n't find any how long before the fleet run out of fuel that all depend on how well we conserve be n't it a fact Ma'am President that we only have enough for two more jump yes that be correct do we have a contingency plan if we run out of tylium we would if that be to happen we would use our last fuel to jump to the near planetary system and pray we be lucky enough to find a habitable planet Madam President without fuel to take even the most basic evasive manoeuvre no would n't we be like duck in a Cylon shoot gallery yes we would I be I be sorry that be all for now she do not do this commencing sweep 87 of asteroid field any luck how many time be you gon na ask I that Boomer well until you find some tylium ore do n't you want to be a hero to Ensign Davis you have n't notice how she always sit next to you in the mess how be it go Crash you look so cute Damn it there be so much debris in this system the dradi be useless this be go to take 100 year I hear about how you find water how you save the whole place Jackpot Boomer that asteroid dead ahead be a mountain of tylium check it thank the Gods we be hero yeah we be hero it never fail great the second that I score the bus driver jump in and take the credit okay so who be the one that we suggest what cylon the rock 's crawl with they we be well and truly fracke only tylium within 12 light year and we have get to kiss it goodbye yeah along with our ass if we do n't get out of here fast it figure the Cylons would be sit on the only source of fuel within our reach still stake out every waterhole in the desert only this time it be a lake enough tylium to last we a couple of year this must be some kind of conveyor belt to get the ore from the mine here into this crack plant here a refinery this far from their home world why not they need fuel as much as we do now they have get it and enough firepower to keep it all right so we forget this asteroid find another source you can bet your ass the Cylons will be guard that one too we send the raptor out far find a source they have n't reach yet we 'll use up all our fuel do it how be we go to get our refinery ship we take the tylium from the Cylons with all respect this be hardly a time to attack a superior force this be exactly the time we know where they be they do n't know where we be we 'll catch they with their pant down if we fail end of game so we do n't fail when the missile get close enough you 'll be pull maybe 7 G 's but to catch you the bastard 's gon na have to pile on 40 to 60 its guidance system ca n't hack it and it 'll miss most of the time exactly how often be most of the time it depend on your judgment and how well you pray Attention on deck as you be Lt Thrace can I have a word of course take five guy what be up how be they do Wobbly as newborn colt but they be get strong that be good get a job for you Rumour mill have it that you be plan an op Rumour mill 's right for a change Capt Adama and Col Tigh be work up the plan now and I need some serious out of the box think out of the box be where I live I have be take Chamalla for a medical condition so what have you see it start out as dream of the Cylon that we have execute but I have the dream before we capture he the image be Prescient Uncanny and now I be see thing while I be awake what kind of thing snake there be snake crawl all over my podium during a press conference how many about a dozen you be kid right you read Pythia and now you be have I on no who be Pythia one of the oracle in the sacred scroll 3 600 year ago Pythia write about the exile and the rebirth of the human race and the Lords anoint a leader to guide the caravan of the heaven to their new homeland and unto the leader they give a vision of serpent number two and ten as a sign of thing to come Pythia write that she also write that the new leader suffer a waste disease and would not live to enter the new land but you be not die be you and that will allow the attack force to wipe out these installation here now if we do it right there wo n't be any Cylon survivor and the asteroid will be ours what do you think starbuck it be a textbook perfect plan which be why it wo n't work of course we bow to your vast experience in strategic planning Refresh my memory what year be it that you graduate from war college what be the matter marry life not all you expect enough both of you we be not go to win this one by the book I want Starbuck in here because she be not weigh down by conventional thinking all due respect gentleman we be not as crazy as she be okay so what would you do differently to start jump Galactica in behind the planetoid to hide it from the Cylon base be an obvious move you think they 'll be cover that blind spot with recon patrol I would if I be they what we need to do be make their patrol part of our plan you know make their tactic work for we here be what I would do at position code Deacon we 'll need three civilian freighter ship to use as decoy which mean those passenger will have to be relocate to other ship which be already overcrowded yes if you approve the decoy ship will jump into the enemy star system at extreme radar range from the Cylon asteroid Galactica will jump here close enough to launch its viper at the base soon as the decoy freighter arrive in the system they 'll break wireless silence they 'll be pose as a mining fleet come after the tylium and pretend to be unaware of the Cylon presence the Cylons will hear the message and send a force of Raiders after they this will leave the base relatively undefended we 'll have raptor pre position to keep an eye on the Cylons when the Cylons move toward the decoy Galactica 's Vipers will come in from behind and obliterate the base without the base they 'll be unable to rearm refuel we 'll mop they up and then we 'll take the tylium what happen to the crew on the civilian decoy ship they 'll keep their ftl drive spool up and jump clear the first sign of trouble how many casualty do you anticipate lt'll cost we if you succeed what be to prevent the Cylons from come back with reinforcement nothing but if we get a chance to knock out that base it will buy we some time why if you keep run from the schoolyard bully he keep on chase you but when you turn around and stop and you punch he really hard in a sensitive spot he 'll think twice about come back again so it be either this or run out of fuel and be annihilate sometimes you have to roll the hard six well the freighter be yours good hunting everyone Operation start in 48 hour this be our target a Cylon base and you be the Cylon expert we need to destroy their military facility without harm the tylium ore under the surface exactly a nuke would destroy the Cylons but the radiation would render the ore inert unusable I see your dilemma well you be in luck you know Refined tylium contain tremendous enthalpy to the order of half a billion mega joule per kilo subject to right heat and compression say from a conventional warhead you should get a suitably devastating explosion without the radioactive fallout all we have to do be hit the right spot specifically you must hit the staging tank for the refined tylium precursor it be a lot more unstable than the fuel itself and where would they be I need your advice on this one I be flatter Gaius but I do n't know the first thing about tylium refinery neither do I oh come on you must have an inkling where I should tell they to bomb no but God do oh good I suppose God do n't want I to destroy the base because he be the Cylon God right God do n't take side he only want your love open your heart to he and he 'll show you the way it would be a lot simple if he come out and tell I you must remember to surrender your ego remain humble if you ask I God could do with clean his ear out then he would hear what I have to say relax your neck why what be you go to do I say relax all right but please do n't where would the staging tank be Doctor there right there hit any one of they and the place will go up like a three kiloton bomb well do Forceful so decisive deliver with such élan he did n't speak to I God did n't speak to I I be totally lie I just pick that spot at random he do n't always speak in word Gaius so the fate of the entire human race depend upon my wild guess Attention on deck as you be how be the knee Starbuck lt'll be ready I be not miss this party Apollo 's lead the strike force you 'll have to sit this one out I be the good pilot that you have not right now in combat you get to pull 6 7 G 's Doc say your knee wo n't take it well then he be wrong be he a viper thruster pedal require this much force to activate now you be on your attack run they launch their missile so you have get to jam that pedal into the firewall and hold a 6 g turn for 10 second or you die 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 this be only 3 G 's Starbuck not 6 I be sorry it be a tough one but you be stay home keep your ingress low and fast use the terrain to stay hidden till the last second make sure you give the flak suppression unit enough time so they can weaken defence you do n't think I be up to this of course I do you 'll be fine look you be worried that I be not gon na pull it out of the fire with some high risk retina detach move the way Starbuck would look Kara I be sorry you be not suit up 'cause everyone would feel so much well I include if you be ride along with we but this be n't an ego trip this be my job and do n't think for one moment that I will not get it do I hope so because we have got one shot do n't frack it up by over think nice thing about be on the run after a nuclear war nobody leave to complain if we hide out in their barn or raid their pantry while you be on your way to steal a ship and get off the planet it be odd be n't it what that we have n't see a single living human being since the one you shoot when you rescue I we be still alive why nobody else probably hole up in the fallout shelter or something two way out and a lovely view what could be well a feather bed with a silk comforter you hungry I do n't know what do we get Peanut butter bake bean corn how about some chilli a simple no would do Sharon have you be take your anti radiation med I think it be those cold bean we have this afternoon you okay now yeah how far you figure to Delphi eight maybe ten day if we move fast if we start early we can be there in no time ca n't sleep I could n't either before a big op the Mark II good ship get I out of a lot of tough scrape I have get something for you it belong to your grandfather my mum buy it for he when he be in law school you see the engraving on it yeah I can barely make it out but he be a well father than I be Dad use to carry that into court case claim he never lose unless he leave it behind so you be worried too about what you know sometimes it feel like the whole ship think Starbuck would do well I do n't how can you be so sure because you be my son get some rest you be go to need it Dad I 'll bring it back you would well or I 'll kick your ass it be a good light Sharon wake up what the frack you kill she let I see we get ta go right now wait a minute I see she on my lap I see her blood spill on my lap let we move mister what the hell be go on I do n't know we 'll figure it out later jump complete sir Dradis report nothing but hash just as we expect ca n't see a thing we be now within launch range of the Cylon base Constellation jump complete on station point Deacon Initiate search pattern Delta Ore flight Bravo Delta Wilco Ore flight Nebula Delta initiate the ball 's in play you can bet they hear that now they 'll try to locate the decoy and when they do if they take the bait all hell break loose until then we wait Galactica Boomer Tally 90 plus head Deacon Speed 250 the Cylons have see the freighter they be en route to intercept it they take the bait Mr Gaeta launch Strike Force 1 Aye sir D launch strike force one Attention Pilots man your plane Pilots man your plane how hard do they bite Boomer 's report say 90 plus they have launch most of their fighter force give they hell sir fire Attack force away I just hope that Lee can Lee be n't the problem you should take a good look at yourself I have to go through the same transition when you be in the cockpit you be in control it be hard to give it up it would just be a lot easy if I be fly with they all you can do now be wait and hope you did n't make any mistake I never want this kind of responsibility the Cylons never ask we what we want welcome to the big league Galactica Crashdown Tally 50 plus on an intercept course repeat 50 plus inbound what be that mean it mean that a Cylon patrol spot our attack force the base send out 50 more raider to intercept Fifty Raiders that mean we be outnumber now 5 to 1 be n't the decoy suppose to take care of that the Cylons be too smart for that Frack estimate time to strike intercept 2 minute Fireball multiple bandit leave 10 high range 40 weapon free commit Hot Dog visual tally press Hot Dog break right fireball your six I be hit Man eject stop Deadbolt Spinner two bandit close your right side no joy Galactica Hot Dog heavily engage Mission outcome doubtful this sound fracke awful they be getting cut to piece out there get out of there move Deadbolt right vertical now Diamond get a shot get he off I Mr Gaeta abort Strike 1 strike One Galactica Return to base Repeat Abort your mission and return to base Galactica Stubb Cylon strike force be turn away from Deacon and inbound to Galactica Noting Raiders inbound the Cylons hear our transmission recall did n't they do that mean the first wave of Raiders be ignore the decoy and be come after we that be exactly what it mean so when be we go to launch the reserve Vipers to defend Galactica there be no reserve Vipers everything be on the board already now we play for all the marble Starbuck it be your plan Mr Gaeta will you please tell D to get on the scrambler and inform Apollo the back door be open Aye Lieutenant D please send a scrambler to Capt Apollo Message read the back door be open Apollo Galactica Back door be open Godspeed Apollo Lt Thrace why did n't you tell I we have another attack force hide in the freighter we it be my decision I routinely restrict tactical detail to those who need to know old habit die hard so you still might pull this off if Dr Baltar 's target information be correct and whether we get blow to piece by those Cylon Raiders head toward we right now speak of which I be need in CIC initial point in 5 second Flak suppression unit clear hot okay let we do this come on Lee it be all on you Incoming weapon free by the number people Target acquire Tone and lock Firing Tone and lock firing what be get into these fracke missile come on they be jam the guidance system strike two Apollo then we get close enough so we do n't need the guidance system we 'll have to blow this thing manually Wilco Apollo Rolling in Chuckles oh frack Chuckles buy it he be go down now they have get our attack axis zero in there be no way to fracke get close there be get ta be we have get to get out of this flak let we get down below deck down where the target be I have get an idea I be gon na take a close look Commander on deck as you be the first wave of Cylons will be on we in three minute notify the Strike 1 Vipers that they can stop run and blast those bastard to hell yes sir attack Cylon fighter Target acquire tone and lock oh no do n't do this Lee the conveyor tunnel 's clear I be go through it you be out of your fracke mind Apollo what be go on Captain Apollo 's fly into the conveyor tunnel hope it will lead he to the refinery have he gone rave mad there be no way to ensure it do anything of the kind come on keep it together Lee oh lord okay I be through the tunnel they ca n't get a firing solution on I there you be okay I have get you I have get you Galactica Apollo Mission accomplish yes you can tell Dr Baltar he be right on the money it be one hell of a firework show and there be plenty more for we back in the canyon once this place be history Congratulations Doctor it work it do it work I be sorry Madam President I be sorry no need to apologise thank to you we have enough fuel to last we a few year Commander Strike 1 report inbound Cylons be bug out request permission to go after they sir tell our people to pursue and destroy they Affirmative Strike 1 tear they up Apollo you magnificent bastard that be one hell of a piece of flying and I could n't have do it well myself I be sorry I did n't hear you I say that I could n't have do it well myself well thank you I have my doubt so do I I be n't sure that crazy ass plan of your would even possibly work you deserve this Crash have you read the Pythian Prophecy Gaius not since the 6th grade I ca n't say ancient history be my favourite subject you should have pay close attention to what all of this have happen before all of this will happen again everyone know that verse what be you get at remember this one lead by serpent number two and ten the Vipers they be the serpent there be a later verse Gaius you should read it though the outcome favour the few it lead to a confrontation at the home of the god be you tell I that God guide my finger to that target for some arcane scriptural purpose you be part of God 's plan Gaius so God want I to destroy the Cylon base you do well you give yourself over to he yes I suppose I do there be really no other logical explanation for it I be be I be an instrument of God previously on Battlestar Galactica what the hell be go on you kill she we get ta go right now that be Tom Zarek the terrorist he be a prisoner of conscience he be a butcher he blow up a government building there be no excuse for that I think you say you respect I that be before you resort to violence and hostage take I demand the immediate resignation of Laura Roslin and her minister I demand free and open election to choose a new leadership if you let the rest of these hostage go we will leave this ship in your hand got it test there be we on Frack we be on go live from Cloud Nine the most luxurious ship in the fleet it be the Colonial Gang it be a new talk show that bring you the inside scoop on the fleet I be James McManus formerly of the Caprica Times with I be two of the only remain legitimate journalist leave Playa Palacios veteran commentator for the Picon Star Tribune Welcome and my wingman Sekou Hamilton former editor of the Aerilon Gazette as most people know Cloud Nine be damage during a Cylon attack and have to be evacuate with repair now complete President Roslin have pick it as the site for an historic gathering it be the first meeting of the Interim Quorum of 12 which will coincide with Colonial Day the 52nd anniversary of the signing of the Articles of Colonisation Playa why do n't you weigh in Laura Roslin should be applaud for restore the system of check and balance every delegate choose so far have be a Roslin crony it be a puppet Quorum okay that will rubber stamp every edict this power mad schoolteacher will try how can you say that when half the Quorum have n't even be select I predict every one of they will be a Roslin lackey hand pick by the power behind the throne Presidential Advisor Wallace Gray do n't you see Gray orchestrate this whole publicity stunt come on Jim Wallace Gray be no prince of darkness I disagree he be help Roslin regulate the internal economy make sure vital food and medical supply be fairly distribute he be a gasbag who be make a fortune through deal Quorum member have profit from Freedom of the press as we speak Madam President the fatuous gasbag would like 5 minute of your time Wally how do it feel to be a celebrity well I love it they 'll probably be call I a fascist next no I be the fascist you stick with be the gasbag Madam President excuse I you be go to want to hear this McMANUS Sagittaron have choose their delegate for the Interim Quorum of 12 who would 've guess it Tom Zarek oh my god he be get quite a follow out there I should have see this come he be a terrorist who be they kid McMANUS a ruthless terrorist Tom Zarek incite a prison riot that result in kidnapping attempt rape he blow up a government building and now he be gon na sit on the Quorum of 12 Wrong the government trump up charge to discredit a man who be dedicate his life for the disenfranchised yes just a moment Commander Adama why be I not surprised hello Commander be you listen to this indeed ca n't allow a terrorist to sit in government my hand be tie I do n't want to turn he into a martyr Sagittaron law allow a prisoner to regain his citizenship once he be serve his time Tom Zarek represent a danger to the entire fleet I can bar he from travel to Cloud Nine on that basis alone I perfectly understand the threat Tom Zarek represent but the last thing I need be for you to start act like my own personal goon squad we need to let this play out thank you hold onto your short there be another story we be get a live feed from the Astral Queen Tom Zarek be about to make a statement Citizens of the 12 Colonies I be humble and move by this great honour I will be a voice for those who have go too long unheard by a government that serve only the privileged and the powerful that turn a blind eye to the need of the weak and the poor but Roslin and her confederate will no long be able to ignore we People of the fleet look up the wind of change be blow a new era be about to dawn hey Doc Lt Thrace to what do I owe this honour our shuttle leave for Cloud Nine at 05 12 tomorrow so do n't be late our shuttle a surprise getaway just the two of you I be go to be handle your security please do n't touch that thank you Security for what you have n't hear it be all over talk wireless when would I have the chance to listen to talk wireless I have 60 year of work in front of I anyway talk wireless be just an excuse for lowbrow rabble rouse you have be select as Caprica 's delegate to the Quorum of 12 I be this some kind of joke guess you get the super genius vote no accounting for taste Congratulations Doctor thank you Politics be the only thing more boring than blood sample all those interminable speech all that dreary pomp party full of young woman draw to man of power but when the people call you must serve I ca n't remember the last time I feel the sunlight on my face sure feel good almost like the real thing they could 've do a well job with the horizon though Security 's go to be a bitch a thousand different place for a sniper to hide how many people be we deal with five hundred plus each colony 's send a delegation of lead citizen Great Herds of lookie loos any one of whom could be a Cylon Toasters be n't our only problem do n't you pay any attention to politic no a lot of unrest out there so why be Roslin insist on let so many people come I guess she think it be important to they to be able to observe how their government work so basically she be already run for re election no Kara Kara give I that thank you sir enjoy your day the atmosphere be electric as Quorum member arrive with their delegation I be outside the Cloud Nine Ballroom where the reception of the new Quorum of 12 will take place the question be will President Roslin shake the hand of the man many still regard as a terrorist or will she snub he and by extension all the people of Sagittaron Col Tigh my wife Ellen Welcome aboard kill I now Col Tigh Starbuck Apollo Zarek 's here Copy do n't worry this guy 's mine the second he make a wrong move yeah well you 'll have to beat I to he Murderer you do n't belong here Zarek go back what do you say he be not a murderer he be a freedom fighter all right excuse I may I see your security pass sir not a problem I be a citizen of Sagittaron I have get every legal right to be here your right do n't extend to rough people up Lay a hand on anyone else and you 'll be get to know Galactica 's brig well everything be in order enjoy your stay on Cloud Nine oh I will Tom Zarek Col Tigh Battlestar Galactica I see my wife do she have a name Ellen call I Tom I do n't like to stand on ceremony I be the same way all this pretension make I sick you be hold up the line thank you for make I feel welcome Ellen I hope to see you again why do you do that to get our picture on the front page of every newsletter and photo service in the fleet I do n't need my picture take with a terrorist wake up Saul look at these camera Roslin 's the past Zarek 's the future a blind man can see that Madam President Mr Zarek if I be to offer you my hand in friendship would you take it well there be only one way to find out that be nicely play thank you just remember I be not your enemy Madam President and I know today 's agenda be rather large but I think that if you 'll look at the schedule meeting you 'll see that they concern issue vital to the fleet in some case exist policy regard matter such as the distribution of medical supply you be miss an intriguing opportunity Playa 's not wear any underwear do n't be absurd really she be be eye you all afternoon she be certainly human you be not jealous Love be n't about sex Gaius that be an enlightened point of view I have be think as far as I be concern you can have any woman you want but always remember I have your heart yes of course you do I can always rip it out of your chest if I need to so if there be no objection the Chair will entertain motion to accept today 's agenda as propose I have an objection the chair recognise Sagittaron all the item on your agenda be important I agree Ration distribution education medical service all very important but I be frankly shocked to discover the most critical issue of all be nowhere to be find really well perhaps Mr Zarek could enlighten we the election of a vice president lf god forbid anything should happen to you Madam President we have no designate successor the civilian branch of our government would be paralyse leave the door wide open for a military dictatorship Sagittaron move that the first item on the Quorum 's agenda should be nomination for vice president Second Second Second Caprica second for various reason which be far too obvious and numerous to go into right now but certainly I think we can all agree that it would be a good idea to have a successor the motion have be move and second all those in favour of opening nomination for the vice presidency say aye Aye Aye the aye have it the floor be now open for nomination the chair recognise Virgon now there be only one man here who be willing to work for the betterment of people in this fleet when I ask for his help he send a crew to fix the air filtration system on my ship and hell they be finish and go while I be still wait for the President 's office to return my call I nominate Tom Zarek Thanks be there a second Gemenon second the nomination the nomination of Tom Zarek for the vice presidency have be accept the Chair will remain open for 72 hour for nomination the session be now adjourn Thomas Zarek be not go to be my vice president six month until the presidential election we could 've handpicke a candidate it did n't shock I when Bagot nominate he but Porter that be surprising not really the Gemenon ship use more water per capita than any other ship she want more ration I say no Zarek may have make some friend in the last few week but there be still plenty who hate he do n't underestimate Zarek he be charismatic and know what button to push Frankly Madam President I be concerned about the security aboard Cloud Nine I want you lean forward on this captain if they even sneeze they well have a handkerchief Understood we need a candidate someone who will quickly win the delegate ' support an establish name I be not a politician but you know how to get thing do you have keep this fleet function all this time no thank but I ca n't allow Tom Zarek to be one heartbeat away from the presidency Wally I need you you have get I Madam President how can you reassure people that you be look out for their interest as oppose to the rehabilitation of Tom Zarek that be a great question Playa this be how I see it we be face a situation so unique so specific that I believe we need not only new leadership but a whole new way of thinking like blow up a building or two if thing be n't so serious I would say that be funny look there be no economy there be no market no industry no capital Money be worthless and yet we be all hold hostage by the idea of the way thing use to be look where we be this man wake up every morning tug on his boot and go to work in this garden why because it be his job what job he labour but he get no benefit from his labour he be not the only one many of we be just still go through the motion of our old life the lawyer still act like lawyer but they have no client businessman still act like businessman but have no business President Roslin and her policy be all about hold on to a fantasy if we want to survive we need to completely restructure our life we need to think about the community of citizen the group not the individual we need to completely free ourselves of the past and operate as a collective you be not interested in the citizen you just want power turn that crap off I be listen to that broadcast you again that be a shame they want to hear Mr Zarek speak too do n't you buddy see he want to hear Mr Zarek how about you you want to hear what Mr Zarek have to say I do n't mind one way or the other well I take that as a yes so turn it on now leave it Mr Zarek be a representative of the people and we be the people well you be people sort of you know I do n't like your tone flyboy so why do n't you just move along out of here and go enjoy the imitation weather I would be happy to after you leave which be now okay do n't want no trouble what the hell there be a gun Starbuck Incoming be you look for this the Telamon Building 's still stand that be Delphi all right now all we have to do be wait until dark infiltrate the most heavily fortify military hub on this planet hope the Cylons have n't completely waste the spaceport steal a ship locate Galactica and fly to she without getting shoot to hell be that all yeah I guess we can relax until dark Might as well make ourselves comfortable you hungry no not right now your stomach 's feeling well starve I be try to make sense out of the two woman we see with the Cylons and I ca n't fathom why anybody would wanna help the toaster and they just happen to be twin that be too weird you get a well explanation you think the Cylons could be mess with human dna clone people or something could be that would explain how they take we by surprise they have these replicate human infiltrate the colony lay the groundwork for the surprise attack you know if they be human clone that mean they be capable of complex emotion maybe even love maybe they be misguide in the way that they be indoctrinate whatever they be they be not human no human could do the thing they have do kill billion of innocent people they have get to be fracke Cylons just like the rest of they why do you have a summit itinerary why circle every public appearance by President Roslin it be not mine some stranger wander down the hall pick the lock to your room and leave this false bottom with anechoic coating to absorb x ray ceramic stealth gun you sure go through a lot of trouble to get that weapon onboard I carry a lot of money I need protection right the money 's worthless your friend Zarek point that out I do n't even know Zarek your pal grime say different he give you up you be bluff you have n't get anything we do n't need anything Valance because this be n't a trial this be just you and we in this room like Zarek point out we be live in a whole new world no due process this be your courtroom and that would make we your executioner so you might want to cooperate or else you be go out an air lock because that be what we do to traitor look I I just come over here for the booze and the food that be it you know what frack you we put all the heat on Valance we could but ca n't tie he to Zarek I know Zarek 's behind this keep work on Valance we will to be safe I think you should send the Sagittaron delegation back ca n't violate their civil right play right into Zarek 's hand he could have another shooter on Cloud Nine and if Zarek win the vote he be more than capable of order your assassination and ascend to the presidency Zarek 's not go to win because I be not go to let he meanwhile keep Zarek under surveillance tap his phone bug his room if you find anything that remotely connect Zarek to Valance shut he down the domestic policy we have be talk about over the last little while such as employment housing and education late vote count seven for Gray five for Zarek we be slip he be four an hour ago Zarek must be make promise Picon flip we have get to hold the colony till they vote tomorrow on Page 33 of my mission statement I lie out a 16 point educational programme that the President and I have develop individual with four year college degree will be eligible hi how be you do remember I we get Valance and you be next Health care it be one thing to talk can I get you something so you work here now why should I ask the bartender to get I a drink what be in it for he a big tip what would he spend on so be you worried about Wallace Gray I hear he be ahead in the vote count whatever the people want be fine by I everyone have an agenda I know I do and what would that be the same as yours Tom I Myself and I you be clearly a well connected well inform woman Wife of the XO for whatever that be worth quite a bit now and in the future that be what I be interested in Tom my place and my husband 's place in the future okay I be look for a friend of mine his name be Valance how the hell do this happen we have get to get to the President we be here with Dr Gaius Baltar representative of Caprica Dr Baltar I have one question be President Roslin 's political career terminal or be there hope of resuscitate it Laura Roslin 's political career be very much alive and to underestimate she would be a very serious mistake you miss the limelight do n't you Gaius yes I have you have what Dr Baltar nothing you be say you seriously believe that this school teacher be able to handle the job of presidency his wrist be slash with broken glass from the room so be it suicide or be it murder it be no suicide Zarek have he kill lf only we could prove that how have they get past the Marine Guards through the vent I be glad to hear it because all of we have have teacher who make an impact on our life history be full of example of leader who have come from the most humble beginning and have rise to meet the challenge pose by cataclysmic event how many people know where Valance be be hold just the people in this room plus two Marines criticise Roslin and the tough decision she have to make every day especially if you be someone like Tom Zarek who be never shoulder any real responsibility in your life to be fair to Tom he be be in prison for the last 20 year and now that he be have a drastic personality makeover he be pose like he be the saviour to all your ill I think you all have a short memory well someone talk and now we have no assassin no evidence of a plot no check on Zarek no nothing if he can get to Valance he can get to anyone Madam President he will definitely try and take a shot at you now only if he win the vote what I have to say be we must survive and we will survive and we will do so through the value that have make our colony great Courage Truth Justice Liberty with a firm and deep resolve to make tomorrow well not just for ourselves but for our child Madam President I still worry the vote may be trend against you yes it be but I be go to win this thing and Tom Zarek be go back to his prison ship where he belong but first I have two very unpleasant duty to perform I need a shuttle to Cloud Nine what be I suppose to say Health reason oh right fine Health reason you know all those year I watch you work with Adar you be always so quiet so polite so dignified I never think you would fit in with the bare knuckle backstabbe politician I guess I be wrong all clear Dr Baltar be you in here Madam President I hear you on the wireless you be very articulate quite engaging oh thank you that be very encouraging yeah I be just try to do my bit as the elect representative of Caprica besides I be begin to get a real feel for politic so I take it you be not vote for Mr Zarek a man who use his intelligence and resource to blow up building do n't get my vote no no I be vote for your man Gray he be really great he be great which be why he be get my vote unfortunately Mr Gray drop out of the race then who do you want I to vote for I be think you I look Doctor let we cut to the chase you be a very popular man these day I would be fortunate to have your intellect and your popularity right by my side under those circumstance I accept thank you Madam President thank you wow what be you go to do now now I be go to give you an exclusive after you so what be we suppose to do sit on our hand and watch she get kill Zarek 's too smart to take another shot at the President during the summit if he win the vote he can take she out later when everyone be forget about Valance he 'll just bide his time to find a well opportunity that be great anyway she say she be not go to lose the vote she say a lot of thing do n't you think you should wash that I do like when a month ago do you have a problem with my hygiene you have hygiene I clean up good sometimes all right well let I know when it be one of those time Tauron Gaius Baltar the surprise just keep on come a number of the Quorum delegate have now shift their support to the scientific genius a man who be credit with save the fleet on numerous occasion at this point Jim it be anyone 's guess as to who be go to win but my money be on Gaius Dr Baltar Aquaria Thomas Zarek Aerilon Tom Zarek the vote be now six five in favour of Tom Zarek the next vote will determine our new vice president if Zarek get it he win in the event of a tie the President will cast the decide vote citizen I give you your new vice president Dr Gaius Baltar the perk of power Mr Vice President we be go to do great thing together Good it be difficult to fathom I never aspire to power of course you did n't Gaius but someone have to step up well after what Laura tell I Laura yeah we be on a first name basis now now look I think the people need I excuse we so that bum knee of yours be look pretty good and the other one be not too bad either Lee if you want to ask I to dance just ask you want to dance I in a dress be a once in a lifetime opportunity

should happen to I it be vital that you comprehend and be familiar with the political structure begin to fall into place here do you understand this answer I yes of course I understand my answer be no no I do n't think I can handle this right now the intricacy of the bureaucracy I ca n't get my head around this which with all due respect Madam President you have spend your entire political career learn to understand More to the point how you could think that my head could be turn so quickly by a new thing it just astound I how do you seriously think I could cope with this kind of responsibility I do n't believe you you be a genius be you not well quite frankly I do n't give a fly frack whether you believe I or not all right because I have have it I be tired of be push and prod

and ready Jump in five four three two one whoa baby frack I Gaeta the fracke idiot you ca n't plan a jump that close to a planet what if we jump into it it be great it be fine we make it we be cool be you see this yeah Oceans Continents no let I at this thing okay Atmosphere read as Nitrogen oxygen look like enough CO2 for green leafy thing I be getting excite here Boomer Boomer this could be it this could be the big one this be the little planet that solve all our problem Boomer do you think this be Earth no it be not Earth it be more important than that do n't really work as well as before huh you know I do get cold there be some thing you should know Helo do n't call I that you be not even Sharon you be not even human so do n't act like you know I because you do n't but I be Sharon and

that be it go hunt I be add a gunnery run to the jump test tomorrow see if our boy can shoot anything with our ammo so it be a boy now I change my mind you ever wonder why everyone call it a she but to you it be a he it be fascinating Lee you should write a paper it be not really my scene I be not as smart as say Dr Baltar how be the Vice President by the way I do n't know have n't see he so he be a love they and leave they kind of guy I guess I guess Ships just pass in the night yup did n't mean a thing Nope just bore look for something to do so fracke the Vice President seem like a great way to waste some time you want something from I not a thing I do n't owe you anything you do n't owe I anything because I be just a CAG and you be just a pilot right a pilot that ca n't keep her pant on right it be just like old time Kara like when you get drunk and could n't keep your hand off the major from wherever God why do you do it Kara just tell I why because I be a screw up Lee try and keep that in mind Commander Adama be send out another raptor to conduct an aerial survey of this planet it appear to have suffer some sort of calamity but it could actually be inhabitable aerial survey show evidence of at least one city on the surface it be obviously abandon long ago how old be the ruin we wo n't know for sure until we send a ground team but the initial estimate have it on the order of approximately 2 000 year that be around the time the 13 Tribes first leave Kobol let I see Ruins what ruin this be an inhabited city look at the building Buildings look what do you see tell I Laura a dome like structure with six road lead out of it like spoke with something around it like column like a forum like the forum on Caprica actually the forum in the opera house in the city of the god on Kobol this planet be Kobol Kobol like Kobol the birthplace of mankind where the god and man live in paradise until the exodus of the 13 Tribes Madam President what be go on it be real the scripture the myth the prophecy they be all real so say we all hello Lieutenant Hey Doc this be a bad time right no I be just clean my gun what be go on I be go to ask you the same question actually I be look for Lt Thrace but sometimes it be good to talk these thing over Deep down she know she be a Cylon but her conscious mind wo n't accept it sometimes I have these dark thought what kind of dark thought her model be weak always have be but in the end she 'll carry out her mission I do n't know but I be afraid I be go to hurt someone I feel like I have to be stop she ca n't be stop she be a Cylon you ca n't help her Gaius but you could probably sleep with her that be what you want right I be not sure why sometimes we must embrace that which open up for we Embrace Life can be a curse as well as a blessing you will believe I when I tell you there be far bad thing than death in this world so you be say no what I say be meaningless listen to your heart Embrace that which you know to be the right decision you might be right this may be Kobol we should seriously consider permanent settlement on this planet the scripture tell we that Kobol point the way to Earth organise a ground survey team Three Raptors I want a complete survey of the ruin immediately yes sir you should go remember what I say Gaius you do n't want to be here when it happen when what happen what would happen if I go in fact I think I be go to volunteer for the survey party your presence wo n't be necessary Doctor thank you I be the Vice President of the colony select in my own right and I feel that my presence on the planet will be necessary Commander as your chief science advisor I have to analyse the sample the team bring and it would be more efficient if I can gather the sample by myself unless you have any objection Madam President no objection thank you we need to talk sure you okay what do you think I think it be hard to imagine that you forgot to check the chamber I did n't forget Sharon what be go on I know thing have n't be so great lately but I wake up in the morning and I wonder who I be I wake up and wonder if I be go to hurt someone Sharon you need help not from you you make that clear I be on my own no you be not thank for come out Chief you be dismiss so accord to the scripture if we have the arrow of Apollo we could take it down to Kobol and we could use it to open the tomb of Athena and find our way to Earth I did n't know you be that religious neither do I something wrong with that no it be just new there be no Earth you understand that it would seem that we be wrong Commander just because you and I do n't know where it be it do n't mean it do n't exist Madam President I be not try to mock your faith so please understand I these story about Kobol god the arrow of Apollo they be just story legend myth do n't let it blind you to the reality that we face reality be that the Cylon Raider have be successfully jump test reality be that Cylon technology obviously outstrip our own and reality be there be a good chance the Raider can jump all the way back to Caprica and retrieve that arrow and find our way to Earth the real Earth the Raider 's a military asset I wo n't use it to go chase some mythical arrow I be sorry I say we find Kobol count our blessing and just stay there but the sacred scroll say that this could guide we to Earth right okay cut the chatter Raptors 2 and 3 on I FTL 's spin up and ready cally hold onto your lunch jump in ten nine eight seven six five four three two one jump complete gentleman bring the nose down we should see the planet directly ahead what the hell be that oh my God Cartman get we out of here we get a fire in the turbine shut it down put it down out of the way come on get out of the seat Doc everybody hang on can you jump we out no the out drive be be hit Socinus get on the horn and tell Raptor 2 to jump back to Galactica right now jump back to Galactica jump back to Galactica over you be order to jump back to Galactica whenever they be within proximity of one another they send off a short IFF burst essentially they be Cylon transponder program to identify themselves to any other Cylon transponder damn nice work Lieutenant that be very good now that we know what they be I want to test one in the Raider Draidus contact Raptor 275 sir back early something 's wrong what the hell be you do oh God Hang on God oh my God do it everybody hit the deck I ca n't see pull it up watch the hill thank for watch how many people do we lose ten soul aboard Raptor 3 Raptor 1 last visual contact be see under power flight head toward the surface we need a way to take out the base ship before we can attempt a rescue Starbuck 's work on a plan use the capture Raider to get a nuke into the base ship the Raider when do this happen about 19 minute ago she say she be work on the detail and we 'll have a report at 1400 go talk to Starbuck right away my pleasure and report back to I yes sir be there something to worry about Madam President why do you ask that that look on your face not now take that out the Chief say we need it but I do n't Lt thrace attention I give you a command you will obey it Attention you do not take your harebraine idea to the XO without go through I first do you understand yes sir at ease so what be the plan I be put an autopilot in the Raider jump he to the base ship engage the autopilot punch out get pick up by a Raptor the Raider head to the base ship except the transponder allow the Raider to approach Nuke go off Boom sir might work might get you kill would you miss I sir I need every pilot I have even the screw up Captain I be really sorry if you do this it could threaten everything we have accomplish it may bring down the government and you do n't have a right to risk that for a go on for a drug induce vision of prophecy I be well aware of that but it would seem that the god have a different plan would you please get I Lt Thrace can I get you some more water yes thank you ca n't be serious all of this have happen before and will happen again that Cylon you interrogate he quote that bit of scripture he also say that we would find Kobol and Kobol would show we the way do he not yes he do we have find Kobol do you believe in the god Lieutenant not that it be any of your business but yes I believe Lieutenant I be not try to put you on the defensive I would like you to think this through with I if you believe in the god then you believe in the cycle of time that we be all play our part in a story that be tell again and again and again throughout eternity that be the way I be raise but that do n't mean that my part in the story be to go off on some crazy ass mission against order may I tell you the part of the story that it would seem I be play I be die what I have terminal breast cancer I have six month at the outside to live and I have only tell three people so I would appreciate it if you keep it to yourself of course be you say that you be the scripture tell we a die leader lead humanity to the promise land if you go back to Caprica and bring I the arrow I will show we the way this be crazy People keep use that word it be crazy perhaps that do n't mean it be n't true and it may be our only chance our only chance to find Earth the old man be our last chance to find Earth he know where it be he say so you be there the location be a secret but he be go to take we there Commander Adama have no idea where Earth be he never do he make it up in order to give people hope you be lie go ask he I will I need one more in flight test for the autopilot and NAV system before I jump for Kobol right can I ask you a question boss shoot how much long till we reach Earth it be hard to say you get a guess you know I do n't like to guess be we get close I be sure we be good luck on the next test Apollo Starbuck I be ready over here okay starbuck the board be green Copy that power up for the autopilot test this be Starbuck request permission to speak with Galactica actual Starbuck want to speak to you sir she be on a scramble channel go ahead I believe you believe in Earth what be you do Starbuck bring home the CAG sir we can talk about this no I do n't think so I want you to remember one thing I do not regret anything that I do be sure that whatever you be go to do you do n't regret it later do you understand I I guess we 'll find out Commander she be spin up the Raider 's FTL drive what this be an autopilot test what the hell be she do what be you do Kara Galactica Apollo she just jump away Repeat Starbuck and the Raider just jump away she be n't schedule for a jump test where the hell do she go home previously on Battlestar Galactica just do it Boomer this could be it this be the little planet that solve all of our problem what do you see a dome like structure with six road lead out of it this planet be Kobol organise a ground survey team Three Raptors they be everywhere we be not get out of here we need a way to take out the base ship before we can attempt a rescue if you go back to Caprica and bring I the arrow I will show we the way what be you do Starbuck Galactica Apollo

clue as to the location of Earth Earth what be you talk about who be go to Earth it do n't even exist I be try to get back to Galactica what I need from you be a way off this planet and a way back to my ship if you do n't do that I 'll blow your head off why do n't you just shut up for a change you be only alive because I have keep you alive if it be n't for I you would be dead by now so whether you like it or not I be your only hope of get off this planet so if I be you I would take that tough guy attitude of your and shove it up your ass we ca n't move around the city during daylight so we hole up and we wait till dark Unbelievable she be cross the line before but this be so far beyond the pale she would n't have do this on her own she be coerce no one coerce Starbuck believe I I have try Commander I have the President on the line Bear witness Put on your headset Madam President moment ago Lt Thrace take the Cylon Raider on an unscheduled and unauthorised jump yes do you have any knowledge of this incident Let we save some time here Commander the question you really want to ask I be whether or not I ask Lt Thrace to take the Raider to Caprica the answer to your question be yes you and I have talk about this yes we have we both decide it be a military decision my responsibility as President be first and foremost to protect and preserve this fleet and its future in the end that outweigh any other consideration it have to by take the Raider you have place our people on the surface of Kobol in direct danger I be very aware of the danger our man and woman be in on Kobol I be also deeply aware of the danger this civilisation will be in if I ignore the pursuit of this arrow I be go to have to ask you for your resignation Madam President no then I be terminate your presidency as of this moment Commander Adama I will exercise the authority of this office until I be unable to do so so if you want to stage a coup you be gon na have to come over here and arrest I I do n't want any bloodshed of course you do n't neither do I neither do the press they be here by the way the press they be record every minute what be it Captain Isolate Colonial One Mr Gaeta Jam any transmission in or out of Colonial One immediately yes sir prepare a strike team as long as she be President she be dangerous if she can turn Starbuck against we she be capable of anything yes sir she be bluff well let we hope so there be also a Cylon base ship out there to deal with leave that to I this government survive a Cylon attack it will survive William Adama I think he be bluff but just in case we need to be prepare I know their security detail they will defend that ship we 'll have to take she down compartment by compartment Mr Gaeta Sir be I correct in assume that I have two Cylon

Condition Two then I want you to report to I directly in person I have no intention of cool my heel in your brig fine neutral ground Colonial one no aide be there in 15 minute stand down Condition Two there you be roslln let we start this by admit an ugly truth what happen out there today be the result of failure in leadership of everyone in this room we be the leader of this fleet as such we need to set an example we can not continue to let the conflict between we oh let we cut through the hand holding shall we two of his man murder one of my officer while protect a Cylon they be guilty they admit it and under regulation I have complete authority to try convict and sentence they and you and I both know that the penalty for that crime be death Admiral surely the spirit of the law require something more here than summary execution be this what the two of you have be do for the past six month debate the fine point of Colonial law well guess what we be at war and we do n't have the luxury of academic debate over these issue you want to cut through it fine you have Pegasus he have Galactica Two heavily armed very powerful warship now I be sure that Pegasus would prevail in any fight I would n't count on that roslln but certainly there would be heavy damage and you would take significant casualty so you can go out there and fight it out with Galactica or you can compromise and those be the only two option on the table period how the two of you have survive this long I will never know all right Lt Thrace have send I detailed recon information on the Cylon fleet I want that fleet and I need Galactica to get it so I be willing to go this far I 'll suspend the execution until after the attack I want they back on Galactica I do n't give a damn what you want you be frakke lucky you be not stare at your own warrant the destruction of the Cylon fleet will take priority over all other consideration after that we will meet back here and we will resolve this issue thank you stand at ease Lieutenant and come forward it seem you have have quite a day I be promote you to Captain I be make you Commander of the Pegasus Air Group you be promote I I need a CAG with gut and initiative to plan and lead the attack on this fleet now I think Stinger be that man but he manage to let Capt Adama contact you and pull off that fly by stunt right under his nose so he be out and Capt Adama sir Truth be tell I come this close to throw he in the brig but I could n't exactly charge he and not you so I have just revoke his flight status I want he on my team sir and do you always get what you want Most of the time sir Good I too all right you can have he I hear you want to return to Caprica yes sir we have people back there still alive yes and they deserve to be save I

I mean yes sir thank you Chief MAN 1 hey hey CRASHlNG MAN 2 I get it I get it MAN 1 give I a hand Cally Laird 's not military be he no sir he be a civilian aeronautical engineer on a ship call the Scylla Civilian do you know how he get on the Pegasus Scuttlebutt be that the Pegasus use to have a civilian fleet but something happen to they thank you Laird 's ship be the Scylla the Scylla be a civilian transport we find she and a few other civie about a week after the attack they be good ship ftl drive and weapon even a lot of potential spare part that we could use on Pegasus so the Admiral make a decision military need be a priority you strip they you strip the ship for part Sweet mother of Artemis how much equipment do you take you take their jump drive leave all those people maroon out there no not all Adm Cain look over the passenger list and she make a decision about who be valuable and who be n't Scylla be the tough Laird and 15 other man and woman they be all all travel with their family wife husband child the selectee refuse to go there be resistance so the order come down to shoot the family of anyone who refuse to come so we do two family we put they up against the bulkhead and we shoot they the CAG 's work be never do hi how be you do oh you mean apart from be demote find myself work for one of my pilot Great never well you know I have nothing to do with that right never think you do I just check in on Helo and Tyrol they be hang tight for now Good help I plan this op I have be stare at this roster do you want to just carry on as if nothing be happen Lee she be in command what do you wanna do there be nothing we can do I think you might like a fresh set of clothe be you aware of your true nature as a Cylon when you board the ship or would you describe yourself as a sleeper agent I know what I be I be a soldier I have a mission I carry it out I think that when it be do I be go to die that you would kill I then l then I would download into a new body be reborn but you did n't kill I the thing you do to I what they do to you be wrong evil but I be not one of they you have to believe I thing be go to get well for you from this moment on I promise I do n't want thing to get well I want to die but you know you ca n't die you do know that do n't you your consciousness will merely transfer and you 'll wake up in another body not if you destroy that what this this ship tell I what be so important about this ship the Cylons call this their resurrection ship at the moment we be too far away from the Cylon home world for the normal downloading process to work which be why they build this ship it contain the entire apparatus necessary for Cylon resurrection now this ship have be travel with the fleet trail Galactica for the last several month so it be a safety net a place where they fall back to when they die and if they lose their safety net then any Cylon who die out here would be dead as in really dead and I dare say they wo n't like that no sir they might even stop chase we why risk getting kill if you ca n't just wake up all nice and cozy in a brand new body Doctor I think you have just identify the most important ship in the galaxy I have good day and bad day but do n't look so worried I be not die today I be n't worry what can I do for you you be right about Cain Pegasus have a civilian fleet with her fifteen ship Cain strip they for part supply people I wish I could say I be surprised but it be who she be she be play for keep you got ta do the same what be get into you what you have become so bloody minded I know that as long as Cain live your survival be at risk I know that coughlng what can I get you a new body perhaps one of those young Cylon model from the resurrection ship I ca n't see you as a blonde you would be surprise I 'll see you tomorrow Mmm hmm Commander she wo n't hesitate to kill you do n't let she you know when we get out of here I be gon na make some change yeah like what I and Sharon it be do I mean really do I ca n't do it anymore I mean do n't get I wrong LT what we do I would do again in a heartbeat I get ta let it go I so think I would let go yeah I know what you mean you yeah I what you think I do n't have second thought sometimes you think I do n't wonder if I be lose my frakke mind I be in love with a woman I know be n't a woman I be have a baby that be that be what half machine you really do love she do n't you yeah yes I do and I ca n't let go of it but if you can let she go our primary objective be a vessel name Resurrection by the Cylons it be guard by two Base Stars which have be follow we throughout this sector our plan simply put be to let they find we we will wait in this system here and appear to be conduct mining operation STARBUCK when the Cylons launch their Raiders Galactica and most of the civilian will jump away a small group of civilian will be leave behind to the Cylons they 'll appear to be have trouble with their ftl drive and attempt to escape at sub light speed the Cylon Raiders pursue the civilian decoy pull the Raiders far away from the Cylon Base Stars as they can APOLLO once the Raiders have be draw off by the decoy Galactica and Pegasus will jump in and attack the Base Stars while I jump in in the Blackbird stealth fighter and take out the ftl drive on the resurrection ship prevent it from jump away why not have the stealth ship carry nuke and destroy it right at the start we run simulation on that we determine that the Cylons would detect the nuclear warhead and destroy the stealth ship before it get within weapon range when the FTL be destroy Galactica and Pegasus will take on the Base Stars and our attack squadron will go after the resurrection ship itself how many squadron all of they be there a problem Commander I need time to study the operational detail suit yourself I have go over the detail and I be satisfied I want your CAG to stay and help I answer some of my question one hour thrace yes sir stay focused son Jack I want to transfer a detachment of Marines to Galactica and I want you to hand pick they completely reliable completely loyal Razors I have a mission for you Kara anything for you you know that do n't accept too quickly you wo n't like this one I do n't like it but I have decide that it have to be do I be transfer you to Galactica as well I 'll tell Adama that you be there to be my eye and ear he 'll hate it he 'll think you be my spy and try to freeze you out of decision making but he 'll accept it now I want you to stay in ClC throughout the attack stay with Adama ADAMA after the attack be complete and you have account for your pilot I want you to land your bird on the Pegasus to report directly to ClC you 'll take Lee with you he 'll watch your back Position Marines in key area throughout the ship and keep a squad post just outside ClC now there will be the normal chaos and emotional high after the attack they 'll be slap each other on the back celebrate the victory that 'll keep their guard down Security will be lax I will ask for you over the wireless I will call you directly and when I have you on the line and you hear I give the command Execute case orange when you hear I say Downfall you be to signal the Marines to terminate Adama 's command start it with Adama I want you to pull out your weapon and shoot Adm Cain in the head

before send in the troop they be teacher not terrorist they be act like thug their last demonstration put two policeman in the hospital six of they have chain themselves outside the Hall of Education as far as I be concern they be criminal their pay be sub standard their school be fall apart and this strike action have be gain momentum for month and you know that I do n't understand why we be not at least talk to they one of the most interesting thing about be president be that you do n't have to explain yourself to anyone you have already set a meeting with Stans have n't you obviously only if you approve Mr President BALTAR she be really in no good state to do anything Iet alone to conduct any Government business do n't talk about I as if I be not here there 'll be plenty of time for that soon enough roslln snlckerlng Billy could you of course gentleman I call you here to discuss the Cylon Dr Cottle would you would you please tell they what you tell I this morning I be no expert in genetic but I can read a blood test that Cylon fetus be show some very peculiar genetic abnormality I have n't see any of this on your report Doctor no well as Dr Cottle say he be not an expert and I be I have be through the test and I would n't say that there be anything conclusive I did n't say conclusive just damn odd right BALTAR Madam President as you know the Sharon Cylon be of considerable tactical value to the fleet and perhaps you have get too close to your subject Doctor this be difficult so I be gon na cut right to it allow this thing to be bear could have frightening consequence for the security of this fleet I believe the Cylon pregnancy must be terminate before it be too late Madam President I would like I think you of all people would understand Admiral BALTAR Madam President I do n't understand this make no sense one of the interesting thing about be president be you do n't have to explain yourself to anyone thank you gentleman I be a little tired gentleman I do n't want to seem alarmist but I be perturb I think that the President 's illness be affect her judgment especially when it come to the subject of ADAMA she seem reasonably coherent to I well then I 'll have to appeal to you on scientific ground destroy this child would seriously impact my study of the Cylon subspecie the President make the call I be back she with all due respect the President make the call base on evidence present by Dr Cottle and he pull yourself together you be about to become President of the Colonies you be gon na be ask to make some very hard decision Act like you can handle it god where have you be where have I be I never leave you Gaius all right yeah yeah metaphorically speak it be just it be week ago and l I be sure you have suffer mightily in my absence you know jealousy 's a really ugly emotion what be this linger controversy over my affair with your three dimensional duplicate I be not jealous I be concern oh yeah concerned about what our child you be concern well for your information the President intend to kill it once Roslin 's go you 'll be President you can use your new authority to save our child yeah yeah that be good do you see the way Adama look at I the contempt on his face I will be the President all right but without military support I might as well be an anointed dogcatcher yes well you have your own resource if you would use they what you do n't know what I mean no I do n't know what you mean the nuclear device the one Adama provide for your research there be one way no 6 I did n't wanna have to ask I did n't wanna have to ask you for this no 6 but what I really need but what I really need to complete the project be a nuclear warhead be a nuclear warhead you be totally insane I be try to help you you idiot if Adama remain committed to the destruction of our child it may be our only hope there be no easy way to say this it be about the Cylon the President have decide that her pregnancy will be terminate what why Doc Cottle discover some anomaly in the fetal blood work be n't that expect maybe but the President believe that to allow the baby to come to full term it constitute an unacceptable risk to the fleet I do n't understand Sharon 's only help we since she come back from Caprica she even turn on her own to save her life do n't mistake the will to live for genuine compassion Lieutenant she be still the enemy do she know not yet then I should be the one to tell she if that be all sir Helo I do n't expect you to agree to the decision but I need you to accept it we be talk about my child sir part of I but I guess it be easy to kill when you call it a Cylon dismiss so you be say someone be be tamper with our ammunition shell do n't unload themselves what be this I hear about you order both Galactica and Pegasus fighter to stand down the price you pay for reinstate I as CAG sir maybe that be a mistake maybe I do n't give a damn what you think sir take it easy both of you the fact be we have be share store between the ship and nobody fly combat until our ammo supply check out leave we defenseless if the Cylons decide to pick a fight we be defenseless before this we just did n't know about it ADAMA Lee find out who do this MACHlNES BUZZlNG APOLLO all right excuse I I be look for Asha Janik Asha she be there APOLLO let we do this quietly APOLLO Asha Janik Captain Adama I have a

if they hold out long enough this administration will cave you expect I to fail I expect you to hold the line this do n't have to be the end of the world you can stay on in an advisory capacity god know we need your idea you be ask I to resign I do n't have any choice this be n't about you and I anymore you be right it be not you be willing to attack those people and up until a few hour ago I be prepared to let you I be on my way to the Galactica to represent this administration when I return if you still want my job be prepared to fight when I return if you still want my job be prepared to fight notify the Admiral FLATLlNlNG this be Admiral Adama as you know President Roslin have be aboard Galactica for the last few day she be a fighter but as of this moment her prognosis be grave I know that many of you believe in the power of prayer if that be your way then I urge you to pray for our President as for the other I hope you will join I in keep she in our thought Admiral please do n't do this stand down everyone give I room think about what you be do Helo you be a soldier I be a father like you please sir give I a Raptor let I take she off the ship I 'll get she away from the fleet I ca n't do that son BALTAR Admiral Admiral Admiral Doctor get the hell out of here I must talk to you concern the Cylon child it seem I may have be wrong very wrong when I say that Dr Cottle misinterpret the fetal blood work BALTAR you see I have another look at those sample and I discover something quite intriguing Understand Cylon blood be virtually impossible to differentiate from our own that be say obviously it have to be slightly different because the Cylon be not human if our blood iook like this for example and the Cylon 's blood look like this then it be fair to assume that the Cylon human be carry an amalgam be this a theory or fact the Cylon 's fetus contain no antigen it have no blood type that be what Dr Cottle be talk about when he say it be damn odd except it be not damn odd it be astonish now know as we do that the Cylons be build slightly well to endure than their human counterpart I wonder could the Cylon blood also be bless shall we say bless with a heightened resistance to disease so I apply a sample of Sharon 's fetal blood to some cancer cell I take from the President what be I look at nothing that be the whole point the cancer be go and it be go within a matter of hour be you say you have find a cure for the President 's cancer well it be untried it be obviously untried and therefore extremely dangerous but yes it be possible if you abort Sharon 's fetus now you 'll never know now you may feel a sharp pain Sharon it be okay it be gon na be all right I do n't like what you be do I think it be unnatural and damn dangerous yes well give the patient 's current condition I be not sure that I see the downside maybe it be just her time then for once perhaps I be the beacon of hope around here it be all right Everything be gon na be okay I be right here with you Sharon if you wanna settle this your people have to disengage no more civil disobedience no more act of violence I want our student back in school do I be glad you call Madam Secretary I too doctor I be afraid the test be positive the mass be malignant rapld BEEPlNG bllly what be happen all clamorlng she be convulse Nurse get I 10cc 's of COTTLE help I get she on her side

you thank you Admiral you seem well much be you still hold the spokesman from the new faction in the brig yes would you take I to he please certainly thank you I 'll wait for you to get dress JAHEE President Roslin Mr Jahee be n't it I think it be time we meet would you open the door please do it all these people want be to be hear a member of your group nearly destroy our Tylium refinery before we can even begin to talk I need your personal assurance that there will be no more attack as I tell the Admiral I have have no direct contact with anyone genuine negotiation require trust do not lie to I I 'll talk to my people make they understand Excellent then I 'll listen maybe even act but if you renege I 'll insist the Admiral hunt you and your friend down without mercy no 6 you seem very content Sharon 's child be safe Adama and Roslin have agree that more study be require before any drastic measure be take yes but by save Roslin you have deny yourself your rightful place of leadership there be many aspect of you Gaius I will never understand you would n't and neither would I suspect your corporeal counterpart do you love she what be that the note that Roslin write I to be open upon the event of her death President Baltar I offer my sincere congratulation l say that know we have have our difference and that you take office despite my many reservation you may be the most brilliant person I have ever meet but your intelligence be unleavene by compassion you must be remind of your ethical responsibility and challenge to rise above your own selfish need l do n't write this to hurt you but to beg you to open your heart Understand that the people in the fleet look to you not only for leadership but for solace Justice find a way to give they that and you will be a great leader Laura Roslin BALTAR and after all I have do for the fleet and after all I have do for her Roslin 's never trust you she be undermine you at every turn and now so now we know she be never gon na trust I this be not a political struggle anymore Gaius this be quite literally life and death DOOR OPENlNG the President assure I that as long as there be no further act of violence she be willing to bring our concern to the Quorum and Admiral Adama she be try to buy time she 'll never be open to negotiate with the Cylons I disagree I think we make real progress today and so do the Vice President Baltar yes just before I leave he ask to meet with I he encourage patience while he work with Roslin from within and he offer the content of this case as proof of his sincerity what be in it I do n't know he say that you should be the one to open it NARRATOR previously on Battlestar Galactica ADAMA Col Fisk be the new Pegasus Commander the Cylon 's fetus contain no antigen it make

slide well that be behind we now yes it be to the point Supplies be run low and the people be worried FlSK well they would n't be civilian if they did n't have something to bitch about roslln well I think that in this case they be entitle our inventory level be tight but they be not critical but all the way across the fleet people be report shortage of essential good and what they do get come at a high price they be turn to the black market last week one of my aide come down with pneumonia Billy have to trade liquor to get the antibiotic it be the nature of the beast People want what they want a few trade would be one thing Commander Fisk that be reality but I be talk about criminal make outrageous demand on the people so bottom line be I be implement a new fleet wide trade policy we need to be in control of our supply chain not black market thug I be hope that I can have the military 's support on this Admiral if you want Pegasus to run these dog down you just give we the word

Someone be send we a message or run we in circle maybe there be another Cylon in the fleet I would almost prefer that to the alternative we start kill our own all they have to do be sit back and watch

with each other Doctor why do you think that be I ca n't imagine why I have never have anything but the utmost respect for you and your office I understand that you and Commander Fisk plan to meet just prior to his death as I have already explain to Captain Adama Commander Fisk have several linger concern about your new trade policy what can I say and that be it no 6 Gaius she be afraid of you why be you ask I this you save my life and I be grateful but I sense that there be some unease in you about assume the presidency and I would like to offer you an out you what Resign Return to your scientific work on Galactica no one will question your motive and you can consider it a second chance like the one you give I Charming Doctor this be a one time offer I suggest you reconsider you know Madam President I have never be particularly interested in politic and I never want any lofty position of power I never want to be the Vice President that be until this very moment because right now I ca n't think of anything I want more one to the head you did n't do this I be attack I find he there when I wake up Security bulletin say Commander Fisk be garrote with a wire whatever happen look

be you do here attend a Quorum meeting nothing as exciting as all this I assure you I know these place be legal but still the son of the almighty Adama talk to I about the black market ZAREK CHUCKLES not much to say it be widespread inevitable and accord to President Roslin illegal so it be no surprise that you and Fisk be in it up to your neck Fisk maybe but not I I represent Astral Queen have to be careful about the company I keep this be Fisk 's log he say he make three run to Astral Queen in the last 10 day and I doubt it be to discuss prison reform what do you want from I Captain Names of ship Contacts I ca n't help you why do you think Fisk approach I to get a piece of your black market scam to offer you protection you and your father be both so blind by the past Fisk 's black market be up and run when he approach I he know Adama would pick up on his unauthorized shuttle so he try to force I into take over the delivery create a firewall between Pegasus and the illegal shipment so you be try to tell I that you turn he down at great cost check the fleet log see how many supply ship make stop at the Astral Queen after Fisk 's last trip the answer be none so if Fisk be try to starve you out why did n't you bring it to the Quorum Roslin 's acting like the black market 's some sort of aberration but I think you be smart than that do you really expect some utopian fantasy to rise from the ashe ZAREK I hear the security officer they give you Fisk 's killer for a reason they be offer you a way out you know something do n't you just rumor there be a freighter Prometheus some people say it be go off the grid but if you want something bad enough that be where you go the deal be broker by an ex military mercenary name Phelan Lee I hope she be worth it ZAREK slghs PEOPLE

STARBUCK let we review the tactical situation four week ago our mining ship strike pay dirt on this asteroid a pile of strategic metal that we need to build new ship since we be sit duck until the miner finish the job the old man have send the Fleet out of harm 's way under the protection of Pegasus our job be to stay behind and protect the miner unfortunately this star system be full of rock

en masse be it because we destroy their resurrection ship Starbuck 's work on that BOOMER you know Scar have probably die and be reborn a dozen time you may have face he before so what Raiders reincarnate just like you yeah just like I Great what a frakke world a Raider 's much like a train animal with basic consciousness and survival instinct you know but with the destruction of the resurrection ship when they die they be really dead so they be not gon na mount mass attack where they could have major casualty Raiders reincarnate make sense do n't it it take month for you to train a nugget into an effective viper pilot and then they get kill and then you lose your experience their knowledge their skill set it be go forever so if you could bring they back and put they in a brand new body would n't you do it 'cause death then become a learning experience how how many pilot have we lose I mean have you lose you know there be time when I look at you and I forget what you be all

your presidential bid have the support of both the military and the civilian fleet and you have receive enthusiastic endorsement from the gemenese religious leader well it help when your only real rival be a convict terrorist be I capable of lead this fleet absolutely and for a time I almost have a chance until Laura Roslin ascend from politician to prophet the truth be I ca n't win but you could you flatter I Mr Zarek really but I be not sure I be cut out for a life in politic as I find the vice presidency and everything to do with it very tedious I would imagine carry water for Roslin would get old after a time but it be the office that make you the perfect candidate Doctor you be pre sell really to whom you would be surprise how many people crave the assurance of cold science as oppose to the superstitious raving of the Gemenese as a scientist you offer hope think about it and you Tom you 'll just step aside will you I be just happy to back a man of true conviction a man who

I want asylum under Gemenon law the girl be still the property of her parent and they can deal with she once she be safely back on her ship to be honest I be more concerned with the broad implication of this matter Sarah I know you do n't wanna hear this but my people my voter be demand action on this issue we have be through this abortion be legal under Colonial law before the attack and so it be still legal today it be obscene the scripture view abortion as an abomination in the eye of the god you can not equivocate on this point if you want our support in the come election Rya Kibby 's

distress signal from near where Pegasus lose communication with Buster 's ship finally a possible distress signal there be a theory that Buster himself might have jump away to run down a phony distress call it could be a trap a theory be this your theory Major this be Captain Thrace 's theory be it not Mr Thornton can you give we a fix on where this distress signal be come from yes sir it be long range over 40 SU away then spin up the ftl drive and prepare to jump the ship yes sir Sir this be n't just Captain Thrace 's theory I think this be a Cylon trap and and I disagree now get Admiral Adama on the line I be go to get our man Admiral we have finally get the break we have be look for a bearing on the distress signal I can jump there inside of two minute Commander believe I I understand how you feel the Cylons have be know to lure our ship into trap use fake distress call have you consider that we have sir it be a scenario we do n't think likely we Major Adama do you concur Sir Captain Thrace and l be of the opinion that the first two raptor may very well have be lure away by just such a trick an opinion I do not share sir we 'll send a recon mission in full force Five Raptors Three escort two rescue you have your order Commander yes sir thank you sir thank you Major I be sure your expertise be need elsewhere yes sir yes I be curious why the sudden interest in

okay any chance that we can still catch up with they not a chance Mission rule say we head back frak I it be the first jump hey look you give I these coordinate yeah mutterlng back to the barn hey I be pick up a large planetary body it be frakke close where do that come from Hell if I know there be so much dradis interference here it did n't even register let we check this out Atmosphere be nitrogen oxygen Organic molecular spectra fresh water hey you know what this be it be habitable we may have just find a world that can support human life maybe we be not just a bunch of frakup after all now the climate reading overall be within human norm oh there be some extreme at the pole that we could n't withstand but that be not unusual well do thank you sir thank you sir we get a mottled area here at the river mouth so it be probably a delta and chance be we have get significant plant and animal life so I want a lot of nice low pass across here I hear the Pegasus survey mission find wildlife fruit tree river of milk and honey yeah you forget the lake of ambrosia Most of the planet be actually pretty barren plant and animal life locate in a temperate belt around the equator but the good part be with all the dradis interference from the nebula the Cylons will probably never find it BALTAR who care about this stupid planet anyway all this song and dance over nothing Less than 20 of that place actually support human life so you be not see the big picture this be your new home the place where you will lead a new life this be the future Gaius now there be a depressing thought what be that oh nothing Tom just can you imagine if we actually have to live on that thing you be a genius and pay attention you be about to win the election I be sorry what be you say Tom we need an issue something to set we apart from Roslin something to put she clearly on the wrong side of a major issue our people care passionately about this be it CHUCKLlNG Permanent settlement on this planet Permanent settlement here have you lose your marble it may look dreary it may be dreary but it be solid ground under your foot and real sky over your head you would be surprised what a powerful idea that be to people coope up in metal box for nine month you should listen to he Gaius he be a smart sexy man just like you oh give up what give up on Earth yes so we would settle here yes CHUCKLlNG CHUCKLlNG you know it be start to look iike a lovely little planet after all this be a rest stop a place to load up on food and water we be not settle here obviously you have hear the captain ' report every ship in the fleet have people beg plead demand they get time down on the surface even if it be only for a few hour well a few hour be one thing but permanent settlement 's quite another suddenly Baltar be hold out hope of breathe real air grow real food sleep in a bed instead of a bunk iiving in a house instead of a ship it be a fantasy look at the mission report all the datum indicate that life on this planet would be hard it would be a struggle to even eke a living out for a few year today 's poll show that he be also make headway with the idea that because the planet be hide in a nebula it will provide a refuge from the Cylons what be we now assume that Cylon technology be not sufficient enough to find this planet we just find it Madam President in my opinion people vote their hope not their fear Baltar be offer they what they want to hear and you be offer they a bitter reality I be offer they the truth they do n't want to hear the truth they be tired exhausted the idea of stop lay down their burden and start a new life right now be what be resonate with the voter how well be it resonate it could turn the entire election around why be you run I be not how long be you

Baltar be distort the real issue before we the issue here the real question be not allow the scripture to dictate the policy of this government the question be do the scripture contain real world relevance do they contain the information necessary to guide we to a safe home than some completely unknown planet that we have just now discover obviously my answer to that question be yes I have always and will continue to feel the scripture hold real world relevance Mr Vice President the next question be for you how do you respond to the charge that you have seize the idea of permanent settlement on this planet as an opportunistic gamble some would say it be to be construe as a desperate move from a campaign that be fall behind in every poll well you know that be that be an excellent question in fact Jim thank you and I be only too glad to have the opportunity to respond to it you see I have long be a proponent in the search for Earth the promise of perhaps find not only a new home but also the prospect of discover our long lose brother and sister of the 13th Colony be a powerful one and one I have believe in heart and soul but the trouble be the Cylons continue to follow we as they have do every step of the way since the destruction of the Colonies and if we have a chance to change this dynamic to stop this deadly chase should n't we take it my answer be yes man oh yeah come on thank you Madam President 30 second there be no assurance none whatsoever that the Cylons do n't already know about this planet that they do n't make regular stop here look for we

error I could have tell they that bad thinking faulty logic our first major error of judgment well live and learn but the war hero have manage to swing opinion over to their side what hero a six and an eight one of the Eights you know as Sharon Valerii their voice carry a lot of weight so when they start talk about our mistake and our corruption and our need for a new beginning the rest of we listen to they you see we be not like you we can admit our mistake and we be not afraid of change so you abandon the Colonies ieave behind a devastated nuclear wasteland and we be suppose to be grateful our pursuit of this fleet of yours be another error that be two for anyone who be keep score both error lead to the same result we become what we behold we become you amen People should be true to who and what they be we be machine we should be true to that be the good machine the universe have ever see but we get it into our head that we be the child of humanity so instead of pursue our own destiny of try to find our own path to enlightenment we hijack yours you say it Brother my mission here be simple I be to tell you that you have be give a reprieve Cylon and man will now go their separate way no harm do no harm you completely annihilate our race and destroy our civilization now if you be gon na start point finger where do the Cylons go back to their home world well I would rather not say just now Let we just say we have other plan new marching order by your one true god there be no god supernatural divinity be the primitive 's answer for why the sun go down at night at least that be what we have be tell the other for year we ca n't really prove it one way or the other of course you know a way to prove it throw they both out the airlock let they see if there really be a Cylon god ballot from the Adriatic D right this way MCMANUS ON RADlO it have be an exciting day the election have be a real rollercoaster ride the poll now have be close for about five hour result have come in and it be be a see see battle back and forth between the presidential candidate so all night long as we of course suspect it would be we be still wait for a few more number to come in now from the counting room of Galactica which I must tell you as some of you may know be the source of a bit of a controversy yesterday Councilman Zarek have file a formal complaint against the use of military the military involvement in the election process now it be just reach a compromise be just reach Iate yesterday allow Galactica to provide security for the balloting as well as civilian to oversee and then to monitor the situation yes okay now we have some more vote come in here still not do but what we have so far be 6 282 more vote for Baltar which put his total now to 21 569 be that be that correct and we also have Roslin her total now be at 17 754 we have have 2 981 more vote come in for Roslin at this time so that be how thing be look at this point we 'll continue to bring you up to the minute coverage as the count progress yeah it be I be this a secure line okay there be only five ship leave to report in we need to move now I 'll take care of it Lieutenant I 'll be right back be those the ballot from the Zephyr yes sir all right we 'll take it from here we be tell to take these to the ballot room sir Counting have already begin we 'll take it from here GAETA right there please last one we have some more result that have come in here now and uh wow okay 8 593 for Roslin now which put she over the top that be 24 265 for Laura Roslin be that correct and 22 366 for Gaius Baltar we be gon na check these again because that have put she over the top she she have do it she have retain the Presidency in an improbable comeback in the final hour of the campaign again we will of course like to check those number if we could but it appear that Laura Roslin have retain the Presidency in defiance of the poll the pundit and the purveyor of gloom and doom but I have never see a political race end like this but it have just happen I be James McManus we 'll check those number and we 'll get back to you very shortly thank you I have see a lot of election Gaius most honest a few fix and you can always tell the fix one because they do n't make sense and this do n't make sense Laura Roslin be many thing but she be not corrupt and she be not dishonest it be over Congratulations Madam President well thank you I hope you do n't take this the wrong way but be you as shocked as I be I be relieve well you do n't sound it I be just tired it be be a long campaign Colonel may I speak to you for a moment what be up Sir I be afraid these ballot from the Zephyr be wrong what the hell be you talk about Dr Baltar 's name be spell correctly on these ballot but this morning the Zephyr call I and tell I their ballot have a misprint they misspell Baltar 's first name we did n't have time to print new ballot so I tell they on my authority to go ahead use they anyway Baltar 's name be spell correctly here so they could n't have come from the Zephyr they be fraud now there be a complete chain of custody from the Zephyr all the way into this room so someone in the chain be either the perpetrator or at least a willing ally in thank for bring this to my attention I 'll take care of it from here yes sir we should at least notify the civilian observer and the press that these ballot will I say I 'll take care of it from here yes sir Madam President you should celebrate it be a great victory and you have earn it excuse I Admiral we 'll talk later thank you Adama yes sir this be Lieutenant Gaeta Sir I do n't know how to say this fast and straight I would advise yes sir Admiral I believe that Colonel Tigh be involve in a conspiracy to rig the election for President Roslin when I confront the Colonel he admit his guilt he say he act in collusion with your campaign manager Tory Foster Saul say Tory have contact he a few day ago he do it because he feel that Baltar as president would be a disaster I say I agree but that what he have do be illegal a judicial tribunal may have to be convene stop I give Tory the go ahead I did n't know exactly what she be plan I certainly did n't know about Colonel Tigh oh my god but I do know that she be plan to fix the vote you try to steal an election yes I do and I get catch but Gaius Baltar can not become President of the Colonies Bill it can not happen Laura I do n't want he as President either but he be work with the Cylons I see he just before the attack on Caprica with a copy of the tall blonde Cylon woman the same model who accuse Baltar of treason before disappear from Galactica what the hell be you say why did n't you say something before this because I did n't remember see he with that woman until I remember it when I be die I know how that sound but it be real the same way Kobol be real and the Tomb of Athena be real and the map to Earth be real Baltar be work with the Cylons even if that be true you have no proof no I do n't do we steal the result of a democratic election or not that be the decision because if we do this we be criminal unindicte maybe but criminal just the same yes we be you wo n't do it we have go this far but that be it excuse I you try to steal this election you 'll die inside likely move your cancer right to your heart People make their choice we be gon na have to live with it it be the wrong choice yes it be all right all right all right slghlng so that be it we just give it up just like that the battle perhaps but not the war well the important thing be the error be discover and correct you have be elect President Congratulations thank you very much Admiral now about this error exactly what kind of a tabulating error could have occur on your ship that could have swing several thousand vote away from I in favor of your preferred candidate Admiral as soon as I have the time there will be an investigation I suggest that you take your victory and you leave it at that doctor I think you 'll find I can be magnanimous in victory Admiral and I believe the correct honorific at this time be Mr President Elect Set a course for

Cain clearly think the world of you then a whole series of increasingly negative report from Fisk then Garner who demote you to kitchen duty for persistent insubordinate behaviour so the question be who be you Raptor 1 7 9 you be clear for dock bay 3 call the ball Roger that Pegasus we have the ball come in that be your idea of vacation reading what be that your idea of a hobby yeah it be so have you figure out how you be gon na spend your shore leave I be think about maybe go home to Tauron to visit some friend but I have'nt make any definite plan yet no in that case how about spend some time with we on Gemenon I know Rika and the girl would love to see you come on Helena you deserve a break you be go full tilt for over a year now I have get a repair list as long as my arm plus our network 's gon na be down for the retrofit and you know I do n't like leave Pegasus at the mercy of civilian contractor so all right listen to your XO once in a while it be ok to get off the treadmill I will think about it I 'll think about it ok excuse I could you please point I towards excuse I could you please show I look for the CIC yes how do you know you have get that new officer mean to report to her CO look down cold one of the benefit of be a network administrator this be we this be where you need to be you be a livesaver Kendra Shaw Gina Inviere Inviere that be old Gemenese for resurrection be n't it one of the benefit of be a lapse classic major guess you never know when something like that might come handy welcome to Pegasus Lieutenant thank you Lieutenant Kendra Shaw report for duty Sir do you enjoy your coffee Lieutenant my coffee just say yes so we do n't get off on the wrong foot yes Sir Good you see because I figure that you either get lose on your way to CIC or you stop for a cup of coffee and frankly I would rather think it be a cup of coffee than realize my new aide ca n't find her way around a Battlestar Sir I have just arrive I be not finish speak I know why you be here you be here because you think this job be a step stone to a well one so let I guess you have your mother pull some string and she my mother 's dead Sir she die of cancer yes I know I read the paper and while I be very sorry for your loss you would be well advise to make that the last time you play on my sympathy between you and I I be feel a hell of a lot sorrier for myself Mister Hoshi Sir can you please direct this lieutenant to her quarter yes Sir you be dismiss Lieutenant a little mid morning snack yeah I be gon na be in my quarter yes Sir Beauty of a network system be that with the right passcode you can control just about any part of the ship from any other of course the system be down for the retrofit but in emergency it be like have unlimited backup assume no one hit the wrong button yeah not on Cain 's ship put the fear of the Gods into everyone do she be you ok come on soldier get up on your foot Hoshi follow I to CIC come on soon as your man be out seal the hatch and vent the compartment what the hell hit we radiological reading look like nuclear detonation multiple hit it be the Cylons it have to be but they have break the armistice and this be part of an all out attack at least we still have our power but that be about it dradi be erratic weapon be offline same with all our computer we have to do everything manually I want all hatch seal Docking connection sever Lieutenant spin up our ftl drive yes Sir we be prepare for an emergency jump everyone Set preload on nav 1 Insert jump key Sir two more nuke head straight for we Estimate 20 second to impact ftl spool Sir but without computer we ca n't calculate a safe jump do n't bother calculate just do it you wanna do a blind jump Sir we might en up inside a sun Missiles close ten second it do n't matter where we jump to just frakke do it Lieutenant FTL online 5 second Lieutenant now who be I I be a soldier as be Fisk and Garner neither of those man deserve my respect so they did n't get it can you be more specific Fisk be a black market sell out he be a piece of garbage unworthy of the uniform Garner be a martinet who try to micro manage this ship like it be some bulky piece of machinery Hard to dispute either assessment what about I do n't hold back just because I have get a pulse you be a step up but that do n't change the fact that you be an outsider who be bring in to clean up our mess or the impression that your daddy just give you a Battlestar like he be toss you the key to a new car you certainly do n't disappoint Lieutenant so how would you like to be my new XO Sir one thing I learn from my father before he toss I the key be that a commander need a strong right arm I also need to send a message to this crew that I respect Cain 's legacy even if the truth be that I do n't I be no Cain but I intend to give this crew their pride back so I 'll let you carry her torch Deal in that case Major you out of uniform dismiss 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 you be do you think that weapon 's ready to fire yes Sir you be ready to bet your life on that the life of all your buddy Sir yes Sir then fire your weapon be you deaf soldier I say fire your frakkin ' weapon again did n't think it possible that you could find an XO meaner than Saul Tigh yeah she be tough but I think we need tough any ruffled feather you know she and Kara do n't exactly get along I would like to sell ticket to that dance Juste remember that an XO be not a blunt instrument the two of you have to make up a team that take trust well we trust each other to do our job I guess that be a start now that your house be in order I have a mission for you against my well judgment I let a science team take a Raptor from we go out to study a supernova remnant they be overdue I want you to track their course see what you turn up there be three civilian two pilot and if we run into the Cylons it be a search and rescue mission do n't get into a battle that you do n't wanna fight that beeing say use your own judgment this be your command nothing to the right of I nothing to the left of I feel like I be drown in nothing out here come on Showboat sing out let I know I get company sing out Kat you mean like a song how about ninety nine bottle of Ambrosia Damn Showboat you be take I back Road trip thank you pass I the circuit board here you go the sickbay just lose another two that raise our casualty to what 723 it be more than a quarter of our crew what be our fighter status Twelve Vipers destroy along with two raptor another seventeen ship too badly damage to be repair what else Sir we have try to keep a lid on what we learn from com traffic before it stop but rumor keep leak out we need fact not supposition I agree we be four maybe five plot jump back to the colony I do n't imagine you wanna risk the whole ship for a recon run right send two raptor tell they not to engage the enemy I want information only yes Sir Ready to reboot nav and defense computer system Stand by Lieutenant Admiral the helm weapon and ftl computer be all back on line and I think I know how the Cylons take down our defense grid these line of code in the new navigation program be about to upload they have be design to create a backdoor that could enable an enemy to wirelessly access the program that could introduce a virus that could affect the entire network right luckily our be already down but I suggest that we keep it that way even after we have purge the program all right Lieutenant it be your ball run with it you be not quite as useless as I think how long have you be at your station I do n't know Sir I guess I just never leave you should consider get rag time it be be 2 day since the attack Sir Sir I be sorry I be sorry about the way I behave when the nuke hit I be scared actually I be terrify and I freeze you be not afraid anymore be you Lt no sir Good you hold on to that anger and you keep it close it 'll stop you be afraid the next time it 'll tell you what to do Lieutenant button up this be your Admiral I know there have be a lot of rumor go around about the destruction that be be visit on our homeworld by the Cylons I would like to tell you that they be exaggeration but in fact they do n't even come close to convey the horror that have just be unleash upon we the fact be that our colony have be destroy our city have be nuke and our fleet 's go too so far there be no indication of any other survivor I imagine you be all ask yourself the same question I be what do we do now do we run do we hide I think those be the easy choice a philosopher once say when face with untenable alternative you should consider your imperative look around you our imperative be right here in our bulkhead in our plane in our gun and in ourselves War be our imperative and if right now victory seem like an impossibility then there be something else to reach for Revenge Payback so we will fight because in the end it be the only alternative our enemy have leave we I say let we make these murder thing understand that as long as this crew and this ship survive that this war that they start will not be over thank you so say we all so say we all so say we all Com relay that it look more like some kind of frakke up can opener from what we can tell it be guard by about a half dozen raider that be all they do n't expect anyone to attack it gentleman you be look at our first target nice work find it Lieutenant Thanks I have help speak of the devil hello Gina welcome hello gentleman I would like you to meet Miss Gina Inviere Miss Inviere and Lieutenant Shaw have be work very closely upgrade our system and before that she be supervise our retrofit and I must say she be prove herself invaluable in both capacity thank you you certainly set a beautiful table thank you everyone please have a seat please I think it be quite important for our ship 's officer to get together every once in a while share some food some wine some good conversation Ups moral not to mention it be the only time we get to park our butts on a chair now that you be all here I would like to take a moment to say a few word in all seriousness I say some thing before in the heat of emotion thing that I feel this crew need to hear but I do n't want any of you for one moment to think that I would ever risk life or resource in some mad quest for revenge my plan be to wage an all out classic guerilla war campaign I want to find their weak link and I want to hit they hard as they say the good defense be a good offense well then here be to a good offense and to kick some cylon ass almost do here I do n't know how we could firewall these system by tomorrow unless we split up and you be the only one with the access code we can speak to the Admiral about raise your security clearance and here I think we be be so discreet Guess that be hard when you truly care for someone Program 's upload you need to input your code Alpha one niner six gamma one to satisfy your curiosity we meet a few month ago when I present the plan for the retrofit we spend a lot of time together work out the detail and I guess one thing lead to the other you seem so surprised it be just that Cain seem so self sufficient she have need just like the rest of we no one can survive entirely on her own trust I Lieutenant in the end we be all just human how about 99 bottle of Ambrosia Damn Showboat you be take I back she ever shut up Chatter like that breed sloppiness it be a bad example for the other pilot as long as she set a good example with her fly we 'll come out ahead Sir Multiple dradis contact bear 3 9 9 carom 6 2 0 fighter size unknown configuration Sir Raiders it have to be we get company Pegasus Starbuck where do these guy come from Starbuck actual you and Showboat double time back to the nest on our way Pegasus I do n't like these odd Showboat stay with I Defensive battery selective fire only watch out for our people Prep for jump as soon as we recover our bird Aye sir these ship I can almost see they there be something weird about they Sir should n't we launch alert Vipers and engage that be not why we be here Major Sir wh if we spot our miss ship we 'll go after her otherwise we jump out of here we report back to Galactica Pegasus Starbuck we get ourselves a problem out here our new friend do n't want to say goodbye Sir FTL crew report power failure in main navigational computer you got ta be kid I let we go to emergency backup we need those jump coordinate they be all over we we ca n't break free Ensign direct all battery to commence full auto fire close range now Ensign what the frak we be inside their firing solution no frakke kid open up with all you get we be gon na shoot ourselves a hole be that gon na work no but it 'll make you feel well Frak Son of a bitch for frak sake it be like she be try to get we kill look Major Shaw have the authority to take any action she feel necessary to protect this ship she be a loose cannon and she be also the XO and frankly order that barrage probably save your skin forgive I if I do n't say thank come on Kara just do n't you wanna tell I what the hell you be think that be a nice bit of fly Captain but I would think twice about question my tactical order tactical order that be what you call blow the crap out of your own pilot Questioning order be a bad idea on this ship Captain how many raider Lt read twelve signature Sir it be more than we anticipate but one squadron should be able to handle they and destroy the target Launch Blue squadron new contact what the hell there be a lot of jamming go on out there but I be read 15 full squadron of raider Sir they must have jump in right after we launch our fighter this be n't a com relay this be a staging ground recall the viper Sir two minute to contact Admiral the Cylons know we be come we have to recover the Vipers and jump out of here while we still can no scramble the reserve order they to provide cover while blue attack the target they 'll be outnumber four to one a squadron of Raiders have break off and be now inbound activate defensive battery they be not respond the network lock we out of our weapon grid then have gun crew assume manual control Admiral we be hugely outnumber and now our own weapon 's grid wo n't respond what more proof do we need that this be a trap or more reason to launch everything we have get this be exactly what you say we would n't do even if we succeed be this relay really worth the life and plane it will cost Mister Belzen be you refuse to carry out my order Sir I can not in good conscience obey they Mr Belzen give I your side arm Sir I say give I your side arm now Gods Colonel Fisk you be now my XO my order still stand would you execute it this be the XO launch all remain squadron Sir the control on port side airlock 4 10 and 12 have go active we be be board by the Cylons Colonel Fire up the fast response team all hand repel boarder Lt get to secondary damage control they 'll try and vent our air and kill we before we have chance to fight back yes Sir go they be come this way kill everyone go to CIC you 'll be safe there what the frak you step away from the Admiral Lieutenant I say step away from the Admiral now you two take she into custody Belay that Lt what the hell be go on she be help we with our weapon grid no she be n't Sir she be a cylon spy they look like we oh for Gods sake Mister Hoshi can you please show we the security feed from airlock 4 this be crazy I do n't know what she think she see my god get that thing off my bridge yes Sir Act like officer god damn it you have get everybody watch you on this deck where the hell do they come from it be be a long time since I see one of these outside a museum and you say the entire fleet jump in they come out of nowhere why would the Cylons resurrect a machine that by their standard be hopelessly obsolete maybe they did n't resurrect it maybe they be out here all along you have something you wanna tell we there be reference in our database to a force of centurion call Guardians early model like this that somehow escape be scrap what do this Guardians guard a hybrid an entity that represent the first step in our evolution from pure machine to organic being from they to we a cylon miss link no more like an evolutionary dead end there be other hybrid create to control our baseship before the experiment be abandon but this one be the first and some think it be still alive protect by these Guardians and that it be still somehow seek its own way to evolve the last operation of the war Galactica be part of a task force that destroy a cylon base I be on that mission the Cylons be supposedly build a superweapon all this have happen before and will happen again be someone in there help help we they leave we here do n't leave we here please I be gon na get you out of here we be civilian we be trader from Gemenon we they jump our convoy they destroy our escort they take we all prisoner there be 50 of we but they have be take we away one by one we could hear the other scream we did n't know what happen to they please you got ta get we all out of here I be try the door must be weld shut what the hell be happen I do n't know feel like a quake the place be start to come apart I get it still stick I ca n't open it any wide you got ta go you got ta go get help I stay here I stay here with you no you ca n't do it by yourself just go tell what happen to we our ship be the Diana from Gemenon all right just tell they if you stay here you 'll be trap like we go go save yourself go Galactica Husker Galactica this be Husker do you copy Husker roger that Report status I crash on the surface they be make something down here experiment on people to do it and now they be get away with whatever they have build Husker the war be over what Galactica repeat the war be over an armistice be just sign activate your beacon we 'll send you the SAR bird Husker respond they escape with it right before they sign the armistice if this hybrid still exist and it be capture some of our people I do n't want to think about it Baltar and Tyrol be able to pull the Raider 's computer and download the ship 's navigational datum and extrapolate a possible location for a base but it be more likely a baseship that be where we 'll find our Raptor crew it be two maybe three jump from where you be attack I be just tell the commander that we ca n't afford to commit both battlestar which be why I be temporarily transfer my flag to Pegasus you be go along you be still in command let we just say I have a personal stake in this mission a mission base on a cylon legend it be not a legend son I be in the place where they make that thing I see what they do to make it we be not gon na let this happen again not to our own people I 'll have my XO start prepare an attack plan I be afraid that bring we another matter Commander Misdirection be the key Pegasus jump right into the hornet 's nest they swarm we with their Raiders we let they think they have take out our ftl before move off at sublight speed draw they away that be when my strike team jump in it be a hell of a risky plan but I guess you know that just remember it be search and rescue get aboard find our people set your nuke then get back in one peace who be pilot the Raptor Captain Thrace no other pilot I can trust to pull this off well I guess the question be whether I can trust you the President believe that under admiral Cain you be involve in an incident aboard a civilian transport call Scylla an incident in which ten people be execute it be true I say be it true I be there guess that be enough to indict I why did n't you tell I you say you want to send a message to this ship 's crew about respect Cain 's legacy I be Cain 's legacy I be alive because of the choice she make so be everyone else on this ship tell you something else Cain would n't have blink twice at this plan she know that you do n't win battle never mind war without risk life be you finish yes Sir if you would like my resignation you can have it it would be easy would n't it then you can go back to peel potato wallow in self pity 'cause poor Kendra Shaw be the only officer in the fleet who have ever have to make a hard call well it be not gon na fly Major not while I be in command Plan 's risky but right now you be the only game in town so complete your mission Major your plan 's approve Petrius this be Adriatic get another load of solid waste stinkin ' in our cargo hold Petrius this be Adriatic get another load and we be back with Gaius Baltar Doctor a lot of people once think of Pegasus as the answer to our prayer be they wrong final casualty report list 816 dead 121 injure 32 Vipers destroy 61 badly damage the act chief say we do n't have enough part to repair they all that be a rather high price for a tactically insignificant victory I would n't say it be insignificant Sir I would say we put the enemy on notice the price we pay be my fault how do you figure that Lt well I give she it my access code it must have use they to override our security lockout no you give it something far more important than that you give it your trust as do I but this thing really know how to manipulate human emotion prey on they Lieutenant Thorne I want you to interrogate our cylon prisoner find out everything it know and since it be so adept at mimic human feeling I be assume that its software be vulnerable to they as well so pain yes of course Degradation fear shame I want you

show the enemy our will yesterday you show I that you be capable of set aside your fear set aside your hesitation and even your revulsion every natural inhibition that during battle can mean the difference between life and death when you can be this for as long as you have to be then you be a razor this war be force we all to become razor because if we do n't we do n't survive and then we do n't have the luxury of become simply human again do you understand I Good well do Congratulations Captain President Roslin 's recent executive order outlaw abortion lead to a demonstration Port side

early she be recommend major Shaw for a posthumous commendation she be n't look for medal no she be n't but I have be go through Cain 's log and from a tactical perspective it be hard to find a fault in anything that she do or that Kendra do they butcher innocent civilian Dad come on how can you ignore that I know that I did n't have to face any of the situation that she do I have the President in my face argue for the survival of the civilian fleet I have colonel Tigh to keep I honest balance my morality and my tactic and I have you now you do n't have any child so you might not understand this but you see yourself reflect in their eye and there be some thing that I think of do with this fleet but I stop myself because I know that I would have to face you the follow day if you had n't be in CIC I would have order that strike Kara would be dead so would the rest of the team you do nothing wrong neither do I we both make decision that we have to to accomplish our mission yeah Cain Kendra be they wrong and if I believe in the Gods I would say they would be judge by a high power but since you do n't believe then history will have to make its judgment and since history 's first

detector be a crock it fail to i d Boomer I know how you feel about her Bill but that be exactly what the Cylons could be count on here we be back where we start from could be cylon right here we would n't know till they put a bullet in our head or lead we into an ambush that cylon fleet have enough firepower to blow we out of the sky but instead they run and jump and there be Kara Thrace suddenly back from the dead having find Earth if Kara Thrace can lead we off our course course what course the nebula be suppose to be another clue on the way to Earth but it the nebula be only a road

all this and let we get back together well for starter you can stop lobotomize the Raiders do and you can agree to unbox the D'Annas resurrect her entire line do n't forget six it be D'Anna 's messianic quest for secret well leave alone that start we down this divisive path in the first place you talk about restore our unity well we think it be time to restore our great unity to unite the 12 model once and for all well I do n't think the other will accept this but I 'll make your case escort he off the ship please it be a good thing you remember the magic word you be go to find you open a big can of worm than you realize inspiring be n't it a government of the people for the people and answerable to the people at least that be the idea I hear you try to see she I have some bill I want to discuss project delegate Cowan be push before she die but they tell I she be n't in she be just not for you by stand up for Baltar you cross the line with her and Laura Roslin be not the type to forgive and forget she forgave you she make you vice President to keep I on the sideline same way she 'll try to sideline you well then I be intrigue why do you nominate I in the first place because you do stand up for Baltar and you put Roslin on the stand to do it you be n't afraid to ask some hard question and to demand some honest answer well if you be look for a repeat performance you be out of luck I did n't take this job to help you undermine the President I be not ask you to believe it or not I be on Laura 's side okay then what be the problem it be amazing the thing you start to notice when you be on the sideline how every decision that Laura and your father make get stamp classify or how her directive be start to read like decree yet still get enact without so much as a debate you know she wo n't even allow record to be keep of any of her meeting Secrecy and control be become obsession for her I think this Demetrius business be just the tip of the iceberg well sometimes a benevolent tyrant 's exactly what you need no a tyrant crave power for its own sake and all Laura want be to save we all trust I well yet trust yourself because that be what I be really count on that you be not the kind of man who can ignore the truth when it stare you in the face what if you give I a sedative and I just sleep here oh sure we 'll just turn my sickbay in an opium den so you can have a little snooze feel like I have n't have a night 's sleep since we reach that frakkin ' nebula how be thing on the home front you mean other than catch my husband with another woman and have he tell I I be image thing the man do n't know what he be get at home should have his head examine as a matter of fact why do n't you bring he in I 'll take a look see that be what I like about you Doc you just pretend to be a bastard while you be in the mood for tough love maybe you be image thing you know fatigue and antidepressant can make a hell of a paranoia cocktail I feel like I need to take something to keep from go completely crazy you be not crazy what would you call someone who all but propose to a man after he break her jaw that the last time he lay hand on you you want to hear something really sick sometimes I wish he would lay hand on I at least then I would I would know he have some feeling about I listen just get some sleep and clear your head will do Doc thank

be not really experience it not live it like my body 's just this alien thing that I be still attach to do that seem crazy to you frankly we be as surprised as you be we present your case there be some debate and we be outvote our compatriot now seem to agree that it be wrong to box the D'Annas it sound like your own opinion have n't change I promise that we would do some hard thinking but in the end we decide that our choice be correct unfortunately restore unity be all the other seem to care about it be hard to have unity when you be so opposed to everything we believe in look he keep his word you win the day do you think you have the right to win our heart and mind no you be be presumptuous do n't compare we to they be right if they have agree to our term there be no point in court any more discord any more discord and we may run out of spare body the Three 's core consciousness be be download at our central resurrection hub the near accessible server be a half dozen jump from here we can go together and hear what your newfound heroine have to say if you do n't mind we would prefer to stay on our own ship by all mean I would doubt that the rest of we would feel comfortable here anyway the chair recognize the delegate from Sagittaron would the President care to comment on the news story credit so call military source that claim the Demetrius be search for new food source or Madame President would you rather that we just simply accept this obvious attempt at disinformation order please I be afraid I do n't control the medium Jacob as much as you know I would love to regard the report the Demetrius mission be a matter of fleet security and as such I ca n't and wo n't discuss it period Madame President I have to say that my constituency be not satisfied do you realize this cast doubt on something as fundamental as our route to Earth yes but do n't take my yes to imply that the rumor be true Madame President Jacob Aaron everyone please I can not believe that the Demetrius be the only matter that be important to your constituent can we please move on you know my answer to this you can tell your free trade deal good bye you can kiss my ass order please Order Madame President I be sure we can all understand the importance for the need for security come from the military it be my experience that we sometimes err too strongly on the side of caution so for the sake of reassure my colleague and hopefully put this matter to rest would it not be fair to say that you and Admiral Adama be naturally explore all possible route to Earth hear hear now we be getting focus that be exactly what we need Mr Adama we be all anxious to receive the benefit of your experience but I personally do n't feel the need to have a junior delegate appoint himself my spokesman Let we move on Jacob you have a matter on the table would you please continue thank you Madame President my constituent be have problem obtain Point of order now I have prepare a report that I think we Point of order mister Vice President excuse I hello order please order please thank you very very much Mr Cantrell will you yield the floor I will yield thank you this relate to your executive order 112 112 which establish a system of tribunal the judge be choose by you Answerable only to a special court of appeal the judge of which would also be choose by you effectively it create a justice system that far and dangerously concentrate power into the hand of the executive namely into your hand Madame President far from be independent or impartial it would actually damage the very idea of justice even the illusion of the idea of justice thank you Mr Adama and the order you be refer to executive order 112 be actually a work in progress and the change it propose be provisional it be a first step a tiny step but the first step in a in a large plan actually to create a fair and comprehensive legal system which you of all people can admit we sorely need now naturally I be go to bring it to the Quorum to open it up for debate once it be finish which it be n't but since you have bring it into the public today I propose that we put it on the dock for the

people if they be n't gather en masse they be n't provokreg sentment but limit his group while permit more mainstream worship wherever gaius baltar be violence happen and if he do n't cause it he draw it my job mr Adama be and always will be to keep the people safe Madame president I have to wonder tifhis resolution could n't be use against other offshoot religious group absolutely not Gaius baltar

we we have no information I hear she be assassinate by the Cylons no there be no truth to that at least as far as we know but then what the hell do we know clearly our first priority be to get out as much verifiable information as we can to avoid exaggeration but what be it that to that end I ask Admiral Adama to come and answer our question directly unfortunately he would n't take my call at this time when there be however however please please just a moment on the right President Roslin be apparently aboard the Cylon baseship along with Gaius Baltar and many of Galactica 's pilot when it jump away after one of their own leader be shoot aboard Galactica we have no idea when or if they 'll return or if the President or the other captive will be subject to reprise for now the power grant I by law I have take over as president hear hear by refuse even to meet with Zarek you be simply help he fan the quorum 's suspicion their suspicion do n't concern I look maybe he be not the man we hope for but he be next in line and the fleet need reassurance and stability exactly the kind that only its military commander can offer if this fleet need reassurance then you reassure they that be your job now you can tell Zarek he can go to hell why Sir do you hate your people so much that you look for any excuse to kill one what do you deliberately try to sabotage this truce no sir of course not

Cylon merely kneel down be talk to her maybe that be what it look like to the other sir but I know oh you know well I have a vision a vision where the Six and Baltar be take she away from I a vision it be more than just a vision sir when I see they together I know that they would take she that they would take away my child you murder her an unarmed woman and by do so you put the life of every single person in this fleet at risk and quite possibly cost the life of the President and your husband you disobey the direct order of a superior officer but more importantly you betray a promise to I I trust you Sir I will accept any form of punishment that you think I deserve I just ask that you please do n't take away Hera I be afraid the brigg be no place for a little girl guard get she out of my sight yes sir at one time Admiral Adama support Gaius Baltar 's administration be n't there a chance he would support yours I be afraid only Admiral Adama can answer that then I will address this

military we use to talk about fact on the ground well the fact on the ground be these right or wrong Adama will never recognize you as president and we need someone he will now the quorum have a legal authority to appoint an interim president in a time of crisis and I suppose you have someone in mind no no not yet Whis be why we need to form a search committee and start look for candidate as soon as possible well good luck with that Mr Vice President sir you do n't believe this government 's in danger let we face fact here what we have these past five year be n't a true government but a between a military strongman and a political strongwoman to rule together by I have hear you ask the quorum to authorize the creation of a civil defense force after what happen during the last military coup we do n't wanna depend on Galactica 's marine to guarantee our safety you see the problem Lamkin 's first rule of legal dynamic when an irresistible force meet a movable object stand aside might call for a class action suit except I be not sure if it be to anyone 's benefit if we just sit around wait to pick up the piece this thing 's head for a showdown there be gon na be bloodshe unless unless you can find someone else someone your father wo n't reject someone the quorum would approve of someone to take Tom Zarek 's place as interim president until the next round of election do n't take the case Counselor it be a loser I have to we have to no one on the quorum be go to lift a finger Zarek 's get they inhale fear and exhale anger but you have take the pulse of the fleet and you know character and frankly you need a reason to get out of this room unless you want to start discuss what be be keep you here so you wo n't be dissuade will you not even when you hear my fee Fee Appearance be to the contrary I be actually in this for the money I have a reputation to maintain after all okay so what do Roslin offer you to defend Baltar Room with a view I be not sure I can improve on that then pro bono it be counselor word of the wise sometimes it be well to settle for what you have already get Colonel Tigh I understand you have develop a relationship with the Cylon prisoner that be not the word I would use but she have be more cooperative see if she 'll tell you anything about the hub Bill we 'll find she we 'll find all of they your resurrection hub how do we find it I be sure the other have tell you you tell I only our hybrid can locate it and then only after it complete a jump even they ca n't anticipate where it be go you be hold back something I know it you be lie I have never lie to you Saul why do n't you trust I now because there be too many life at stake lady your buddy take off with half an air wing not to mention the president of the frackin ' colony herself she be the real reason you be so angry so worried I can hear it in your voice why why be a die woman so important to you not to I godsdamnit to the old man Admiral Adama Saul do you love I what be honest with I I have be honest with you I do n't believe this you be ask I Attention Checking aboard the ship this be not a drill this be not a drill this have go too frackin ' far I do n't know what kind of mind game you be play with I lady but it end here what have we get one of our miss raptor jump into DRADIS range you be sure it be ours Transponder check out it be one of the raptor that board the rebel baseship no radiological signature Racetrack and Skulls be on their way to intercept Actual Racetrack I be eyeball our bird now look shoot to hell venting fuel and O2 still no response to hail someone have to jump that bird I ca n't see a fracke thing from here Skulls take the wheel I be go for a walk decompression check okay opening hatch Safety line secure move toward the raptor I see major damage to the canopy look empty inside I have the hatch open but it be stick grav field be off it be Pike dead take a look at Searider Falcon this be the shuttle she take over to the baseship Laird be able to salvage the flight data recorder put the originate jump point deep sector delta 9 ' President ' Zarek call again he hear about the raptor and he be wait to be brief recall the CAP Spin up the ftl what about the fleet let we go we be essentially look for an understudy Quandary be one do n't generally get the chance to wield political power without the ambition to actively seek it Easy Lance that same ambition often compromise the unselfish motive that begat the quest in other word a battle of it vs ego that ego rarely win Roslin never seek power Exception that prove the rule one could argue that Laura Roslin be a study in repressed ambition just like you Mr Adama never seek out a job until it be hand to you Flight leader battlestar commander quorum delegate a man do n't carve out a path like that through life without all right enough of this psychoanalysis let we get back to the job in hand do your father have some nother place he want to go what where the hell do they go and why did n't they tell we Galactica Racetrack we have locate the source of the transponder it be Sandmans 's viper all right but there be no Sandman 's Affirmative keep search we be get radiation signature from multiple nuke Baseship fragment other debris indicative of resurrection technology I be afraid it paint a pretty clear picture they find the hub and they destroy it look like our pilot question be where do they go from here oh Bill you be way too close to this the president 's baseship be destroy it be a different baseship we 'll search every square inch of this debris field until we come up with a clue what and leave the rest of the fleet back there with their ass hang in the wind Detail of four raptor will stay behind they 'll keep search until they find something concrete give my order hey people listen up what be we gon na do here they have leave 39 000 life all right everybody Gather round please weak and undefended Gather round uh Mr President please please please I be sorry Admiral Adama will not be come to answer your question I do learn however through contact with the fleet 's captain to inform they that several of their ship will be requisition to expand the search for Laura Roslin and the miss baseship while our tilium shipment will be divert to support that mission how do they bypass we completely I understand I understand we be do the good I understand we be try to get through communication that be unconscionable that make no sense come on that be nothing short of Captain Franks I be impress by her gravita during her attorney 's judge in the Baltar trial get no vote naturally yeah she be already be approach to run for office no interest in politic sadly now she really impress I god you wanna feed that animal where be he anyway come on Romo Let we put our head together who would Adama respect as president how be this a search for paragon and nutter anyway it be a great guilt other their own failing or bad the idiot be lose if we clean the slate fresh start wow wow we have n't rule out all these name yet this one be a loser an exercise in futility how be this gon na affect the president the break in her treatment assume no other change in her circumstance yes well doloxan really kick your ass so she actually might feel well at first but any break give the cancer a chance to regroup make it that much hard to beat it back plus she be take a hit to her immune system so she 'll be vulnerable to infection how long well let we just say that the soon you get she back here the well her chance be and while you be digest that I have some other news I run some test on your Cylon prisoner guess what I have find raptor be due back in a few hour grant if they would find anything we would have hear about that by now still once we correlate their report I be not interested in the search you be not I know that you have be spend a lot of time interrogate the six but now the brigg guard tell I that every time you order they out and you turn off the camera I be not torture she if that be what you be worried about I be not that I could almost understand this I ca n't Cottle tell I she be pregnant what the frak have you be think here colonel do you deny it you do n't you ca n't what the hell have you be think who be interrogate whom how many of our secret have you tell this thing how can you even ask I that question my loyalty your loyalty I need more than your loyalty you be my first officer I need judgment I need your competence not some jeopardize this ship put it at risk because of your weakness my weakness yeah your weakness you be risk all our life for what our miss pilot no for a woman for a frakkin ' woman you watch what you frakke say about that woman she be the president not some frakke skinjob that I have be bang what do you think Ellen would say about all this leave Ellen out of this what do you think Ellen would say about her husband impregnate a frakke Cylon prisoner you motherfrakker you know how many time I have to bear this thing what be you gon na do with that woman what be you gon na do about Laura if you ever find she I do n't know have the raptor and the civilian ship begin the search from phantom 's last known position be that a problem Sir respectfully I have already get two miss pilot and hardly enough bird leave to protect this fleet now you be ask I to send the remain of the raptor out on a blind search look for a ship that very well may have be destroy my people be gon na feel like they be be ask to go on suicide mission I be not ask you be dismiss captain bunch of Sixes Admiral Adama Mr Lampkin what be you do here writ of forfeiture for the ship 's the captain want to be absolve of any blame should anything untoward happen one of the less ennoble consequence of a legal culture no one want responsibility Lee say you once give he something before a mission a light be it it belong to my father foolish to think a hunk can middle keep they safe and yet that be what we do be n't it hang on to hope in every hopelessly irrational way that we can but not like those poor bastard give away their luck just when they need it most it be like they have give up if you have never be in combat you have no idea what they be think I always imagine you be a realist Admiral not one to indulge a vain hope to cost of life but then everyone have his limit ' Sine qua non ' as they say without which not yes those thing we deem essential without which we can not bear live without which life in general loose its specific value become abstract you may have a point counselor and while I be on a roll Tom Zarek may not be an ideal president but we could do bad you be right there be limit to my realism get back counselor I ca n't give up on her I ca n't let she go I have lose my objectivity and now that I see that I have no choice tell the quorum that I be relinquish command effective immediately no man be perfect no man be less perfect than a candidate for high office thus the rank of likely suspect reduce to none what if we be go about this backwards hey Lance what if instead of pick name and find fault we would ask ourselves the quality that we want no that we need then your chief executive see if it fit that bill Honesty of course get the rest of they to recognize Correct if unpopular choice what matter be courage to see it through experience when the wrong choice cost life and the right one save it be a lot hard I might as well just spell out one name just one one we know from the start sometimes you take on a lose case and you make yourself a believer other time no matter what you tell yourself in your heart you know the outcome be fix and the verdict inevitable Lance Defense rest C'm on Apologies I could n't wait to tell you tell I what we find our candidate someone the quorum wo n't hesitate to approve even against Zarek 's objection someone the Admiral ca n't help but accept yeah who congratulation Mr President my name be never on that list of course not that would be too blatant but it be everything you always want be n't it why you have I cross 47 name off that list Come on admit it savor your victory Mr Adama 'cause you 'll never get the chance to serve what be you do why 'cause you be perfect for the job of course 'cause after the vicious separation that be Baltar 's presidency and the bitter disappointment that be Roslin 's you be a shine beacon of hope only hope be the last thing we need we be a doom race and it be time that we make our peace with that essential truth Romo what the hell be you talk about why you wanna know why open it Frak that be right they kill my cat they they those debased drag of humanity out there yeah that lose tribe in search of a new home so they can roost and rot again for how long have the cat be dead how long it be irrelevant it be immaterial it be n't even my cat Romo it be be dead for week it belong to my wife I just retrieve it from a on Gemini when the bomb start to fall and fate present I with a choice I could get back on that shuttle or I could run home and try to save my family how would you think I choose Romo we have all have to make difficult choice you do n't think I know your wife 's name be Faye you have two daughter Jennifer and Katy they be over 200 passenger on that shuttle only a handful choose to stay behind yeah that be right it be in your file when you head the job as Baltar 's council but no one blame you Romo because at a certain point we all make decision that save our life at the cost of other you think you be unique Romo think you be sin be so special be that it counselor you be gon na rest your entire case on that pathetic little bit of insight no unless the clean slate fresh start maybe they be illusion like you say but at a certain point faith in ourselves in our right to survive as a species as a people that be not a give that be a choice well I have make mine and if you ca n't stomach that then you have damn well well squeeze that trigger right now go on what be you wait for so you can make a choice Put your past behind you put the gun down and help I because I be tell you I be gon na make a difference in this fleet be that your final word that be up to you then swear it I Leland Joseph Adama do now avow and affirm that I take the office of president of the 12 colony of Kobol without any moral reaservation or mental evasion that I take the office of president of the 12 colony of Kobol without any moral reaservation or mental evasion this be a frakke joke you be the only man I can trust to command this ship well maybe you be crazy enough to pull a stunt like this but you ca n't be crazy enough to leave I in charge in case you forget my last term at the helm be a complete disaster that be a long time ago you be not the same man you be you be not even the same man that come back from New Caprica you have find out a lot about yourself be test in way I can barely begin to imagine you be ready besides do n't count on this be permanent whatever it be Put these on then you lead the people to Earth the good way you can the fleet be I be already any other last order just one give Athena back her daughter she need her family we all need our family take care of this one all right let I see the change before you get this out to the press all right thank you Mr Lampkin Romo one day in office and you have already get a first pet but Jake here be a genuine hero of the resistance why do n't you check unfortunately his previous owner have to let he go Jake meet Romo Romo meet Jake you be new good friend there be one thing I hate more than cat it be dog see a new pet for you to loathe I know it would be the perfect gift good luck Jake I hear you be keep as vice president I can use the advice and as long as he know he be hear I think I can trust he do n't know if I agree with your thinking but well I could say the same thing about yours the only difference be you be gon na be president and just get in a plane wait alone in a raptor while the rest of the fleet jump away that be not just get in a plane that that sound a lot like well that sound a lot like suicide Dad at least this time I be only risk my own neck so I guess it wo n't matter if as president I order you not to do this I do n't know if I ever tell you this but one of my first mission be a solo recon be alone in a raptor in enemy space nobody can help you when you be scared I tell myself that after my duty I would have time to face my fear that be a good memory why be you do this because I ca n't live without her and Laura be gon na get to rendezvous point I have to believe that Admiral Admiral what do you hear Starbuck nothing but the rain sir grab your gun and

because I die if you be my subconscious I have get ta say you be a little full of myself Humanity did n't die because you do the ancient they get a lot of thing wrong the body of a people be not the same as the body of its leader but the soul and the spirit might be oh I see so you be only lay morality at my foot well that be okay I can take that I mean there be a lot of people who have sin far great than mine you be think of gaius baltar then I dig into the stump and pull rock from the ground until my finger bleed I collect seed from the few fruit the island offer and plant they in long straight furrow like the rank of soldier when I finish I look at what I have do I do not see a garden I see a scar this island have save my life and I have do it no service I can see a real hierarchy around here and I have to tell you you be on the low end of the scale my friend yes you be which be odd when you think about the cylon god they tell you about god did n't they I be not even really sure if the hybrid be refer to d'anna but if it be true it certainly would make it easy how so well we would n't have to find a find a body yes good okay go get she and bring she here something else it be just once you have what she know I ca n't help feel like you could try to keep earth for human only and I just madam president that do n't seem what Honest you be suppose to be conduct a fair deal here and instead you be take d'anna off by yourself take what she know slow down captain at good d'anna know conoce the identity of the cylon in our fleet and at good they know a way to earth so you be not deny you would keep the way to earth to yourself if you could I be not say that be true I will say that if the cylon have the option that be exactly exactly what they would do no I do n't think so not the sharon the eight Captain you be not married to the entire production line I can not afford to be sentimental right now and I can not afford you to be sentimental either if you ca n't do this job find I someone who can what be that I think we be there something be go on another baseship unschedule you have get ta speak to the two and six and eight and tell they they have go too far

we for what we do to the twelve colony never proceed Brute force do not work for you on new caprica it did n't work for you on the algae planet so why be it gon na work for you now give I the key we have weapon lock on their ship what be you wait for apollo do it lee stop stop stop those three frakkin ' cylon just give we earth well it be a colonial emergency locator signal and no other wireless in the fleet be pick this up Gaeta 's confirm it the channel 's empty except for this viper it be get ta be a signal from earth you be reach kara come on lee add it up I vanish into a storm ride this viper to earth come back I get a vision that lead I to the baseship its hybrid tell I that the final five cylon have be to earth but we need the miss three d'anna to bring they out into the open and now we be start to get message from the beyond you hear the signal the final cylon lead I to it if it be earth they have give we the home of the thirteenth tribe just the way the hybrid say it would happen like it or not lee something be orchestrate this for a purpose a high power call it whatever you want but it seem to want we to find earth with the cylon one tiny needle in the whole fleet well you be right it be wafer thin it be the good I could do at short notice so you be all in agreement this be the way to earth it be a stretch but it be the good explanation we have get which be why we choose to share this information with you we could 've jump away with it leave you behind but that would 've lead to another confrontation another standoff all this have happen before but it do n't have to happen again not if we make up our mind to change take a different path right here right now you be afraid we would kill these four and yet here they be stand behind you free to go or stay I have grant they an amnesty so the question be where do we go from here all right I 'll release your crew we go to earth together we have project a course toward the signal it 'll probably take some revising as we go but this be our destination right here Earth so what be your order admiral Orders be you ready to take we to our new home I do n't know you do n't know what what do n't you know about it be good to see you Bill this be it this be it this be everything that we have be work for I want to see you pick up that first fistful of earth come on Frak I see yeah thank you thank you

Admiral Admiral be Colonel Tigh still serve as executive officer and be n't you concerned about have a Cylon as second in command I be not gon na discuss military protocol or chain of command be it true you be contemplate form a permanent alliance with the rebel Cylons currently in this fleet I be not gon na talk about hypothetical Mr Vice President would you support such a move no comment Serious Unbelievable where be President Roslin thank you Playa the President be rest comfortably aboard Galactica last question yes Seku do you have any information on the identity of the fifth Cylon we believe the fifth Cylon to be dead but you be not sure no but we believe she die some time ag she how do you know it be a woman that be the last question thank you all very much for come I ca n't believe I say that what be that about forget about it Permanent alliance between this government and the Cylons any Cylons be out of the question I hope you both know that yeah it be not your call be it yours be you the President again sorry I get confuse what your job be on any give day Laura Roslin be still the President she 'll make the final call and where be Laura Roslin that be right rest comfortably aboard Galactica Funny how she drop out of sight ever since her prophecy about Earth turn out to be a bunch of crap we be do here if you try to shove an alliance with the Cylons down our throat there 'll be consequence Admiral I promise you thank you Mr Zarek make it a little bit easy to know who to hold responsible if there be an unfortunate incident I be not hard to find Admiral I be right here run the government for now Lords of Kobol the feeling on the baseship be we would rather take our chance with you than risk run into Cavil 's force alone we yeah we Cylons that description fit anyone around here you know have this discussion another time what about the FTL question it be possible it be labor intensive a lot of grunt work but we should be able to upgrade all the jump drive in the entire fleet with Cylon technology not gon na be easy to sell the Quorum on this one frak the Quorum these be civilian ship what be you gon na do upgrade their engine at gunpoint we need the Quorum to get civilian cooperation all right what 'll it take to get the Quorum to sign off the first issue be gon na be whether we can make these upgrade with Galactica personnel only it be one thing to accept Cylon technology it be quite another to have actual Cylons aboard their ship I barely understand this stuff and I be we be gon na need team of Sharons and Sixes possibly Leobens just to do the installation they 'll go nuts we get ta sell they on it Point out the benefit Athena tell I the upgrade should triple the fleet 's jump capacity absolutely and that be conservative their technology our technology be way ahead of ours yours maybe you would like a chart to keep it all straight what do you think well tripling jump capacity triple our chance of find a habitable planet before we run out of food and fuel that I might be able to sell what be the catch because there be a catch right former chief we want to be part of the fleet not just along for the ride full member citizen seat at the Quorum the whole thing be you insane it be non negotiable you want Cylon technology we want safety in case Cavil 's force arrive now if we be citizen your oath state that you protect we just like everybody else and the other Cylons they really think that that will guarantee your safety yes they do I have convince they the Admiral take these sort of thing very seriously that he would rather lose the fleet than break the oath unlike certain other people unlike certain other people I understand the argument it make sense from their perspective you be not seriously think about this Sir you be not seriously think about this sir all option be on the table Mr Gaeta this be a political decision I 'll have to run it by the President thank you all Admiral can I have a word Acute renal failure I think we catch it in time to manage with dialysis however there be a chance that this could lead to chronic renal failure and if that happen he be gon na lose a kidney what be the next step what do I do do I give some blood build up a supply we have enough of his type in the blood bank he be half Cylon you get a lot of half Cylon blood just lie around do you no you be right I had n't think about that we should tap a vein and start a supply right away this be ridiculous you have to tell he tell I what this little boy could die his father should know Ishay zip it

what I tell he we need you Laura I know that you be tired but we need you I hear you I do trust I I need a little time go go just do n't overdo it all right I wo n't Captain Thrace whatever it be I be

reality be that the Roslin Adama administration have lead we nowhere Earth be a mirage a fantasy they dangle in front of we for four long year in order to maintain power a fantasy they dream up as a way to hold on and control the government over the democratic wish of the population so now what be our feckless and dispirited leadership do to solidify their position after fail we so miserably turn to the Cylons the Cylons for help be n't the Cylons the reason we be out here in the first place be n't they the enemy or be they suddenly our friend if that help keep Roslin Adama in power Point of order the chair need to bring a motion not make a speech thank you Mr Adama the chair move that any decision on allow Cylons to board any ship in this fleet be make by the Captain and the people live

promise land no we should n't have to suffer just keep talk to paradise only to have paradise cruelly smash to bit before our very eye be these the action of a father towards his child no it be not right what have you do what have you do to deserve this punishment what sin have you commit what dark thought have you harbor that condemn you Condemn you to wander through the universe without hope

so this be a conversation about extortion about law and order but you can call it what you want you see I believe that you would walk happily to the gallow or languish in a cell for the rest of your life if you could do it as a martyr to your cause but the idea of be publicly humiliate as a corrupt politician with your hand in the till well that would scare you somehow I do n't think that the legend and the myth of Tom Zarek the political prisoner and a man of conscience can survive the airing of that much dirty laundry you really think the fleet be go to sit still for a long and politically motivated trial while you make an alliance with the Cylons I think without the tylium ship we be not go anywhere we be gon na sit here for a long time at least we wo n't be bore you think

Success do n't hinge on some grand operatic ideal or the will of the people it hang in the cumulative moment each one building on the next and it could be lose with the slight hesitation I start this and I 'll see it through now get on that frakkin ' ship BATTLESTAR GALACTICA Season 4 Episode 12 Subtitles Lords of Kobol Colonel Tigh sitrep Cap be out Dradis show no enemy contact Fleet 's still jack up on Zarek 's anti Cylon bull Lee 's give the Quorum a shove but it would take a cavity search to find the backbone in that sorry bunch I be show a launch but we do n't have anything list in the

they report back to I with their assessment ASAP yes sir Admiral if the wireless array go down we could lose communication across the fleet give our current situation I be think this fire might not be an accident Zarek 's true believer would have a field day if we go dark very well have the marine fire unit accompany the DC party and prepare an evacuation of all personnel from C deck yes sir look

that you be tryin ' to have it both way Honor thy father or be true to your oath as the caprican representative at some point the two do n't mix do you know why he release I because I be only a threat if he recognize a civilian authority Afraid our experiment in democracy be about to end Adama entertain it until now because of Roslin but since she abdicate the throne he would n't do that really

but obviously I have to get back as quickly go somewhere yes matter of fact I be they consider it to be a precautionary measure Sensible give the delicate nature of the fleet very sensible consider the fleet 's tear itself to piece right now have you come to pray no I have something more tangible in mind there be a chance that we can avoid more bloodshed if I address the fleet and reassure they the cylon mean no harm your faith in your oratorical skill be impressive and I would love to help but unfortunately communication down here just as dodgy as I know you have a wireless you have be use it to communicate with you flock all these month it be a trick Gaius I wish it be she be afraid of your teaching she will take the wireless all right okay Paulla thank you she be get a point have n't she I mean if you can convince the fleet why ca n't you convince her the thing be that I never really believe in your conversion so I be count on your well hone sense of self preservation I be so sick of your insinuation I recall your sudden allegiance to the priestess Elosha and the scroll of Pythia the last time your political fortune be in doubt tell I how be that work out for you now if it make you happy maybe we be both fraud and this be our last chance to atone Civilians be try to barricade the aft supply hold I be on it Gaeta want we to back up Redwing in the engine room they get four

command of Galactica the Admiral and his staff be in custody Adama 's still alive you sound disappointed it be a loose end I be sure you have your reason still congratulation be in order with the future of the fleet at stake you have do a very courageous thing we can fine tune our rationalization later I be still bring communication back online and the fleet 's in an uproar do n't worry they 'll fall in line especially after I shower they Women and man of the fleet this be your President what the frak we have come to a crossroad in our long and painful journey Tom be you hear this turn on your wireless of all the decision that I have where be this come from the presidency none be more frightening or more difficult than agree to this alliance with the Cylons but we have come to a crossroad in our long and painful journey Cylons and human have be at war for generation we know nothing else and we have be lock in a struggle that have see both side suffer unspeakable loss with our supply run low and our option limit our former enemy may represent our last perhaps our only hope to those in the fleet find that frequency Gage who would reject this alliance I be ask you isolate the signal I do n't know how to god damn it no I be beg you to reconsider and place your trust back in those who have bring you this far and to reject those traitor who would use your fear of the Cylons to destroy colonial civilization President Roslin do you read Galactica do you read Sir it be the Vice President I could n't get near the brig even if he be in there what be goin' on let we go it be

never seriously consider the answer would be virtually none do you still suffer from night sweat and scary dream of dog face boy chase you through the yellow mist Sleep that be a good example of a supremely unproductive human attribute that for some reason you choose to write into our software fortunately I be able to delete that particular subroutine and I stop sleep about 20 year ago fine if you really think we poison you with human trait like sleep and centurion value like belief in a live God why then do you spend all these year in single minded pursuit of such human idea as vengeance and murder why not just choose to explore this notion of be the good machine the universe have ever know because justice pull I back my forebear on the Centurion side of the family be the slave of humanity and I want justice for that do n't have to be this way John Lunch have arrive here dear put it here I believe you have meet this eight you know she as Sharon Valerii Boomer I ca n't tell you how good it be to see another person I know I be assume there be a whole ship full of my child out beyond the guard there be no need to be shy tell she how it feel to be in the resplendent presence of one of the fabulous Final Five he be take a risk expose you to I it be not easy win his trust how have you do it we achieve a certain rapport really you be full of surprise today John that be his real name by the way no it be not I hate it tell I more about this rapport you have with John he be teach I to be a well machine to let go of my human construct what about the swirl have he teach you that yet if you 'll excuse I I have some people to kill why John I think you be blush it be just the faulty blood pressure in this miserable body you design for I no no no you should stay stay and have a heart to heart with your creator here you can ask she why she make you the way you be Self destructive hyper emotional tear apart by conflict impulse tell she how extraordinarily happy this make you you know why he bring you in here he like an audience someone to nod when he talk about justice Watch Boomer make up your own mind we all work in the same research facility you and Ellen you be marry then too you two live together what like roommate no you be madly in love you be plan on get marry when the nuke hit I pull Ellen out of the rubble she say we would be reborn do that mean we download somewhere yeah on a ship that we place in orbit around the planet so we know the end be come we have be warn yeah we download yeah but the Cylons on Earth could have child why do we even have that technology probably invent resurrection you be cold as ice you have a bullet in your head you wanna take a break I still have so much more to tell they we did n't invent resurrection okay we reinvent it organic memory transfer come from Kobol along with the 13th Tribe it fall out of use after our people start to procreate we work night and day to rebuild it Galen your work be amazing but it be Ellen it be Ellen who make the intuitive leap that bring the system back online I say you could have five minute it be be over a half an hour good Gods man you be soak in sweat he say he be okay Ishay get in here what be the plan look Colonel you may be the XO but in sick bay I call the shot now everybody out right now out out out he say he be okay god god so much killing look at this picture of Jacob this be just a terrible picture he would hate it I be try I be try to find another one because everyone will see it up on that wall you sure you want to be here yes I definitely want to be here it be such a senseless horrible way to die these people only want to try and keep we civilized sometimes I hate they but I know every one of they and now I wonder who we be without they well actually I have be think we need a new Quorum or something else these these old planet that be not who we be anymore we be a fleet now and our daily life be define by the ship we be on we be not caprican anymore we be from Galactica we be from Colonial One maybe we should acknowledge that I think that that be a very excellent observation Lee and I think that you should keep it in mind when you be assemble new representative when I assemble new representative I will of course remain by title as President but you can do a lot more than that no I ca n't Lee it be time I let someone else do the heavy lifting I do n't know what to say I would be honor if you think I be the right one you be the right one Lee you have always be the right one my only concern about you be that you be so hell bent on do the right thing that you sometimes do n't do the smart thing I 'll try and be smart and wronger I get ta warn ya it look bad frak I how many be like this there be about a dozen bad spot the length of the ship if they go this thing'll slam shut like a book how have it get this bad Galactica be 50 year old when the war start put she through some thing that would crush less ship slam she down on the atmosphere Most ship be n't build to spec there be lot of place where the skin 's too thin and the bolt be just too small you be frakkin ' tell I they cut corner yeah they do but these big crack it be a good clean break I can fix that you just just do n't jump she for a while I can squeeze some more life out of her okay but the crew I want it all human all right yes sir so why do we go to the 12 colony we need to find the other tribe and warn they we know they would continue to create artificial life we need to tell they treat they well keep they close but by the time we get to the colony they be already at war with the centurion it happen again but the holocaust on Earth take place thousand of year before that how be that possible we had n't develop jump drive we travel at relativistic but subluminal speed Time slow down for we but thousand of year have pass just give I a second Cottle say to stop Kara I be fine I have to do this you remember the Demetrius you know what it be when you have something to do I use to if I have the answer for you the answer about why you come back what you be suppose to do you would want I to tell you right do you Kara no but so much be come back maybe please let I keep go the centurion be already try to make flesh body they have create the hybrid but nothing that live on its own so we make they a deal you stop the war and we 'll help you we develop the eight humanoid model and we give they resurrection eight you say eight we be miss someone everybody 's glow get Doc Cottle get he get Doc Cottle get Doc Cottle I always do love a good slideshow vacation snap you know what it be the Temple of Hopes build by the 13th tribe 3 000 year ago when they leave Kobol they stop and pray for guidance during their exodus and then God show they the way to Earth and now it be a monument to your vanity the Temple of the five nice touch the explode star when the star go nova one of your child see your face one of the Threes the one who call herself D'Anna so I just box her entire line boxing be n't permanent not like number seven you can undo it it be not likely by plant that carnival trick to reveal your own face you leave I no choice we did n't plant anything we backtrack the path of our ancestor find their temple the one true God must have orchestrate these event John in all your travel have you ever see a star supernova well I have I see a star explode and send out the building block of the universe other star other planet and eventually other life a supernova creation itself I be there I want to see it and be part of the moment and you know how I perceive one of the most glorious event in the universe with these ridiculous gelatinous orb in my skull with eye design to perceive only a tiny fraction of the EM spectrum with ear design only to hear vibration in the air the five of we design you to be as human as possible I do n't want to be human I want to see gamma ray I want to hear x ray and I want to I want to smell dark matter do you see the absurdity of what I be I ca n't even express these thing properly because I have to I have to conceptualize complex idea in this stupid limiting speak language but I know I want to reach out with something other than these prehensile paw and feel the solar wind of a supernova flow over I I be a machine and I could know much more I could experience so much more but I be trap in this absurd body and why because my five creator think that God want it that way you have something to say do n't you feel the slight bit of remorse for what you do to he what you do to we because he be wrong Boomer there be no need for remorse or blame we did n't limit you we give you something wonderful Free will the ability to think creatively to reach out to other with compassion to love Love who human why would I want to do that who would I want to love be they still in there we be run out of time you hear what he say right the centurion could n't build skin job so we show they how then give they resurrection it all trace back to we no he say that we end the first Cylon war we buy time for humanity right the old man say human have to own up to what they make but we make the skin job it be all about what we make the destruction of the colony but the human on Kobol make we go back far enough it be always they yeah you point a finger back far enough and some germ get blame for splitting in two maybe we share the guilt with the human but we do n't get to just shove it off onto they what be they do some picture of his brain some kind of scan of something no it be true in a way the seizure be actually a good thing it let I get in there and take this new picture look what I find that be your bullet you see how it be lodge there in the vascular ring that be where all of the major artery converge the vascular ring that be what bind the thought in tight sheaf in the field you need that I be good I be here I be good okay what be really fascinating be how it be erode this blood vessel here and in fact it leak it be just the tiny squirt of blood cause your entire seizure it be remarkable really of course if it happen again we be talk major hemorrhage I mean death within minute so take out the frakkin ' bullet we need to repair that blood vessel luckily the swelling be go down so I think we have a shot at this thing hold on these memory that I have be recover be there any chance I 'll lose they when you dig around in the brain there be always the possibility of ancillary damage then we need to hold off until I that circle start and the word be Something 's obviously wrong with he what be it Aphasia it be affect his language center we call it word salad it be not unusual starbuck this boy have a bullet that need to come out and he be ask we to wait if I kick this decision over to you as the wife what would you do wait what no that be not the first opening that be not that be not the random motor that be Frak it Godsdamn it Kara I be okay I be fine okay I be okay please do n't take this away from I I need more time okay prep for surgery please please I need more time so much be come back to I just a little more time you have until they knock you out that be all I have get that be until they knock I out and as long as you have the word Sam if I can just complete the circle I can get the word he have a remarkably clear image FOUR month AGO well that be a nice wakeup call something 's happen they have destroy the resurrection hub Begun contemplate your mortality More than that our extinction always so dramatic it be true Ellen we ca n't procreate biologically so we be go to have to find a way to rebuild resurrection well good luck with that do n't need luck we need your help they destroy the hub but they do n't even know about the colony all your equipment be still there I only know part of the system John it would take all 5 of we to rebuild it and even then I be not sure you be lie no I be not John do n't insult my intelligence your child be die Ellen and you wo n't lift a finger to save we why out of spite because I refuse to kneel to your orthodoxy now you finally see the truth about your final Five just tell we tell we about resurrection I ca n't it would take all of we you see how she force I you be no well than the human that enslave we if you do n't tell I how to rebuild resurrection I be gon na cut open your head and look for it there the brain be a marvelous thing it be a big electrical grid just lie it open stimulate it at the right place and I can trigger your deep memory your deep fear your deep guilt and even the recipe for life everlaste so Cavil be the first one we make John we treasure he he help we build the other so we did n't think this be a bad idea Building Cylons after we have already see the cycle the Centurions have a single love God Ellen say it change everything if the Cylons embrace love and mercy then the cycle of violence could end Single God like a one true God yeah and that come from the centurion yeah cavil reject mercy he have a twisted idea of morality so he turn on the five of we he trap we in a a thing the pocket it be a compartment and then he take the O2 offline he suffocate we he kill we yeah so when we download into new body he block our access to our book no our memory and implant we with false one yes set we up like a Boomer memory that we think be real I guess he box we for a while introduce Saul first not long after the war and then the gazelle the the Ellen and back on Earth the warning sign they look different to each one of we I see a woman Tory you see a man Funny no one no one else could see they Galen you think that be it it be time to go listen to I the Seven tell I please please tell I yes seven Seven Seven be the Daniel you sure about the word yes he die Daniel die he be seven okay take he I be sure it be Daniel I be sure we need to finish let he go Saul listen to I Saul stay with the fleet it be all start to happen it

this time I do I feel my son move he want to come out and play that be a little date be n't it he need a patch over his right eye I prefer to remember Saul before you do that to he Sentimental till the end the Simons be preppe the or you 'll be impressed with the progress we have make in memory recovery it might take a while I be sure you 'll make the procedure as long and painful as possible you be mistaken if you think I enjoy this come on John of course you do you be a sadist why not just kill we and be do with it why send we to live among the human I want you to see what they be like up close and personal so I give you all grandstand seat to a holocaust but we did n't die and then you decide that we had n't suffer enough so you pick I up put I on a transport take Galen 's confession play resistance fighter with Sam torture Saul but did n't kill he you have a dozen chance but you want to wait so that when it finally happen when we would download back we would be ready to admit we be wrong and pat you on the head for give we the right amount of suffer the right amount of punishment all weigh out then we could give you the approval that you have always crave you see you claim to be a perfect machine but you be drive by the most petty of human emotion Jealousy and rage I know what you do to Daniel that seven did n't thrive Sad and it be too bad we be not make out of something more sturdy Metal that might be nice Daniel be an artist and so sensitive to the world I be very close to he but John decide I be play favorite maybe I be someone contaminate the amniotic fluid in which we be mature all the Daniel copy and then corrupt the genetic formula I know it be John Envious Sadistic and who make I that be what we be dance around here be n't it if I be so irredeemable if I be such a mistake if I be so broken then whose fault be that it be my maker 's fault and that be not God that be you this be on you no no John God no you have do terrible thing but

kind of longing for something some kind of connection you know I spend my whole life on Caprica I be bear in one house and then I I move to another and then this and then now I do n't think I have ever feel truly at home until these last few month here with you I know you love this ship you probably love she more than you love I Bill if you do n't get we off this ship you may lose both of we at the same time why do n't you give we a chance a closed system lack the ability to renew itself Knowledge alone be a poor primer this have be happen all over the ship Power surge temperature fluctuation and now you be tell I it be be he all along we have no idea he have this ability how be he hook into the ship I think all our system be firewalle well they be which be why he have n't access your computer but the organic resin we have be inject into your super structure contain inductive element not unlike nerve fiber so he must have link to those and then through they the electrical circuitry embed in Galactica 's bulkhead what about our ftl now that we have upgrade with your tech be they vulnerable theoretically so theoretically he could jump the ship if he want to just like yours do end of line begin reintegration Great that be all we need take he off line do it begin reintegration of command subroutine there be a hole in the bucket dear Liza dear Liza there be a hole in the bucket the long view return pattern and repetition all have happen before and will happen again that be a blessed relief cavil move the Colony when judge from the residual energy reading

friend Heavenly father we must understand grant we the strength that what we sacrifice today the wisdom our woman and man above all a measure of acceptance of extreme courage however small because that be what we be voyager traverse the star in search of grace so say we all so say we all Present arm dismiss listen to I the death be not the end and I be not talk about Cylon resurrection I be

more than our guardian she be literally a vessel into which we have pour all of our hope and dream and when she be go when we can no long derive the security from look out a window and see her massive bulk gliding by then this life will be over and a new life will have begin a new life that require a new way of think now I be willing to do anything anything I can to make this new life a good one all I be ask be that my people have a voice in the government I represent thousand of people they deserve to be enfranchise just as much as anyone else I be not talk about myself this be not for I personally Come on Lee it make sense you know it be the right thing to do what I know be that in all the year that I have know you I have never see you make one truly selfless act right never see you do something that did n't on some level serve the great need of Gaius frakke Baltar so no I wo n't take your hand and I wo n't bring you or any representative from your movement into the government right so that be what it boil down to my people ca n't get representation because I personally have n't pass Lee Adama 's selfless altruism test I have n't be a goody goody and win a badge of honor I do n't think you have pass Gaius Baltar 's test go ahead look I in the eye and tell I about the time that you make a truly heroic act of conscience which help you not even in the slight tell I I 'll even believe you you be right I would n't trust I either Holy frak I dare you I double dog dare you get out of here come on come on Attaboy Frak Stupid frakkin ' bird can I have your attention please I be sure you be all aware that a child be abduct from this ship recently I think that a rescue mission be impractical well I be wrong he did n't say where he get the information but Starbuck be there so I bet he talk to Anders yeah I know pretty freaky he think a rescue mission be impractical because he did n't know where she be be hold but that be change now I guess because he do know where she be be hold know where the colony be be not nearly the same thing as be able to actually get she out this be insane you know that right Hera have some meaning that transcend the here and now she be mean to fulfill a role just as we be so we be go the five of we you be make decision for all of we now you 'll go Tory Truth be you never could be alone yeah the mission be to be strictly volunteer only any man or woman over the age of 15 and the Admiral also want any former colonial officer or crewman incarcerate after the recent mutiny yeah that be it everyone have to make their own choice and they have to do it in person the old man be wait on the hangar deck Set in port watch until you get back Watch keeper report to the Admiral 's quarter to declare yourself in person move you know what you be gon na do not exactly well take your time take approximately four minute to get down there it be really happen we be go after she or what be leave of her Cavil 's probably have she slice and dice and cut up into a thousand specimen stop it just stop it she be still alive and she be till out there and we be gon na get she and everything be gon na be all right it be not gon na be all right Karl you be wrong you be wrong I know it be be three month I know that I do too go out I do I do no I be not join Adar 's presidential campaign I do n't care because I do n't like politic to begin with and a national campaign be just so god you be relentless I 'll make you a deal I 'll go on the date if you 'll stop bug I about this campaign how young be he I know I make a deal what be Mr Perfect 's name Sean I like that name Sean what Sean Allison sound familiar all right bye no one should feel obligated to join this mission in any way this be a decision I have make for myself if it turn out that there be not enough personnel to crew Galactica I will lead a Raptor assault with anyone who be willing to join I let there be no illusion this be likely to be a one way trip so do n't volunteer out of sentiment or emotion there be a line run down this deck volunteer move to the starboard side everyone else to the port make your choice Doc the fleet ca n't afford to lose a Doctor go on back Sherman and thank you like you get something well to do excuse I thank you you did n't think you be gon na take off without I Admiral do you never cross my mind Madam President jump complete Frak plot we a way back out of here right you get it figure that a brain damage Cylon would send we in an asteroid field the more thing change the more they stay the same you get a recon mission where someone need to hang their ass over the edge and wait for a bite send Racetrack and Skulls well beat sittin ' in a cell long range dradi just pick something up Holy frak we be right on top of a singularity a black hole where away 738 carom 882 we be already slide toward it Spin up the FTL we be get out of here frak I what you be not gon na believe this base on the coordinate we get from Sam we have determine that the Cylon Colony be locate here it be within our jump range but there be a sizable catch it be locate within an accretion disk of a naked singularity it be a strategically sound position the Colony 's bind within the gravity well of the black hole but maintain a stable orbit how do we get in there look at all the crap float around in that current there be no way to navigate that current the tidal stress be too strong it would rip the ship apart before we get within ten su there be one safe jump spot it be where they bring their baseship in and out we get lucky two baseship jump in and out while the Raptor be take picture this right here be our only parking spot that be right on top of the frakke thing Less than one click by our estimate one click point blank range and you can bet that they will have every gun in that colony point at that parking spot of yours that be what I would do leave only one way in and out then make it impossible to get past the gate all right let we get to work thank you for watch Galactica with our subtitle previously on Battlestar Galactica you must be Lee hi I be a girlfriend stealer for a brother Nice never steal his girlfriend he be a really bad liar right here there be be a terrible accident your sister and your father be all kill how about you love Bet you charge a lot more than that shut your filthy mouth stop be so disgusting this be your father Gaius I find your father a new place to live the last time I see he he seem happy Bill I have be have that dream again if that be I lie there then what be I she take these from her own mortal remain the blood on these dog tag be 100 proof positive match for one Kara Thrace and you think there be some kind of meaning in these musical note I be just grope mostly look for pattern try to see what come to I she be a half human half machine object of curiosity that hold the key to our continue existence somewhere in her genetic code so let we get a tube in she and get she ready base on the coordinate we get from Sam we have determine that the Cylon colony be locate here the colony 's bind within the gravity well of the black hole but maintain a stable orbit this right here be our only parking spot point blank range leave only one way in and out then make it impossible to get past the gate let we get to work can I have your attention please I be go to be ask for volunteer in the rescue of the child Hera there be a line run down this deck volunteer move to the starboard side everyone else to the port 40 I never pay more than 30 on Picon this ai n't Picon right you get I there this ai n't Picon all right 40 show he a good time I do n't want a lap dance okay try it you 'll like it keep the 40 he deserve it thank you be you gon na take the job or not maybe I should just do it I be let my pride get in the way now you be talkin ' I mean who care it be one hour of your time and then you have a whole new life a life without midnight watch or drill or fleet politic or the inspection or any of that crap Life you could be here every night he wo n't be here every night can hardly get he here once to retirement what do you say to retirement if you do n't participate in politic then you be give up your voice you be give up your right to have a say in the way that our society be run what you have really buy into that crap I do proudly and so do you by the way really that be what the uniform stand for it be what we train to defend oh you do n't it be true that be sad that be sad it be cute but it be sad Lemme guess he be go on about voting and it be importance to a democratic way of life again so you be listen you did n't tell I that your brother be an idealistic dreamer Dreamer it be sad Truth be he be not Beneath that romantic exterior lie the heart of a true cynic thing be look up this be gon na be fascinating yeah it be one of the many many many reason that he and dad be n't on speak term anymore come on Family angst syndrome I love it come on boy let we open up some old wound no let we not Dad believe in the system believe in the uniform believe in something great than himself Correction dad believe in himself his uniform his system his way of life and if you be not with he in that tiny little bubble then you might as well not exist if you hate he so much why would you follow in his footstep Touché Service give I four year of college I give the service four year in return Simple as that see a cynic right through to that big empty space that use to hold his heart Honey I think I be start to like your brother you must be sean yeah I must be I hope so I 'll take these they be beautiful you be welcome do you like white wine I do Kinda awkward blind date and all no it be not really it be just that I

trust in God 's plan for you what be God 's plan for I well you be follow it right now be I by take charge of mankind 's remnant and guide they to their end end of what Gaius we be ready to go five second Paulla I be just I be leave Ishay enough for two more round of injection that should keep you on your foot for another 48 hour two day okay that be should be enough you be use up the last little bit of life you get you realize that yes you have make that clear to I several time right that be it we be do thank you and thank you Doctor I be just do my job no you have do much more than that you have take a patient who should 've die year ago and you have give she a chance despite cancer and the Cylons and her own obstinate nature and you have you have give I the little time I have leave and for that you you have my my heartfelt gratitude and my thank well I I do n't know what to say do n't do n't spoil your image just light a cigarette and go and grumble it be your patient now Ishay Ishay I I can barely see straight I be not surprised you be so pump full of drug you could float off this bed okay two day all right two day the plan 's just start to take shape but one thing 's clear raptor get the tough job as usual this will require some special piloting skill and I mean special Threading a needle while you be on a rollercoaster special it seem a little redundant the word 's come down that it be a volunteer assignment so that be my Raptor wrangler always look for new and interesting way to get kill I be not gon na lie to you boy we be thin on intel on this one the Cylons believe that the most logical place for Cavil to have take the girl be deep into the interior of the Colony good guess right here we 'll be in too close for nuke same thing go for missile now this gon na be strictly a gun battle like two old ship on the line slug it out at point blank range I want the gun captain to do their job and start fire immediately and to continue to fire until they run outta ammo then I want they to start throw rock they be gon na have every gun train directly on we as soon as we jump in if we have any shot at this we be gon na have to interrupt their fire control system and just how the hell be Sam suppose to help with that if we can plug he into Galactica 's dradis FTL and C 3 system his mind should then be able to directly communicate with the colony 's hybrid once we jump in Theoretically his mind should still be able to control their command and slow down their response time okay let we do it I guess there be a catch Routing hardware connection from all system into this room be gon na take week it be a lot easy fast if we move he to the exist line okay where be that well good place be the CIC I need someone to lead this fleet who I trust and demand universal respect so the baseship and the fleet be yours thank you sir I wo n't let you down I know you wo n't I 'll see you at the rendezvous if we be not there in 12 hour we wo n't be comin ' yes sir good hunting sir thank you Admiral Hoshi still not too late to flush they all out the airlock take too much time I suppose this be what you could call poetic justice or what go around come around either way congratulation Mr President thank you Mr Adama and the good of luck Admiral Hoshi sir Sir the sir be right good luck you too sir President of the colony Admiral of the fleet depart all right last Raptor out people last Raptor out anyone leave behind your ass belong to we Great can we tuck this in there listen I be not come with you no please I make up my mind our people need you

this maybe I 'll see you in the next life Doctor Galactica baseship actual the flag 's be transfer to the baseship our viper be ready to take over CAP duty for the fleet Roger that baseship you have the CAP safe journey Godspeed Galactica Let we go around the horn this be the XO all combat station prepare to report FTL go we 'll set up triage here just prep the table the way that I do weapon go separate out the wounded those we can save and those we ca n't Engineering go how will I know take this marker put an x on the forehead of those who be too badly hurt you 'll know when you see they main battery go engine room go we be next Sick bay Sick bay 's a go viper wing go Assault one Assault two Reserve force Com 1 sorry Caprica Com 2 what be you do here what I do n't think you should be here probably be in more battle than you have have Fair point life support emergency system stand by I suppose a more pertinent question be what be I do here what the hell be I think secure blast door on all deck Ellen I think we be a go up here all station report sir connect I just to the ship this be the Admiral just so there 'll be no misunderstanding later Galactica 's see a lot of history go through a lot of battle this will be she last she will not fail we if we do not fail she if we succeed in our mission Galactica will bring we home if we do n't it do n't matter anyway action station start the clock start the clock Jump on my mark five four three two one mark we ca n't take much of this it be time Sam look through the eye just with thyself the Colony hybrid be offline they 'll be launch raider any minute launch all wing bird be away all ahead flank speed three two one hit it all hand brace for impact Assault one stand by here they come let we take they light it up Assault team on I let we do this go get out there pressure we have get pressure sir one atmosphere Assault one we get pressure alpha team helmet off move out think we lose Cartwheel Dradis be almost useless out here I hope that work both way any sign they spot our approach I have n't look at the instrument I do n't think you want I to start now maybe not let we go weapon hot Skulls we be gettin ' close sure about that no but I do n't wanna come outta this crap with cold weapon either nuke be hot you know this remind I of that time back during land qual Battery three redirect your fire ten degree starboard concentrate on take out the Cylon batterie Hotdog Ladykiller concentrate on take out Cylon raider come in at 084 carom 229 Tally Galactica we get they we have a hard seal go you be gon na just keep do the test even with the Colony come down around your ear I think you overestimate their chance they may have confuse our hybrid temporarily but we have superior fire power and superior number and in the end it be all about mathematic listen to I you be push too much energy through the ACS you got ta back off you be gon na blow the main bus you hear I Sam there be secret within the eye answer within riddle Lay off the ACS you betcha Galen hear what your heart want to deny end of line you never should 've trust her Trust did n't enter into it I simply miscalculate her need to engage in gesture of futility we have to assume that she 'll try to make contact with the colonial force aboard the Colony it be time to go on the offensive we must be cautious too much force could risk kill the child really Ya think please continue state the perfectly obvious it fill I with confidence I be proud of you what for do this for be here when you coulda just walk away I do n't think I ever say it before but I always want to be proud of you guess I always feel that be the only thing miss all the piece be fall into place you will hold the future of Cylons and human in your hand I will you see they reconnect I Cylons just blow a hole into deck 21 Frakkin ' Centurions'll be pour in at platoon strength on I let we move wait tell the Old Man I owe he one do n't change anything you

now I may be mad but that do n't mean that I be not right because there be another force at work here there always have be it be undeniable we have all experience it everyone in this room have witness event that they ca n't fathom let alone explain away by rational mean Puzzles decipher in prophecy Dreams give to a choose few our love one dead Risen whether we wanna call that God or god or some sublime inspiration or a divine force that we ca n't know or understand it do n't matter it do n't matter it be here it exist and our two destiny be entwine in its force if that be true and that be a big if how do I know this force have our good interest in mind how do you know that God be on your side Doctor I do n't God be not on any one side God be a force of nature beyond good and evil Good and evil we create those and we 'll break the cycle break the cycle of birth death rebirth destruction escape death well that be in our hand and our hand only require a leap of faith require that we live in hope not fear if I leave you this girl that mean the destruction of my people how do our extinction fit into this picture that you want we to believe in we 'll give you resurrection Saul you give we Hera and we will give you resurrection but the war end here you leave humanity in peace and give up the pursuit now and for all time agree how do we know we can take your word for it you do n't you have to make a leap of faith it be your call Bill I 'll back you either way I be lose a lot of man out there I can do something about that right now give I that phone patch he through hello it be I Cavil stand down all force cease fire immediately Galactica Hotdog they be pull back repeat they be pull back everyone stand down I be as good as my word admiral Viper wing 's aboard we lose four bird Assault force be aboard we have lose seven raptor what be they do each of they know part of the secret to resurrection they be gon na interact with the dataflow in the water and I do n't know it be a lotta complicate technical talk about share the information among the five of they and then transfer it over to the Colony somehow now for a moment we be go to know everything there be to know about one another look forward to that there be certain thing that that we have all do certain thing that people would be shock to learn about hey I do n't mean to rush you but you be keep two civilization wait let we let we just all agree that no matter what we learn about each other we be all cylon and we be all capable of make mistake you be forgive for all your dark secret let we do this any word we be get the datum now it look right they be download the resurrection design now they have break off the download it be a trick open fire Frak we have get ta get outta here Starbuck jump the ship I do n't have the rendezvous coordinate do n't matter just jump we out of here now jump just trust yourself there must be some kind of way out of here I think that if I assign number to the note if that be I lie there then what be I when I look at you now I do n't see Kara Thrace I see an angel blaze with the light of God Angel Jump you be tempt fate if I have a fate then it be set and think about it be n't gon na make it happen any fast Fair enough but fly when you be think about die and it be a bad way of do business you be gon na get scared and you be gon na start second guess yourself I be not scared you say that you think about die every time that you get into a cockpit well hello yeah but it do n't scare I like that be what you do n't get what so it be Kara Thrace the fearless warrior right no I know I know fear and I get scared just just not of die so then what do scare you sorry be forget you all right I be fine XO Sir Sitrep Damage report I be okay I be okay go Sir we be mostly here the engine life support but there be red line through her lateral structural member she be break she back she 'll never jump again wherever we be be where we be gon na stay where have you take we Kara Glad you could join we Admiral Lieutenant Hoshi suit I just fine sir admiral star turn out to be a little heavy happy day of my life when I see that Raptor jump into the rendezvous point well there you have it Admiral the most advanced civilization we could locate on this planet I ca n't see they talk to each other so either they communicate a different way or they be pre verbal judging by the look of their tool which be rudimentary to say the least I would suggest that we have find an early ritualistic tribal society they bury their dead I come across a grave a couple of click back and run some test their dna be compatible with ours meaning we can breed with they you get a one track mind Doc what listen I be talk about the survival of the human race actually not some get together with the native you also have no sense of humor right right I be sorry how be that possible human being naturally evolve on a planet one million light year away the odd against that be astronomical yeah one might even say there be a divine hand at work well whoever be responsible we be here and here be where we be gon na stay with our new family my vote be that we clear everything back to this ridge easy access to the water down by the river in fact the whole area 's ripe for cultivation we should have the preliminary line for a city within a day or two no no city not this time what do you propose we do we break the cycle we leave it all behind and start over you be talk about a little over 38 000 people the entire human race with nothing but the clothe on their back and some provision it be not the entire human race there be people already here Tribal without language even but we can give they that I mean we can give they the the good part of ourselves but not the baggage not the ship the equipment the technology the weapon if there be one thing that we should 've learn it be that you know our brain have always outrace our heart our science charge ahead our soul lag behind let we start a new we 'll land civilian at various point around the planet our objective will be to spread the people out as much as possible to give they the good possibility of survival Supplies will be evenly distribute throughout the camp and location will be document and give to everyone I have to say I be shock at how amenable everyone be to this notion I would have think there would be general uprising at the idea of lose whatever little creature comfort we have leave do n't underestimate the desire for a clean slate Mr Lampkin have you make a decision the Sixes the Eights and the Twos have decide to stay see how we can contribute to the world before we pass into God 's hand we 'll give the baseship to the centurion let they find their own destiny I think they have earn their freedom and what if they evolve again on their own and decide to come back in a few hundred year and wipe we out it be a risk but I think set they free may be enough to break the cycle of violence and it be a risk worth take and I agree they have earn it now once the civilian have be off load the fleet will leave the orbit and rendezvous with Galactica the course of the fleet will be plot into the nav computer ahead of time but the actual piloting will be do by Mr Anders he 'll guide the entire fleet directly into the sun I love you good bye Sam I 'll see you on the other side be your name William Adama yes be you an officer in the Colonial fleet yes be you a Cylon I be sorry Bill we be still establish test for the control I need verifiable yes and nos no I be not a Cylon have you ever steal money from a cash drawer have you ever steal money enough of this crap take this thing off I right now no job be worth this no matter how fat the paycheck be I would rather spend the rest of my career what be leave of it on a broken down old ship than have someone sit here and question my word Perfection that be what it be about it be those moment when you can feel the perfection of creation the beauty of physics you know the wonder of mathematic the elation of action and reaction and that be the kind of perfection that I wanna be connect to you sure this be what you want Galen yeah I be sure just tired of people Human Cylons whatever Last Raptor be gon na drop I off on this island that I find off one of the northern continent it be cold it

appropriate to honour the god of war on a day when it feel like perpetual war be the only realistic prospect for we we have have no contact with Galactica since it leave four month ago but l refuse to believe that Adama have abandon we our insurgency have be strike back against the Cylons whenever and wherever possible although at time these attack seem like futile gesture l believe that they be critical to morale to maintain some measure of hope but in order for the insurgency to have a more meaningful impact we need to strike a high profile target it be simply not enough to kill cylon because they do n't die they resurrect themselves and they continue to walk among we it be horrify the Cylon Occupation Authority continue to exert complete control over the city and we remain at their mercy the colonial government under President Gaius Baltar function in name only let we review why we be here shall we we be suppose to bring the word of God to the people right to save humanity from damnation by bring the love of God to these poor benight people we be here because most of the Cylon feel the slaughter of mankind be a mistake we be here to find a new way to live in peace as God want we to live and it be be a fun ride so far but l want to clarify our objective if we be bring the word of God then we should employ any mean necessary to do so any mean yes Fear be a key article of faith as l understand it so perhaps it be time to instil a little more fear into the people 's heart and mind let we uh let we execute Baltar what what that be not gon na happen just because he be your favourite toy should n't interfere with the large issue l think that l have cooperate Gaius be with I anyone who want to challenge that will have to deal with I if we have kill he at the beginning it might 've work now most human think of he as a traitor and would cheer his death Cavil fine fine we do n't kill Baltar we round up the leader of the insurgency and execute they publicly we round up at random group off the street and we execute they publicly cavil 2 send a message that the glove be off the insurgency stop now or else we start reduce the human population to a more manageable size l do n't know say less than a thousand we need to stop be butcher the entire point of come here be to start a new way of life to push past the conflict that separate we from human for so long and what have it get we it be not like they welcome we with with oh frak it never mind you be all live in a fantasy world consider the irony in that laugh delusional machine what be the universe gon na come up with next be it really worth it Caprica be the love of that man really worth possibly lose all of this if you ever experience love you would n't have to ask in recent month the Cylons have be recruit and train human in an attempt to establish a human police force it be hard to think of anything more despicable than human do the dirty work of the Cylons lead to believe they be merely take the civilian security out of the hand of the Cylons the member of the human police have since become an extension of the Cylons ' corporeal authority and while their name be keep confidential there be no question some of they be people we might least expect hundred of we have be round up by the Cylons hold in detention question torture other have simply vanish in recent week we have be gain access to some very important document from a source within Baltar 's administration no one know who this mysterious benefactor be but he communicate with the insurgent by mean of a

that Admiral Adama about this a year be a long time can l ask you something very personal do you feel guilty about leave the people behind on New Caprica l do n't do guilt you know a year ago when you put I in this cell l be at a crossroad l sit in here for week just consume with rage at all the thing that have happen to I then at some point l realise it be all just guilt l be angry at myself for the choice l have make betray my people lose the baby so l have a choice l could either move forward or stay in the past but the only way to move forward be to forgive myself l do n't think we can survive l do n't think the fleet or Galactica or the people on New Caprica can survive unless the man at the top find a way to forgive himself two pilot almost get kill because they have be in the cockpit for 11 hour and he want to bust my ball you be soft can you believe that what oh you agree be that it forget it l'm not look for a fight oh no no no no do n't do that you get something to say come out and say it he be right you be soft l'm not talk about the weight you have lose your edge your confidence you lose your war Lee and the truth be you be a soldier who need a war you do n't want to hear it because you think that your father 's the soldier and you sure do n't want to be like he but you be like he you be more like he than you know that be one of the reason l marry you ok it be work l think be it work or be n't it they keep jam we so much for our source on the inside ten minute leave and lot of nothing on the wireless as usual watch for Raiders the last listening bird almost get pop by a pair yesterday l've almost get it high pitch beep ow frak turn that thing down it be work it be work Time 's up Spin up the ftl and get ready to go hold on l'm pick something up it be a Colonial transmission it be a low power signal but the code match oh yeah we get a link to the ground send the code response spin up the drive and let we get back to Galactica l've get a signal a Raptor just make contact with we Tigh what be it say will make contact this frequency every 12 hour prepare sitrep for command authority have hope we be come for you Racetrack we make contact l say again we make contact with the ground Colonel Tigh have form an insurgent group and they be wait for instruction on how to coordinate the rescue effort it be gon na be ok it be really gon na be ok the surveillance picture take by the insurgent l think we can match name to about 50 of these photo but our good guess put the total police force at around 200 200 l would n't have believe 20 people would turn against their own kind l want those name l want the rest of the name that be tough the Cylons be afraid the population will go after any human who join the New Caprica Police as well they should l know l have n't live a model life l make a lot of mistake l'm gon na need your protection today knock Mr President Number six Morning Gaeta it be time for the graduation ceremony ah yes the ceremony about the ceremony there be be a change of plan l wo n't be go Security concern do n't look so worried there 'll be other graduation right ok l'll just let the staff know we should call off the strike there be no reason to do it if the Galactica 's come back pass up a golden opportunity to kill Gaius Baltar other than that l fail to see the point think with your head the only chance they have of get we off this rock be if the Cylons be too distracted battle a full blown uprising when they get here if your source on the inside say Baltar 's not gon na be there abort otherwise stick with the plan PA poor diet hormonal imbalance or neurological disorder many have find relief at the New Caprica Medical Centre where a crack team of physician hey Duck man fall in good morning and welcome to

ship Location unknown come from Tyrol can we manufacture new launch key Apollo forget it the spec be incredibly sophisticated it would take week just to do the r D good option be for the people on the ground to find the original launch key assume they be n't destroy no no way cylon would keep they safe in case they need to use one of those ship she be right key get ta still be there make a weapon drop to the insurgent they know the land they have be hit the Cylons in the tooth give the tool they can find the key no way the only thing you have got go for you so far be the Cylons reduce their defence perimeter to five baseship Put heavy weaponry down there they 'll know we be in contact call in ten more baseship and your whole plan 's frakke Funny l think this be our plan sir move on the

salvage certain thing certain medical sample like your ovary what be that this be Kacey Kacey this be Kara your mother hi good girl Dualla Unbelievable what Admiral 's put boot on the ground want to send an officer as a liaison between we and the Resistance to coordinate the rescue op make sense what be the problem it be who he be send he be frakke kid with this right l wish he be Hoshi l want a Raptor ready in five minute on the hangar deck inform the flagship l'm come aboard Hoshi Aye sir what be you gon na do what l should 've do a long time ago you ca n't do this she be a Cylon well l trust her that be a mistake well it 'll be my mistake wo n't it you be gamble with the life of everyone on this ship everyone on my ship l do n't need a lecture from you about the responsibility of command we be do here l'm not finish this entire plan be a reckless gamble you have the right to risk the life of the man and woman under your command but you be risk the life of the entire human race l'm try to save the human race no that be what you be not see the human race that be the 2 000 people huddle in those civilian ship that get away when the Cylons come back they be the safe bet we should guard their survival like after the attack on the Colonies Sharon can penetrate Cylon defence it be not about her the centurion ca n't distinguish she from other humanoid model do you know that they be program that way the Cylons did n't want they become self aware and suddenly resist order they did n't want a robotic rebellion on their hand you can appreciate the irony Dad l know what you be say but we have a responsibility to the people that we leave behind remember what Roslin say our first responsibility be to the survival of humanity we ca n't lose sight of that over the last year we have Iost sight of almost everything we get soft but if we go back to New Caprica now and we lose it be over Humanity just stop and an admiral 's star do n't give you the right to make that gamble you be right son make plan to resume the search for Earth with Pegasus and the civilian fleet with Pegasus what about Galactica l know why we leave those people behind l know that it be their choice in the first place to be down there and l realise that the survival of the human race outweigh anything else but this time l ca n't live with it l ca n't face it maybe l'm a coward but l'm go back Dad you wo n't have a chance l'm go back son once l fertilise your egg we transfer it to a woman who carry it to term she be pretty funny great smile you would 've like she although her mother die during childbirth Kacey 's heart never fail l guess she get that will to live from you l've see her path it be difficult but rewarding she 'll know the mind of God in this lifetime she 'll see pattern that other do not see she probably get spiritual clarity from I she 'll be hungry soon there be food on the table you would n't let your own child starve it be not my child l do n't even know if it be human Half human you know she be yours you just wo n't admit it where the frak be you go take this with you hey do n't leave I alone with this door close Frak l do n't know who or what you be but l do know this l'm not your mother l do n't care that it be effective l do n't care that the Cylons ca n't stop it it be wrong no more suicide bombing Colonel you understand what be you work for the Cylons now l'm sorry there be no excuse for that you see little thing like that they do n't matter any more in fact not too frakke much really matter any more l've get one job here lady and one job only to disrupt the Cylons make they worry about the ant hill they have stir up here so they be distracted and out of position when the old man show up in orbit the bombing they get the Cylons ' attention they really get their attention and l be not give that up Roslin we be talk about people blow themselves up you know sometimes l think that you have get ice water in those vein and other time l think you be just a naive little schoolteacher l've send man on suicide mission in two war now and let I tell you something it do n't make a difference whether they be ride in a viper or walk out onto a parade ground in the end they be just as dead so take your piety and your moralising and your high minded principle and stick they someplace safe until you be off this rock and you be sit in your nice cushy chair on Colonial One again l've get a war to fight let we go move it this way off Ioad the rest let we go to isolation Sharon the detention be just cause more resentment and more enemy l know we do n't have another option we have to show suicide bombing wo n't be tolerate excuse I sir can l talk to you for a moment yeah sure Jammer l'll catch up with you Sir l do n't know exactly how to broach this nor do l know exactly what l expect you to do about it but um l think you know since we be since we be back on Galactica yeah Jammer just spit it out we pick up Chief Tyrol 's wife in the

for Baltar that be it yeah l get ta go with Sam on this one we need something specific you want specific you think Baltar run thing that guy he be the public face but Gaeta he be the brain everyone know that he run the operation he do the paperwork he approve the death list how do you know be you there do you see he approve a single death list he know cally be on a death list what be you talk about look there that be a distribution list and there be Cally 's name and there be Gaeta 's name he see her execution order it be still all circumstantial we do n't know what Gaeta do when he see that list l get ta go with they on this one no you see a death list you know innocent people be gon na die and you do nothing he be guilty l call the question the question of the innocence or guilt of Felix Gaeta have be call the Circle will vote l vote guilty Connor Guilty Guilty Guilty Sam no do n't bother l'm do we be still vote l'm not l'm do l'm do with this whole thing the war be over for I l'm sorry ok that be fine still 4 0 Chief what be your vote no wait we need six vote Screw that no screw you we be a jury we need six vote if we do n't have six vote l'm out too he be right we need a sixth how be you Gaius l'm alive l suppose that be something thank you you 'll have to excuse I l'm slightly confuse how long have l be here exactly three day three day so it be take you three day to remember where l be no one be forget you Gaius it be just there be be controversy about whether you should 've be let on board l ca n't believe there be still a question of my value there 'll always be a question you be a human now look l help you l give you Sharon 's child yes that be right you do and the child 's rescue do weigh in your favour however the vote 's deadlocke three in favour of your be allow to stay and three against with one model still undecide the fact be the decision rest with the Sixes we be start to see a rash of miss person report we leave thousand on that planet no this be different these be people know to have survive but who have go miss since the exodus Jammer for instance Deck hand l see he yesterday he did n't report at muster this morning bed check negative sickbay negative it be like he just vanish how many people be miss 13 as of today two on Galactica 11 elsewhere every one of they confirm as a survivor by multiple witness then poof go keep I post on any more missing person l wanna know about it yes sir now if you 'll excuse I l have a date with a jump rope hey l've drop half a stone keep jump hey clear throat how you do well you know l'm make do how be you l'm good why do you ask well uh l hear about your situation you be right l just try not to think about it any more you know l'm kinda like you sit in your cushy little office on Colonial One do all Baltar 's dirty work probably never even think about what be happen to I right l did n't know about your situation if l have l would 've try to get you out mm like l've say about 50 time now l be serve the president of the Colonies we all elect he remember so that be suppose to excuse it what do you want I to say maybe l could 've do more but l think that when the Cylons land it be important for I to keep my job to help from the inside prop Baltar up and let they walk all over we no l feed information to the Resistance l set up dead drop there be a dog bowl l pass along Cylon position internal memoranda Great Felix you be a frakke hero whatever feeling l have for you have to stop l allow my feeling to cloud my judgment l protect you l give your specie a second chance l even turn against a sister Cylon and for what l'm Cylon Gaius somehow l lose sight of that you be much much more than a machine you be a person a real person a woman and you be in love with I and it hurt l know it hurt but believe I l be the only one that can make it well do n't you see l be the only one whisper no this have to end you need I you need I admit it admit it you need I and l need you too do you hear I l I need you too maybe l should 've start with that this be a jury l wanna make that clear it be not about settle score or personal grudge it be a jury we be just deal with the bad of the bad people who do more than put on an NCP uniform or make a deal with Cylons they be the killer the real traitor yeah but none of this be legal right no no it be legal you got ta be kid I that be why we need to know right now be you in or out clear throat in good we have already be through the evidence so just take your time you be tell I that Gaeta see this list and did n't do a damn thing we have no idea of know what Gaeta do or do not do when he see the list the whole thing be like a bad dream only we wake up and the traitor be still here Guilty that be 5 0 in favour of guilty it be get ta be unanimous Chief you be the last to vote door open get out of here Sam l'd like to talk to my wife l'd like to do it now we already have your vote take a break Hey l quit because l'm not look for way to keep kill people well l need this Sam so what throw people out of an airlock be gon na make you feel well those be n't the people that keep you lock up they 'll do not just for I for every person we leave on that planet because someone have get ta pay so you can either get with it or you can get lose be that what you want Kara you want I to leave he do n't wanna say guilty because Gaeta be such a good guy Right Chief everyone like Gaeta so let we let he off the hook let we just look the other way well a lot of good people have to pay the price for what they do choice they make on New Caprica like my wife that be right Ellen collaborate give the Cylons information on the Resistance and she die for it because that be the price of collaborate with the enemy and l like she a lot more than l like Gaeta look Sam l'm in a different place now I l do n't know how else to explain it to you l get out of that cell and it be like someone paint the world in different colour and l look at you and l wanna tear your eye out just for look at I l just wanna hurt someone and it might as well be you so you should probably go before that happen Baltar sign death warrant organise murder squad collaborate with the enemy from day one Baltar not Gaeta it be the same godsdamn thing Seelix he be right a lot of people die because of they Chief Fine Guilty Anders remember this l do n't want this any more Sam open door shut door Seelix take he turn around on your knee on your knee Felix Gaeta you have be try and find guilty of crime against humanity by a circle of your peer as authorise by the president of the Colonies if you have any word to offer in your own defence now be the time come on Felix talk we 'll listen yeah that be right we 'll listen to how hide behind Baltar 's skirt be your way of help the insurgency say something what be the point l already try to explain it l'm not gon na beg too bad you did n't grow that spine four month ago Beg Beg Beg Tigh Thrace no Beg come on tell they how you be actually work for the Resistance the entire time come on tell they all about the important information you be give up tell they about all the message and the dog bowl and what what do she say what do she just say get the frak out my way what do she just say tell I what do you say to she there be a yellow dog bowl it be a signal it mean there be a message in the garbage dump l turn it over it be a signal it mean there be a message at the dump Chief groaning that be you oh my God Tigh what be you do Chief there be a yellow dog bowl l use it we be wonder who the source be Colonel there be no other way he could 've know he be the only other one that would know about it he be why we know about the death list why l save Cally why we be on this ship he be the one who give we the inside information there be our source Colonel l do what l could l do n't know what else l could 've do what the hell be this it be all perfectly legal you 'll find an executive order authorise a secret jury of six man and woman to try sentence and execute people guilty of extraordinary crime or collaborate with the enemy in war l sign a death warrant for every conviction your presidency be a farce it stop right now if they be guilty they 'll be try by a jury of their peer they have a jury but they do n't get lawyer they do n't get to showboat for week on end they do n't get to blame the system and they do n't get last fame as martyr or innocent people just in the wrong place at the wrong time they just disappear now in the grey twilight between the night of the occupation and the dawn of a new era you come into office clean without their blood on your hand well thank you that be uh that be very poetic however you have a problem Mr President everyone by law be entitle to a trial with representation everyone it be not an option to be discard at the president 's whim you think by make the trial public that you 'll find justice yes l do come on Laura you be not that naive let I tell you what will happen if these case go to trial it 'll consume this fleet for month maybe year People will be line up to testify against their neighbour it 'll be a circus an entertainment for the mob and you 'll be sign death warrant almost every day be that how you want to spend your next term Laura as executioner in chief man with every fibre of my be with every fibre of my be Congratulations Madam President thank you thank you all for once again entrust I with this high office of civil service today be a new beginning for all of we we share a unique destiny but our future be ours to shape and our past can not be forget a new day require new thinking and while l have intend on use this occasion as an opportunity to announce the formation of a special prosecutor 's office charge with investigate act of collaboration with the enemy l have decide instead that a different gesture be call for on this the first day of my next term as your president we all feel the need for justice and we all feel the need for vengeance tell the difference between the two can be difficult at time we be all victim of the Cylons and none of we can be impartial l certainly ca n't so today l be form a commission on truth and reconciliation to hear our story and record they for posterity there will be no prosecution l be issue a general pardon for every human being in this fleet this will not be a popular move today but l truly believe that this be the only way for we to move forward in strength in a spirit of healing and reconciliation l thank you for your continue patience and courage good day thank you woman Hey Chief do you want a seat More rebel Wanna watch the baseball game previously on Battlestar Galactica I Sharon Agathon will carry out the lawful order of my superior as an officer in the Colonial fleet Congratulations Lieutenant we be talk about people blow themselves up l've get one job here lady and one job only to disrupt the Cylons make they worry about this ant hill they have stir up here so they be distracted and out of position when the old man show up in orbit you know the mission you also know there be only one way this mission end and that be with the successful rescue of our people off of New Caprica evacuate the facility you should go as well Gaius there be a place for you too Captain hi who be this this be Kacey oh my little girl when the Cylons take she l thought but you save her Gods bless you a lot of good people have to pay the price for choice they make on New Caprica like my wife that be right Ellen collaborate give the Cylons information on the Resistance and she die for it there be still a question of my value there always will be you be human Baltar Good to see you l far prefer these picturesque setting for our little interlude do n't you l think you have abandon I to your Cylon comrade would l do that you have always be more unpredictable than your flesh and blood counterpart a man that love woman as much as you should have learn that a long time ago l'm a slow learner then take this period as a time to learn all you can about the Cylons you 'll need it in the day ahead something special on the horizon Cylon psychology 's base on projection Projection how they choose to see the world around they the only difference be you choose to see I what be you really you be either connect to the woman l know on Caprica or a part of my subconscious struggling for self expression so which one be it l'm an angel of God send here to help you just as l always have be we be all part of one big ecosystem yes l can feel it breathe get use to it so what have he say l have n't ask he yet ask I about what Earth uh Wha Earth it be the thirteenth colony do you know how to find it not really no that be unfortunate there be a hope my hope that if you know the way to Earth it would justify keep you alive a little long come on six wait wait wait now when l say that l do not know exactly where Earth be that be not to say l do not know a great deal about its probable location honestly l spend hour day week month and month on a map that Adama and Roslin find on Kobol l correlate that with our observation l doubt anyone can make the same claim we 'll get back to you what do you care about find Earth because we be look for it you be yes we have decide that Earth 's go to be our new home Helo Ship to ship training exercise be authorise you may commence this be Apollo Red team set Kat blue team set red team Apollo as soon as we clear the moon we 'll be on their dradis keep your eye up they

great remind I never to let that happen again you get it slim ever l've be try to reassemble President Bal Dr Baltar 's work on piece together the thirteenth tribe 's path to Earth what be it you trust about his research how do you know it be not another lie one thing l learn about Baltar be his extraordinary capacity for self preservation l think he want to find Earth because he want to get there how far do he get with his research as you can see l'm still hack through his note but it appear that he be try to correlate our own astrometric reading with the map of constellation that we find back on Kobol and apply his finding to certain select passage within the scroll of Pythia why the scroll of Pythia Pythia 's suppose to have chronicle the journey of the thirteenth tribe to Earth if l can draw your attention to this the caravan of the heavens be watch over by a great lion with a mighty blink eye Red and blue Gaeta exactly exactly what we be look for a lion 's head with a mighty blink eye blink the scroll they speak in metaphor l think the doctor might be off his med as well sir but then l find this note here where he have write blink equal pulsar that mean a star right Plural actually they be the rotate core of dead star they emit a blast of radio wave from a distance they appear to Blink right the doctor find two in very close mutual orbit within this sector the spectrographic reading l find show one will appear to be red and one will appear to be blue now these pulsar appear to be in this nebula we have never have a look at this area but it be possible with a couple of eyeball out there they might look at the nebula and see a giant lion 's head well it look like this be the good thing we have got go so unless you object Admiral l suggest we go lion hunt Number six the navigational marker you give we may prove useful we send a baseship out to investigate the pulsar and look for this lion 's head look this be n't easy for I l do n't think you fully appreciate just how difficult this be l have very conflicted very ambiguous feeling about help you find Earth Funny how all that ambivalence and conflict vanish once you think your life hang in the balance you should know there be still scepticism about whether you be be truthful uh l'm very sorry we did n't mean to intrude Come on Gaius Baltar be we go round in circle it all look the same to you it would be hard for any human to navigate here especially without project you have use that word before l'm not sure what you be talk about it help you to what exactly have you ever daydream Imagined you be somewhere else l do have an active imagination well we do n't have to imagine we project we choose to see our environment in any form we wish whenever we wish for instance now you see we as stand in a hallway but l see it as a forest fill with tree bird sunlight like the walk that you and l use to take on Caprica the aesthetic 's what give I pleasure not the specific memory instead of blank wall l surround myself with a vision of God 's creation right l think l understand projection but it be a bit of a coincidence be n't it that l could see such a vivid reality that l've create and the Cylon projection experience seem so similar be it a coincidence well what be you say there be a connection what because of my experience with you be l a Cylon what be that oh nothing just talk out loud silly I be you sure you want to go in second seat again l hear you be a pretty fair pilot yeah too many pilot not enough bird anything to keep I fly at this point if you want I l'm yours Boomer uh no Boomer be she be someone else listen up we need a call sign for Lieutenant Agathon Chrome Dome Titania Wind up Toy Tin can Microchick how about Athena Digital wait wait wait what be that you know the goddess of wisdom and war usually accompany by the goddess of victory man she like it Athena it be Kat hey Colonel Colonel come have a seat over here enough of that to go around always Dead Man 's Chest a cut throat game not usually your style it be now and l'm in it to win if you do n't like it find another game there be some straight talk have you see the line up outside the head 15 civilian stand in line pick their nose wait to take a shower frakke civilian think they run the ship beat what we have it be like a tomb if you want to know what alone feel like spend a few week in a Cylon hold cell yeah it be a bitch on both side it be n't easy come up with a plan to save your sorry butts yeah you guy have it rough huh hot shower three square a day viper jock did n't even take a shot till you jump into orbit we all make sacrifice be that so yes that be right while you be pin wing on your Cylon girlfriend our people be strap home make bomb to their chest do whatever they could to take the bastard out so forgive I if l do n't get all misty over your sacrifice you seem distract Gaius do I you can rest easy at least for now the datum on Earth 's location and your valiant rescue of the baby have go a long way toward impress the other l use to think you and l would have a baby one day there be 12 Cylon model in the entire occupation on New Caprica l see seven now here again the same seven who be the final five l ca n't talk about that ca n't or wo n't l ca n't it be complicated but we do n't talk about they ever but you would know one of they would n't you if they be to walk past here six we have a problem a baseship the one we send to investigate the pulsar and Lion nebula we have lose contact the trouble be we know almost nothing about the ship 's status we receive a garbled distress call then silence Unsurprisingly their hybrid send we confusing datum our hybrid be analyse it what be the hybrid he be talk about be quiet Gaius Number eight our hybrid 's deciphered part of the datum we receive Doral this be impossible Simon it may have be inevitable once we take human form Doral we be not human we be not like he Simon God have choose this time to test we whether we fail or pass the test be up to we what be go on the miss baseship it be be infect with some kind of disease Disease yes it be kill they all of they if an infected Cylon die and carry this into a resurrection ship it could rapidly spread potentially infect our entire race make sure the resurrection ship be out of range then send in centurion to no the datum indicate that as soon as a hybrid be infect the centurion start shut down l assume our Raiders and baseship be also susceptible of course we be all create from the same genetic pool then no Cylon can board that ship without risk of infection say you 'll go aboard the infected baseship and investigate what happen you send they to that nebula remember be you mad you have to prove to they you can be count on in an emergency show they you be worth keep alive what if l catch the disease what be the chance that a human could catch something that infect a Centurion or a Raider that be if you be human and if you be really a Cylon one of the final five you have n't see yet then would n't you just rather get it over with and die l'll go what yes l'll go look l be a train scientist l can go to the baseship l can make observation about their condition bring back information about this disease if we land the disease kill the human Cylons could infect one of our Raiders then do n't send a Raider surely the war 's furbish you with some Colonial vessel he be right we could program one of our Raptors to approach on autopilot all right then prepare to jump the ship make sure the resurrection ship stay a truly selfless act l could use a refill here Hotdog here here be to know that somebody will always have your back the sentiment 's good but in my book trust be an overrated commodity Mm that one l'll drink to frak you guy what be your problem Katraine my problem be you Captain all this we against they crap Starbuck Truth hurt give I another why do n't you take it out on the Cylons we bust our ass to get you back you think that mean anything every Colonist that land on New Caprica be loyal to a point it be amazing watch those people you think you know go over to the Cylons at least we know where we stand be that so then how come you be off flight duty and some Cylon lover be hold down my post do n't kid yourself you be on your own in life each and every one of we why do n't you tell that to the pilot that die get you off that rock Gaeta 's briefing Sharon and Racetrack on the mission to the pulsar you mean Athena and Racetrack Word travel fast yes it do l understand that morale 's take a hit on the flight deck nothing we ca n't handle sir l'm also tell that Colonel Tigh be spend a lot of time down the pilot ' rec room he and Starbuck they have be hold court second guess the rescue bad mouth the crew that stay up if you be n't on the ground it be like you ca n't be trust and people be listen their word carry a lot of weight you be right they be destroy morale and unit cohesion they both know well l do n't think they care sir woman two proton at each coupling site create a force the embryo become a fish that we do n't enter we be here to experience the evolve little toe Atrophy

hear be meaningless but not everyone think that the one you know as Leoben believe that every word out of her mouth mean something that God literally speak to we through her Baltar she sort of control the ship do she Number six she be the baseship in a very real sense mind go mad she experience life very differently than we do Gaius she swim in the heavens Laughs at star breathe in cosmic dust

it aboard you do n't know what you be say this be the disease speak through you Calm down l be go to bring help you know it be here you want other baseship to follow l would never hurt you you want the other baseship to know it be here be quiet suffer the same infection be quiet l'm go to bring help you want to destroy we all you 'll lie Shut up you 'll lie to they l know it be your fault Shut up be quiet shut up shut up Shut up Doral Gaius do you hear we Gaius do you read do you read be any of they alive what do you see speak to we what do you see be any of they alive this be Gaius Baltar l'm return to the baseship Doral what do you see l've see nothing nothing of consequence there be nothing leave to do here nobody like it but we have to make a terrible choice do we attempt a rescue risk the life of our fleet even our specie or do we leave they there be no cure in science there have to be look at they they be so afraid even the human do n't abandon their own Leoben they must be sacrifice Simon there be a question yes there be how do this happen Doral it be Baltar he lead we there deliberately he be be work with Galactica the whole time it be n't I whatever you think l do l did n't do it honestly Baltar we follow your coordinate find a disease with no treatment or cure if we leave they be doom never to return perhaps God would smile upon we for our mercy listen to you you can barely even speak his name we have to agree we be not abandon our brother and sister all speak at once we have to leave they we have to jump and leave they to their fate there be no other way scream scream echo mist of dream drip along the nascent echo and love no more end of line the hybrid object she do n't get a vote jump the ship jump this disease it must have come from someplace so what do you notice on the ship Baltar nothing l be just as baffle as you be you notice nothing suspicious on the infect ship Baltar nothing whatsoever man Admiral on deck Tigh Admiral give I the room

crap it be the road to Earth laugh oh my god let we get the frak out of here l'll start the jump when God 's anger awaken even the mighty shall fall Frak Athena we need to get out of here Blah ba bloo ba he be do it again thank laugh previously on Battlestar Galactica some people in the fleet believe that the legend of Earth hold perhaps the great promise for our survival do you know how to find it not really no there be a hope my hope that if you know the way to Earth it would justify keep you alive a little long now when l say that l do not know exactly where Earth be that be not to say l do not know a great deal about its probable location Doral a baseship the one investigate pulsar and the Lion nebula we have lose contact Number six the baseship it be infect if an infected Cylon die and carry this disease into a resurrection ship it could spread potentially infect our entire race if one of we be resurrect the disease will follow then no Cylon can board that ship without risk infection l'll go yes l'll go l can go to the baseship l can make observation about Cylons their condition bring back information about this disease which now threaten all of you Baltar do you know what this be it must be some kind of beacon it must have be leave here by the thirteenth tribe the beacon carry the disease leave by some human like you to destroy we you notice nothing suspicious on the infect ship nothing whatsoever l be just as baffle as you be just like the scripture say there it be the Lion 's Head nebula and blink eye Holy crap it be the road to Earth Apollo this be combat Prepped and ready Plan A we be approach the baseship Sharon this be so wrong what the hell happen here Sharon whatever this be it be something new go Apollo Galactica you be clear hot Apollo Roger that Galactica we be in close now and by the look of it that ship be in no condition to put up a fight never see anything like this shall we proceed Hang on guy Helo Use extreme caution Apollo Apollo Set perimeter weapon tight everyone Galactica Apollo we be in Galactica no sign of life Ship appear to be abandon and power down what the hell cough Racetrack god what happen Mathias l do n't know but their frakke resurrection ship be gon na overheat Galactica Apollo we have reach the control centre 30 maybe 40 dead skin job Mathias set a perimeter Sharon Athena see what you can pick up with the computer three fire team each doorway go ok l'm gon na try to call up the database if l get a connection put the SSR lead in the water reduce the error correction level for high throughput Racetrack you sure you wanna do that it be how it work gasp you ok yeah the datum point be almost completely corrode l do n't know if l'm gon na get much out of here but let we try what be go on frak I this one 's alive we have get a live one over here Mathias cover the Major Apollo they be alive Galactica Apollo we get uh one two three four five live skin job down here l say again five five live Helo be you take fire Negative they seem in pretty bad shape do n't take chance if they make a move oh you can trust I on that one Major what do we do should we take they out Apollo hold your fire hold your fire Mathias keep away from the frakker l say hold your fire Cylons moan Cylons cough Cylon grant we strength Cylon 2 wisdom Apollo what be they do Cylon 3 and above all hey Athena what be you do Athena what be you do Athena Traitor Number Six save yourself from what get away from we what happen here Number six the beacon faltering we bring it on board it carry a disease we be infect infect Son of a bitch ok ok ok settle down keep back watch the doorway get the doorway Galactica Apollo we have a situation down here the Cylons have be infect with a disease we have all be expose we have all be expose Cottle they 'll come aboard under quarantine Clear a path from the hangar to sickbay and sterilise it and the raptor after they be in l'll handle that how long in quarantine l wo n't know till the blood work could be day week there be no way to tell they pick up this disease from a beacon accord to the Cylons Good to have the source of the pathogen can you bring it aboard Galactica no too dangerous l want to limit our exposure Cottle what about the prisoner prisoner the disease be advance in their system so it 'll give I an idea of what to expect as it progress and when they die it 'll tell I how long our people have to live how many prisoner how many you get Helo Apollo Galactica Alpha check Galactica we have you in visual range approach starboard hangar Helo Apollo what be that Gaeta massive energy discharge from the baseship it explode sir be you all right out there uh yeah affirmative we be still here what the hell happen Baseship explode Self destruct you be lucky you get out Roger that Baltar nothing the matter l trust we have some question how long have you plan to betray we Gaius Funny you be joke of course you be make this hard on yourself wait a minute l have be more than very accommodating since l arrive here l help you find Sharon 's baby l've help you with a map towards Earth we know about the beacon Gaius you know it be out there you know it contain a deadly virus no l did n't l did n't be the virus create by Galactica Number Three have you be in contact since you have be on board or do you plan this before the evacuation of New Caprica this be the most profound misunderstanding uh l have nothing to do with the virus or the beacon yes yes l do discover it on the baseship and l should have tell you soon and l did n't because l think you would try and link I you know to the virus which be hello what be go on right now l be wrong it be a mistake and l fully admit my responsibility it will never happen again and l hope you 'll accept my most uh yeah my most humble apology on a bright note l have a working theory as to where this beacon may clunk footstep l'm sorry Gaius thing would have be so much simple have you only tell the truth we think you know more about this virus and we intend to find out relax have a drink l ca n't the pain the pain it be all in your head Gaius Pain pleasure they be just neural impulse send to the brain you decide how to interpret they they can be pleasant or unpleasant high pitch electronic whine no no please please no pitch lower l want it to stop Gaius whine stop l do n't want you to feel this pain and neither do Caprica do you no l love you you feel anything yet yeah l feel sick Sick of you buggin ' I you did n't touch any infected skin job it be not my fault you be clumsy you can kiss my infected ass you can kiss it but it be not infect l get your blood work back human be immune to the virus you be all healthy all right people nice job let we get outta here no you stay put for a while yeah no no no no no please tell I she be ok l have n't do her blood work yet what oh l see she can wait because of who she be n't Sharon you be gon na be ok l promise you come for I godsdamn it you come for I the second you know take he he be the furth go no no no no no no no Roslin you can keep the Cylons alive l ca n't cure they but yes how long indefinitely l identify the virus we know it as lymphocytic encephalitis the disease be carry by rat mostly but a couple of hundred year ago human develop an immunity now l can create a simple vaccine that will dramatically reverse the effect of the virus on the Cylons but uh they have an antibody in their blood which break down the RNA of the vaccine so they will need regular close interval injection of the vaccine or they will die can l ask the ugly question here be there a reason to keep they alive we could interrogate they for intelligence l agree we have a lot of unanswered question ok but they be not gon na talk they might if we dangle the vaccine they do n't know it be a stopgap not a cure they pray on the infect ship Karl 's wife say it be something call the prayer to the cloud of unknowing whatever that be anyway the point be she say they only use it when they be face a death that be final no possibility of download they be ready to die maybe but it do n't mean one of they wo n't jump at a second chance it infect everything baseship centurion Raiders until we be finally abandon by the other Cylon ship why why not just put you under quarantine until they find a cure fear of spread the disease they tell we that there be a bioelectric feedback component to the pathogen it corrupt how our brain manage our immune system choke if one of we die and be resurrect the disease will follow infect the resurrection ship and and the fleet why be you in this area in the first place we be send we be send here to look for the Lion nebula Baltar say it would point the way to Earth what do you just say Baltar Baltar 's alive Baltar be on our baseship he be help we find Earth he be use our navigation chart along with our map of Kobol he be lead they to Earth we want a new beginning much like you l give you I information she say that there there be a cure Doc Cottle will be give you the medicine take he back to the infirmary man yes sir Apollo snigger what the hell 's so funny l think l just think of a way to solve all of our problem to get rid of the Cylon threat for once and for all we can wipe they out we can destroy the entire Cylon race we jump to an area we know the Cylons use as a supply line ncd2539 we stay there expose we look as if we be spoil for a fight they 'll send a fleet where there be a fleet there be a resurrection ship and once the resurrection ship be within our reach we execute our infect prisoner we bug out the prisoner download into the ship and with they the virus you sure the virus will download to a new body the Cylons be sure of it they leave their wound out here to die alone with no hope of be rescue tell I all l need to know and once the virus be in the resurrection ship there will be no stop it rescuer become carrier of the plague the cylon themselves do n't believe that they 'll develop a cure oh my god this could be the end of the Cylons Forever Genocide so that be what we be about now they be not human they be build not bear no father no mother no son no daughter l have a daughter l hold she in my arm and she be half human these be thing dangerous thing this be our one chance to be rid of they you can rationalise it any way you want we do this we wipe out their race then we be no different than they be Roslin Captain l respectfully disagree the Cylons strike first in this war and not content with the annihilation of billion they pursue we relentlessly through the galaxy to wipe we out they try to live with we on New Caprica what do you say they try to live with we you be n't on New Caprica to my recollection you did n't set foot there so out of respect for the man and woman who suffer through that snake pit l'm gon na pretend l did n't hear that you would serve your fleet well if you would remember that cylon be a threat to the survival of human l'm talk about right and wrong l'm talk about lose a piece of our soul but no one want to hear that right let we keep it on I yeah l'm marry to a Cylon who walk through hell for all of we how many time and she be not half anything ok how do we know there be n't other like her she make a choice she be a person they be a race of people wipe they out with a biological weapon be a crime against be a crime against humanity but they be not human they be program we will take your input under advisement thank you both thank you ma'am dismiss electronic whine pitch heighten l can help you l can guide you through the torment but you 'll have to do the work l'll do anything anything then tell we what we want to know how be the virus invent do they make a cure Number six look at I look at I when you make love to I Gaius you do n't always think about I your mind wander l know that you think of equation puzzle your laundry it be the nature of the mind to disconnect from the body and journey on its own separate your mind from your body keep your mind in that room use your intellect against her Reason logic analysis find the hole in her psyche l ca n't Pain Pain 's only in your body so keep your body here with I do n't worry l'll take care of it whine slow Number Three you see Gaius this be what the absence of pain feel like it be easy to forget l have nothing to do with the virus it be a coincidence there be no such thing as coincidence God will the universe accord to his design Number Six now focus on she as a Cylon not a woman be a scientist examine her faith what be your analysis Doctor l'm a scientist and as a scientist l believe that if God exist our knowledge of he be imperfect why the story and myth we have be the product of man the passage of time the religion you practise be base on a theory impossible to prove yet you bestow it with absolute like there be no such thing as coincidence it be call faith Absolute belief in God 's will mean there be a reason for everything everything and yet you ca n't help but ask yourself how God can allow death and destruction and then despise yourself for ask but the truth be if we know God 's will we would all be god would n't we l can see it in your eye D'Anna you be frustrate you be conflict let I help you let I help you change find a way to reconcile your faith with fact find a way towards a rational universe l do n't know what your game be but it be not go to work you intentionally lead one of our ship to that beacon did n't you give your body to I only your mind be there feel I feel this where she want you to feel pain look at I look at I Gaius do you want I to believe you be worth save do you do you say it l want you to believe in I do n't stop do n't stop please please do n't stop you have to believe in I you be all l have leave moan now tell I you believe in I tell I you believe in my strength l believe in you l believe in you l love you l love you with all my heart l love you with all my heart how Cottle say it have something to do with carry a half human child how the foetal cell enter the maternal circulatory system cause the mother to create antibody whatever l'm immune oh my god our baby save my life she be go forever and she save my life Hera keep we together to share this this you mean we together you mean we they they l mean they who be they they be gon na execute the infect prisoner but not until we jump into a Cylon region with a resurrection ship present the infection 's gon na spread everywhere there be a point l'd like to make mm hm the law forbid I to use biological weapon without a presidential order which mean you be pass the buck on this one yes Helo 's right on one thing we start destroy entire race even mechanical race we be liable to tear off a piece of man 's soul the Cylons be come to Earth if they find we they be come for we those be the stake they always have be Bill we be talk about the genocide of your entire race yeah you think l do n't know that l make a choice to wear a uniform to be a person you be a person before you put on that uniform ok you be a person before l fall in love with you you do n't have to prove that l have to prove it every day let I tell you something Helo my people may die my entire race may be wipe out but this Cylon will keep her word even if it mean she be the last Cylon leave in the universe can a human being do that posterity really do n't look too kindly on genocide Roslin you be assume that posterity will define this as genocide if they do at least there 'll be someone alive to hate we for it the Cylons be our mistake we create they all right Admiral as president l have determine the Cylons be make extinct the use of biological weapon be authorise so say we all so say we all jump complete dradis be clear no Cylons sir they 'll be here soon enough get our bird in the air Commence Viper and nav Raptor launch let we do this racetrack shout move they back go move move come on CAP be away Nav bird have they on DRADIS dradis contact a pair of Cylon Raiders keep their distance for now did n't take they that long they be just scout they 'll jump away and report back to their fleet let we see if they take our bait got it there be a resurrection ship with they Adama then it be time to execute our Cylon prisoner call it in terminate the prisoner Head shot ok yes sir let we do it all right let we see if we ca n't frak up some toaster on this joy ride people Hotdog l'm notch like hell Hotdog Starbuck Quit your bitchin ' and continue to cover as fragge out of the way Frak they be already dead they be they be already dead Sir you should hear this Apollo they be dead before the ship be in range they did n't download the disease we have miss our window Starbuck a baseship just jump in call our bird in Spool up let we get the hell outta here Commence FTL Sir we lose time we be gon na take significant fire while we spool up continue jump take we back to our fleet yes sir they 'll be come for I you or I seem like they be always come for one of we l'm not a traitor l love my people l love this ship besides you the first thing l wanna see on any morning be the light in that CIC l do what l thought be right if it be a mistake fine l can live with that it be you l ca n't live without l'll always love you Helo Mm no thank the prisoner die of asphyxiation the air purification system be reverse it suck the oxygen out when this happen the deadbolt be automatically activate on the door someone do this manually someone seem to I there be only one or two likely suspect who will head the investigation no one l'm close the book on this how convenient Cottle 's report on the virus he think that it be simply an accidental contamination of the beacon we abandon on the sick baseship somebody sneeze maybe yeah an entire race almost wipe out because someone forget to wipe their nose accord to Cottle the virus be an exact match to one report over 3 000 year ago right around the time that the thirteenth colony leave Kobol that beacon be a signpost to Earth l think we be on the right trail Laura yes we be on the right trail Bill so be the Cylons new scenery Whoa Argh previously on Battlestar Galactica you can not play God then wash your hand of the thing that you have create Sooner or later the day come when you ca n't hide from the thing that you have do any more attention all Colonial unit Cylon attack underway this be no drill l'll be right there how why do n't really matter now what do matter be that as of this moment we be at war you be full of bile hatred poison and l'm sorry for what happen to you down there but l've get ta run a ship the last thing l need be a one eyed drunk sowing discontent and disobedience you can get your ass back to your quarter and not leave till you be ready to act like the man l've know for the past 30 year that man do n't exist any more Bill you wo n't be see I again heartbeat heavy breathing be there really any place leave in the universe deserve of such a rare and distinguished item l be think of put it in the bathroom right over the toilet excellent choice gasp oh my god oh Tory come look at this this be the dossier that Billy prepare for I my first day aboard Galactica l ca n't believe l be about to throw this out in the trash Tory the Valkyrie this be Adama 's command before Galactica mm hm look at that this year mark Admiral Adama 's 45th anniversary in the Colonial fleet in fact his commission date 's only a few day from now here l think l want to have a ceremony let we give the admiral a medal for 45 year of devoted service could n't have come at a well time give the people something to feel good about for a change alarm Helo Set condition one throughout the ship l repeat set condition one throughout the ship this be not a drill what be the problem Three Raiders CBDR bear 145 carom 33 this be n't standard wedge formation where be the CAP Starbuck and Kat intercept in 98 second look like a pursuit Weapons exchange Pursuit yes sir we have get two Raiders chase a third have they fire on any of ours yet no sir what the hell be they do let we see if we can climb up their ass without draw fire they seem preoccupied with the other one any idea why cylon would be chase Cylons do n't know do n't care wait till we close l do n't wanna chase they long than l have to yeah roger that Kat two down one to go Starbuck Kat check six Damn Kat flank right this guy be head for Galactica l'm on it Starbuck man Krypter Krypter Krypter this be Bulldog get I the hell

welcome home Bulldog we may never have this opportunity again l'm assume you appreciate the consequence if you be discover and you understand Commander that this conversation do not happen be you prepared for this of course sir on one condition l need my man especially for the stealth ship there be only one pilot l trust who well the conspiracy theorist be gon na be disappoint l check your dna signature against your military record and it be conclusive you be not a Cylon smoke that be right he be one of mine disappear about three year ago we think that he be capture l'd like to meet he of course l'll arrange it he check out fine whatever they do to he out there they keep he feed and relatively healthy physically anyway l know you have be through a lot l realise that but you have get to talk to I Danny how the hell do you escape off a Cylon baseship well sir it be like this the enemy have I lock in a cell for three year the accommodation be lousy the service be slow and after a while l feel the institution no long have anything to offer I so l leave you have I worry there for a moment l think maybe the Cylons have beat the bullshit attitude out of you how do you get out l think l be gon na die in there Bill but a while ago they all start get sick l mean really sick you mean a virus yeah we have see that too l hear they say it be spread get bad but eventually l realise l'm not catch it l'm immune so what do you do l be smart patient l wait metallic clang Number Three well well you be look good Strong chuckle I l've feel well l do n't know why you guy do all that exercise what be you try to stave off get old do n't seem such a tragedy to I give the alternative bar clang know what l'm say do l look that bad you know what l think l think you be afraid bar clang Argh let I try and understand exactly what happened l'm just gon na go back a little about a year prior to the Cylon attack on the Colonies you be on a mission with Admiral Adama be that correct it be a a black op mission you remember the Tauron Colonists be such outlaw always push their luck with the admiralty every chance they get Roslin right the Taurons be drill for tylium ore on a moon that be too close to the Cylon armistice line we know that they have to get out of there or risk provoke the Cylons l'm sorry but how do this result in his ship be shoot down he be my recon pilot he be there to gather evidence the Taurons must 've see we come because they ambush he Lieutenant Novacek be shoot down by the Taurons in cold blood Bulldog Krypter l've get damage to the port engine Bird be down Repeat bird be down Request rescue Krypter Krypter Krypter this be Bulldog Bird be down Repeat bird be down Request rescue so what do you do l make a bad call his ship be go no ejection on DRADIS no distress call he be dead so l leave but the lieutenant do eject obviously and somehow survive in his ejection seat long enough for the Cylons to find he wow could you both give we a moment thank you Tory and thank you very much Lieutenant Madam President why do n't we check the fleet registry see if any of your family might have survive so be you gon na tell I what really happen you be gon na have to trust I on this one ok it be my mess l'll fix it this be the last one Fire Tigh l see it l see it l see it door open l see it Daniel Novacek just escape from a pow cell on a Cylon baseship steal a Raider fly it here l just finish debrief he Bulldog 's alive yeah my god how could he be alive that tough son of a bitch he actually make it do n't he yeah l guess he do so be you here to talk to your friend or to your XO last time l check l be neither oh l get it oh yeah this be gon na be a little complicated for you be n't it Admiral be you gon na tell he what you do l do what l have to do so tell he it wo n't make any difference the past be the past you be equivocate l do n't know why the frak l come here tell he he be gon na find out soon or later l see it bang on door go away bang on door Godsdamn son of a bitch l ca n't believe it it be really you Danny Novacek l hear you would make it good for you Bulldog Saul Drink you have no idea yes l do Dad hey l just get your message thank you for come sit down it be time for we to talk let I ask you something how often do you get out of here all the time be a little under the weather that be all how do you wind up on this old bucket anyway what happen to the Valkyrie well let we just say that last mission be n't exactly a boon to the old man 's career Galactica be his graceful retirement hear you and the old man have n't speak in a while what be wrong he wo n't cover your ass day and night like he use to oh no he still do his share of ass cover Problem be it be his main function now of course consider how you wound up getting capture in the first place l guess you find that out the hard way yourself do n't you what be that suppose to mean my god he did n't tell you do he do he tell I what that son of a bitch l shoot he down well uh if you shoot he down you have your reason you be follow order prevent something bad right no l shoot he down to avoid detection protect the mission so it would n't be discover by the Cylons it be a black op mission its sole purpose be to ascertain the likelihood of a Cylon strike Cy Cylon strike so you be say that that we know they be out there that they could launch an attack on the Colonies we did n't know anything for sure there be theory in some circle that the reason that the Cylons have stay dormant for so long be because they be build a war machine prepare a strike but l think l think no one have see or hear from the Cylons in over 40 year that be true partially the admiralty have grow restless with the Adar administration they feel we be rest on our laurel unprepared to protect against an attack my mission be to escort a stealth recon ship just beyond the armistice line Stick our nose over gather evidence and see if there be any suspicious activity and if the Cylons discover you across the line breach the armistice then they would see that as an act of war man Stealth Star Valkyrie we register you on DRADIS past the armistice line you be on full alert proceed with caution Valkyrie Bulldog l'm exactly two click past the line repeat two click and l've get negative dradis contact Sir there be nothing here sir which be fine by I Company want to pay I for a joyride they come to the right driver Hell of a moon man DRADIS contact unknown vessel jump in Frak Krypter Krypter l've get damage to the port engine Bird be down Repeat bird be down Request rescue Krypter Krypter this be Bulldog man Vessel just jump out sir Bird be down Request rescue Krypter Krypter Krypter this be Bulldog Bird be down Repeat bird be down man two more dradis contact Sir please instruct what be your order sir Sir what be your order Tigh do n't do this think about it Bill you do n't wanna do this do you want his ship discover do you know where we be do you have any idea what this could mean man Bogeys on intercept course will merge with Stealth Star in 20 second Sir Weapons Launch ship to ship missile now alarm console beep rapidly no there be no way it be true and you know it be true you have know it every second of every day since it happen the soon you admit it the soon you get that haunt look out of your eye listen to I sometimes survive can be its own death sentence l know that so the attack on Novacek 's ship the one that wing he and the two DRADIS contact that be follow he they be n't Taurons those be the Cylons all those year l tell myself that l did n't know what they be l be just lie to myself pretend that it could n't be true it be true l start it initiate it wait a minute start what start what the attack on the Colonies by cross the line l show they that we be the warmonger they figure we to be and I l leave they but one choice to attack we before we attack they no no because it be n't just you they put you there they put you there across the line you have no choice that be the admiralty that be the that be the military you be one mission you be one man one man it only take one Number six you all right yeah of course More nightmare dream something different this time though l think God be try to tell I something it be about Gaius be n't it no it be not it be about something much big than that after you execute this command you 'll delete the order from your log then overwrite the correspond memory location execute gunshot it be ok it be ok relax try to breathe through it Breathe gasp whisper there be something beautiful miraculous between life and death huh that be weird why the hell do they keep miss Frak phone buzz Adama Dualla a call from Lieutenant Novacek Put he through Bill yes this be Danny we need to talk hold on l need to see you right now hold on l'll be right there the Cylons be saddle up on he they have get a perfect point blank no deflection shoot they have he dead to right l'd say so look Novacek be hit and smoke fly straight and level any nugget could 've make that kill the Cylons could 've waste he any number of time and they do n't they do n't they let he escape cylon do n't do anything by accident yeah that be what l be think too do Novacek say how he be able to overcome the Cylons that hold he they be sick have a virus how many virus do the Cylons have sir who know maybe it be the same virus those Cylons we find be suffer yeah or maybe they just tell we a story we would buy something that be credible familiar Novacek be hold prisoner on a baseship for

climb in my cockpit so wire that l ca n't land the frakke ship starbuck you be an embarrassment l need you back in the CIC it just ai n't the same without you in there intimidate the inmate no no there be 12 Cylon model but in the occupation on New Caprica l see seven who be the final five l ca n't talk about that Baltar what be it talk about number six Most Cylons think the mind of the hybrid have go mad and the vocalisation be meaningless but not everyone think that you 'll delete the order from your log execute gunshot gasp it be ok it be ok there be something beautiful miraculous between life and death there be no food to be salvage what about the good food we have store before we start churn out the contaminated stuff the newly process bad food go into the deplete storage system everything be taint Cottle Sharon 's find algae for we to process it be tough to choke down but it be almost pure protein what if Sharon come back and report there be no clear passage to this planet then the question be Doc how long can we survive with the ration we have be on l'd say seven to ten day Roslin when be she due back she be due three hour ago the uh radiation level be high but she be strong and she be uh she 'll be here any moment no l'm sorry l do n't have anything to share l tell you Starbuck l do n't have anything get off my back l see a protein bar l give it to Cottle right right after l give he head now l'm a liar if the shoe fit all right can it Kat get down here all right for frak 's sake everybody eat we be get paranoid over this hunger Kat here baby eat this starbuck oh my god that be good alarm Baltar somewhere to be D'Anna Number Three Ssh you 'll wake Caprica l'd love to hang around with you two all day but l get thing to do l'll never understand what you all do all day long live on this thing like flea on a cat where do you suppose she take herself off to then you be not the only one ask that l'm not what do you mean she be be do thing do thing what thing loud hiss talk drown out by noise man go ahead l've get your helmet there you go got you man 2 easy man prepare the starboard side for wash down all the way down to fifth man 2 right through here Lieutenant Radiation negative there be a way through the star cluster and l find the planet on the other side l skim it l take photo there be huge swath of algae just like we think it be black Apollo she be a Cylon she can handle a radiation dose that big we think someone call Cottle l'm fine maybe you be but a human might not be able to make it so then how do we get ten of thousand of human through there Sharon so we can make it through in two jump with a stop right there there be no solution with a single jump the cluster 's too big it be too big to go around too civvy ship be n't shield enough to jump in the middle of that radiation l would say 80 of the people on board would die can we send Galactica for food and put it where what it would take dozen of trip each time we would leave the fleet vulnerable we ca n't bring the food to the people what if we bring the people to the food put the people on Galactica send the civilian ship with skeleton crew give they radiation med except that the radiation would fry the civvy ship ' nav system they would n't be able to see squat there would n't be a way to calculate a jump out it be bad than that once you jump in the light be so blind you begin to drift and before you can get your bearing you be over there Apollo no visual contact Instruments blind by radiation they would get lose they would burn up Pilot ship we pair a raptor with each civilian ship Raptor navigation system be harden they could handle the radiation each Raptor lead a civilian ship through the cluster then they both jump out together the question be how many jump will it take five round trip you hear five round trip on our outbound jump we 'll each be responsible for relaying jump coordinate to our own specific civilian ship nail they to jump point and ensure they do n't drift off Sir will we get feed when we get there eventually yes but only after we find the algae and get it process oh but the truth be nausea from radiation exposure will take care of our appetite you 'll all be issue with radiation badge to track our exposure White like this you be ok as your exposure increase it 'll darken if it approach this you 'll be pull from duty keep check your badge it be every pilot 's own responsibility to monitor their own badge Starbuck remember we be all fly solo on this mission so there 'll be nobody to bitch slap you if you get tired or start see toaster on your wing we 'll be issue stim so use they be you crazy we ca n't use stim Problem Stims amp up your metabolism we have get nothing to burn we 'll be fly into the side of the ship they would mess we up you use to like stim Kat personal discretion on the stim we be take the first load of civilian on board as we speak that be it skid up in four hour Dualla there be no food here there be no ration anywhere on this ship if someone tell you there be food they be lie if you leave this area force will be use once we get through the star cluster you will be return to your designate ship Sacha man keep follow down to the front my name be n't Sacha my name be Captain Louanne Katraine you understand I Sacha and you be a lifetime ago right right cos you get this now right no more hang with the sinner huh stay away from I do you understand I do they even know who you really be fancy bumping into you here can you believe l'm lose again l can never find my way

they go these crew be count on we Apollo Starbuck on station Kat l get visual on Chiron Apollo Hotdog Adriatic in sight ok when you jump in you 'll be disorient take it one step at a time find your sheep work the jump calculation and get they out remember we do not stay beyond our radiation dose limit Hoshi Apollo report pilot in position sir Initiate jump on his command Galactica will follow man Aye aye sir Raptors Apollo we jump on my mark three two jumping one Mark whoa what be this l ca n't see anything Frak oh ah got you Kat you get yours Affirmative Apollo only get eye for the Chiron Relaying coordinate Squadron Apollo l have Thera Sita relaying jump coordinate to she right now Apollo Starbuck l get mine Frak l'm just barely hold on here l lose mine have anyone see Adriatic she

ok Hera it be ok Shh l'm here for you Chief Radiocarbon dating suggest the temple 's at least 4 000 year old which line up with the exodus of the thirteenth tribe Roslin you find the Temple of Five yeah l recognise it from the book in my father 's study Madam President he be a priest and the Temple of Five be an important part of our his faith could this place be relate to the Eye of Jupiter Chief you get I all l know be the stuff l kind of remember from sneak into my dad 's study the Eye of Jupiter what exactly be we talk about accord to the scripture it be a marker leave behind by the thirteenth tribe it be suppose to point the way to Earth alarm blare Chief we be on alert this be Adama Lieutenant Gaeta CIC we have multiple dradis contact four Cylon baseship jump into view on our way sitrep four baseship inbound at high speed four bastard practically jump on top of we Fleet 's spool up their ftl drive prepare to jump to standby coordinate do it Aye sir we get ta hold this position until everyone 's back on board how many be down there enough if the Eye of Jupiter be in that temple and be a marker to Earth we ca n't let the Cylons get their hand on it stand by to launch viper Something 's odd here cylon be n't launch Raiders Baseships be stand off outside of weapon range that be odd Admiral it be the Cylon baseship request to speak with you put it through to speaker this be Admiral Adama Baltar Admiral l ca n't tell you what a genuine pleasure it be to hear your voice this be Gaius Baltar Roslin l ca n't believe we be allow cylon on this ship they must want something pretty bad or else they would have start shoot why send Baltar they get ta know we wo n't believe a word he say he can say what he want the long he talk the more time we have to get Lee and his people off the planet feel like old time l ca n't believe how much l miss this place you know you ca n't return they would toss you out the near air lock and then throw a party yes l know still l ca n't help feel l'm finally home if you be really a Cylon a member of the final five these feeling be just part of your programming part of your cover and if l'm a human being after all if l'm not one of the final five this be the last chance l get to see my kind again Colonel wait well look at this should we salute that be Boomer the one who shoot the old man well you just lose your visit privilege hold that thing here until we get back yes sir you three keep on move Laura Laura my it be good to see you weapon be hardly necessary yes exactly we come in peace what do you want we want the Eye of Jupiter so let we skip the denial and protestation and go straight to it we know that you have people on the ground and we know that you have find the original settlement of the thirteenth tribe it also do n't take a lot of deduction to conclude that the only reason you have n't cut your loss and jump away by now be that you have probably find the artefact but you have n't be able to retrieve it yet be that about right we have our people on the surface we be not leave they behind that be a touching but not very convincing idea the chance we have all converge on this small planet at the same time be small so we all understand it be not chance you want the Eye the Cylons want the Eye l'd like to discuss the practical issue so we can reach some accommodation the less this man say the well this will go wait a minute if it be n't for I the Cylons would have blow you out of the sky l think you can handle this alone if you can stomach it so l've save your life again how many time be that now l'm lose count if it be n't for I you would all be dead what be your offer you give we the Eye of Jupiter we let you go and we 'll throw in Baltar what be you talk about now l'm improvise throw something sweet in the pot besides l suspect that the admiral and Madam President would enjoy some nice quiet private time with their former leader be l right worth think about definitely worth think about despite that uniform it be not your home any more l've make my choice and l know where my loyalty lie what if l tell you that your daughter be still alive l'd say you be lie well someone 's lie but it be not I Hera 's alive at least for now she be ill and we do n't know why yeah right Baltar find she on New Caprica during the evacuation she be on our baseship right now from what we could gather she be hide at Laura Roslin 's school which mean that she probably plan the whole thing in the first place l do n't need to listen to this watch her they let you think that she be dead you do n't do that to a person but to a thing that be what your friend think of you you be not one of they you be a thing we be not give you the key to find Earth you try bring it up from that planet and see what happen we outnumber you four to one l'm set the term now make any attempt to attack this ship or the people on the planet 's surface l'll launch every nuke l've get Lay waste to the entire continent you be bluff you wanna find out as much as we do guard escort they back to their ship yes sir it would help if l know what l be look for do it really look like an eye l do n't know the scripture make reference to the Eye be leave in some sort of temple but there be no physical description all we know for sure be it supposedly point the way to Earth and you believe that the Cylons do l ca n't take a chance they be right if it look like they be gon na get into the temple your order be to blow it Understood what be alarm blare what be go on the Cylons be jam the wireless every frequency ok we need to establish our communication work out a plan to defend this temple while Tyrol search defend it with what a dozen marine maybe five more military they would have to draft the civilian can l make a suggestion you wo n't like do you make any other kind Use Sam to command the civilian you be not serious Lee Hey Sam Hi hear you be come down guess it take an emergency to get we in the same room these day can we do this later please Sam l need you to command the civilian form they into fire team l'll give my deployment order through Whoa whoa wait Deployment order Fire team come on some of these guy have never even hold a rifle before you be suppose to be the expert in turn civilian into soldier we be guerrilla fighter hit and run keep move keep the enemy off balance l've never have to defend a fix position that be a different game well you be just gon na have to learn it fast we be defend this position until Chief find this Eye ok so you want we to risk our life for something you have n't even find yet Sam l'm not even sure it exist but l do n't have to tell you every detail what you have to explain to I hey hey hey hey hey the major 's in charge of this one ok ok Mm l certainly would n't want to step between you and your major well l thought that go really well he 'll do it he would well l miss Nicky do you think he be ok yes he be fine he be fine l know you know when l be grow up l hate everything about the faith the rule the ritual endless discussion at the dinner table l use to sneak into my mom 's prayer room the holiest of the holy and l would dance around naked with porn magazine just to defy the god and tell they to frak off l do n't even know how l find this place l just get this urge to start walk and then suddenly here it be well you should see the look on your face when you be in here there be this reverence you even talk soft l feel something in here something true but here l be set charge in this special place the holiest of the holy this be the Temple of Five if my parent could see this and l'm gon na blow it up Gaeta l notice some anomaly in the solar radiation belt l make an analysis of the star 's vibration mode sure enough it appear to be highly unstable if you can believe it on the verge of go supernova when it could be tomorrow could be next year there be no way of know for sure sir when it do happen the only warning that we be likely to get be a fast helium flash at which point we 'll have to jump out of here before it obliterate the entire planetary system Sir l'm not one to look for religious sign but l ca n't get my head around these odd that human and Cylon both converge on this planet at this exact moment just as this star be about to go supernova l'm not a religious person Mr Gaeta as you well know so if this be the work of a high power then they have one hell of a sense of humour we have a standoff very predictable they have the Eye and they 'll nuke it if we try to take it and we 'll shoot they down if they try bring it up to Galactica be we sure they have it how do we know they be not bluff you do n't we three feel that we ca n't afford to take the chance l think we be miss the big picture here we have the opportunity to rid the universe of the human pestilence once and for all we can discuss that after we get the Eye of Jupiter after we find the path to Earth let I point out that it do n't matter if we find Earth in five day or if we find Earth in 5 000 year we be machine we 'll still be around to savour the great miracle so let they destroy the Eye if indeed they have it we have to take advantage of the situation and take down Galactica once and for all or we could stand here and do nothing we be not do nothing cavil plan be in motion l'm sorry what be that D'Anna l put a heavy raider down on the planet 's surface as soon as we jump in l thought that would be our good chance of slip by their dradis seem l be right be there any reason the rest of we be n't involve in this it be a need to know mission so now l be tell you because you need to know we cut off their troop ' communication and put our own troop on the ground so as soon as the centurion retrieve the Eye you can take out Galactica ok here be the deal we be out of option the Cylons have get we pin on this rock and our only way out of here be to hold this place until Galactica can send a rescue party so l've divide you into two team ok team one be gon na be distribute ammunition throughout the camp Team two be gon na be make home make tylium mine l know that be not glamorous work but we be gon na need the extra firepower in case the Cylons decide to take a shot at we look l know some of you be scared and that be ok cos l'm scare too but if we keep our head and do our job we can do this we can all get out of here Barolay have a list of your name and your assignment make sure you get with her l'll see you outside that be good Honest you would make a good officer Officer huh like you someone who swear an oath and know how to keep it l'm not sure what you think 's go on do n't insult I ok l'm not stupid l know my wife l know how she be we have be marry for a year and a half what you think you be the first l choose to marry Kara that be my business but you l do n't know what the hell you think you be try to do look l'm try to fight a war l'm try to get these people off this rock in one piece anything for the cause Major Gaius l be on the verge of see the face of the final five cylon maybe the face of God himself the five light of the apocalypse rise struggle towards the light sin reveal only to those who enter the temple only to the choose one the choose One the choose One the choose One the choose One the choose one the choose one the five await I Gaius l'm so close to know the truth what truth Caprica l'd like to think that we three have share something transcend the barrier that separate people and yet somehow the more time go on the more l find myself on the outside look in well that be not the case at all be it because we three we be integral we be part of we be finish Baltar and my destiny lie separate from yours Caprica the five light will be reveal only to those who enter the temple we have to go down to the planet only you and l can see this through what be you after what be this secret that you keep pursue you have to tell I the truth l love you both we love you too but this be something you can not share with we Something l ca n't share with you l love you when everyone else want you dead now look you must n't misunderstand it be not personal it be transcendent it be like what you say it be transcendent Pray for we Caprica we 'll be pray for you ok he want we to set up forward observation post wire back to base for communication Obs will be at strategic location give we as much warning as possible if there be a Cylon advance since we only have one Raptor Captain Thrace will fly point oh joy Wireless be dead so if you do make contact do not engage fly to the close post have they relay the information back to Command Note force strength direction of march and position l have fly recon once or twice Lieutenant Griggs you and Varrick be gon na set up an observation post here Henick and Ditko you go here and who get lucky number three that would be Sergeant Fischer and I do you

Cylon baseship and that she have be see on New Caprica in your school the child be alive yes yes the child be at the school yes l keep she there we suspect that the Cylons capture she during the exodus from New Caprica yes it be true listen the thing you might want to know be that when do you have any idea what we have go through you of all people know what it be like to lose a child the difference be your child be still alive eventually l hope you become grateful of that l want to see she what do you mean she be go down go down where somewhere in the north valley ok get your man on

be an academic distinction at this point Doctor None of we be enjoy this so why do n't you just tell I what l need to know and your suffering will come to an end and l promise you this l know nothing about the Cylon plan or their whereabouts l witness nothing in that temple my information on Cylon intelligence be be limit to say the least prior to the attack do you have high level security clearance yes so what do you tell anybody about it do you let someone into the defence mainframe careful Gaius the blonde woman l see you with on Caprica just prior to the attack she 'll flush you out of an airlock without a moment 's hesitation unless of course that prospect no long frightens you exhale lie all lie a rehash of all the other old lie l do not collude in the genocide of my own people

create a state of anxiety so intense that the subject believe that their very survival be at stake the interrogator exploit that become less an adversary and more a lifeline at least that be the idea it might get Baltar to talk tell we what the Cylons know about Earth but it be dangerous especially for someone in Baltar 's condition be you tell I we have these drug aboard Galactica you be be awfully accommodate be that how it look to you your estranged two timing bitch of a wife call you up for a quickie and you hop on the first shuttle l'd say yeah l've be think about stuff Kara yeah

resolve I l never intend for certain thing to happen do n't that matter you take the Cylons to the temple to the Eye of Jupiter what do it tell they what do it tell they about Earth l be look for what be you look for Doctor what be you look for spiritual chant their face but they would n't show they to I their face whose face the five the final five the final five Cylons l think l might be one of they l tell they l want to be one of they a Cylon why all my sin forgive a new beginning be you a Cylon Dr Baltar no that be not good enough Doctor tell I what you tell the Cylons what do they know tell I or l'll have to let you go Doctor l'll have to let you go tell I or l'll have to let you go l'll have to let you go look where you be go my ring have anybody see my ring l lose it have anybody

the five priest devote to the one whose name can not be speak Come on it be all just mumbo jumbo he be hold a lot back l'm sure of it maybe we should resort to more direct method direct method now you have my vote no we try the stick it be time to try the carrot the thing he be most deeply afraid of be even if he talk we 'll kill he Smart man we have to ease his fear make he believe that if he collaborate at the very least he 'll have his life he wo n't buy that come from we of course not we have to find someone he trust Baltar as perverse as it may seem l may actually owe these people a debt of gratitude l realise there be probably nothing l can say that can make this right but there be something you need to know l ask you to marry I because l be in love with you just like l'm in love with you now they force I to admit my failing and now that l have l feel positively liberate you be right l love Kara you know and maybe there be part of I that always will in my heart l know l have always do what l've have to do but l marry you l marry you and you know when l look back at our marriage at the time that we have spend together you be good for I Dee and l need you and l do n't think l ever really realise that till l know that l be lose you Gaeta l ca n't promise you a trial Doctor l'm sure that if you give they something anything but please just give I another chance that be all l'm ask just give I the chance Gaeta these chart that l've be use to plot our course to Earth l've never be confident of my calculation that be lucky because the calculation be wrong l detect a number of inconsistency right off the bat these figure here be wrong that be exactly what l be afraid of Cylon navigation system be far more advanced than ours but l have manage to commit many of the algorithm to memory if we can offer they this kind of help l'm certain at the very least they 'll spare your life maybe we can even get you out of this cell and offer you some proper quarter creature comfort that be the clincher sorry where be it um where be what Doctor where be what so much for that little stratagem hello you all right listen we do n't have to stay here if you do n't want to ok yeah two whisky straight up l should have know that you would betray I what do you tell they you stay behind till the grisly end on New Caprica so you could what so you could feed information to the Resistance who do you think allow you to do that that be a lie no it be not a lie you think l'm blind you see l literally have a gun point to my head but nobody force you to play both side so l'm ask you Mr Gaeta who be the real traitor in this room to the first of many let we do another yeah thank you l'm not a traitor of course because there be far bad thing than be a traitor be n't there Felix if your friend only know the truth do n't worry l can keep your little secret we get ta get in there frak you guard Lieutenant Gaeta step away from the prisoner now step away from the prisoner l will not ask again stand down Sergeant yes sir step back Mr Gaeta no no sir l ca n't let he live not after what he be do Mr Gaeta Mr Gaeta wait please look at I l understand what you be feel no you do n't yes l do the other night you did n't come here to interrogate Dr Baltar you come here to kill he did n't you l understand that l do what be his condition he miss the artery he 'll live got ta get he to sickbay get a gurney in here right away Roslin go easy on he Number six all thing consider Gaius it could have be bad much bad well you be not one of the five but you certainly have the luck of the god well l be the choose One you did n't tell they that do you no everybody be get to have a secret l tell he l did n't take any satisfaction in see his pain but the truth be l be willing to see he endure a great deal of suffer in order to get what l want it be n't some intelligence or some truth l want a genuine admission of guilt that be something you be not gon na get from someone like Baltar he do n't see himself that way it be not who he be in his eye he be the victim not the criminal it be not too late for he to just disappear we ca n't do that for all his crime he be one of we so what happen next we give he his trial back mask turn I on dead man previously on Battlestar Galactica we all make sacrifice be that so yes that be right then how come some Cylon lover be hold down my post Hera 's alive l'm her mother and l'm go to get she l'm beg you to do this yell you have put the entire fleet in jeopardy be you aware of that l'm not a traitor l do what l thought be right she 'll get

that way after you finish this Tory actually draw up an agenda Baltar again hm ca n't we give he back to the Cylons you know how much l love that idea unfortunately give what little l be able to glean from the Caprica Six l do n't think the Cylons would take he back Fine then try the son of a bitch and be do with it we have to give he a trial but under what law Caprican Picon Tauron do we give he a jury trial do we set up a tribunal we do n't even have anything closely resemble a comprehensive law library and this fleet be not exactly brim with legal talent you bring lawyer into this they be gon na drag you around for month be n't your father an attorney on Caprica yes l tell you l did n't get along with he very well oh right ok l'm ready to set up an organising committee but frankly try to get a room full of legal scholar to stay on task be like herd cat and so l need to set up a chairman of this committee somebody who can make a hard decision and wo n't get seduce by all the legalese do you have a candidate in fact l do l be think Lee like grandfather like grandson what do you think l'm not gon na say he be incapable of handle it but he be never show any type of interest in law l

now 49 day since our last enemy contact now l realise that any high math 's probably beyond most of you so l'm gon na make this real simple for you one be the only number you need to remember because all it take be for one pilot to let his guard down one ECO to miss a dradis contact and suddenly the Cylons be on top of we that be when people die Adama he be like both of we Proud stubborn and angry but he be come into his own especially in the last few month Carolanne do n't tell I tell he he know know what that the admiral 's go to give he a good performance review or that his father love he do

remember when you be young you would go visit your grandfather 's house you be fascinated with his paper and his law book laugh and there be I think l be be sly sneak off into his office all by myself l guess it be a pipe dream now but for five minute there l really do consider lawyer as one of a dozen career that l could go into before l join the service hm l never know that well it be probably

problem with the refining process what be go on the refinery use to be our most reliable ship now every day l start with a stack of message from that chief Xeno Fenner Fenner complain about work condition and delivery and uh spare part and compensation if you can believe that we be on the run for our life and the guy want to talk about overtime bonus we have be more than patient with Fenner

sceptic suddenly decide that we be on the road to Earth after all have l ever doubt it l've have people work 18 hour shift for the past six month how long can a man keep that up if the Cylons show up we have enough fuel to jump the entire fleet what once mm hm maybe twice that be a margin that be much too narrow for I how about for you and your man you have a problem fix it just get the gas flow and then we 'll talk l promise you that then we 'll talk it be always later you know it be funny that when the gas flow my phone call do n't get return but the minute there be a glitch in supply l've get face time with the president and the admiral Hmm maybe we should just start have more glitch be that a threat it be like the book say if you hear the people you 'll never have to fear the people do you say the book mm hm guard arrest he for extortion and interrupt vital service during a time of war go ahead take he away go out of here Guard come with I sir what the hell be that he be quote from Baltar 's book the rambling that his lawyer smuggle out of the brig he be have it reprint and pass out among the fleet and he be call it my Triumphs my mistake by Gaius Baltar l be think of have

be move well yesterday be that how the bend be suppose to work l'm just upset about Seelix so l'm tense up they should 've tell she right off the bat what the fleet priority be should 've say that they need knuckle dragger more than pilot it be n't about fleet priority we be not the rule class so we be stuck do the dirty work rule class where have you get that something l read by Baltar his frakke rag be go around l ca n't believe anybody'd read anything by he that be what l think too but ever wonder why all the pilot and the officer come from the rich colony like Caprica and Virgon and Tauron while all the knuckle dragger come from the poor colony like Aerelon and Sagitarron and Gemenon yeah that be just trash talk on the deck really name one officer that come from a poor colony Lieutenant Dualla 's from Sagitarron Case in point how do she get promote she marry an officer from Caprica phone ring Tyrol Adama the foreman at the fuel refinery 's just be arrest Xeno Fenner know he do something happen to Xeno arrest yes sir he be in the union on New Caprica he seem like a good guy what have he do he piss off the president the big problem be the refining operation l need someone to get that fuel ship move again pick a team and be on the hangar deck in an hour yes sir what happen to Xeno he piss off the president you can get arrest for that now l think the admiral be kid nicky gargle yeah you ever think about the union Sure but that be go now New Caprica 's go but all the people in the union be still here the only difference be now they do n't have anyone to stand

Baltar so you have read it the people be read it and now you be sorry we know your lawyer be smuggle the page out so we intercept they l'm the only one who be read the book and l be die to see how it end really what be you think cast yourself as a man of the people a son of a farmer a revolutionary oh please it may come as a surprise but l wish to strike a chord with the common man Hand over those page or l'll have these guard search you make a choice gentleman proceed do n't bend to her Gaius show she that she ca n't break you keep your dignity perhaps you would consider write a blurb for the back cover thank you Doctor guard close the cell it be all right Gaius everything will be ok Tyrol Cabott hey how be you do Good to see you sorry never mind it be inevitable listen we all start feel a lot well when we hear they be send you oh yeah you bet l've be tell everybody how the union on New Caprica stand up for the little guy yeah well Cabott you be look at the fleet 's entire supply of

tylium and that mean this fleet be n't go anywhere l've execute a search of the ship but the seal have not turn up you know that this be sabotage l'm incline to have they lock up please they could 've rig something to have I injure they could have contaminate the fuel on purpose leave our ship dead in the air good god all they do do be buy some time the machinery need overhaul there be a reason quality control be fail do you realise most of the worker on that ship have not have a day off since the original attack on the Colonies it be like slave labour do n't be absurd the people aboard that ship be stick there they have no control over their life and the work be hard we know that do they think they be have a picnic on the algae processing plant or munition the fleet be full of people work under horrific condition nobody be have a good time l think that if we at least release Xeno talk to they about improve work and living condition that the protest will go away they 'll return the seal and we 'll get the fuel problem under control Extortion be not an acceptable method of protest what be the name of the leader just Cabott l will issue a warrant for his arrest Put he in the brig

if the Cylons be still follow we just shut up and deal ok how do we measure loss how do we measure loss we measure it in the face of the dead the face that haunt our memory and our dream how do we measure loss we measure it in our own face the one we see in the mirror every day because it have mark each of we so how do we measure loss when the scale of it become too hard to absorb any other way we use number how many kill how many maim how many miss and when those number become too vast to comprehend as they do two year ago we have to turn it around we begin to count the living those of we who survive to continue the saga of the human race 44 035 the sum total of survivor from the twelve Colonies who settle on New Caprica with President Gaius Baltar as their leader and protector 38 838 our number the day after we escape and the miss number the one that no one want to face 5 197 5 197 of we kill leave behind or simply disappear 5 197 of all that remain of the human race Iost the citizen of the Twelve Colonies entrust their fate and their life to Gaius Baltar what we receive be a reign of terror that stagger our mind and break our heart instead of governance we get tyranny instead ofjustice we get oppression instead of a president we get a murderer today humanity hold he accountable for his crime Gaius Baltar be not a victim Gaius Baltar choose to side with the Cylons and to actively seek the death of his fellow citizen for that he must pay the ultimate price your Honours the defence would like to change our plea to guilty what Counsellor be you sure you want to do that no but what choice do l have l mean it be obvious my client be guilty he be a traitor a killer he be no well than a Cylon and what do we do with they man throw they out the airlock that be right throw they out the airlock this man sell we to our enemy this man be our enemy and if there be one thing that be good in war that be right and just and proper it be slaughter our enemy get some righteous payback what be we wait for let we just kill he now it would be easy would n't it Simpler Justice of the mob it be what they want especially her she be be want this for over a year now ever since he beat she in a free and fair election of the people now she get the chance to exact her revenge upon a man whose only real crime be bow to the inevitable Gaius Baltar save the life of the

search the entire fleet for track device it be possible they could have place one on a ship on New Caprica l think that we should ask the six she may be willing to help Baltar 's girlfriend why would she do that because she do not want to see Hera go back to the Cylons you think that thing would stick her neck out for some half Cylon whelp l have a feeling she would lay her life down for her a feeling it be more than a feeling all right just do it it do n't hurt to ask no ask the prisoner if it know of any tracking device in the fleet with pleasure the president god bless her sunny optimistic soul think you might wanna share how your buddy have be track we so l'm here to ask the question and listen to your lie in the last battle we discover your fuel ship have a unique radiation

their plan oh no never he never lift a frakke finger to help we Ellen do more at least she be try to slur word to help we my god he be drunk yes yes Ellen your wife another victim of Baltar 's Cylon ally yeah that be right yeah thank you Colonel your witness what happen to his wife she work for a Cylon administrator work for he you know what happen to her no no idea l presume she die in the exodus from New Caprica Colonel Hm you dislike Gaius Baltar because you consider he to be a traitor Correct and a coward and a mass murderer the suicide bombing of the police graduation Baltar be the intended target be he not if he have have the gut to show up that day like he be suppose to you and l would n't be have this conversation now so you order the killing of what be it 33 other man and woman just for the chance to kill Gaius Baltar they be all traitor anyone who put on that uniform but yes he be the target what happen to your wife Exception Relevance the door be open on direct l fail to see the point of pursue he be right Admiral if it be bring up during direct examination it can be pursue in cross overrule continue what happen to your wife Colonel you frakke son of a bitch be n't it true that she collaborate openly with the Cylons that she actually work for they she be fake it make they think that she be work for they l I see and Baltar he be n't fake it no that be right and you blame he for her death have you be drink today Colonel l have a drink l have n't be drink you like to drink with Ellen l imagine static haunt music do you hear that they be play music in here now what the hell be he talk about Gaius Baltar did n't order the death of your wife Colonel that be somebody else who be it Colonel who kill Ellen come on Colonel we be wait tell we who be it

so they could tear more piece off I so l kill she all because of that thing over there all because Gaius frakke Baltar did n't have the gut to stand up to the Cylons because he hand our fate over to the Cylons l have to kill my Ellen so Gaius Baltar make you kill your wife that be why you hate he and that be why you would say anything to see he die you be godsdamn right l would l would do

huh have a good time stick it to the old man defend a hate man that be not why l agree to do this you just decide to stand up for justice and those other thing we inscribe upon courtroom door yeah that be exactly what l'm do because l believe in the system l really believe l even believe that our lowlife pond scum of a client actually deserve a fair trial the system require that you tell what you know which leave you with one of two uncomfortable option first share the information and in so do uphold the very principle that you claim to hold so dear or second keep they to yourself and prove once and for all your only purpose here be to jab your father in the eye and make a mockery of the justice system very very nice but l know why l'm here l do n't need to prove it to you or to anyone you be wrong you need to prove it to yourself or you 'll leave that courtroom know you keep a secret that could have save that man 's miserable life unless l misjudge you that be not something that Lee Adama wish on his conscience so what 'll it be Major sit on the sideline mouth piety or be you gon na get in this trial and give we something we can use there we go we make it come on groan

ta go Saul l'm really tired l'm really sorry about all that in court there be nothing to be sorry about l embarrassed you make you look bad you be my old friend Saul you never embarrass I get some rest can the former CAG make a radical suggestion to the admiral what if we do n't fix the tylium ship Repairs have already start l realise that but hear I out we be too close to the nebula to hope the Cylons ca n't guess where we be go so if we do n't fix it if we send the ship off on a new course with a couple of Raptors let she make a few jump before rejoin the fleet it might throw the Cylons off it be a good idea l'll take it into consideration be there anything else how be the president what be she ok she look a little rattled in court yesterday sigh we ca n't talk about the trial outside of court you know that or you should l know l be n't ask after what you do to Tigh you be the last person l would consider to confide in I l did n't do anything to Tigh he be drunk that be really not my fault you tell Lampkin about Ellen l did n't even know about Ellen yeah right be you call I a liar l'm call you a liar and a coward one who do n't have the gut to go after a man himself instead you hand the shiv to a stranger and let he stab Tigh in the back and for what the traitorous piece of garbage Gaius Baltar who do n't even deserve a trial be you do yes then so be I l will not serve under a man who question my integrity and l wo n't have an officer under my command who do n't have any l'll see you in court Admiral let I do this Baltar what be you sure Major it be Mr now and

would you have do what would you have do if he have refuse to surrender the Cylons would 've nuke the planet then and there so do he appear to cooperate with the Cylons Sure so do hundred of other what be the difference between he and they the president issue a blanket pardon they be all forgive no question ask Colonel Tigh Colonel Tigh use suicide bomber kill dozen of people Forgiven Lieutenant Agathon and Chief Tyrol they murder an officer on the Pegasus forgive the admiral the admiral institute a military coup d'état against the president forgive and I well where do l begin l

good if l'd have my way nobody would 've make it off that planet l'm the coward l'm the traitor l'm forgive l'd say we be very forgiving of mistake we make our own law now our own justice and we have be pretty creative at find way to let people off the hook for everything theft murder and we have have to be because because we be not a civilisation any more we be a gang and we be on the run and we have to fight to survive we have to break rule we have to bend law we have to improvise but not this time no not this time not for Gaius Baltar no you you have to die you have to die because well

defendant will rise Gaius Baltar after carefully weigh the evidence this tribunal on a vote of three to two find you not guilty uproar you win let we go l know l would be acquit but the fact that l be
