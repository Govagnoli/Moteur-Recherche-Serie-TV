forwarding address be just a mail box the Lion King and other Disney favourite that be his I should put it away he have Disney favourite he like the song my dark side like Mary Poppins no wonder I be bully at school you say yourself he be a child find out where that mail box be Bedfordshire exactly physically where hello sweetie this be the part where you be suppose to follow I it would be ever so helpful if you be awake I be the one without any rich relative which be a bit of a lie actually I 've get an uncle with a half explode liver but it be tactless to make plan anyway I be in that tangerine car over there pop your engine on try to keep up if you be careful I bet I shall not suspect a thing find he right although technically he be suppose to find we sorry Miranda but he fall asleep while he be wait he would not make a very good detective no I do not suppose you would would you Dr Jackman either of you at first I think it be a kind of make up job but the hairline be clearly different and also he be at least two inch tall and a little narrow across the shoulder you miss out sexy he be a sexy boy yep and if we notice he be sexy he must be push the envelope be not that so dear oh look I think Dr Jackman 's make a clever old deduction about we so tell we about yourself why because I be pay a very large amount of money to stop follow you which we take of course I do not care to see what come next in their repertoire of persuasion and also we need a new kitchen and there be the baby of course oh and the baby yeah of course we be pregnant well mostly I so any idea who might be bribe we Dr Jackman no or follow you in a black van No do not you want to find out of course then let we help I do not need help you do I can handle this on my own oh I entirely believe you but then again you never be be you on your own it start about six month ago I would have symptom before but nothlng really major Hair on my forearm out of nowhere thing like that then I start have blackout except of course they be not blackout I think it be a split personality thing but there be an actual physical change for a while I think I be curse or a werewolf or God know what and what do you think now I do not know what to think I know how often you go to the library I even know what book you get out do your other half know you be look for a cure I would rather you do not tell he I will not what have you find there be nothing to find my condition be unprecedented nothing like this have ever happen before yes it have you 've be look in the wrong place ah Jekyll and Hyde the comparison have occur to I but this be fiction step into my office Dr Henry Jekyll 1883 Edinburgh amongst his close friend one Robert Louis Stevenson Jekyll die a few month before Stevenson 's story be publish it be a true story at least base on truth he look like I exactly like you yeah you say he die at the age of 43 not long after this photograph be take about my age then I think time be become a factor what do he die of it be unclear even in the story but he die as Hyde but my case be different be not it he drink a potion or something he be drug that be how he change I never take anything well maybe you just inherit it like it be in your blood now run in the family well that would make sense just one problem they be not relate but look at they they must be but they can not be why not it be interesting that you have twin do they have similar personality or be they opposite they be very sweet Dr Jackman do not you worry about they what with your you know funny turn Dr Jackman have give a great deal of thought to their protection of course though one wonder how much protection would be enough so why can not Dr Jackman and Dr Jekyll be relate because Dr Jekyll be the last of the Jekyll line there be no brother and sister no survive cousin nobody well that be impossible you be a foundling be not you leave in a railway station in Belfast raise by foster parent nobody really know how you get here I know you 've try to find out so have I but there be nothing out there not a footprint not a kiss you arrive in this world without a trace Dr Jekyll 1883 Dr

the human specie no long evolves remember we change the world it no long change we but at what cost the millennia pass and Homo sapiens remain unchanged century after century and then one day Dr Jekyll drink from a flask and what do you know there be life in the old girl yet I never drink anything you do not have to it be part of your inheritance your birthright because I be his descendant

form company Klein Utterson Klein Utterson still survive to this day and how do you find they as an employer Mr Syme American Ooh and initially scottish a frightening combination Klein Utterson also take possession of something else the body of Dr Henry Jekyll how be I do fascinating fairy tale there be a copy of this fairy tale with my lawyer I hope that be enough to secure my safety for the evening oh absolutely you should definitely hope that in the 70 year follow Henry Jekyll 's death and in total secrecy there be I think 16 attempt to recreate his experiment result in sixteen death

create from the DNA harvest from his body a brand new grow your own Winston how be that go by the way be he do you be go to make a clone of Winston Churchill of course not just some bloody idiot mouth off in a pub try to impress a girl from Hull accord to the record unfortunately her father work for one of our more esteemed tabloid you be not try to clone Winston Churchill you be try to clone Henry Jekyll after all those year of fail to recreate his experiment you finally decide to throw in the towel and recreate the man himself how be I do now it take until 1997 to successfully clone a sheep do you really imagine in 1965 we be able to clone a dead victorian Klein Utterson be successfully clone farm animal in the 1950 anyone that try to speak about it end up very rich or disappear which be
