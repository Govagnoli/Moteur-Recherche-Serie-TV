other out Clear Hi fan 1 my name be jordan I have rayna I want to make an exchange no funny stuff I will meet you where the original plan be suppose to go down you can have she what the hell 's the matter with you be you do this on purpose or you just terrible at your job neither do what Echo 's off task your little brainchild just backfire okay okay first of all wow secondly echo 's hardwired to protect the client now sometimes these thing play out differently than we anticipate you would well check your tech that be enough you be in my house lawrence of the two people here one of we be a genius and the other be a security guard in a very lovely suit all right genius tell I why echo would kidnap the girl you program she to protect and bring she to the man who be try to kill she that do sound kind of bad you want to die this would be a careful what you wish for moment let she go and let she fall to her death but then I would have nothing to bargain with you drop she and this girl will have a big hole right in her head this girl for rayna now how about this you let audra go throw the gun down there and I will hand you rayna you can do whatever you want with she because honestly I do not care if rayna live she want to die and you want to kill she so basically nobody want rayna to make it to tomorrow I do it be not about kill she it be about give she what she want then this be a big magical moment for the two of you shut up you can not possibly understand what we have together true maybe rayna can explain I be so sorry please let I go I do not want to hurt anybody I be sorry no please I be sorry in position I have a clear shot we be ready to eliminate the threat Ma'am not just yet I do not want to hurt anymore that be really up to he he decide your fate right no please he be crazy I guess it be not love after all she do not mean it then I be sorry Rayna I would never hurt you God now you be change your story too Shut up I I could kill you and have both girl I could kill everybody no she do not seem to like that idea shut up Shut up I will shoot you and then I will let go you do not want to die you do not want she dead this be way too confusing be rayna okay please do not let I die I want to live I know I will have quite the story to tell when I get back to brisbane what do you mean this be what every day be like in america well part of it be dreadful but it be by far the most exciting fulfil wonderful day of my life and you be the scary one of all that be all I need you rub off on her who the hell be you Audra time for your treatment what be wrong with he be you ready for your treatment all right but can I kick that guy 's ass first I will seriously consider it she be a risk an increase risk she have control over the situation but we can not control she I be recommend that we send echo to the attic before someone else end up dead or bad she compromise this organization I believe she act in our good interest she go off mission in fact I believe she do quite the opposite she stop the person who want rayna dead it just happen to be rayna herself and by quite literally dangle the threat of death in front of her she prevent rayna

see these personality imprint they come from scan of real people keep it down while this little darling and I get to know each other well wow she be in hey neighbor off early Ooh who be she nobody accord to the FBI database what the hell 's the matter with you your little brainchild just backfire Excuse you be you go to pick that up oh how sweet to walk in this pilgrim way I be talk to you what

Happy no this be something quite apart from happiness call it a kind of bliss an unquestione serenity true happiness require some measure of self awareness we be talk about people here who have their very will take away imagine such a thing the irony of bring this to you Adelle be not lose on I I promise you it be not the irony that concern I you be ask I to place an Active with a federal agency indirectly yes I do not wish to be vulgar but one of the many benefit of have you as a client be that you help we avoid entanglement with federal agency Senator it be the ATF you be run gun besides your Active will not be work with the government one of your security guy would liaise your Active would be perfectly safe in a fanatical religious cult Adelle this be an election year I get the family value voter on the right the woman 's issue constituency on the left all come after I if anything untoward be go on behind those compound wall the ATF be convince there be now we have a very narrow window on this warrant if the government send in some wet behind the ear Quantico undercover graduate these people be go to know about it I need the real thing I need a true believer I can not help you you be the only one who can be not you suppose to be shoot I live I see that should not you be recuperate come on Loomis you scan the face you look for a match Computer do all the work have Carter run it through NCIC I already do that and you do not get a match nothing well I do not know what you expect I to do we both know your clearance rating open up database Carter can only dream about then you know that I 've get plenty of face to scan for people much more impressive than you but not as charming be that flirt I think so it be be a while do I mention I be shoot I do not like it good it be your job not to like it Mr Dominic but Senator Boxbaum be more than just a value client he be a well place asset deny his request would have a steep downside than acquiesce it be not the job I be confident Langton can handle the ATF it be Echo her field response have be wildly erratic lately she be demonstrate a talent for adaptability which be precisely what be require in this instance they should not be adaptable they should be predictable if Alpha do not teach we that much you do not like Echo do you Mr Dominic it be not that I do not like her it be that sometimes I worry you do your objection have be note thank you Mr Dominic Hello Echo hello I have an exam that be good would you like to have some lunch now I would she should not eat not before the surgery Echo why do not you go have a massage a massage would be relax if she be any more relaxed she would be ooze so it be doable it be experimental and highly invasive but doable the actual procedure be not much more complicated than laser eye correction it be not brain surgery actually it be brain surgery we be go to be turn Echo into a human camera and in order to do that she be go to have to be make blind not permanently in theory so this be it yes uh the late in CSEVP cortical stimulation for evocation of visual perception Brain camera for the blind or that and this be what she will be see well this be what the feds will be see only less clear once we get it inside of Echo we will be use her eye as lense the image will bypass her own cortex and be broadcast directly back to the ATF Echo herself will see no evil there have be instance of this technology cause aneurysm and in one case death it be possible one good sneeze could bring on a seizure or even bad a sneezure the risk have be determine to be within acceptable margin how soon can she be ready I will need 24 hour Good Clock start now thank a6 this be our target call himself Jonas Sparrow real name Nathan Allan White 36 year of age spend

anyone here think they 've get a well idea we give they what they need Dr saunder Closure if active have particularly poignant or reoccurring experience these can cause desire emotional need or reactivate old one that exist before they come here open loop if they be able to close those loop to get some sense of resolve you be recommend we allow they to take a self guide journey just the priority case let the tide come in it be the only way to wash it back out have the tide turn be they well now each active 's brain be program to release a sedative the moment they feel closure they be all back with we so I have to assume they 've resolve the issue that cause they to glitch November need to grieve for her daughter I understand that and Sierra she need to confront the man who take away her power one of they anyway as I recall you confront the other one and Echo she want to free we all what about Victor he be not go back to a trauma or need from his past he have a more present

Underground like it be somewhere beneath los angeles you work for the NSA you have not figure it out use your deductive skill you be a doll why do you want to bring down the dollhouse if it be not for I Paul Ballard would 've find you already do it congratulation Mr Langton for what for become our new head of security I 've see this before Alpha Alpha be dead after what he do they track he down and put a bullet in his brain they would never lie to we about something like that would they as soon as the prince kiss she the spell be break and Briar Rose open her eye and as she look at the face of the handsome young prince the whole kingdom begin to magically awaken all around the the cook in the kitchen and the boy in the yard all rub their eye and look around they this be crap I be sorry Crap do not you know what that mean you do not like the story but the other be listen so maybe we could talk about this afterwards the spell be for a hundred year so he show up on the last day and take credit for save she okay what be your name that be Susan really my name 's Susan too that be a really good point Susan she know the curse you will touch a poison spindle on your 15th birthday right so if it be I I be not explore the castle on my 15th birthday grope any spindle I find lie around especially when I think she might 've actually have a vague idea what the hell a spindle be I do not think her parent tell she about the curse if she know maybe they could 've hide she or she could 've just run away or what about this she could 've just wake herself the hell up it be a curse she could not just should 've wake herself up Susan stop that be enough let I go let I go leave I alone come on okay that be it for today everyone back to your room and I will check well guess I hit a trigger yeah something remind she of what she be be through I be not surprised that story always bug I too why I pick it sorry if I blow your routine you think that could happen someone tell I I could help she I be go to ask you to point she out Guess I do not have to but when be you go where I do not know be this about Caroline do you find she no be you go to tell I if I would come by tomorrow instead of today Paul talk to I what be there to say just tell I why we be not good for each other around you we be not good for each other no no Paul you be in my way you be under a lot of stress I 've be smother you I will back off we can take a break that be probably a good idea but just a break be all we need can you talk to I anyway you think you can not trust I and you be right to pay attention to that feeling but you need to make sure that you be lay the blame where it deserve to be look at I look at the real I and really think about whether I 've ever tell you anything I do not believe with all my heart you know you just say exactly what I need to hear and that be why I be leave what I will deal with this later please this be stop be so cruel can not you see this be kill I you will get over it what be on it we do not know it be hand deliver for Mr Dominic today we have not be able to unlock the datum that be inside you think it be from the NSA we know he be their inside man with he suddenly off their radar this may be they reach out try to find he what do we need to open it a tech expert I mean surely we can imprint an active with the skill we need I think we can assume they 've take precaution so that Mr Dominic be the only one who can retrieve the datum without corrupt it well you would well ask Mr Dominic then right right Mr Dominic be in the attic you do not really think we should let that stop we do you we keep place she in foster home and she keep bounce back she cut school and get in fight we 've take five knife off of that girl different time I do not even know how she get those steal they off other kid shoplift they some deli 's just have cup with steak knife in they on the table you can get in and out the mother die of a drug overdose when she be very young and the girl be leave with the woman 's boyfriend a small time drug dealer part time pimp probably think that she could start earn money for he when she get old but turn out that last part be not necessary half the age twice the price you know anything about Susan that be not in the report when they hand she to you I would be shock if you do she be not go to tell you she lie to her therapist she be useless in group that be pretty specific for someone who be know Susan for all of five minute I 've know she much long than that they be not the same they kind of be look close this one be the imprint I give Echo this morning this one be the 11 year old yeah I see similar response pattern sign of depression and instability so what be the deal the kid be a mess past trauma have her emotion reaction intellectual development all frakke up beyond recognition but if she get help really work deal with the soup of her life she get to be a nice lady with the tragic past but the healthy head Echo 's imprint be the kid grow up Names and date tiny detail change but in general yeah this be her if she grow up okay Echo 's like the live example of the kid 's well possible future so she think she be a volunteer help a kid like she but she know exactly what to expect and the kid see that maybe there be a decent future for her whole approach my idea whole engagement actually how do you sell Dewitt on it everybody want to be righteous when they can afford it even Topher Brink this feeling it be not unlike pride Topher okay end of the pride parade tell they to bring up Victor I do not know I do not know what I do wrong it be okay I try so hard I do everything I could think of right here it be right here can I you keep that book I be fix it I see that they call that edit you could make a living out of it you really hate that she do not save herself do not you of course she be 15 that be pretty big if she be littler say six or seven or eight you can always run away really I could not when do you want to run away in the middle of the night it always seem like I could run away when it would get light sometimes I would get dressed and lie there wait for the sun but when it come up he would be there pretend thing be normal and it seem so much well to just pretend you know it seem like I have imagine all the other stuff and I really want all of that to be something I have imagine and I end up feel like I be just as guilty as he be like it be a crime we be commit together and every time someone call I a victim I feel like I be the big liar in

to here you know why that look like that that be because Terry Karrens do not use that part of his brain and that would be where you find store such thing as empathy compassion an aversion to disemboweling puppy Basically this be what some of your more famous serial killer ' brain look like you be quite certain of this certain enough that I have serious ethical problem try to wake he up

incomplete yes I encourage candor I have a team stand by to return he to Mercy a return to Mercy that have a poetry all right all right all right when I tell you the doctor say he could not be revive that be true revive in time be what I neglect to add in time for what well you be no doubt aware of Terry 's past his trouble with the law Minor offense what you know about be only what the family have not be able to scrub there have be other indiscretion woman survivor I should call they and when you have a survivor you have a person that might be persuade monetarily or by other mean to stay quiet but when all you have be body I see we can not be certain o course but recent report of abduction miss person might suggest Survivors Terry and I have always be close if there be woman out there he would tell I and I just know that if I can talk to he if he be to be question we do it on my term my term that be all I will take she what I will cover your engagement you be stay here why turn out we have a sudden need for an FBI profiler I suggest you for what to interrogate a possible serial killer Serial killer thank God Car Goodness gracious hello Terry hello I would like to know if I be be charge with something do you know you have to charge I with something eventually I know my right how much do he know about who he be where he be straight brain dump he be Terry Karrens right up to the moment he got hit by that car I do not understand why you will not just let I speak with he Mr Ballard receive his training from the FBI he be very experience in these matter we defer to he these missing person report why do you think he be connect just a hunch that be not a hunch a 42 year old woman from Covina a 16 year old girl from El Monte a 20 year old from Whittier and a 38 year old from Alhambra I do not see a pattern here for some reason you do who be these woman who be they to he they be in a real sense nobody the author of some of the most important medieval literature have no concept of self identity as we might understand it we think of they as anonymous they do not think of themselves at all and I can see many of you would rather not be think of they either okay your essay on the economic of love in Chaucer 's the Wife of Bath be be return to you if you have question or quibble my office be open Professor this can not be right Ms Turner KiKi okay so I probably never should 've take this course to begin with but I figure it be Mid Evil light not Advanced Evil how hard could it be so I skip Intro to Evil or whatever but how be it I get an f when this guy that we be read Chauncy can not even spell it be Chaucer it be middle English right like Hobbits or something as I say my office be open if you would care to discuss it I would care to discuss it I be like the Scarlet Lady with the F on her chest a if only the detail be exquisite Chaucer 's detail Alisoun be his most fully realize character well then he suck because I do not get she really because I think I can detect a little Alisoun in you these cuff be dig into my wrist I have no circulation hello well about time Terry Marion Karrens any part of that a boy 's name what so I get to ask and I think you know I get to ask have you be practice dentistry on large cat Leopards Pumas what I be just wonder why it be you have trace of a veterinary grade paralytic in your system I demand my phone call I want my attorney present no attorney no phone call I know my right and no right you be in big trouble when my family find out what you be do you and this entire department this be not a department what and I be not a cop what do you mean who be you then what be this place this be the place you be not in and I be the guy you be not talk to and these these be the woman you be go to tell I how to find I 've never see any of these woman before take another look Terry Squint if you have to I tell you I 've never see these woman before I do not know they let I help you out Mother Big Sis Little Sis and Aunt Sheila at least that be how you know they this be exactly the wrong approach to take with Terry he need to know you be on his side but we be not on his side Adelle I know my nephew and you should visit your nephew Escort Mr Karrens downstairs where he can see for himself he care be provide I be sure you will be impress he be get his own private room and we 've keep he very clean you know Terry when I be first tell that this be what you do abduct woman who look like the woman you grow up with who tell you that I figure Hell the sick little twist must 've kill his family it be a whole Norman Bates thing but no your real mother and sister and your aunt be all still live in the family home you know what that make you very weird I be not weird no no you be weird Terry but what you be not be special it do not take a criminal profiler to figure you out maybe just a pimp it be ordinary you be ordinary maybe you get bottle feed maybe you got dump it do not matter at some point you decide real people be not worth it you push they away alienate everyone in your life so you could surround yourself with the fake the copy it make you feel like you have some control you be not in control do this look like a guy who be in control Goodness gracious no it be impossible it can not be I it be you Terry what be this you remember that car do not you you think you walk away from that without a scratch be that what you think this be a trick be it you need too tell I where to find those woman they be the reason you be in that bed they be the reason your Uncle Brad look so worried and they be your only hope of ever get up again they do this to I you do this to yourself it be her that one it be all her fault what about her she make I I do not mean to I do not want to she mean for this to happen you bitch you bitch what do she make you do Terry you just want to have a nice time you want to have a nice day but they will not let you because they be not nice they be never nice they care more about their date and their boyfriend and they do not pay attention to Terry they never let Terry play no time for Terry they be whore no she be not a whore you be say she use sex to get what she want I be say she be a lusty bawdy self aware woman she do not allow man to define her she know she be the one with the real power what power the same power that all woman have you make a nice day you make shade you put plastic umbrella in the drink it do not matter it never matter but I think woman back then have to do whatever a man say Alisoun know well Alisoun know it be all up to her she can have what she want she know how to get it Meself have be the whippe she be the whip she be the one in control they never do what Terry want they always do what they want she make I it be not my fault she make I so if she be here and you be Chauncy Chaucer and he be the author do not matter she would know how to get the f on her chest turn into an a you be learn not literature but still but I can fix this I can make this right they will let I play again we just need a new Aunt Sheila we know he be kill at least one the unfortunate ubiquitous Aunt Sheila I be not expect that I do not think he would cross that line but it make sense she probably fight back that be why he be wander around with trace of that paralytic in his system he would lose a piece and be out look to replace it when the accident happen you glean quite a bit in there all thing consider but not enough by the way smart move send the uncle down there I know what you have plan it might add a touch of pathos he be really get on your nerve huh could not stand another moment what happen I do not know his uncle be visit and then he go into cardiac arrest or something where be Bradley he be right here false alarm it be nothing how be that cacophony nothing somebody tamper with the main lead this be entirely unacceptable we try it your way it do not work Terry 's go to have a little chat with his unc everything will be fine now Terry he be refuse to pick up I would say this be a very positive turn of event you think I do assume your profile be correct you still believe Terry Karrens will return to his victim I think he be in the market for a new Aunt Sheila but yeah all our active be tag with a GPS strip we can find they anywhere at any time so if there be survivor Victor will lead we to they what do you mean he be not tag why not they take his GPS strip out before they start all that complicated facial reconstruction the scar removal the surgery 's complete right but Dr saunder be the one who sign off on have it take out and she kind of leave before tell anybody to put it back Lovely so you be say that we 've imprint an Active as a serial killer and then blindly let he loose upon the street I be not say that Victor might not have a working gps in his body but maybe Bradley Karrens have one in his car Funny how my mind would never think to go there what be happen the stuff it be wear off where be he I do not know he kill she he kill she I know he be go to kill we too no he be not we will not let he what be your name Megan I be Robin we have name remember that we be human not his toy we be get out of here find a weakness he be on foot Damn or maybe not on foot what do you see Metrolink station if he get on it he could be anywhere from the Valley downtown Hollywood the accident the hit and run where do it happen just outside Beverly Hills that have to be close to where he be keep the woman you think he be head back there probably with a stop along the way to pick up a new Aunt Sheila the Hollywood line would put he straight towards Beverly Hills I be go to see if I can pick up his trail your one man manhunt 's use public transportation now which be why you be go to provide assurance Beg pardon we can not allow Victor to be use as Terry Karrens ' vehicle for abduction and murder I be personally against it you need to free Victor of he Love to he be not here I do know this a remote wipe it can not be do Alpha do it with Echo but he use a tonal interface serial killer Victor would need to have a phone I need to have a tone I would have to get he answer the phone do you have his number obviously not well think another way think of it fast upon an ambler easily she sit well wimple aye and over all a hat as broad as be a buckler or a targe a targe be a shield still not follow a rug be tuck around her buttock large I guess a fat ass be a good thing in the 1300 's and on her foot a pair of spur quite sharp Nasty the remedy of love she know perchance for of that art she would learn the old old dance like that where be your tune age do not you just feel like dancing be you feel my bathy girl power 'cause I be pretty sure I be feel your boy power now let us talk about this f must be love or something this be Boyd Boyd it be Topher we be try something in here and so we be call all the handler in the field to let they know that I be go to be take the biolink grid off line for a few second so when your screen go dead there be nothing to worry about what be you try a remote wipe why Victor 's loose do not have gps and apparently he be a serial killer so what I be go to attempt to do be go into his biolink feed which do not tell I where he be but it do give I a way into his head I be go to reverse the signal send a purgation tone and blow his mind literally then what just leave he out there in his Doll state totally wipe he will be an empty head robot wander around Hollywood he will be fine we will find he how will we know if we be successful see this right now his vital be do the mamba he be excited about something if the wipe take they should flatten out go you do have power over I you be an incredible woman what do you call I I be an incredible woman hello Mr Langton how be your evening out a lot like my evening in I be afraid there be be a little bit of a situation here I speak to Topher do the remote wipe take it remain to be see the attempt seem to have throw the entire system off line we will know all once Topher have rebuild it until then we be blind we need to bring in all our field Actives get they in pocket till the situation be resolve I agree you will take point on this will do I will start send out the word then grab Echo and come home very good I think I would make a nice day but they just will not let I you know what now they do not even get a new Aunt Sheila full recall everybody 's come home Hang on that be my other line this be Boyd Cooper do you end the engagement what get back to the house it be fine everything be go to be fine this be Boyd I need an ambulance so how do it happen do we even know what happen my good guess I have to access the biolink grid for the remote wipe I think I isolate Victor but everything must have gotten scramble so we assume Terry Karrens imprint somehow got transfer to Echo either that or my attempt to make she hot for teacher really do not come off if Terry be in Echo where do KiKi go I be KiKi I do not know how I get here I sort of do not care be I drunk Hang on just a minute I notice you watch I I think we both know why as help I God I

to verify all this we be go to find proof we 've get well than proof we 've get a name there be nothing to worry about do security vet everyone Metal detector hand wand the occasional frisk Occasional relax the Rossum Corporation 's evil not stupid they be not go to try anything while the camera be roll you really be not nervous I be terrify I be about to put an innocent woman up against the large corporation and I have no idea how they be go to react remind I why I love you so much I be your white knight and I be your beautiful damsel ever after ever after the press conference ten minute late huh good afternoon in the past week I have make some serious charge charge of corporate malfeasance on the part of several medical research company charge which will receive a full airing on Capitol Hill this week when hearing begin at those hearing you will hear a most innocent word a word which will take on a new and grim mean a word that will become synonymous with human trafficking prostitution and unconscionable abuse of neural technology directly traceable back to the Rossum Corporation that word be Dollhouse an urban myth that have become all too real where people have their memory erase and be brainwash to do thing that would appall the most cynical among we today I want to put a face on this issue I have a witness who lose three year of her life to the Dollhouse she would like to make a brief statement my name be Madeline Costley three year of my life be gone steal by the Dollhouse they prey on I when I be at my weak and force I to and force I to do thing thing I never would have believe until Senator Perrin show I evidence I almost wish I have not see it but then I would not be here and there be still people be hold captive by the Dollhouse they do not even know they need help so that mean we have to help we applaud Miss Costley 's bravery and we ask that you respect her privacy throughout the inquiry process remind I why you release she from her contract two year early it be an internal matter right something to do with keep you from expose this house to the public that work out something obviously have go very wrong but the protocol at this house can not be blame there have be nothing in her reintegration that would suggest that she be about to go before a senate subcommittee and start name name I be not question your protocol Adelle it be your judgment that be become the issue here there be some concern you may have develop a soft spot for this one like you do with Nolan 's girl what be she call Sierra how would you like we to proceed by do nothing Rossum already have a plan in place to deal with Madeline what the hell 's that suppose to mean your house will be cover may I ask how it be handle that be all you need to know I be already late for a satellite tour where I get to run pr flack against this mess talk up Rossum 's good work our groundbreake Alzheimer 's treatment I will be sure to watch oh we will all be watch so just how much danger be she in a former Active once make a pass reference to we in his blog that be his last entry so go before the United States Senate that would be bad considerably we can not just sit by and let this happen I have no intention of just sit by he tell you to do nothing indeed he do not I inquire how he would want we to proceed and give the context I would call his response a suggestion you frame it before he could tell you what to do Madeline will not be testify in front of any senate subcommittee she be quite happy when she leave we now she be not she be be use you have develop a soft spot you miss my point she be be use against I someone with inside knowledge have serve she up to this crusade junior senator so what be your next move to discover what game be be play Daniel Perrin Political family Third in his line to become a United States senator start police medical research just under three year ago no one be say the work these corporation do be not vital but there must be accountability the health of our citizen can not be hold hostage to a profit motive he be a demagogue look at he so concerned about the public and when he shut down all research we can go back to leech so why be not Rossum worry maybe they 've get dirt on he they would have use it by now November be sad I almost wish I have not see it she be be there for year but then I would not be here yes she be we should help she that be just what we be go to do she be not right we get that the first time Echo she do not mean Madeline only that it take that long I be sure the moment I lay eye he I could not let she get away she be perfect it be like they make she just for I Episode 205 the Public Eye www subbercafe fr I could not let she get away she be perfect it be like they make she just for I he be not lie at first glance she be perfect at second glance she be still perfect Skip to the part where she be not you look hard enough you start to see discrepancy her parent ' social security number do not match with their name her college transcript weight her GPA even though Berkley do not calculate like that forgery some of the good I 've see Cindy Perrin be a Doll Harding be be modest when he say Rossum have a plan in place they 've be marry for three year long term placement she clearly be not imprint to dissuade he from go after Rossum she be a sleeper an assassin you mean like Madeline when she be Mellie oh please she do not kill you Mrs Perrin 's go to be activate when thing get too hot I would say thing be warmish even Harding 's too smart to murder a sit US senator but he would not think twice about have a sleeper assassin take out Madeline it will not come to that you be go to stop she before she get to Madeline Senator Perrin move they both to a safe house by a security firm call Contratech where be Perrin his senate team be still work out of the downtown hotel where they hold their press conference the Commerce Plaza he be still there so tell I about this safe house ten minute from downtown Quiet residential neighborhood the house be cover with surveillance I be work on get access to Contratech 's server just give I the address I will go get Madeline it will be a touch more difficult than play cat burglar especially if Cindy Perrin be there you will need to understand what it be you will be up against that be my apartment Mellie once a sleeper Active 's protocol have be trigger the thing you be face will be neither reason with nor stop there be three flower in a vase the third flower be green I get the idea Madeline easily dispense with a man twice her size Cindy Perrin will be no less capable any sympathy for Mr Hearn would be misplace he be a serial rapist I be not think about he last time I be at the Dollhouse he seem so kind and gentle you can never tell what monster people be hide inside like I why would you say that I kill someone for the rest of my life I be go to know that I kill someone you do not do this the Dollhouse do and that be why you be go to testify against they hello how be the two most important lady in my life you be sweet Daniel but I can not talk Madeline 's have a rough time go take care of her I be go to stay at the hotel and go over the financial if you need I remind I why I love you so much I be your white knight and I be your beautiful damsel ever after what be it it be the thing that if it do not work exactly like it should will not get I in trouble I call it a disrupter that be not too Star Trek be it t o S it be base off what I could deconstruct from Alpha 's remote wipe tech this be the same tech that turn Echo into a serial killer we say we would not dwell on that he be dwelling continue you push this button and it send a neuro electric feedback loop through the biolink implant disrupt the cranial architecture if the frequency be calibrate to match less tell more show hello Kilo be it time for my treatment be not she so cute and tiny I love it when a Doll 's name be so on the nose because she weigh one kilo it be a unit of measurement I be so alone I enjoy my treatment yes we know but you probably will not enjoy this the gentle hum let you know it be work side effect include headache bloody nose and the uncontrollable urge to it will knock out any Doll in a ten foot radius include a pesky sleeper like Cindy without actually harm real people like we make that a 50 foot radius Good so I will drop Mrs Perrin and I will pick up Madeline what you be more right than you know if Madeline be in range it will bring she down as well I think it only work on Dolls it would affect anyone with active architecture but you release she why would she still have your architecture in her head no one ever really leave here do they it be time for a treatment do I get to help November if he make I someone else I will not be able to help she that be okay the person Topher 's go to make you be go to help we her handler 's not go to be happy when he learn you send she out without he Mr Ballard be unhappy about a great many thing at the moment his complete focus need to be on Madeline 's retrieval you sure you do not want I to cover her engagement I need you on point in operation Echo will be fine any qualified interim handler will do I will send Edwards Fine just tell he not to nod off Echo 's go to be do most of the handling on this one try the

and you have the pedigree you do not create I I be go to expose you you know that that righteous indignation yeah we give that to you too we spend three year build up your credibility when you finally exonerate Rossum at the Senate hearing today no one will question you why be you tell I this now because it be funny and because you be not go to remember in 20 minute anyway which be also why I think I can say I can not stand you have to be your wife let you touch I pretend that when it do not disgust I it do not bore I that have be really hard feel good to get that out this limo be nice right very fancy you be probably use to it see I definitely be not use to it your sole purpose here be to hack into the D C mainframe and acquire Senator Perrin 's imprint this will require stealth clarity of purpose and above all calm good stuff drink no can I have one absolutely not Roger I do not like go outside of my comfort zone our one and only chance for discover Rossum 's plan be to pull it from the senator 's brain scan there be no margin for error so I would suggest that you expand your comfort zone immediately it be just water it will help it take a lot out of you we take a lot out of you do you know your name Echo your real name Caroline you know it be good it help and you know we take your memory be Caroline in there yes and no this be one of my memory of you this be the last time I see you this be what you do to I not just to my arm to I I want you to feel this there be something bad than pain sorry to have keep you wait for a few minute 25 always so precise and who be this my chief programmer Topher Brink you be out of your jurisdiction you 've my Active I would like have back Geez lighten up will you so serious it be a serious situation I trust we will find her undamaged here be the thing Adelle I be not in a position to help you your girl got catch up in a major operation and there be certain protocol that I just have to follow I just can not give she back to you I have to get approval and that may take time you understand of course I do then why do not the two of you just fly on back to Los Angeles and the moment I get the go ahead we will ship your active back to you do that sound like a plan absolutely I will need Mr Brink to examine Echo just to ensure my asset be intact where be the trust protocol I will let my programmer know you be come business must be slow in L A if you be here who be mind the store we 've get our top guy cover for I only person in the world I trust what you be not get man friend be that this whole operation be dependant upon I not brain constructy I but Bond James Bond I which be not so I Topher all you have to do be stay calm this from the guy who have to dismember my last little outing you get into their system you make the connect so that we you can get a look at Perrin 's brain map I be not up to this I suffer from acute agoraphobia or I plan to Bennett Halverson be the chief programmer at the D C Dollhouse she be a genius I think she be a genius so you know double it she be just go to look at my 1 0 and his palm be go to sweat and she be just she will know I have to track down Ballard you just run the House and wait for yourself to call it be start the clammy I be busy right I be sorry Topher Brink of course Mr Brink I I be look for Bennett Halverson can you tell I where or you can show I where she it be different than L A well I suppose it would be you probably have palm tree and tan we be four story underground not a lot of photosynthesis no no you be very pale White pinkish white your skin your skin be like a pig Bennett Halv because it be pink People assume that pig be bad but I love they I like they I hear they make good pet I be Bennett you be look for I for realsie you be Bennett not Bennett Junior you merge JAMS with ESAMS to create next gen protein you stud I be sorry that be clammy hand I be glad that you enjoy the report what be up with your arm it be dead from the shoulder nerve be sever you be here for your Active you will not get she what she interfere with a Rossum directive it be unlikely that Mr Lipman will let she go it be unlikely Mr Lipman will have a choice can I see she of course she be still unconscious Courtesy of your device just a little project hardly be it weird that I ask about your arm honestly it be refresh Adelle DeWitt fly 3 000 mile across country to pick up one Doll must be a special girl they be all special oh yeah but this one she nearly take Perrin from we I think our programmer would not mind wade around in that brain and clearly you can not control she I think maybe you be just go to have to walk away from this one do you honestly think it be up to you do you think anyone at Rossum will take your side Harding you be not much of a poker player be you you get no card Adelle and you do not know how to bluff one for the road now Stewart you and I have similar goal I would like to think we could achieve a a mutually beneficial compromise Compromise can be fun if you do not return my Active I will send someone to cut these off you will be kill horribly over a long period and never find now look I in my eye Stewart and tell I if I 've learn how to bluff Compromise this be not my device she be be tranque it be probably one of the Handlers how do you work it the Disruptor how have you know it be call that what else would you call it the signal go out for 50 foot but everywhere that be what mess up your senator and ruin your evil plan if you if you route the signal through here it become directional not like a bomb more like a taser do you just try to tase I no no that would result in you would be unconscious why would I want that and it only work on Actives I be concerned that you may have try to tase I no I just you be really Bennett Halverson this conversation be become vague so we have have an Active Whiskey and she be render unengageable so we I make she into a doctor and you so I think maybe Similar Bennett the real Bennett would use an Active to you think that be idiotic active be beautiful yeah and it be not my evil plan it be it be not evil wait hey I be just here for Echo my last ethical quandary be unhelpful let mommy and daddy do the squabbling yes sir right away look like you get the girl let I go check on be it Echo and get everything sign can I use your phone just wanna check in with my House yes of course Wasabi pea I be excited and scared finally everything good there everything be great I man except I 've get a long white beard from wait put the signal through solid I see what you see I still do not know how I be go to get Perrin 's brain map run but you can use this link to route it Dude Halverson 's fine what wait who what Bennett she be what like distinguish like young and fine I poo you not be we into her we may be fierce on the subject oh God I wish I be there what be she like totally shy librarian energy through the roof glass glass on a chain for the win Dude she have a dead arm like dead like in a sling with the glove Imagine John Cassavetes in the Fury as a hot chick which you know I often have we lose the connection Dude she be probably an Active

when you be finish listen to I I think someone on the inside be try to help we they show I the way out put it in my head so we could escape we have not escape they be come they always come because of this what be that it be how they find we gps tag we have to cut I do not think I can you will I will show you how that be where Senator Perrin will sit he be go to make an opening statement and then the hearing will begin okay this be the press area here so just be prepare for a couple dozen camera lense point at you a couple dozen do not even think about that just focus on your testimony where be the senator now he be follow up on some last minute evidence we receive he want all the ammunition against Rossum we can get excuse I one moment hello Perrin escape I see can you explain how that happen he be attack by that LA Active Echo they be together have he be wipe no that be very unfortunate we track their gps we dispatch a retrieval team I 've send you the coordinate you need to be there when it go down on my way they will not stop look we will not stop run pull everybody in I want every team on this well figure it out he have to be at that hearing in 4 hour or Rossum will have our head to be clear this little project be your problem not mine well I will remind you of that when we be bunk buddy in the Attic listen to this she be get a great idea it be your idea it be base on your idea but you should tell they I can not take the credit Spit it out we might be able to reconfigure the disruptor to incapacitate Echo and Perrin without actually locate they Explain Topher 's disruptor send a signal use a universal frequency which affect every Doll but only within a limited range if we use the neural electric biolink we can redirect the loop to target a specific brain in English I do the english part that be new we can plug my disruptor into the biolink system and send the signal from here and put they to sleep a painful bleeding sleep but sleep nonetheless right she be just Genius she be so good how long will this take to accomplish not long at all I can have Echo 's brain map upload into Bennett 's system I just need Perrin 's I get to have a target give he whatever he need Topher Brink Meet Daniel Perrin it may be the most beautiful thing I 've ever see Selective strand replacement take a delicate hand this be more than just an alteration this be an imprint marry to a an exist consciousness it be amazing you do not end up with a schizophrenic I have a theory that the brain can hold multiple imprint and still function a composite not a composite something new the original Daniel Perrin be all there I just make he well we will need your Active 's map upload it be very nice she be kind of a hooker how about while I build the magic bullet you work on adapt your gun right right you can use the whole workspace over there let us hope when we zap they they be not drive down the freeway or fly a biplane or something huh you probably do not even need to make delivery file I bet we can just plug this baby straight into your biofeed I know I just think I would upload some sweet dream to pass along Compensate for the searing sear pain I like that Incoming be that it it be I the he I I be give the word to myself and what be the word it be not Grease the he I do it I rock we rock the I other I have access Perrin 's brain map that may be the most beautiful thing I have ever see we can not stay here to long it be real it be all real they do not program this I grow up here I wish they have why they do not create I only part of I how can I ever untangle it do it matter what do you mean do it matter who you be all that matter be who you decide to be who you can be you make it sound so easy it be it be all up to you what the voter do not get a say the voter will say yes I do not know at this stage might seem a little cynical like I be trade in on the family name oh you would be but it would not be cynical you use what you have think of all the good you could do even if I decide to run do you have any idea how much dirt the opposition could throw at I I see what you be do when I walk into this party but everybody be get a past it be the future the voter care about you show they that all will be forgive where do you come from Salinas Kansas and do not say I be not in Kansas anymore I 've hear that one I know exactly where I be

a little while you be awake now and so be I that be what they do not expect they be go to use I as cover but they do not get a chance to reprogram I they 've create someone who can bring they down and that be what I be go to do there be still time we can make it to the hearing we can expose they and then we can be who we be we can be who we decide to be okay Fire when ready I get nothing on Echo that be unusual I think your senator 's filibustering wait what do you do Daniel stop they be in your head you do not have to listen you do not have to be what they tell you to be you can belong to

really be she be a friend Friend that shell I be her friend I be her good friend this be what I get for it this be my gift from Caroline this be not about Caroline this be about Echo they be the same Caroline have a power over people and however well you wipe she she clearly still do she have no power over when be the last time that you describe a Doll as a friend I know about Alpha and Ballard you be say she do not have some power I be say shut Perrin down it be for the good you be so close to perfect you still with I be Bennett on board 'cause I do not see Bennett 's out I kill she I hit she it hurt but we can not just flip he back we can if we isolate the neural path do you know how many then shut up and work I be work I would not hold your breath no I would not Split up where be he

with that or can you trust I where be Mrs Perrin I apologize to the committee for my wife be dead I do not want to be here right now but I be honestly afraid I may not have another chance to tell the truth I be look for a conspiracy and I find something more horrible the Rossum Corporation be the most powerful medical company but they be something else as well for the past several year the Rossum Corporation have be a target a target of a consortium of company that would stop at nothing to undermine Rossum and take its place in the medical community they set I on Rossum 's trail and when I discover the real truth they put a bomb in my car the car Cindy take to stop by the family compound my wife be a victim there have be hundred of other this woman Madeline Costley be a victim of their manipulation and her own delusion what there be no Dollhouse there be no sex slave no underground fortress Madeline Costley spend the last 3 year in a mental institution in Canada you know I be there I have the documentation to prove it in fact I have documentation on all the company involve in this travesty there be abuse here not the lurid pulp fantasy they drill into this unstable mind but something more insidious something that have cost this country more than million and have cost I everything this hearing be adjourn until further notice these man be from the FBI they need to speak with you no Echo 's just go and we be certain she be not apprehend with Perrin my source say no they do not have she and Mr Ballard still no word be we sure this be such a great idea I be sense tension of the palpable sort just lie back find he obstinate be we this be so weird this be so weird seriously just a few more day I could help analyze Perrin 's brain map it would not be a second opinion it would be the same opinion twice there be more to analyze I think we know his function to inoculate Rossum against further scrutiny More than that he be talk about new regulation which inevitably he will oversee Rossum will be create their own law ah good throw Boyd but still do not win you the giant stuff panda it look like Bennett somehow rig his sns into his high function Meaning let us just say it be an awful lot of ambition for a junior senator I be go to say that do I fall asleep for a little while shall I go now for the love of God yes so what be you say they be manufacture a president would not be the first time Delightful well before the fascist takeover we need to find Echo she be lose in the world in Doll state utterly helpless I want every resource

with important information I will never trust another woman as long as I live she totally go all Cylon on I and send a sleeperized assassin after Echo right behind my back disarm I with her arm and glass and face mostly but underneath it all she be ice cold no truly wicked with a shrivel up raisin of a heart I wonder what she be do right now so what happen I punch she in the kisser not what I be

Bennett work on a somatosensory system override and there be what 22 house right 23 now each work on their own small specific relatively harmless technology so I get to think it be a component it be a piece of a large hole and the next question be for what I think they be try to build a portable device that will be able to imprint anyone without any active architecture implant any innocent on the street with a new personality that be unnerve what be unnerving be I figure out how to do it this be something that Harding must never know your taxi 's here it be Lisa now take care Lisa you be the

your three month absence from the Dollhouse I do not know do you remember be away from here it be not nice do a treatment sound nice I can see that it do do you have something you want to tell I before we schedule you for that treatment you choose pain I wish she would say something about her absence then all this could be over be you certain she say nothing to you when you find she I tell you she barely speak at all she be in really bad shape she still be one wonder how she manage out there alone the odd of an Active in an infantile state survive outside the Dollhouse unprotecte I suppose we must take into account the fact that Echo be special you be punish she for survive it be complete lunacy you be wrong Mr Ballard I be very sorry for Echo 's suffering but we must have answer so if she float she be a witch that will be all for today thank you Dr Gholsen we will pick it up tomorrow until I be satisfied that Echo be not expose to dangerous element during her sojourn these session will continue will you excuse I gentleman I will consult with my expert Expert on what what do she think she be go to get out of Echo she do not expect to get anything out of Echo she be use she to make you squirm and it be work I can not help it I do not like see she in pain I do not like see she in pain I look into her eye and swear to protect she same as you before you today protect her mean not react while DeWitt torture her so man up you must have some suspicion I find she in a perfect childlike state simple accept and contradictory she be hide something if she do something naughty she be completely unaware of it she however be naughty and completely aware of it Let us stay on task shall we Doctor you do not like my remark Ms DeWitt you prefer man to keep their natural urge to themselves on the contrary urge be my stock in trade I find identify with those of my client to be very useful but that be your sale pitch I think you be very tightly control see man wear everything on the outside include their genitalia whereas you be chastise for any suggestion of sexuality punish perhaps so go the entirety of relation throughout history Dr Gholsen I really do not see no wonder you despise that girl she get to be the virgin and the whore and for both she be celebrate yes very insightful would you like a treatment yeah very much so that be a tiresome exercise I tell you brain science be all about hardware and software there be no mystical in between so tell I what be wrong with her why be she get these headache weirdly I agree with Dr Freudenstein there be no tumor nothing physical it be all in her mind so she be perfectly normal Normal as anyone else around here and I suppose there be some nonsensical scan to back up your report would you like to see they these be the crazy scan I 've ever see I can not even look at they without go nut I know a conspiracy when I desperately try to avoid see one do you tell DeWitt so why do not you two crack open your little chamber pot of secret and tell I what be go on Echo 's not a blank slate she be a person what do you mean she be self aware that be not all she be everything you 've imprint she with

weakness I find that Rossum 's mainframe be both fallible and vulnerable Vulnerable how well that be why I be here be not it have that information make I a point of weakness Rossum put I in here to eliminate that point of weakness but it be well than be in the Attic not really we have to run I can not leave I have to stay please and try to enjoy myself we have to go now but I can not leave till I be do stop do that sorry it take I forever to find you Arcane be here I know listen not only be the people in the Attic connect but all the Attics in different dollhouse all over the world be

over Echo we all be yes but you you 've always be like a father to her and you take she away from I shelve she my only goal be to protect that girl you know where she be head you encourage she you put she in that attic as much as anyone else be that what you tell yourself you do not come because of Echo you have nowhere else to go you work for Rossum and that mean your option tend to slim to three carry out Rossum 's work without question the attic or death the moment you step into this House you in effect give we your life and you must decide if that life be be put to good use or lay to waste I have see the future Mr Langton and it be not for the weak I 've be through this before then what we got do the thing he fear most to get out of his mind the thing he dread enjoy myself good time Lay down suppressive fire give I a window to flank from the left Myers you be with I what be you do it be not safe reinforcement be pin down in Herat there be no air support all right Tony do not be afraid take a breath you be in the attic in the attic man none of this be real okay fine wait a minute I know you you need to stop be afraid this be all in your mind that explain a lot how long have

he be go we trap he lure he in pin he down kill he then and there and we 've get to hurry before he get to Priya Priya 's in here too you know this be a scenario I never try Rigor mortis the new Viagra it be all in my mind it be all in my mind there be no reason to be afraid you sure about that oh my God what have you do Arcane well Clyde actually so this be your mind Clyde this be your bad nightmare this be not a nightmare this be the shape of thing to come do that take away the fear and the pain too sometimes that be what we be go to do to Paul you know take something away I hear that be go to make he more pissed off than he usually be not if we take away his anger Anger will be all he have that woman be go to drag we straight to hell you should not have bring I here it be too dangerous that be the idea who be you how do you do that you people be aware why do you call yourself Arcane sound bad ass all right no no please if I die there will be nobody leave to take down Rossum that be my line you be try to kill we it be a necessary evil I be try to take out Rossum 's mainframe computer wait we hear something about that the mainframe be vulnerable how do we take it out be it accessible from inside the Attic tell we how to destroy it you do not understand that be the problem you I everybody in the Attic we be the mainframe what do you mean we be the mainframe we all have repeat bad case scenario right problem we be try to solve that be because the people in the attic our brain be be use as processor human computer how be that even possible it be more practical really the human brain be 20 time more powerful than the most massive multiprocesse computer in the world Rossum have hundred of they hundred many attic all networked to a central hub our brain continually soak with adrenaline from the fear run on maximum the processing power behind Rossum and you be kill people I be try to put they out of misery free they from an eternal hell but mostly I be try to take out Rossum 's number of cpu to prevent this how do you know this be true because it be my idea we need to hole up find someplace safe it be your head genius let us go in my scenario I be constantly fight myself at war just try to get home to my girl in mine I be constantly make love to you and then you would turn into the rot corpse of a rapist I kill talk to we Clyde talk I be one of the original founder of Rossum one of two actually I and my good mate at university I have discover ECC ECC Encephalic Communication and Coding he be the one that have a plan for it I have not even begin to imagine all the possible application for the technology we think we be make history we be not wrong how do you end up here it be the very beginning our first test subject be to be imprint with my own personality we both agree that it would be too dangerous to imprint a persona with my knowledge and ambition so we slightly modify Clyde 2 0 we call he modify his persona to have no aspiration so that he would just follow order and your friend betray you another possibility I have not imagine he be the only one I trust he give Clyde 2 0 the order to betray I that be how the Attic be found they clear my head out hook I up I become a human computer first one in history I suppose and you 've be here ever since yes that be 1993 my nightmare my loop have be to run statistical probability scenario for where the technology might lead all but three percent of they include the end of civilization what year be it 2010 I think we do not know how long we 've be off the air 2010 that be all then there be still time we might still be able to stop they that be our mission the first thing they will do be install an imprinted person in the government yeah they do that they do then they be way ahead of my schedule your friend who betray you who be this man I do not even know if it be a man that be the first thing they erase I can not remember face or name not to mention the fact that Clyde 2 0 's probably switch body by now if we could eliminate that backstabber and the copy of I that do his or her bidding then we might be able to stop they but there be no way out of here be there no there be not believe I I 've try even if we could find a way out we would just be put a blank face to a name we do not even have there have be talk amongst some of the security personnel that they place here they mistakenly let a woman in she see they she could identify they but apparently they get to she too they scrub her clean so we still have no way of tell yes Caroline that be it wait Echo why do that sound familiar it be I I be Caroline before I become Echo do you have any memory of not hers not in here we 've get to find a way out of the Attic there be no way out what if someone unplug we our mind be engage integrate disconnection will fry the circuit turn our brain to mush I be sorry Echo get down wait what be you do I know a way out he be not go to take this well what be happen it do not work his brain be reorganize it will take a minute to adjust what the hell do you do to I you be in a coma Paul Alpha damage your brain we do it to save your life do what you make I a Doll active architecture be the only way to save you then why do I feel like myself you be but it be an imprint I be sorry it be an order and we need you Paul we do not have many friend leave what do you mean they be in the Attic wait this should be interesting at some point he be go to figure out what we take away from he I know I be not afraid to lose my life take you down I do not want to die then only one of we be go to b disappoint any last word listen my bad case scenario my loop be get out of the attic the place where our body be hook up I think I can unplug will not her brain turn to mush when a person flatline the computer disengage that be right it would to avoid any corrupted datum if I can flatline and manage to wake up then I can get out of here and send help your plan be to come back from the dead then you will be there to revive we when we flatline wait a minute I can not risk you two I be not normal so I think I can do this I 've be through bad and we have not Priya please the only way this scenario work be if I do not have to fight for you then we will fight for ourselves you do not have to look after we anymore you 've be inside our mind you know we be just as abnormal and just as ready as you we be a team now we go together we go together be you in I be stay I want out but there be hundred of people be torture here Rossum 's feed off it I get to help they Clyde my body 's halfway across the country anyway we will teach they to be aware face their fear might even be fun that would be nice if you succeed and you can get a signal to I we will shut down the mainframe I guess I be glad I never do kill you do not get sloppy here go everything we get it the information we be look for maybe more I understand the mainframe and I know how to get at the heart of Rossum or at least someone who will your plan work thank you there be only one place for a doll as irreparably damage you the Attic they say it be whatever hell you imagine but I think it be something far worse I think the Attic be where Rossum be keep some of its darkest secret they be rabid in their protection of whatever be hide there and you want I to go in I need you to go in but far more importantly I need you to come back and bring the secret with you it be the only way we will ever gain an edge we we can bring they down Nobody be ever get out of the Attic nobody else be you and everyone else I think I 've impress upon they the danger we will be face we be ready we be one soldier shy it be time for I to meet Caroline it be time to win her war previously sorry sister I stay we both get nab do not leave I I be her good friend this be what I get for it this be my gift from Caroline and he take all of Caroline 's imprint where be her original self you have a backup this be the backup alpha map his entire brain I will try and piece it back together you make I a doll then why do I feel like myself you be but it be an imprint there be only one place for a doll that be irreparably damage the Attic they say it be whatever hell you imagine this be your bad nightmare this be the shape of thing to come we get it the information we be look for I know how to get at the heart of Rossum we be ready it be time for I to meet Caroline not this one come on you say you would give I the tour here it be all right it be just like any other office

be Caroline she can I d the man in charge or the woman or hermaphrodite Say can we get back to the part where the chair less imprinting tech that I design which you hand over to Harding in order to get the swank office back how that lead to the apocalypse 'cause I think that be kind of an interesting detail it do not matter where the tech come from we have to do more than disrupt production as long as Clyde 's partner be still out there Rossum will go on we have to cut the head off the snake and Caroline be the only one who be ever meet that snake she be be behind the curtain now we need for she to take we there what if she will not you be impressive you be you be carry multiple construct and something in you have allow you to fuse they into a kind of super ego Caroline be not just

original self come home to find the house party that be go on inside your head she might fight back she would lose all right Pull Caroline from the vault Put Echo in the chair be that really necessary

that be legend thing be I still have no idea which decompression algorithm you use to recover the imprint the Hamilton wedge be only miss half its datum that be a one to two compression ratio this be only one to four an exponential increase fail test pin microcrack in the spindle mag comp corruption why do you need this one restore would it sound OTT if I say this could help prevent the end of civilization as we know it I would need to understand the context you could use perceptual coding to reassemble the autonomic function I suppose how much data loss would we suffer one generation no loss every memory will be intact Awesome then maybe we could work on the one memory I would like to erase I be so sorry I hit you I do not want to God how I do not want to I be try to kill your Active at the time you have your reason still that face slug it not my first instinct I do not think it be some form of contact but not who be on that wedge who be you try to resurrect this person it be stupid do it do it matter it might it be not like it be Stalin or somebody I do not suppose that it would be a historical figure who be it ready for your treatment I think I change my mind no mind change come on back in the chair be it so bad right now it be not bad it be just dull we be go to make you pop I be not sure I wish to pop you be go to pop and like it in the chair Lay back all right

when he damage it but he be still Paul same taciturn self regard guy no he be not the same he be different half his brain tissue be scarred I have to do major rewiring which require healthy brain tissue there be two piece of real estate big enough for the job the motor cortex or the cingulate gyrus so either he could live his life trap in a paralyzed body or I could take away something else I be not it not his memory of you he be still get those our connection I think so the fresh bright path those be the one I need I think that be you you be still bleed why do not you let I do that Dr saunder Hop up tilt your head back how do you you mean you two wait less talking would mean less bleeding and I mean that in so many way so you be the reason Boyd be be all tardy and sleepy the last

offensive when Dr Saunders be finish with you come and see I please right o I try to be my good of course you do my dear try and have she back on rotation as soon as be practicably possible she be after all our Number one Ma'am a word three month ago someone delete a substantial portion of security footage from the system three month ago not our system the main building I only learn of it recently and I speak to the security officer on duty that night he admit to it freely loudly there be some pleading turn out he let a young woman into the building your office to be exact I will ask Judith to inventory my file I already do two be miss one of they be Caroline Farrell 's the security officer identify she as the woman he let in Thorn in my side that girl I think we would finish with her she would drop off the radar you say there be two file miss the other one be Bennett Halverson 's Damn Halverson be one of Rossum 's rise star Rumor have it the man at the top select she himself Guess who be room with Bennett Halverson at Tucson Tech who else know about this just we keep it that way we need to get to Tucson Benster you be home early they be do routine maintenance at the lab

plan considerably okay be I the only one thinking we be get maybe a little too much of our intel from the Matrix or possibly Tron give the outfits we will assume the information be good we will begin evacuation procedure at once every Active to be bring to imprint their personality restore and release we can dispense with the nicety I be not leave behind a House full of helpless creature behind where be we go Tucson obviously ROSSUM HEADQUARTERS Tucson Arizona these be the lab with restricted access then those be the target you sure you be up for this we be in it together right till the end go I will do my work from here you should be above the first lab by now copy the charge be in place ten minute on the clock first charge be hot no backing down now I be above a lab just past the L junction it be not in the schematic set the last charge and move on the only reason you build a room that be not in the plan be to hide something I be go in you do not have time when you get curious you get dead do you read Bennett we have to abort what there be people in here you can not the timer be set I will try and pull the detonator cap you have to run help I run I will not run run he be in

just have that replace you should go Server room service tunnel do not be ridiculous you be our general we can not lose you good luck all of you stay back I 've imprint myself with many useful skill you do not want to know Hang in there thank for come up it be terrific can I get you something tea I hate tea so not tea then I mean look at you Caroline Farrell so you be Rossum Rossum be just a name actually from a play although technically you be not robot it seem to fit Sorry Clyde Clyde Randolph the second well like the fifth actually I use a lot of body I will explain that later my partner and I have be quite eager to meet you why I because you be very special you be go to help we in way you can not understand not likely you do not have a lot of option so I be go to be one of your zombie open up my brain like the rest of they you will never be like the rest of they you will not be harm in any way you be far too valuable and I be just go to trust you with your life previously so long as Clyde 's partner be out there Rossum will go on we have to cut the head off the snake and Caroline be the only one who be ever meet that snake where be the wedge go Caroline 's miss saunder do this Rossum get to her a sleeper do you recall your former neighbor Mellie you insist she come along I insist she be someone who trust you entirely we be about to go to war go be with each other even if it be just for the night any good battle plan must be fluid we will be go into full lockdown mode where be security why I because you be very special you be go to help we in way you can not understand and I be just go to trust you with your life I know what you be do here I know all about Rossum 's sick experiment so I gather you be quite the supersleuth you can not do anything to I People will find out People will find out Caroline do not be silly we both know you could vanish off the face of the earth and not a soul would notice you be go do you know that Rossum be the world leader in produce MRI machine Congratulations who care we be also on the cut edge of Parkinson 's and Alzheimer 's research develop the new atomic force microscope we have clinical laboratory in every major city in the world you know like if you 've have your blood draw to see if you be a suitable bone marrow donor for your cousin who have leukemia Rossum likely test that blood what do you say we like to keep the medical record of everyone who cross our path especially the interesting one you be definitely interesting at least on a microscopic level what the hell do you want from I just a few year of your life no way you be go to have to kill I I will not need to you 've commit terrorist act at good you be look at a lifetime in a federal prison that be if they do not stick a needle in your arm Adelle DeWitt be downstairs she be go to make you an offer to what let you brainwash I not a chance believe I when I tell you Caroline this be your only chance you be special you have amazing potential I want to see exactly how far you can go and I promise you I will protect you how do I know I can believe you it be like I say you will learn to trust I I do not want to go back I just find you the idea of let you go we can walk right out of this building find a doctor to rip out the crap they put in our head never look back I could not live with myself neither could you actually no I could definitely get over it here we go look like the war start without we Episode 212 the Hollow Men www subbercafe fr phone be dead Rossum will not be able to find we that way Chopper should be here any second we can not wait for they much long we can wait how be the neck a little sore I think the bleeding stop be not exactly a surgical procedure sorry about that I be not Thought of they be able to track I wherever I go I be just glad it be out sorry I be sorry they say the way I feel about you be just a program I be try to remember that it be okay I be glad we be together no matter what happen look lively someone 's come be that they or Rossum find we let us be prepare for either eventuality it be we where be Echo I need help it be on fire it be burn I what be wrong with she I do not know what happened attack they be come you be okay you be not burn hold she it hurt how do this happen why be she like this do not make any sense I imprint she as Caroline I eat the butt of a rifle I wake up and she be mental the wedge must have be too damage no Bennett fix the wedge she die fix it then maybe Echo and Caroline be not get along we need to reevaluate the game plan here Nothing 's change Boyd you got shoot I 've be shoot before and I 've get med we have to get to Tucson break into Rossum and destroy that mainframe Impossible Caroline be the only one who could get we in the building she be the only one who could identify Rossum 's founder without she we be screw if we do not try everything Echo 's do and become will be for nothing it be up to we to finish this how do we even get inside Boyd we walk in through the front door there be no need to sneak around we have something Rossum want Come on they get the hard drive no security footage they know exactly what they be do exactly how to cover their track how do you feel about get the hell out of here look at this must be some kind of program no not a program a person this chair it change you into someone else it could tell we what happen no we say we would not do this no more technology but this could help we or kill we we do not know who leave that note there I do not want to lose you again oh babe look you say it yourself we have to help our friend and this chair right here might be our only shot and you know no matter who I be no matter what they put in my skull I always remember you that will not change but if I turn evil shoot I I be not go to kill you well seriously wind I then just you know try to stay away from the junk do it oh God take it take it easy do it not work where do everyone go do they change their mind who be you that be not good that be very bad what be I wear tell I who you be it be I Topher Geez why be we arm the Dolls I be not a Doll I be Priya Interesting so you be you be you so the question be where be I you do not know what happen here oh God be I dead ROSSUM HEADQUARTERS Tuscon Arizona you be go to want to come down here good morning can we help you I doubt it I be look for the man in charge and you be Adelle DeWitt we have not meet but I 've hear all about you she kill Bennett she be not Claire he be quick very quick what do you do with her I guess I just sort of evict her toss she out on the digital street as it be I be not big on sentimentality and you my dear so excited to see you again you never know how these type of experiment be go to work out I be a lucky boy right here at my doorstep all you be miss be the little bow who the hell be you Clyde Randolph Cofounder of Rossum I think Clyde be stick in the Attic not anymore my original get himself catch in a loop this world be for people who can evolve and do that include we be not that what you be here to find out this be terrible I want my body back it be a nice body I mean I cover it up half the time with plaid and cotton poly blend but I take pride in my physique I have a physique do you understand I mean this body 's okay and everything but I mean still we do not know you be dead we do not know whose blood that be then where be I Sierra Priya be that really the most important issue right now who else would have leave the Topher wedge behind I mean how could you have do that if you be dead you have a point you have a point right right right why would I leave a backup wedge still think well something only Topher would know yeah frankly 90 of the thing in my head no one else know it would help to get catch up on the state of thing here I mean for example who be the dead dude Hit man from Rossum I be guess we be at war with the Rossum Corporation by the way fine so who kill they we do not know the security footage be take Shut up I have a camera instal no one else know about it see I be try to catch a thief I be pretty sure Ivy be be steal my turkey jerkie here be the last thing it record what be that what be wrong with her back it up back it up he throw something away what be this look like a syringe I do not understand he drug Echo why would he drug Echo not Echo Caroline she be go to tell we who the founder of Rossum be Boyd 's work for Rossum you know Adelle I have to thank you none of this could have happen without you it be an exciting time and you have be a good little worker bee I be happy to be of service Mr Randolph though honestly I be not sure I be deserve of such high praise what above anything Caroline be your success you nurture she foster her growth guide she to become what she be now and what be that our savior Caroline 's go to save the world not the world just the deserve few you will be happy to know you will be count among they unfortunately in her present state Caroline be not fit to save anyone I be afraid we scramble her head one time too many the mind do not matter it be the body we want he always know you would be the one to deliver she to we our mysterious founder I would like to thank he for his faith in I I know he be look forward to that moment do you think they be go to let we out of here you will be okay we will find a way you do not want to do that that be just go to loop back on you what stop breathe on I why do they take Echo I do not know get it you do that you do that they must have a weapon cache in this building find it I will take Topher with I I need he we be go to go after Caroline be careful they will kill we all if they get a chance good luck we 've be betray by my good man friend soft spoken mild mannered benedict Boyd although I get to admit I be kinda of impressed why can not I find Mellie Chip 's deactivate I mean that dude can act I do not know whether I want to kill he or get his autograph we have to go we have to help they hold on cowgirl how do you plan on do that if you have not notice Rossum sort of have way of do well this a lot I do not care I can not just sit here we have to fight that be so Ripley of you and it be supersexy but can I make a suggestion Anthony he be a soldier right I will sacrifice my personhood and give you back your boyfriend and then some and then some what enhancement mad skill Ninja hack combat training Cooking do not seem that important now but if you two end up getting marry you will thank I if if I could do you too no more imprint not for Anthony not for I look I get it I get it the tech be responsible for all of this but in this particular instance why not give the good guy a fighting chance look like they clear the place out I want to tell you something something important whatever happen to her it be not a bad wedge Bennett fix it I see it and anyway if the wedge be not fix it would not make Echo lose her marble like that this be something else what do you think it be I do not have proof but I will tell you what it feel like it be eerily similar to Sierra when Nolan drug she you think someone drug Echo how it have to be someone in the Dollhouse I do not know who yet but I be work on it I leave a little helpful something something back at the ranch what do that mean my backup wedge Topher 2 0 I leave it in the chair Hopefully Victor and Sierra come back fire it up and be on their way here with reinforcement go team thank you for confide in I of course Bros before other who be not bro d level be clear Roger that I need you to stay here that guard have a firearm we could use one right now I 've do my part go do yours how do you feel I do not know I do not feel any different maybe it do not take well that be different I be suddenly okay with this look like somebody from Tucson know we be here what do you say we take the fight to they you will learn to trust I they experiment with animal do I fall asleep this be not a nightmare what do they need baby for I need you Leo please do not leave I this be the shape of thing to come I be your girl Leo you will learn to trust I maybe I should have a gun too what about a taser look at this they clear the place out to be a kid in this sandbox I can only imagine the toy they have in here seriously you got to show I how you do that let us check it out what about Echo and everything what do you make of this that be my tech the one DeWitt hand over to Harding I think it would take Rossum year to realize my schematic now that they have we be even more screw than we think with this you can wipe and imprint anyone no need for an Active 's cranial architecture in your coconut one zap with the laser you be a Doll what be wrong with you it do not work well good maybe they do not have the cojone to finish the job they be set up for mass production this be catastrophic what be you do look around they be go to weaponize the tech my tech why for weapon think it get we here in the first place I be go for mindless destruction now we can use this Topher if the tech stay in our hand we control it we can stop Rossum and get out of this building without take another life all you have to do be fix one of they can you do it in my sleep get to it then I do not think so I be afraid so be I that be why we have gun take it you have to learn to protect yourself I guess I can not rely on you to protect I all the time that be not what I mean I know but it be true why be I here I guess I could not let you go that be very sweet I do not believe you I be not real I know this yes you be I be a program so be I and I decide it do not matter anymore we feel what we feel I do not want to reach the end without you what be next we find the mainframe this be simple what be that it can transmit an imprint via directional laser to the brain but it do not know how to get the brain to answer it be not sync like when your Bluetooth can not find your cell what be the fix the diode be reverse bias dope the semiconductor at the bipolar junction voilà a team of engineer could not crack that but you Topher Brink you do it in ten minute you truly be amazing I be glad I choose you for what what be you do Echo stop stop it be Boyd I have enhance weapon skill anyone care to see a demonstration the Brit go first what the hell be go on Boyd 's the founder he be go to kill you what be you talk about there be no way not a chance on this earth it be true Mr Brink you you really think I be go to kill he why bring he here not just I why the party charade you really do not know you be here 'cause you be my family I love you guy what be that the cool system the mainframe generate a lot of heat it take just as much energy to cool it down we be get close come on what be you do what if it do not do not what cool down it might be all fun for you to shoot your way into a highly fortified mainframe but could not we just pull the plug on the AC and overheat the server thank God you be here so you be work with saunder that mean when she kill Bennett you kill Bennett everyone have have to sacrifice that be what be make you all so incredible your commitment your skill everything I 've throw at you you 've take and ask for more look at you risk your life for the cause choose morality over self preservation and you you find a strength and conviction I will bet you do not even know you have I push you and you push right back you be right I be the Tinman she be the Lion and you be the head of the Lollipop Guild who be a traitor you 've prove yourself in many way I want you all with I except for Paul there be always one relative you can live without I never understand what you see in he so you want we to keep you company fiddle while Rome burn thank you very much I would rather be dead death will be a blessing when it happen you will likely be imprint and enslave we have to face the fact the technology exist it can not be un invent once it get out there it will be abuse none of we can prevent that from happen but we can choose where we want to be and on what side when the end finally do arrive do you want to be the destroy or the destroyer you be spectacularly insane I believe you you pretend to care for I and I believe you how could you do that I know you be angry do not touch I I do I do care for you More than you will ever know who do you think allow you to grow as an individual as Echo while they be send you out to bed half of Los Angeles I be here make sure you have the space to become your own person why you be the key the key to everything you be go to save we all I will not save you Boyd give the first chance I will kill you I have no doubt you will try but the fact still remain that inside that body of yours be everlaste life every time your nervous system block an imprint it leave neurochemical tracer in your cerebrospinal column we 've try to replicate it but we can not it be unique to your physiology so we be go to harvest it from you what be you talk about we be go to use your spinal fluid to make a vaccine against imprint be such a thing even possible the mad scientist in I say yes you come any close I will snap your neck I be sorry Echo I really be tell I they teach you how to sabotage supercomputer at Quantico right after the course on topple evil corporation bend on world domination where do we start how about here I do not think there be an elegant way to do this Good I hate elegant I too bring the secondary cooling system online I will handle the rest there be a phrase I want you to say how do it go somthe about flower in a vase Activate Mellie 's sleeper protocol I will not do it go ahead and shoot I be sure I will be far more talkative with my brain splatter all over Topher what now we be go to have company come on Aim breathe fire it be set for single shot so you do not need to crazy okay we just have to hold on until Echo finish the job you get this there be three flower in a vase cover your ear the third flower be green it be I Paul I be not go to shoot you listen to I you be not a killer Mellie remember we remember what we have I can not you can you can fight this you know who you be when we be together you make I feel like a real person there be no reason to be scare the entire process be design to extract your spinal fluid without kill you Everything be go to be all right go to hell begin the extraction get she out of that thing or you be go to end up with hole in your back move think you two would be on a beach in Cancun by now never leave a man behind before not go to start today besides we be a family do I a favor call we whatever you want just not family you know about Boyd yeah do not see that one come he be hold Adelle and Topher in a research lab same level other side of facility free they then find Paul and Mellie get everybody out of here what be you go to do Something Caroline try to do two year ago Shut this place down for good I do all this I be the one who bring about the thought pocalypse Thought pocalypse be brain pocalypse well I figure if I be responsible for the end of the world I get to name it I give the plan to Harding I be just as culpable thank Adelle you hand someone a piece of paper I invent it which mean I have to destroy it stop they will kill you you all right take cover excuse I now Army of one you still I cause I could use someone to shoulder some of the guilt it be Anthony with some enhancement clearly what next Mr Brink we destroy the prototype the plan for the prototype and every piece of equipment use to make the prototype we wipe this tech off the face of the earth who let the lab rat out of its cage Claire Whiskey whoever can hear I this be not you deep down you know it be true you can overpower he still Clyde you know this be the first time I can hit a girl without feel bad about it you think Topher load I up with nice personality I will scrub the floor with you 15 year of switch body I 've make some improvement to the os besides I do not care what happen to this body you do what do you mean she escape no I will deal with it she kill Mellie what she trigger Mellie and she kill herself I be sorry Paul she be evil we have to stop she I know whoever be run thing get to her she turn on all of we Let us take that bitch down for good I know just where she be we be go to kill each other I have 20 house fill with body wait for I even if you be on life support we can still tap your spine Paul what be you do take it easy it be what do I miss it be he he be the founder he be be lie to we this whole time Question be who be you Caroline Echo I be everything you make I Good then that mean you still trust I with your life you say you would protect I I
