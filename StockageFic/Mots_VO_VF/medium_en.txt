to treat but with leukemia with cancer I mean in theory it be already in there wait to happen right I be not an oncologist but that be kind of a simple way of what if I have have it or my mother have have it be not there thing you would be do test you would be run to keep an eye on it in the child but you do not have it and as for your mother but if we do Allison the kind of test you be talk about be invasive painful it be not something you would want do to a child unless it be completely necessary and they be expensive you know insurance will not cover they unless there be some credible diagnostic rationale you know forgive my ask this but do Joe know you be here talk to I about this I do not want to alarm he till I know more Allison I have to be honest with you this this this be

be there not to understand the doctor say she be fine and for now she be he do not say she would always be fine there be no way he could possibly know that but I know that just like I see Ariel give Marie that tear up teddy bear no Allison even though it just happened just got tear up a few hour ago please listen to yourself that teddy bear have nothing to do with anything you be not listen that tear up teddy bear have everything to do with everything I see it last night before it happen in the same dream that I see our young daughter die Ariel say you and she go into the garage and you find that tear up teddy bear and she want to give it to Marie and that be how I know this be go to happen you see no I do not see actually Allison you be not make any sense oh really after all this time be you say that you do not believe in I you do not believe in the thing that I see or the thing th I feel of course I be not say that I absolutely believe in you I be not question what you see it be your logic that make no sense I will prove it to you Joe what be you do I be save our daughter 's life what be you talk about whisper I be go to go and I be go to take that bear and I be go to burn it in the backyard do not you see look accord to your logic if there be no bear in the garage 20 year from now then there be nothing for Ariel to give to Marie when she go into the hospital so maybe she be not in the hospital 'cause maybe she be not sick whisper you be mock I no I be try to get you to see how irrational and potentially dangerous destructive your thinking be look Allison hey look listen listen sweetie look you may be right about this she may be fate to die before her time but what be the point of living for she and for we if her whole life be spend chase a tragedy that we be not sure be ever really go to happen and which for the time be we can do nothing about I will not do it I will will take that bear from she and I will burn it in the big bonfire you have ever see if it will convince you to forget about what you see for the time be just forget about it until it actually happen if it actually happen till there be something that we can do about it do you have any idea what you be ask of I how hard it would be for I just to pretend that everything be fine I do not know if I can wait wait I be not ask you to pretend you be miss the point I be not ask you to pretend everything be fine that be how life work everything be fine until it be not and then you deal with it otherwise there be no life there be just wait to die what the hell be Willow Elm Huh Willow Elm

love one and you say your good bye this be our fault you know I know it I tell you we should not have stay in that house sob we should not have stay in that house you okay I be fine actually I be good you be right none of it mean anything until it be clear what you can do to stop it what we be move I do not understand what be it exactly about this house that be go to make Marie sick be this about mold be this about radon it be not like we be close to any power line I do not know what difference do it make what you need to know be we need to get our little girl out of here we need to move Allison whoa do you understand what you be say move it be it be not that easy find a new house take time sell the house that we have be go to take time I do not even know what this place be worth People do it every day yeah people do it every day Allison but nobody do it in a day Willow Elm what Willow Elm 's the answer now what you be walk through be the Hacienda model of phase 3 here at

Allison what we do not even know if we can afford it it be a house it be not an impulse buy it be our child I know I know but we have everything we have work for tie up in that house now would not the logical thing figure out if no the logical thing the logical thing be this second figure out if the instant you find out your child be in peril before we uproot the kid you do whatever you have to save they as quickly as you can and you screw the money it make no sense I do not understand I do not understand how you could treat all of this as if it be not real we be talk about our child 's life no do not do that do not do what do not act like I be send our child off to a certain death just because I want to stop and take a breath and see if any of this make sense make sense do not do that either 'cause I be here I take the morningoff work I be in this with you someone have to ask these question well you do that Joe you ask those question so I have a question who be go to call the Realtor I do not understand what be the mystery Kid be a drug addict he die of an overdose I know that just the same I need you to perform another autopsy just because somebody wona free one during the silent auction at this year 's Police Fundraiser I know this kid I call his folk after we find he they make I promise the overdose thing it just do not add up for they wow parent do not believe their baby 's a junkie there be one I have not hear before no they know their kid have a history but he be also a medical student very careful very fastidious they just do not believe he would not know what he be take and how much to take I see so the city of Phoenix be go to pay for an autopsy to test the quality of a young dead addict 's medical education please if we be get a new house who be go to live here excellent question oh I speak with a Realtor she be go to stop by tomorrow and take a look give we an appraisal uh huh so if I and Marie be get our own room then maybe we should leave the bunk bed here for whoever move in right I mean they be go to have kid too right I do not think I can do it I do not think I can sell a poison house look truth be tell I do not want to move I do not want to sell this house I mean I will if I have to but just to play devil 's advocate we do not know for sure that it be poison I mean maybe it be not poison yet maybe that be something that happen in the future be you kid you really think that take we off the hook well I do not know Allison first you tell I we get to move because our daughter be go to get sick and die and then you tell I that you do not want to move because you can not bear the thought of somebody else get sick and die just tell I which side you want I to take in this argument 'cause I can not seem to find one thatork we can not afford to move unless and until we sell this house do you understand that we can not in good conscience sell this house not to a family with small child not to anyone God I hate this I be sorry I do not share your sense of unlimited responsibility for absolutely everything from now until the end of time what be you talk about when we buy this house it be to the good of our knowledge and to the knowledge of the people who sell it to we clean it may very well be that it be still clean as a homeowner I get a responsibility to make sure that the house stay clean to test it from time to time to make repair adjustment okay where be you go with this we will get the house test we will call someone in we will have they test the house for everything we will do everything we can to make sure the house be safe to sell I think that be all that anyone can expect I do not know or we stay and we never speak another word about it I do not understand I hear he die of a drug overdose really be that what you hear huh I be just tell you there it be Detective Thanks I will try and bring it back with a full tank of gas I have be wait for day Doctor Mrs Dubois as my staff have repeatedly

news out what if I be wrong about everything wow a moment of self doubt that be new that be different I kind of like it you be joke I be serious what if I make we go through all of this move make new friend shake everything up when I be already just fine and it be all for nothing then we will just have to tough it out you know big bathroom nice bedroom modern kitchen and if at some point I can free our daughter from the torture that be the community pool perhaps we will find a way forgive you Hmm SCANLON New house that be exciting yeah I get to drop off all the sign paperwork at the sale

upset apparently they be very close this be the woman from the District Attorney 's office I tell you about she be help I with the case Allison Dubois David Channing hi Doctor be you okay I be sorry you just bear an uncanny resemblance to a doctor I know an oncologist of course he be a bit old than you he could almost be your father he be not my father my father 's a postman now look David be a medical student yeah although I do not think oncology be in my future I do not think I would enjoy know that everyone who come to see I most likely already have a fatal disease you know but you never know yeah you never know I really have to get these across town of course I just want you guy to meet uh give I a second to walk she out nice meeting you talk to I what have you see it be nothing nothing that apply to this case what be you talk about you see he you turn white as a ghost it be nothing it be personal a really weird coincidence I really get to go all right I appreciate it sorry it be all for naught be you aware that Gary have a history with narcotic yeah we be friend I mean we live together we go to med school together of course I know I mean it be not something he brag about although I think he take a lot of pride in the fact he be able to put it behind he at least he say that he have I think that he have Gary mention you guy meet work in a lab last summer yeah lab tech work like petri dish culture thing like that do any work with lab rat Sure we do everything with lab rat you personally yeah that be what they pay we to do you know a big client come in with a chemical something they want to put in a food dye or something and they want to see if it be safe so you you inject the rat with it and then you wait and see if they die of course if they be lucky enough to live we dissect they anyway make sure they do not have anything wrong with they on the inside it be it be a fun summer do you remember what chemical you be test I remember that it do not kill the rat now what be all this about anyway we find a jar with three dead rat in it in the back of Gary 's car wow that be weird that do not sound like Gary not that I know what he be like I understand I just figure they must have come from the lab you guy work at I do not know I kind of doubt that these be industrial client big company they need to be sure their product 's safe all the rat tag and number we have to document everything we do to each and every one of they I mean it be not like you could bring they home as pet or I just figure it out you be the guy that Gary be always talk about the uh the cop that be his sponsor he like you he trust you I think he would have want you to know that hi Mr Dubois nice to see you again well my husband and I talk about it we decide we would like to move forward so I want to bring the application and our thousand dollar deposit Fantastic sit down we put our house up on the market and my husband be sit down with the mortgage broker tonight again I want to emphasize that for we speed be of the essence we need to move as quickly as possible all right then it sound serious let I dig out our construction progress list see which house be close to completion take you on a little tour the Sheldons be close on a three bedroom my husband and I just buy a two bedroom unit ourselves and do you have kid because this be a terrific school district here Mrs Dubois be you all right can I get you something maybe a glass of water yeah I do not know if you be aware of it but you get about 55 while you be out slip tape to your cubicle wall I think you ought to call your husband yeah I will I just need to be alone for a little bit so now would not be a good time to ask you a question well I probably just make the big mistake of my life put my husband and my kid through hell at the very least lose a thousand dollar deposit go ahead shoot you ever hear of chlorahydrofromaid why you want to borrow some turn out Gary work as a lab tech last summer he and David Channing be involve in a toxicity study of this chlorahydrofromaid okay apparently it be some kind of industrial byproduct anyway a small legion of rat give their life to demonstrate that the stuff 's harmless here be the weird part the company that commission the lab test be some outfit call uh Bunford Properties Bunford Properties your developer apparently they find trace amount of this chlorahydrofromaid in the well they dig to supply water to the place oh my God not to worry 'cause like I say accord to the test that Gary and his friend David Channing conduct the stuff 's completely harmless of course nobody ask the three dead rat I find in Gary 's car they might feel differently of course it be never our old house that be go to make Marie sick it be Willow Elm Willow Elm be the answer I be just ask the wrong question Mr Bunford yes Mr Bunford my name be Manuel Devalos I be the District Attorney for the city of Phoenix this be Detective Lee Scanlon with Phoenix PD do you mind if we ask you a couple of question about chlorahydrofromaid well what about it it be old news apparently some small quantity have seep into the aquifer the water supply we do some testing the quantity and the chemical itself for that matter pose no threat to anyone be there anything else I can help you with Good Lord what be that rat yeah I can see that rat that accord to the city medical examiner suffer from abnormally low white blood cell count their platelet and red blood cell be destroy they die of leukemia leukemia bring on by exposure to massive dose of chlorahydrofromaid say you thank for stop by gentleman if you have any further question feel free to call my attorney do the name Gary Albright re a bell what part of I be not answer your question do you not hear Mr Albright be find dead in his apartment we be investigate it as a possible homicide ok he be one of the technician that perform the test you order that jar be find among his personal effect gentleman we suspect that these rat die as a part of the test that your company order on its water supply we think that when Mr Albright and his lab partner David Channg come to you and tell you that chlorahydrofromaid test as a carcinogen you prevail on they to go back and run the test again we be guess you pay they to get the result you want the result you need to get permission to build here honestly I 've never meet this Gary I would not know he if I fall over he yeah well we think Gary have a change of heart we think he decide he could not live with what he have do he decide to come forward with proof of the cover up he perpetrate hey folk I be just finish up a tour with these gentleman if you will step inside the model home I will be with you in a minute so what be you say I kill this fellow gentleman if you have a problem with the veracity of the lab 's finding then you need to investigate the lab I be just a guy who build and sell house and really that

have you here be there a problem I guess not you know I be only able to tell you what I do because for some reason Mr Troyer and I begin have the same dream dream about woman alone isolate in some kind of trouble woman he would then attack and kill he threaten I he threaten my family it be not pleasant it be not something that I be anxious to repeat Allison the man be serve three life term there be no reason to believe he can do you any harm from behind bar but if you be uncomfortable I can certainly handle this myself lock buzz Sonny Troyer Mr Troyer perhaps you remember I from your

sexual battery on a 14 year old girl yes I make an error in judgment you want to tell we about that she tell I she be 20 and I believe she accord to her deposition she ask you several time to stop it look like the charge be reduce from rape to battery to avoid a trial because they could not prove their case because there be no case it be all lie when her parent find out about we they get angry at

head spin all the way around what you tell I last night you think that this girl might believe she have a demon inside her it seem like a perfectly legitimate question to I there be no such thing as demon say the psychic who talk to ghost be there thing that exist lie beyond this world yes absolutely demon be not one of they okay fine demon do not exist this girl do what be the big deal well the police be call the priest 's death an accident it do not look that way to I it look to I like Colleen Fitzpatrick might have kill he Fitzpatrick the department store Fitzpatricks they be member of Devalos ' parish the same one the dead priest work at Mm oh I would not want to be they at the next church picnic Sir I know you be on your way into court but I be afraid if I do not speak with you you hold up okay I do not sleep much last night but I guess that be to be expect I try put the time to good use I start work on a eulogy for Father Armando actually he be the reason I want to speak with you oh I be not certain that your friend 's fall be an accident I be guess that I be not the only one who do not sleep well last night you say the Fitzpatrick 's daughter be not well Colleen she have some sort of breakdown last year I do not know the specific but I seem to recall that it be serious enough for her husband to consider institutionalize she but Colleen 's mother would not hear of it they move in with she and she be be care for she ever since what do this have to do with do you know if she be prone to violence Colleen 's mother Helen show up for Mass a few month ago with her arm in a sling no one actually say it but the sense I get be that it have to do with care for her daughter be you imply I think that he be strike in the head before he fall down those stair he be hit with something I do not know what it be something heavy he be your friend I just I think you need to ask some more question be your name Joseph Pritchard Dubois yes it be be you an employee of Aerodytech yes I be have you ever discuss confidential work matter with anyone outside the company no I have not be you marry yes 13 year just a yes or no please right sorry do you ever work on company project while at home sometimes yes be there any way anyone at home could gain unauthorized access to company information no let us take that one again softly oh Manuel Helen I hope you will forgive the mess but we have a small army of policeman pass through she the night of Father Armando 's accident MAN Helen have you see Colleen 's new prescription I think I see it in the upstairs bathroom last night but now I can not seem oh sorry I do not realize you have company oh Michael you remember our old family friend District Attorney Manuel Devalos right of course from the wedding good to see you again Michael anyway I will keep look for those pill upstairs actually Michael if you have a moment I be here on business business that involve you and Helen just a few follow up question regard the statement you give the police the other night would now be a good time well it be a little after 9 00 and we have just finish our meal when Father Armando tell I that he have to make a private call and so I tell he he be welcome to use the study upstairs and uh I be fix a cup of tea and Michael be in the cellar replace a bottle of wine that we have not open and there be this terrible crash from the foyer and I race in from the kitchen softly and he be at the bottom of the stair alone alone there be no third party in the room no one other than you and Armando that be correct may I ask where Colleen be when this be happen she be in her room sleep the commotion do not wake she she would have a very challenging day we have give she a little something to help her sleep be something wrong Manuel I 've just come from the Medical Examiner 's office I ask they to take a second look at Armando 's injury they now feel that he may have sustain a blow to the head before he fall down your stair I do not understand how can they say one thing one day and then something completely different the next they also find a partial fingerprint in a spot of blood on the good Father 's forehead I be sure you will both recall that Colleen be arrest for erratic driving shortly after she take ill 13 month ago we run the fingerprint we have on file for she against the one we find on Armando and I be sorry to say it be a perfect match ALLISON absolutely I will see you tomorrow Devalos sigh Colleen Fitzpatrick do kill Father Armando they find the murder weapon at the top of the stair on a table it be a wooden bookend Ouch her mother and her husband find she stand over the body they know about it the whole time so what happen now everyone go to jail no Devalos feel like the family 's suffer enough he be not go to charge they with obstruction and if the girl 's find incompetent she will not even stand trial her psych evaluation be tomorrow I hope I do the right thing what be you talk about I do not know maybe it be my imagination it just sound like Devalos be sad now that he know the truth I think he prefer it when he think his friend 's death be a simple accident sigh this be one of those moment I be not sure that my gift be such a gift I know what you mean can I ask you something be you sure I be go to get this thing what thing what be you talk about the promotion yeah I be sure at least I think I be sure why it be just that everything be go fine this morning I be do great and then the polygraph guy start ask I question about home and if there be any way that anyone here could find out thing that they should not know and then I remember what happen the other morning what happen the other morning you remember what you say when you be get out of

last few week more delusional more violent during our session you 've be treat she for how long now 13 month then she be not under your care prior to her breakdown it be my understanding Mr Devalos that prior to her breakdown Colleen be a perfectly happy and healthy woman with no need whatsoever for somebody in my line of work I be sorry to say I never have the pleasure of meeting that Colleen it sound like she change pretty suddenly about a year and a half ago Michael come home from work and apparently she be hysterical terrify she have call the police thinking that she have see something monstrous in her house some sort of creature demonic creature there be always be a religious theme to Colleen 's hallucination demon possession I tend to attribute it to the fact that she be such a devout woman before she take ill but you be the one who diagnose she correct undifferentiated schizophrenia yes that be true but to be perfectly honest it be a bit of a catchall as far as diagnosis go I be sorry I do not follow it be use when the patient 's symptom very clearly point to schizophrenia but be so clouded that classify the type of disorder be very difficult if I may ask you Dr Randall what be so cloudy about Colleen 's symptom she be prone to delusional episode but have long stretch of lucidity in between true schizophrenia do not work that way it be far more consistent I 've also give she any number of neuroleptic drug that should treat the symptom of schizophrenia but none of they seem to have any effect on her I be sure there be some sort of explanation for this but I have not be able to find it hey hey you know that project that we be not do to do the one I can not speak to you about you should just forget about it whoa wait a second Marcus your wife she be some type of consultant right have something to do with the government she work part time for the District Attorney 's office why I do not know but she be a red flag for they a big red flag the polygraph

here oh she have to take a call she say she would be right back you be welcome to wait if you would like ALLISON how be she do adjust to her new surrounding uh it be hard to say Dr Randall prescribe some new sedative she be be sleep a lot sorry again about yesterday I be sure that be not an easy thing to watch you know what they say everything happen for a reason as it go I think it be exactly what the district attorney need to see make it easy for he to recommend that she be keep here as oppose to await trial in prison you be right everything happen for a reason NURSE Mr Barlow I be afraid I be go to have to take these take they we have a very strict policy here regard outside food I be sorry yeah but they be not food I mean not technically they be candy my wife have one or two every day she really look forward to they I be sorry there can be no exception no wait a second you be not listen to I my wife need those they be a great comfort to her I only have one today Father I want you to have the other RANDALL be there a problem here NURSE I be just explain to Mr Barlow that we do not allow outside food under any circumstance and I be just explain to she that it be very important that my wife have a piece of candy to look forward to every day I think we can make an exception just this once do not you but Dr Randall they be nothing nurse just little ball of sugar I do not see how they could do any harm you be the doctor Doctor NURSE excuse I what if I tell you I have reason to believe that Colleen Fitzpatrick be not sick at all I be sorry you think she be fake let us just say I do not believe that she be crazy and I do not believe she be possess but I need your help to prove it Manny test result just come back and Allison be right you want we to go scoop these monster up yeah I do no Stanley you be not listen as of today every account be suppose to have my name on it yes even Colleen 's trust well that be what power of attorney mean Stanley I be go to have to call you back Michael Barlow yes you be under arrest for the murder of Father Armando Aguilar you have the right to remain silent what anything you say can and will be use against you no this be wrong in a court of law my wife be the one who kill Father Armando if you can not afford an attorney that be Colleen one will be provide for you this be crazy Crazy huh it be a good thing I pick up a psychiatrist on the way over here her name 's Elizabeth Randall I think you two have meet HELEN Lysergic acid LSD we find significant amount of it in Father Armando 's system after we exhume he we be still run Colleen 's blood work but I be confident we will find it in hers as well I do not understand Manuel be you tell I she be not sick it be our belief that every last one of the symptom she be experience over the past 13 month the hallucination the paranoia the violent outburst be all drug induce the stretch of lucidity between the day that she would act and sound like the old Colleen those be just recovery period between dosing but I 've hardly ever leave Colleen 's side this past year I never see Michael give she a single pill a single injection it be the candy he cover each one with a liquid form of the drug and by make they her daily treat he could count on her self medicate the only thing he do not count on be Colleen offer Father Armando a candy during his last visit we believe that Michael kill the good Father because he know that once the effect of the LSD wear off Armando would start ask question probably realize that Colleen be be dose but all those doctor I take she to all those specialist why do not they ever detect the drug in her system LSD do not show up in most blood screening you have to know that you be look for it you have to run a very specific test and the fact that Michael 's partner in crime Dr Randall be Colleen 's primary physician do not help matter any she could always run interference for Michael throw any other doctor off the scent and all this cruelty just to get around a prenuptial agreement if Colleen have die or divorce Michael he would 've end up with nothing if she be to lose her mind however be declare incompetent he could stay married to she and still have access to your family 's fortune it be go to be okay Helen it be go to be fine Colleen 's work the drug out of her system for the very last time and it be my understanding that once she do she be go to make a full recovery you be go to get your daughter back so let I get this straight the reason we get to stay up an extra half hour and eat cake be because daddy got put in charge of some really cool project that be correct only you can not tell we about this really cool project because it be top secret that be also correct can we at least have a hint

a sympathetic victim I you have a villain we can all rule against unemployed drug addict with a criminal record and we have the add bonus of your involvement no small thing as far as my wife 's concerned I be ask you a direct question Henry Alonso kill I you close the case take the win and go home ok I be go to go out there tell they Monica kill you I wish you would not why because it be true because he love she and because it be not true you know Mr Gregory I be go to be honest with you the more time I spend with you the less I seem to like you but you be my first real for profit visitation from the other side so that count for something I be go to ask you one more time if it be not Henry Alonso and it be not your son 's fiance then who do Wesley know about the two of you there be no two of we I think my son be weak feckless I be try to protect he by seduce his girlfriend I think I have to prove something to he about his girlfriend 's character instead I find something else about his she tell he do not she she tell Wesley that you try one of the real secret of my success and business have always be my ability to sell anything almost anything to almost anyone and anytime but I could not convince that boy that the girl he be in love with be lie oh my God he do it your own son I honestly can not even begin to describe you that collision of emotion I mean you be stare at your own death and yet I do not think he have they in he I mean the way he make it look like robbery take my watch and ring and throw they in that dumpster I be not sure I could have come up

there be exactly 349 000 in that account I be the only one who know about it that be enough for you to start have a real life to make something of yourself just let a father give his son in death what he could not in life and let this innocent man go to jail the question here be not about Henry Alonso it be about Michael Benoit be he go to walk away from this experience as a rich man or be he go

to work he have not be attend any meeting he have not be make any phone call and uh I talk to our IT guy and even though he switch on his computer in the morning he do not seem to be sign on to the company server Near as I can tell he uh sit in his office with his door lock all day and do God know what I feel very strongly that perhaps we have he come back to work too soon I think perhaps he should see a professional a counselor or a therapist I can hear that I 've catch you at work no I be gr I be very grateful for your call and I be think whatever you be think I it seem right ALLISON Hiya hi what you do just look myself up on the internet it be kind of frustrating actually apparently I do not exist although there be a guy with my name who be all the rage in gay porn you do anything interesting nope sit in a car drive across town with Lee talk to my husband love you love you be you sure we should not stop by an emergency room get a proper x ray or something Nah I be fine it be just my head there be nothing in there anyway yeah I know this girl I help she load a freezer out of here last week she be Brian 's girlfriend I mean you know that it be in the paper she use to come around here a lot so this be definitely Brian Barbera 's storage unit have be ever since I work here Kid come in like clockwork every month to pay the rent do you actually want to go inside if you do there be something I have to ask you to sign well that be strange I take it back I guess Brian Barbera be not the actual tenant of record for this unit then who be somebody name Peter Barbera a brother maybe I do not think I 've ever meet he I be worried about you your boss call they say they might want you to see someone talk to someone I think it be a pretty good idea I will get it hello SCANLON he be not the brother he be the father excuse I Peter Barbera the man who rent that storage unit he be the father and he be be in prison almost eight year okay great story too Got pull over for a suspect DUI and actually get into it with the officer I mean big time blow to the head then a high speed chase I mean this guy 's desperate not to get arrest turn out it be his third strike then no soon do they get he in the joint then he be pick out of a line up for a local diamond heist have I get your attention they could not make it stick never find the diamond but on the surveillance video of the heist there be a man and a woman a woman with blond hair your boss and I be set up a visit at Arizona Correctional with Mr Barbera for tomorrow Care to join we Mr Barbera I be Manuel Devalos District Attorney the city of Phoenix these be my colleague I really do not care they bury my son today you would think they would give a guy a day to mourn this should speed thing along we be terribly sorry Mr Barbera actually he be the reason we be here how much do you know about your son 's death he kill some girl then he kill himself can I show you a picture of this girl what have you say her name be Jennie Jennie Heffernan very interesting girl Smart very smart but have a very tragic life her mother abandon she when she be quite young for a while her old sister Haley try to raise she but then Haley got involve with a two time loser that like to stick up jewelry store next thing you know Haley 's nowhere to be find and Jennie 's all alone again then she turn up dead and your son confess in a suicide note anyone tell you how he kill her bind she up stuff she in a freezer douse she with water pretty tragic huh first the sister disappear then Jennie 's kill then we realize that this freezer be not always where we find it that up until recently it be in a storage unit you be rent really really and that get we to think what if Jennie 's sister do not disappear at all what if something far more dire happen to she for that matter what if it be not Jennie in the freezer what if your son be not a killer at all SCANLON you got to wonder what we would find if we tear that place apart think we would find anything valuable think there would be any uh I do not know diamond maybe DEVALOS in a few day we will be able to positively identify the woman in that freezer I 've get a very strong hunch that it be not go to be Jennie but maybe her sister Haley and when we tie her murder to you I intend to seek the death penalty unless you start tell I what you know she get away with it the perfect murder she must have be plan it for year track down Peter Barbera 's son Brian become his girlfriend get the key to the storage unit find the diamond that her sister die for use her own sister 's body to make it look like she be dead so no one would look for her all for those diamond Night they almost do not seem real Haley yeah they be real Jen and you know what these

sympathy Mr Paxton counsel approach the bench please now your Honor I do not know what your Honor this be not a ploy I just find out about this deal four minute ago and now I be suppose to let she speak for I Mr Paxton let I save you a lot of grief and time this be a boneheaded move you be face the death penalty your good strategy right now be to walk back to that chair with your tail between your leg and let your counsel do her work when she be already try to put I away your Honor I be entitle to the good defense available and right now I believe I should speak for myself since I seem to be the only one here who believe in my innoce do you try to cut a deal of course I do your Honor it be my job to present my client with all the option available to he and you explain this to your client yes I do Mr Devalos if the defendant wish to make his own closing argument I have no objection your Honor you know why he have no objection because you be hand he the verdict maybe maybe not Joe Ladies and gentleman of the jury I be not an innocent man I break the vow that I make before God to my wife I lie I steal I give my wife every reason to cut I off and to leave our marriage but that be a far cry from the almost unimaginable thing that I be accuse of today I mean ask yourselves what would it take for you to do to another human being what they accuse I of do now it be true they 've prove that I fight with my wife they 've even prove that on occasion full of emotion I 've say thing I do not mean even wish for my wife 's death but who amongst we have not have an embarrassing public lapse in judgment or an emotional exchange so fill with poison that you pray to God you could take it back they say that I buy the knife that be use to slay my Natalie I do buy a knife I lose it on a camping trip they say I leave the hotel carry a satchel it be true it be full of clothe they say I drive off to dispose of my wife 's head what I really do be back away from an ugly fight to cool off the truth be I do the right thing but instead they be say I do something almost beyond human comprehension so I beg you if you believe it be possible that one just one of the thing that they say happen do not you have to ask do they really get the right man hey hey sorry I be late I may be get a call from work I should probably order too I can not stay long sure thing uh

do everything they can to isolate your boss and completely distance themselves from you fine there be go to come a time when you be go to want to get your side of the story out and there be go to be all kind of people vie for that story I hope you will think of I you be insane whatever you say after all you 've do to I after all you 've do to my family why would I ever speak to you again come on Allison I be the devil you know sorry I be late not to worry my employer my boss give I this to sign it come with a very generous check but the implication be pretty clear if you do not sign this you

for you for you to take they to court you might want to take a look at it I do not need to look at it this woman who be help the D A get in all this trouble she be your wife be not she why what do that have to do with anything well accord to these article she claim to talk to dead people do you believe that you believe she talk to dead people actually I do but what do this have to and you would swear to that under oath Mr Dubois for I to prevail in this case I have to convince a jury to believe you to believe in you if before I can do that I have to convince they that dead people talk to your wife I would sign that paper Cash that check it be very nice meeting you sir first pitch to he testing test one two testing test one two get the hitter to chase that rise fastball but the two one

over to first I know they 've freeze your bank account while they hash out the detail of your wife 's estate my publisher be willing to extend their generous advance immediately I do not need money Ms Mccall oh well you will need to live on something while you mount a suit against the city you know about that I know a lot of thing Litigation can take a long time and my sense be that district attorney devalo be not inclined to settle quickly well I have reason to believe that that decision will soon be out of the district attorney 's hand I appreciate your offer miss Mccall I will look forward to read your next article strike he out and now he be just one out I do not appreciate your attitude ariel I 've have a horrible day too Bridgette can you get Marie a snack Mommy want to get

call from my boss your boss why have you decide whether or not to sue oh yeah yeah the lawyer make it real easy for I really what have he say he say he be drop I as a client he seem to think that in light of recent event that uh I might have a bit of a credibility problem with the jury 'cause of I hello good bye do something else happen that phone all of a sudden be ring off the hook yeah something be happen the whole world 's fall off its axis what do that mean I do not know I go to work no devalos he be just not there I can not get a straight answer from anybody I call his house no

housekeeper the victim let he in and why be it we can not figure out who he be 'cause he be not a he at all that be very nice it be it be it be very interesting but be not you leave something out I do not know who kill pamela franklin maybe it be someone outside this whole situation maybe that be why he do not finish chop her head off maybe that be why he do not leave behind victim number three 's

next wow you be like a dog with a bone listen follow my reasoning victim number four 's head be never completely sever from her body so the killer do not leave victim number three 's head in its place which mean it be still out there which mean it could still be place on your body after the killer kill you if you stay in this hotel Allison you already make this prediction and I be happy to say it do not come true no I be right about everything except for the number it all still work if you be the fifth victim if you be next in my dream he say there be five victim I see victim number three 's head on your body I just assume it be a natural mistake but now I have figure it out you be next Allison you be not make any sense again if you be really concerned about I if you do actually see the third killing would not it just be a whole lot easy to tell everyone who do it who the killer be no because it would not clarify anything and actually I be begin to believe that there must be two killer two killer in my dream the person that I see kill Cheryl Ann Potts be Pamela Franklin Dead Pamela Franklin the fourth victim which be the reason I believe there be two killer Pamela Franklin and the person who kill Pamela Franklin Pamela Franklin so come on just just do it just change hotel you really be crazy than I think truly certifiable and you know the crazy part you know how I

this too let us go tell that Van Dyke guy Van Dick I do not think so you know how he be spin this to the press you do not predict it you inspire it by make this crazy prediction you give this lunatic a fabulous new target and I I be the idiot who leave she vulnerable to the attack I do not care what he think about I and you should not care what anybody think about you we just have to get Paxton we be not go to get Paxton no one be Walter Paxton 's bulletproof at this point nobody can accuse he of anything I be tell you if he got catch rob a bank tomorrow they would have a parade for he he personally murder three people and he help plan the murder of two other that be all well and good allison but you do not have any evidence your dream be not evidence would it be possible for you to get I into debra 's hotel room it be 4 45 in the morning I need you out of here before the techie show up again at 8 00 that should not be a problem I be sorry to leave you on your own but I get to

sound impressive I feel so badly for you I feel so badly for your boss they be just destroy he on television I know I can not help but think a lot of that be my fault how do you mean before Paxton this be a surprise be this a bad time absolutely not no come in thank excuse the mess forgive I I be expect a call can I get you a drink a mini drink from my minibar no I be good I be uh think about our conversation the other day you call it I 've only be out three day and already I be break so I be wonder if we could have one more conversation about that book deal you do say something about an advance would 10 000 tide you over I think if you be willing to sign some paper in the morning I be fairly sure my publisher could come up with at least that fairly quickly that would be a lifesaver so what do you hear be the police any close to figure out who be do this well I do hear one really nutty theory today but it be not go to make you feel any well it be pretty out there what be that two killer two killer be you sit down obviously you be I can see that Pamela Franklin and whoever kill Pamela Franklin Pamela Franklin well I do not get that why would she kill all those people and who be say that be it the police and who be they say Pamela Franklin kill everybody except herself no I do not get that I do not know if the person who tell I this even know and no it be not the police not really yeah I think the thinking be that Pamela kill everyone and then someone kill she but nobody be say who that someone might be and why would that woman want to kill my wife well you do not know this may have nothing to do with your wife it may only be about the second victim and all the other death be commit to throw people off the scent or it could have be about the third victim but you know what I have not really give it much think but the truth be woman do not really do these thing not on their own go into a hotel room and cut off someone 's head no I be bet when the smoke clear if she be do it she be do it for a man not to sound sexist but it be always a man she be in love with someone someone she could not have and and and nothing we have a problem what be that I do not bring my tool do not go away all right lady and gentleman five woman be dead now all brutally murder by the same sociopath be you embarrassed be you ashamed I know I be our local hotel and restaurant be lose million in revenue our convention center be empty every day bring a new cancellation well I will not have it not on my watch I be not go down like my predecessor I like be the new d A of Phoenix well before you get too comfortable I would appreciate it if you would issue an arrest warrant for Walter Paxton in the death of P D Mccall here be the evidence on this tape recorder you can thank I later capture by RaceMan shynchro by Kyoken94 www forom com so accord to the statement you give the police you come home from work and she be just your wife I mean she be just there like that yeah I

be go on you okay yeah Bob back to you no it be just a dream I guess be I in it be we naked Answer the second question first you sure you be okay I say I be okay okay okay a6 it be shortly after 6 yesterday evening a6 when her parent report three year old Davina miss a6 apparently abduct while on a shopping trip a6 with her family at the Greysmark Shopping Center will you change the channel a6

a6 accidentally add an extra ingredient to the concoction a6 Chemical X so last night 's feature attraction my Dinner with Mr Ginsu do you have any idea where this strange encounter take place a6 use their ultra super power a6 Blossom a6 bubble a6 and Buttercup have there be a sign on the wall behind he it happen near here Phoenix Somewhere in Phoenix Lights please this be the front door to Pablo 's house here be the detail of where Martinez shoot the lock on the front door to gain entry and commit the homicide here be the bedroom where Martinez find Pablo and begin the interrogation in an effort to recover the 30 000 from a drug deal that Pablo never give he here be a slug of the mattress from the first time he shoot Pablo the leg wound whoa back up a second the accuse fire seven shot into Pablo how do you know which be first or second or seventh for that matter even the crime lab can not tell we which shot come first no you be right it be just a theory I guess a theory Guy gets shoot seven time the leg wound be the least consequential I guess I be figure he start with that 'cause he know it would cause a lot of pain but would not kill he it be a good way to find out where your money be and then what Pablo tell he where to find the cash and to show his appreciation Martinez shoot he six more time through the heart no he shoot he once in the leg then he go and shoot the mother who be hide in the bathroom with her baby really he shoot the guy once in the leg then decide to look around and see if there be anyone else in the house that be your theory no my theory be Martinez shoot pablo once in the leg the sound of the gunshot startle the baby and make it cry until that happen it do not even occur to Martinez that somebody else might be in the house meanwhile the mother be try so hard to silence her baby she inadvertently smother it by the time Martinez find she in the bathroom she be so consume with remorse that she be beg he to end her life and that be my theory what the hell be you do you be an intern your job be to sort the crime scene photo and talk we through they not come up with theory this be a district attorney 's office not a detective agency so you do not care what be in my head not if it be not in a law book first no which of the following might be a prospective juror 's reason for suppress information that might prejudice he or her from participate in a trial a the prospective juror 's actual bias with regard to b the desire to avoid malign one 's own reputation as an objective bias free citizen wow b be right I do not think I can be a lawyer Joe be this about the dream the voice they give I picture to sort and I know what happen between the picture I just know I sit with legal aid case and they tell I their story and I be

then it would be uh Jury Selection in Capital Trials Catchy 140 please sit down 144 prospective juror these be their questionnaire I do not get to meet they why do not we just wait and see how you do with the questionnaire first you can usually identify the obvious deadhead off of these deadhead People we absolutely will not accept in this case people that be never go to vote for capital punishment if it have a red Post it on it it mean the jury consultant think the person be a definite no if it have a green Post it on it it mean she think the person be a definite yes and if it have no post it on it at all it mean she have no opinion yet and it be something we will figure out when we get to court what happen in court we get six strike and so do the other side Strikes a free pass these be people that you can say no to without have to explain yourself the deadhead well no that be where it get tricky the judge will probably throw out most of the deadhead without prompt what you want to save your strike for be the people that you think the other side be desperate to have that the judge might not kick out at the same time the other side be go to use their six strike to eliminate the people they think you really want to have okay so I bring these they be half the size of the other so we can tell yours from hers so what do you think about what it be just a bunch of paper so you can not just look at they touch they just feel something I do not know I have not try so get aimpression off an inanimate object be not something I do not know you have to understand these be not feeling I 've ever go out of my way to have use to be I would walk into a place or I would meet a person and I would get that feeling and I would just want a drink this be new I guess I be count on meet the people well I do not know what to tell you this be how we start in any event your involvement in this process have get to be secret I hear Allison if this be not something you be interested in do no no I be interested it be just that if I tell you something I want to be certain do not worry about that I be up to my eyeball in people who be certain it would just be nice to meet

participate in the event lead up to that outcome certainly you can understand that actually I find it all rather confusing to be honest I do not recall you accept any responsibility when you do participate that be against the law you know I do not want to make any trouble be that what you be do that be not how I see it Allison you be right about every single person we cross examine today well I I get to tell you I be start to believe if I do not screw this up we have a real shot at getting rid of this monster this be Italy where art and the art of hospitality go hand in hand but no

of Ivan Kinetko a serial murderer and rapist and while District Attorney Manuel Devalos seem highly gratified by the swift and certain verdict the jury give he the accuse and his defense team seem stunned by both the speed and certainty of this verdict wait a second that be not he what be you talk about oh my God something 's wrong that be not the man in my dream okay do that really matter it matter to I that be not the man I see commit the crime hey where be you go but sir I be not even sure he be guilty that be all right Allison I be but there be no but there can not be I get a lab full

I be it be just what I be get do not add up and it be not just Devalos there be this cop this detective you should have hear he talk about his instinct suddenly when it become about my instinct about he work with I well that would be insane I must be insane well then this be perfect be not it you do not like he sound like he do not like you the thing you be sense about this case be not clarify

you what I see what you dream what I see in my dream help I out here will you Manny all right let I see if I can understand this you would see their face they come to I in flash like crime scene photo right but always the husband first yes and always having already be shoot and that make you think that the husband die first Allison the husband be always find at the crime scene with the gun in his hand cover with blowback and powder residue you can not kill yourself first and then kill your wife thank you excuse I could you remind the detective that I be on his side it be all right tell she I appreciate the help but I would really prefer it if her theory make a little more sense excuse I but with all due respect ma'am all you do be come up with thing that contradict the physical evidence

Allison Golly ma'am not impress you I can not tell you how upsetting that be I will probably be awake all night Lee would you give it a rest please intercom ring I tell you not now sigh well I guess this be a bad idea you two be clearly not mean to work with each other Allison I appreciate your time and effort and I apologize for my friend 's extraordinary lack of gratitude Lee I hope I can count on you not to say anything to anyone about who Allison be and how we u her talent here in the D A 's office you be kid right be there anything else you would like to share before I put this investigation to bed once and for all no we be do yes there be one thing like I suspect when I look at the crime photo I always see three people at every one of the killing except for this one this one have four people oh four now well the killer bring a friend with he Damn it Lee Hey Task Force you get any idea what any of these people actually might look like I mean that would give we a real leg up be they male be they female it do not work like that I do not see they I feel they oh well okay so do it feel like an Anglo guy or a latin guy be he black or maybe he be get kind of an asian feel wow she be right you be an ass thank for that vote of confidence yeah and as far as this not be what it appear to be well there be an old expression if it walk like a duck and talk like a duck then it be a duck Personally I think you be up to your knee in a duck pond Detective rdon I um Mr District Attorney the Third Precinct keep call and they be wonder if you could run down there apparently they have some kind of situation all right tell they I be on my way Allison Detective Scanlon Idiot Sorry to make you come across town but the chief want to cut you in early cut I in early on what our guy be call to a homicide last night and they bring this guy in but nobody can quite get a fix on whether he be the victim or perpetrator and he be like I be do an experiment a social experiment and he be stand there in my house ski mask you know he be about my height I think I do not know and he be point a gun at I and my wife and I be like experiment what kind of experiment and I be talk you know 'cause I be think talk be good talk be well than die you know and he be like you love she he be point at my wife I be like of course I love she she be my wife he go okay here be the deal you shoot she and we will let you live and I be like what be you be you insane he be like no I be a social scientist you bourgeois a hole and he take his gun and he put it right under my chin right here and he go okay lab rat you shoot she or I will shoot you both make a choice you wanna live you wanna live and I be like yeah of course of course and he go okay so do it choose life shoot she and she be wail you know she be scream and you can not even make out what she be say even and for a second like I almost think she be say do it and I be think do it shoot my wife I can not I can not do that I can not do that and then and then the gun be the gun be so light the gun be so and then I be think oh I see I get it it be a joke it be a freakin ' joke you know and he be get his gun right here and she be wail so I do it I pull the trigger Mr Conrad so be I to understand that you be now admit to what happen admit that you do kill your wife no no it be like I say before I do pull

wife 's head talk about how he be this social scientist guy and how we 've be specially choose to be part of his experiment so let I ask you this question why do you think a killer would go through all the trouble to find a way to discreetly enter your home confront you and your wife kill your wife in cold blood right in front of you and then let you live do not you think he would worry that you would do the very thing you be do now describe what happened describe he to the police why would he do that I I do not know you think I do it do not you I do not say that sir well you do not have to be a mind reader to figure it out I guess because I do it he tell I he would let I live if I do it and then I do it sniffle I mean not really but I show he that I could that I would I mean think about it I know it sound crazy I mean it be crazy but maybe it be not that crazy I mean here I be tell you about what happen and you be think I be crazy or I be lie which be what he want you to think right so actually if you think about it it be not that crazy in fact that be pretty smart right he be head over to the crime scene he ask I to ask you if you would like to go along so I hear you want some

that well it be very similar to yours actually let I see if I 've get this straight this be the man we should be look for not this man then who do you suppose this be I think it be Matt Damon I leave a magazine lay around and I think the witness see it and oh for cry out loud okay let us say you be right let us say the witness lie and her sketch be bogus well she be not lie exactly she be just afraid of be involve Allison that be lie exactly besides whatever her reason be my hand be really tie what do you mean well what would you have I do with this I don t know Publish it distribute it go get the cop to go get the guy Allison I can not put this out where would I say it come from an anonymous eyewitness oh right the description from the person in the room that be the one I tell the police to ignore and the description from someone whose identity I can not discuss that be the one I want they to pay attention to but then what what happen if we manage to find the guy and make an arrest what happen when the defense attorney put you on the stand what do you say well yet what happen when he put the woman on the stand and she say that be not the man I describe I do not know all I know be you be look for the wrong man well maybe you be right but if this be the real man we should be look for then we need to get the real eyewitness to say so I get a c plus on my math test C plus all right that be progress where be your sister Playground probably Come on let us go find she you be it you can not catch I you can not touch I Bridgette God why do she have to be so weird all the time it do not sound like that big a deal so she be play by herself do you ask she what happen to Bobby maybe he go home sick or maybe he be play with some little boy that do not mean that he do not

leave it at that we have to do something about this I know all right okay fine so we be on the same page then any thought as to why who be be dead for five year should choose to hang around our daughter you make it sound so sinister he be draw to she because she can see he that be all I do not know if you be aware of this but right now you sound almost I do not know almost proud of her please I would not wish the way I see the world on anybody least of all my own daughter so what be next she go to start finish my sentence for I start know thing before they happen start wake up in a cold sweat from bizarre dream you do not know that any of those thing be go to happen well I be allow to wonder and I be allow to worry in fact I would be an idiot not to worry got it sorry sorry to have pollute the gene pool do not mean it like that how else could you mean it how do you know she be not go to outgrow it and just because you see one ghost do not mean you see every ghost if you say so just because you have one dream that seem to come true do not mean every dream come true I have dream the other night a wolf be chase I through the airport try to kill I do not mean a damn thing although you be look kind of wolfish I be go to check on Bridgette so it just be not go to work out with Bobby this weekend how come it just be not but I be think be there somebody else you like

show she my sketch see how she react to a picture of the real killer Love to only down the line the defense attorney could say that I influence the witness we can not even show it to her I do not say we I say I do you remember the affidavit you sign when the sketch artist show you the finish picture yesterday the one on which you swear that the description you give be to the good of your knowledge accurate well we lose that affidavit I feel terrible about the inconvenience but I be afraid that I have to ask you to sign it again be this the man you see shoot your fiancé in cold blood the night of the 12th yeah that be he any change you would like to make no any detail that have come back to you since yesterday not really no be you sure I would be happy to bring in the artist you work with

man have enjoy a friendly long stand relationship with the Phoenix Police Department and consider a lot of the man on the force to be close personal friend Mr Watt you say in a press conference yesterday that you be anticipate a speedy trial why be you so confident well for one thing my client be innocent for another we know the late Detective be shoot to death but to date I 've yet to hear about the murder weapon have the District Attorney find the gun it be not on my evidence list Detective Pulaski be a highly value and much honored member of our police force I personally have the pleasure of work with he many time over the past 15 year for the record I be especially committed to bring his killer to justice thank you Ladies and gentleman no testimonial evidence have be present which can place the murder weapon in Nicholas Morgante 's personal possession prior to the shooting no physical evidence have be present which can place the murder weapon in Nicholas Morgante 's personal possession prior to the shooting so what be we leave with lady and gentleman in America be it enough for the police or the District Attorney to say I just think he do it I think I know where it be you think you know where what be the murder weapon the gun Counselor Mr District Attorney welcome back I be terribly sorry your Honor and be there something you would like to share with the rest of the court Counsel well your Honor as a matter of fact in the interest of justice the prosecution respectfully ask the court for a recess due to an introduction of new evidence bring to our attention Evidence that have a substantial bearing on the outcome of this case in the casket burrie with detective Pulaski 's body and you be sure pretty sure yeah Allison I be about to go ask for a court order to disturb this man 's grave exhume his body open his casket and feel around I would like to go to the judge with a little more than pretty sure well I do not know what to tell you it be a dream you have to allow for a certain margin of error kind of inspire be not it bury the murder weapon with the victim rest on piece I will get a warrant it be so unfair those earring I could tell you where you get they when you get they why they mean so much to you but when it come to my own husband my own child or anything to do with my own life everything be a blur true for all of we I be afraid

know do I have a reason to be you know I normally hesitate do this kind of thing People have trouble understand when you talk to they about their future the day of our life be a lot like the weather if you look long enough and hard enough you can absolutely find a miserable day on the horizon conversely if you be patient enough there be always a sunny one come too I think the key be to focus on something fairly narrow keep the question specific well this be very specific because you know I can not lie I be not ask you to lie all right then uh there be something medical go on right yes it be of no consequence oh my god really this biopsy business it be nothing you can put it right out of your mind so he be healthy yes he be healthy he be extremely healthy you be sure yes I be sure I be

go over it for print then let us get it to ballistic I be nothing less than to stun by the Judge 's decision to allow this gun as admissible evidence and while I have the utmost respect for his honour to ask this jury to believe that my client defile the grave of a decorate police officer and a friend and somehow manage to hide this weapon in a coffin that stand open and in full view of family and friend for two day well I just can not understand why the District Attorney do not just do the honorable thing and go to the jury and admit we do not actually have a case so we plant evidence excuse I he be act like he do not know what hit he and I be guess that be because he do not now go home and dream some more and tell I how long it take I to win this case Allison Dubois yes you be order to appear and give testimony in the matter of the State of Arizona v Nicholas Morgante it be call an on call subpoena half the people in the office get they there be a number at the bottom you call before 7 00 every morning and they will let you know if you have to appear if you want I will have the office call in for you give you a few extra minute of sleep in the morning oh it be okay I have kid I be up at the crack of dawn anyway but why would they want I to testify they do not it be a nuisance tactic the more you spend worry about whether or not you be go to testify the less time you have to prepare a case against their client that be I Bye hey I just get your message Congratulations yeah it be be quite a day how be your go uh not so good look like we be go to be pull an all nighter here an all nighter well not all night but we be not go to get out of here until at least 9 00 anyway soon as I hear I make up my business to sneak out of the meeting I be in and call you thank listen I get to go kiss the kid for I I will try and call later okay bye hello hello hello no Great I will see you around 10 00 okay bye I be sorry about last night what be it like 11 30 when I stumble in I think some of these guy actually just want to work late just to break some record or something it be like they do not have a life outside of that place so what be you do today well I be not go to testify if that what you mean Court 's in recess Devalos want to talk to I about something he be go to come by around 10 00 I think you hate that shirt huh that shirt the one you be wear I buy it for you I like it and you hate it I never hate it you never wear it you say it be juvenile so what happen your shirt suddenly mature you want I to wear another shirt I be just say I do not get it you do not hate something for two year and suddenly you like it I guess I finally get what you get it be stylish I like the shirt make I feel good have a nice cut my wife buy it for I I guess it do not seem juvenile to I anymore I see you take the kid yeah get a call late last night you be definitely testify tomorrow when trial resume oh okay I guess in fact you be at the top of their witness list wait a second I be confuse the other day you say that serve I with a subpoena be no big deal that they be just create a new sense now I be at the top of their list you know what probable cause be of course I know what probable cause be well when you tell I you think you know where the gun be in order to exhume Pulaski 's body I need a search warrant okay and in order to get that warrant I have to show probable cause which be especially sensitive in this case I mean we be disturb a dead man 's grave okay so so unfortunately there be no judge who will issue a warrant base on the dream of a a a nut like I Come on Allison let us not make this any hard than it have to be it be not go to happen so so do what be necessary I do not know what that mean it mean that sometimes you have to consider the great good I still do not know what that mean I request the warrant base on information we receive from an anonymous tip you lie and I indicate you be the one who receive the tip so tomorrow they be go to want I to get up on the stand put my hand on a Bible and swear to the fact that I actually receive this tip at the very least but here be my big fear you be Morgante you 've kill a police detective now somehow you 've manage to slip the murder weapon into your victim 's casket prior to his burial what be the chance that you tell somebody anybody about what you do and how you do it know that one slip of the tongue could cost you your life I think they know there be no tip I think they might have hear about you I think they may have hear about what you do well then I can tell the truth Allison you be not get this the warrant 's dirty I lie to get it if you get on the stand and say anything other than what I tell the judge in the first place he toss out the gun as evidence not to mention my credibility with the jury be nil all of a sudden it be not so hard to believe we be capable of plant Morgante 's fingerprint on the gun plant the gun on the body plant everything that be it and you want I to lie I want you to stick to the story you work in my office you be a consultant and if he start ask anything about dream or psychic phenomenon oh my god just deny it the more matter of factly you deny it the silly and more desperate he sound I do not know if I can do this Allison I do a terrible thing to you and I be sorry but here we be this be not easy for I come here ask you for this I be an attorney I believe in the law I believe in the truth but I know this son of a bitch kill a police officer he kill a police officer and then make the man 's final rest place his own private joke if there ever be a reason to lie I I be sorry I need to think Joe Dubois hi it be I Hey Al look something 's happen and I need you home at the regular time tonight I really need you here Babe you got to know if I could be here I would but I hardly smile no you be not hear I you tell Kelly not tonight you tell Kelly your wife need you home with her okay sure thank you good night baby good night Mommy good night sweetie good night Mommy you know you ask I to come home you say it be important you have not say a word to I since I get here you want to clue I in on this crisis well my boss stop by the house today seem I 've be call to testify tomorrow and he want to know if it would not be too much trouble if when I get on the stand I would not mind perjure myself and why would he want you to do that well it seem you can not get a search warrant in Arizona base on a psychic 's dream so he tell the court that I get an anonymous tip and he want I to testify to that well I know that be not what you want to hear but it sound like pretty good advice to I do you hear any of what I just say they want I to lie in court yeah I hear you I can not lie I beg to differ honey be not it just last week you tell the cousin they could not come visit 'cause we be get the house paint this be in court this be under oath I hear that part but really what choice do you have you do not understand well I think I do no you do not Joe if I lie I do not just betray myself I betray whatever it be that make it possible for I to see this stuff really you think so you think if you get up there on the stand and testify then that be it no more scary dream no more hear other people 's thought no more dead people hang around the house and kill the mood 'cause I get to tell you Allison if that be the case it be all the more reason to get up there and lie you know what Joe I make a mistake I should not have call you go back to work do not push I Al what do that mean it mean the way I be feel and the way you 've be act do not tempt I whoa okay so you be not a happy guy huh not right now not about this wait wait let us be clear about this about what this this pathological need that you seem to have to call the world 's attention to the fact that you be the way you be the way I be oh please no no you know I Joe I be not a religious person I be not a Holy Roller praise the Lord type but whatever it be that allow I to see that gun it come from a high place and I do not want it and I do not ask for it and sometimes I wish I never have it but the fact be I do have it it be a part of I and I be proud of it and to be put in this position what position I be baffle what be it that you actually want to do you want to get up there and tell the truth yeah I do be you crazy be you really that self delude leave it alone I can not believe you be even entertain the notion of it have you tought it through have you think even half way through let it ring can you imagine the front page of our local paper if you do this can you imagine the 6 00 news have you think about the impact that be go to have on our girl at school in the playground have you think about the impact that be go to have on I at my job out in the world this be not about you and whatever cosmic channel your get your vibe from this be about all of we be this something you really wanna do I do not know hello yeah just a moment it be for you it be Kelly hello no it be a family thing it be right there on the desktop on the file mark Kelly okay see you in the morning Kelly Charles be a

God Kelly be not the crisis I take the stand you want I to lie this fight that we be have this be the crisis I have actually no idea what you be talk about and far I have no idea what you 've decide well 'cause I do not know what I 've decide except I would really like you to be there I mean if Kelly would give you the time 'cause I have to tell you if I have to get up on the stand and perjure myself and lie to God and a judge then I really want your ass sit there in the front row when I do it do you swear to tell the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help you God I do Mrs Dubois could you tell the court what you do for a living I work for the District Attorney 's office on a part time basis here in Phoenix and what do you do for the District Attorney 's office do you have a a job title I be a freelance consultant a freelance consultant can you be more specific I study case law and criminal law in college so you be a legal consultant yes I suppose you could say that and how long have youn at the D A 's office two month although prior to that I intern there and do you have a law degree no I do not I see well then could you briefly walk we through what a typical workday would look like for you at the D A 's office objection your Honor how in the world would an understanding of a typical workday for Mrs Dubois contribute to this case your Honor the name Allison Dubois appear on a search warrant use to obtain crucial evidence in the prosecution of my client now give that fact the court have a right to know specifically what Mrs Dubois 's involvement in this case be and what her function be within the office of the District Attorney overrule you may answer the question Mrs Dubois on a typical day I might interview a witness or witness involve in a possible crime I might be ask to take statement from such witness on occasion I 've be ask to monitor interrogation of suspect you do all that for the District Attorney without a law degree wow there must be something very special about you my husband seem to think so this be the warrant order the exhumation of detective Pulaski 's body now accord to the information on line seven it be grant on the basis of an anonymous tip which you allegedly receive be I correct yes what be not indicate anywhere on this warrant be how you receive this anonymous tip do it come in the form of a phone call from this person no it do not no phone call so this this anonymous tipster do you meet he face to face objection your Honor answer the question assume a degree of specificity and as a result compromise the anonymity of our source overrule please answer the question so once again Mrs Dubois be you testify that you actually meet this anonymous tipster face to face oh yes you do I certainly do now I be impressed you say you 've work for the District Attorney 's office for how long two month two month not a very long time but here you be with an anonymous source seek you out contact you instead of the lead detective involve in this case contact you instead of the District Attorney contact you instead of the Assistant District Attorney or the Assistant Assistant or the dozen of other law inforcement individual involve in this case that be a hell of a story Mrs Dubois your Honor be Counsel ask question of the witness or offer a summation to the jury Mr Watt my apology your honor it will not happen again and with that in mind I be go to ask you a simple direct question Mrs Dubois and remember you be under oath you swear to tell the truth what be it you be not tell we excuse I you be Honor he be ask the witness to question herself Mr Watt you would well come to some kind of logical conclusion here that be exactly what I be try to do your Honor I be try to find the logic here now the witness have testify that she be only work for the district attorney 's office for two month that she have no law degree no real authority and yet someone with vitally important information seek she out it do not seem logical it do not make any sense unless unless what Counsel unless the witness enjoy a special and privileged relationship with the informant that she be not share with the Court Objection Overruled be not that really what the situation be here Mrs Dubois do you enjoy a special and privileged relationship with this tipster that you be not share with the court I do not know what you mean I think you do I think you know exactly what be so special about you that you be at that cemetery the other day I think you know exactly what be so special about you that the District Attorney keep you around despite the fact that you have no law degree I think you know exactly what be so special about you that this anonymous tipster seek you out over and

you about the solid citizen who see the burglary I touch he I shake his hand that be what make I ill Allison people get ill because something disturb the body 's chemical equilibrium not because they shake hand with somebody who be Evil Joe this man be evil in the most unimaginable way because he look so benign because he look so friendly so nice and not only that he have a kind of radar for innocence he can spot it a mile away and once he be find it he become obsessed with possess it he seem so harmless so when he offer they a ride they almost always accept then he drug they and by the time they come to they be tie up somewhere helpless then he rape they bathe they rape they again drug they some more and when he can no long convince himself of their innocence he kill they take their body put they in their car drive they to the desert and dump they there for the animal to feast on there have be lot of they maybe six but there be this one woman in particular I keep see she have red hair blue eye a beautiful girl she tell he her name be Sharona she be his first he do not really want to part with her he love she in his own way but the smell be begin to become noticeable and even

never suspect of murder but he do volunteer at a homeless shelter once a month no arrest for assault but he do attend church regularly no speed ticket or parking ticket and he be a mentor to a fatherless boy in Tempe I be think of ask the mayor to give he the key to the city but I be afraid his Honor would be threaten in the presence of someone with so much moral fiber and you might find it

her brother say that she die two year ago and that I be mean to ask he about her oh baby Mommy why be I dream about a dead girl that I do not even know so be I really ground for the rest of my life I

or so I have to talk to your father first so in the meantime let us get some rest I do not want go to sleep I be afraid of what I might dream you be in Mommy 's bed nothing bad can happen in Mommy 's bed hey honey that visitor you be expect be here be everybody else asleep Marie 's in her crib and Bridgette 's out like a light okay you be not go to leave I be you just for a little while then I be go to get into bed next to you and we be go to dream happy dream together love you love you too you know I normally do not make house call but thank you so much for do this I really appreciate it well I hear the panic in your voice when you call by the way I ask a friend to join we I hope you do not mind I get a video you get any popcorn oh I remember this I see this on the news after you call I run a check on every Sara between the age of eight and 12 report miss or murder within 100 mile of here in the last five year once you subtract the custody napping and the false alarm the one case you be really leave with be Sara Crewson a case Detective Scanlon here helped investigate Halloween night two year ago Sara Crewson be out with a group of friend trick or treat decide to go home early a man name uh Darrell Yellen convict child molester grab she as she be cut through a convenience store parking lot two block from her house the security camera 's get the whole thing yeah I remember this case cop catch he two day later on the run to Mexico he confess to rape and murder Sara along with two other girl in exchange for his confession and for tell the police where to find the body we take the death penalty off the table Yellen 's serve a life sentence in Springville I know because I cut the deal do you mind if I ask what be all this about why this sudden fascination with young girl name Sara no that be okay I just have a dream I be not sure what it mean or if it even mean anything at all your dream I do not know what else to say well for the record and nobody ask I hate this you hate what I hate that when my little girl have a bad dream I can not just give she a hug and a piece of cake I have to expect visit from the cop and the D A what do you want I to do I have to see if there be something to it why because she think there be something to it look all over the world kid have dream about the boogeyman and all over the world parent tell they it be go to be okay in the morning well our kid be not like other kid and I know you hate that too I do not say that it be just God there be enough death and darkness out there wait for she when she be an adult she be ten for cry out loud it be one night it be one dream it could pass she be still young I give you my word I be not put she in the middle of all this as far as everyone be concern it be I it be my dream so if we need to get the District Attorney 's office and the police involve they will think it be I let they deal with I okay what be you do it be the middle of the night do you want to wake everyone up you have the cool house if I have this much food in my house I would do nothing but eat and watch tv all day and all night I want to check out your room I want to check out your clothe wait you can not go in there my sister 's sleep in there I want this and this and this those be mine you can not have that you can not take that what give you the right what give I the right I come to you I ask you for your help and you do not do anything that be what give I the right you okay sweetie do you have another bad dream I do not know she be mad Mommy she be mad that I have not help she oh she be not mad at you sweetie how could she be how do you know well it have to do with the kind of dream that you be have it be really just Sara remember something that happen when she be alive and she be try to tell you about it but she be tell you in a kind of code what do you mean like that dragon be really that billboard and the castle be probably just a house somewhere and I be guess that the monster be really this bad man that I find out about who take Sara away from her family it be okay sweetie he be in prison he be lock up where he can never hurt anyone ever again again what do you mean again well it be like her brother tell you Sara have pass on and where she be no one can hurt she not any more no I do not think that be right Mommy what do you mean why not because I do not think Sara be dead I think she be alive and she really want my help so there be no question in your mind that it be he Allison he confess what be this dream you have anyway it be nothing I just I be worried that this Crewson girl might need our help again as part of his confession Darrell Yellen tell the police where to find the body he take we right to they it be all part of the plea agreement okay you take he out there you find she you you do find she right her clothe her bone something actually we find the partial remain of his first two victim um Mindy Atwater and Elizabeth Cale but now that you mention it no no physical remain of the Crewson girl be ever discover it be the assumption that an animal probably oh my God she might still be alive somewhere Hang on let us think about this for a minute why would this man confess to a crime he do not commit I do not know maybe someone should ask he my name 's Allison Dubois I be with the District Attorney 's office I need to ask you some question about Sara Crewson do you remember Sara Crewson of course okay so take I through it um you snatch she on Halloween and then how long until you kill she the next day they have that videotape of I in the parking lot on the news I know it be only a matter of time so I take she out to the desert and I kill she that it we do anything else that be plenty thank one night when the ogre be not look Sara make a break for it and just when she be certain she be safe there he be I just do not believe it happen the way he say it do I just I do not why do you think he confess because he do it because he want to live he make a deal Confessing mean life in prison instead of death by injection I be really struggle with try to understand what your position be here be you try to tell I that you think this man confess to something he do not do I sit with he yesterday I look he in the eye and I be here to tell you Sara Crewson be still alive she be abduct over two year ago I do not care he give she to someone he make a gift of her she be still out there he tell you that no he tell I what he tell you he tell I he kill she okay you and I have a history you tell I that this girl be alive I be tempt to believe you where be she we will go pick she up I do not know then what be it that you would like I to do assume what you be say be true this little girl could be anywhere in the world Darrell Yellen be already in prison for the rest of his life how would you have I compel he to tell we where she be assume that he even know Frankly your theory do not make much sense Allison think about it Let us say Sara be alive and let us say he actually do give she to someone why do not he share that with we when he confess I mean he be try to make a deal why do not he use her safe return for a bargaining chip instead of life without parole insist on the possibility of parole in 50 year something or or or Darrell Yellen choose not to use his trump card because whoever he give that little girl to be more important to he than the dim possibility of parole Allison I mean think about it we find this important person we find Sara excuse I hello yes this be her mother I will be right there I be sorry do not apologize if you have not do something to be sorry for you want to tell I what happen I be in the library and I fall asleep and I have another dream and I wake up scream why do Sara choose I I mean why be she talk to I maybe because she know that you would listen hey what you do you be suppose to come to bed an hour ago I know I just keep think that the answer be in here somewhere you know this crime solve thing be much hard when it be not you have the dream why be everyone awake Sweetie do you have another bad dream good I be glad you be not have those spooky dream I be not have the dream because I be try to stay awake but honey that be why you be fall asleep at school Mommy why do you have a picture of the ogre what be you talk about this man be he the evil ogre Sara it be Wednesday come on I get to go can not I stay out here I will not go anywhere I promise you know Darrell 's rule I can not go till you be in there can I take the castle with I can I play with the castle Sara stop it no it it be dark in the closet you know that now and no this be my castle do you want candy I will bring you candy thank you Henry Yellen be Darrell Yellen 's old brother

be a pedophile how have he get that scar ah when they be kid the father go after Darrell with a knife Henry want to protect his young brother and get between they God Father go to prison die there two year later Darrell 's pretty much take total responsibility for Henry ever since their mother pass away in ' 98 so what be you say you think that Darrell give Sara to his brother you be the one who say that whoever he give she to be even more important than the possibility of parole Henry 's his blood Henry save his life and apparently he do need a certain level of care perhaps when Darrell realize he be go to prison for a long long time he make arrangement for someone else to take care of Henry so what be we do here why be not we out look for this guy to start with we do not know where

develop cure you think about it you be talk about a business whose lifeblood you will pardon the pun be sick people if everyone be well then nobody need drug that be why the most forward think drug company be put their money into develop drug that treat symptom treat the symptom but do not cure the illness it be the illness that be go to keep make you the money down the road it be the illness that be your bread and butter Someone 's have enough to drink would that be I darling you wanna see something look what do you think be you ready to talk dowry yet they be cute be not they but I think

pound if I be not so exhausted I would shoot myself wait excuse I excuse I just wait for the bathroom so what be it exactly that you be postulate I be say that we be container for a form of energy a soul an essence of be and as we all know energy can not be destroy so what happen to it when the soul 's container be use up stop work well I be explore the idea that perhaps it linger at least some of it anyway and I think that there be people that can not only see this energy but can communicate with it now when we identify people who seem to have this ability and they seem to exist all over the globe we ask they to come to our lab so we can measure their accuracy thank you so much it be so great oh I be so sorry I have not be get any sleep you poor thing you see anyone 'cause I can just

I be certainly not look to be a rat in some academic 's maze it be a dream it will pass yes you hear I correctly I would like to delay the press conference I do not know four hour obviously I have my reason of course I have my reason no do not call back and tell I how much you can get I call I back and tell I you 've get I four hour you feel all right oh no I be okay I be just a little tired well I be sorry to call at the last minute but a situation come up over the weekend do you remember read about the killing of Councilman Miguel Garcia Councilman in the ninth district grow up here in fact great guy Gulf War vet get his MBA right here in Arizona come home run for office win obviously the only thing be his district be rife with corruption drug prostitution anything past 5 30 at night and the street be a war zone but he take over and really start to put the lid on thing People be start to go out again at night business be begin to pick up then last July he be at a ribbon cutting ceremony for a new 24 hour market which the neighborhood really need around 9 30 he be get into his car pop pop two shot to the back of the head Killer be sit in the backseat okay now I remember this yeah Whole district 's be up in arm ever since they want someone to pay and we have nothing nothing well next to nothing it have all the earmark of an organized crime hit but beyond that then this weekend the killer turn himself in walk into the police with his attorney and confess oh my God that be great yeah only thing be he be 14 nothing would make my life easy than to hand over this kid 's head on a silver platter but I just do not believe it I can not tell you why but I just do not believe it I be suppose to have a press conference in 20 minute and announce that we have our man but he be sit in the conference room with his lawyer I ask for one more interview I will introduce you as my assistant you can not actually ask any question but I would be very curious to know what you think I steal the gun from my cousin he keep it in his car for protection when I be do I put it back do you know where the gun be now I be sorry I need you to speak your answer no my cousin 's in prison I do not know what he do with the gun okay so let us review you know who the councilman be you hear that he be out to clean up the street shut down the prostitution the gambling the drug your old brother and your cousin all would say how he be make trouble for they so you get it into your head to take care of the problem yourself nobody tell you what to do nobody put you up to it it be your idea and you do it I need yes or no yes it be my idea nobody tell I to do it well it be like I tell you on the phone what bring I here be this dream it be chronic all night every night I can not sleep I can not function and now it be affect my work and that work you claim it do make some use of your sensitivity I tell you I be not allow to discuss my work mm hm I respect that a lot of the research medium I study work with law enforcement and almost all have to agree to some level of confidentiality in their work I be go to assume that be the case with you as well now if you do not mind I would like to get some biographical datum again Dr Cardwell I mean no disrespect I come here in the hope that you could help I or maybe point I towards someone who could I honestly have no interest in be study now these what do you call they sensitivity sensitivity be not something I ever would have choose for myself they make the world a much dark place I really just want some sleep well as you well know Mrs Dubois there be pill for that and you can get those from any doctor but if you really can do what you say you can do then there be a reason you dream the same dream every night and frankly I be probably the good person around to help you figure out what it be what do you mean someone live dead would seem to be send you a message but again none of it be relevant if you be not really who you say you be so if you would be so good as to humor I for just a little while long why do not we take a walk down to the lab Circle be you ask I or tell I it be a circle an octagon a car a rectangle how be this for a psychic contradiction I sense I be do really poorly at this just concentrate on the card I be too tired to concentrate which be why I be here do you want to stop just really focus now a train Mrs Dubois Hurry wait Allison Allison I be sorry I just keep see these two boy run run along the train track a train track yes and there be a train come a long long train with a big J and a big o on it it be my dream I have it over and over again two boy they be brother I think one be a little old the young one fall it do not really matter what card you hold up that be all I see what when I be a boy grow up not far from here actually my brother and I we be out way past when we promise we would be home and to get home you have to go over these railroad track so we be run as fast as we can try to get home before anybody notice and suddenly we realize oh no the train 's come and that train it look like it be five mile long if you do not cross the track by the time the train go by you would be stick there forever so we race I and Kenny two year young than I he fall just before the track Kenny Kenny Cardwell what happen you know what happen the train pass he be go a man came take he kill he kill three other child that summer too but you know all that already do not you no really it be all right here who put you up to this nobody put I up to anything it be my dream I 've be dream about these boy and this train I guess I 've be dream about you I would really appreciate it if you would leave now I really do not know what to say southeast Texas as well right now you can see very heavy rain near the 610 Loop and I 10 on the east side of town but there be also some very heavy flooding hey I be watch that it be okay you be suppose to be a psychic you should not even need the Weather Channel it be a joke you can laugh later look the kid be go to be up in a couple of minute why do not you sneak back into the bedroom while you still have a chance and try and get some sleep I will get they off to school I will tell they you be sick no no no I be okay Beg to differ have you look at your eye lately Bad you should see they from my side you do not actually have to go into work today after I fall asleep the other day no in fact I think they be revoke my clearance to get into the building well now the kid be up who call at 7 00 in the morning hello yeah just a minute it be Dr Cardwell Dr Cardwell Mrs Dubois I I appreciate you come back please when I have the opportunity to reflect on what you say how you describe your dream I realize that you reference the letter J and o on the train on the locomotive now I go back and double check I have not include that fact in my account of the incident it be nowhere in the book so uh I believe I owe you an apology you already apologize on the phone as I explain when we first meet what I really need be some help actually maybe we can help each other if you would be willing I would love you to spend some time in the lab I suspect that the more we study your dream the clear the message will become and my hunch be that once that code be break the dream will abate and how can I help you well I keep think perhaps it be not an accident that we meet at that party that you be have this dream whatever its message I can not help but wonder if it be come from my little brother look the mayor 's ask a lot of question question that I can not answer the most important be why be not this kid be haul off in a jumpsuit yet I just want to make sure we have everything we need everything we need we have a confession what else could we possibly need I just think there might be more to it that be all well you be wrong there be no more to it he do a bad thing People be angry now we need to put he away tell the mayor I get the message I just want to make sure all our duck be in a row and I need a little more time how much a couple of day I do not know if you 've notice but it be pour outside I mention that because the mayor think of you as family the mayor think of you as someone under his umbrella do not take too much time we would all hate to see you get wet I do not know what else to tell you it be big it be

so so I 've give your client 's situation a great deal of thought I be sure and here be what I would like to propose 16 year Arizona State Correctional Facility that of course assume that your client stand by his confession and the state avoid the expense of a trial but I with all due respect Manuel that be not a deal that be a maximum sentence no the maximum sentence for murder one be death by injection the more likely sentence be life in prison and that be what I be guess he will get if we try he as an adult which we be prepared to do at least this way he get out when he be 30 it be not nearly as bad as it sound they say it be the new 20 but he be confess yes he do and in great detail which be the only reason I be even entertain this generous deal I be propose Come on Chavo think about it whatever you be get for this be it worth what you be go get for this who be it it w who be who District Attorney Devalos I really do need you to address all your question to I I do this on my own do not speak be that your final offer it be my only offer and in my opinion if you be interested in do what be good for your client you will accept it I be sorry son but take the rap for murder be not nor will it ever be a career opportunity in the city of Phoenix if you decide to rethink your confession your attorney have my number Mr Buckley can I help you I do not know I be actually here on

that you avoid any contact with the press if you do get buttonhole by someone just please steer they over to I have you ever attend one of these before state execution no it be my idea Mrs Dubois have be do a lot of work as a jury consultant for my office in capital punishment case and I think if she be go to have a hand in end someone 's life it be important that she see um the end result I will be curious to see what you think for I the event itself be always surprisingly matter of fact and then the memory of it it stay with you for the rest of your life I have to say I be impressed you be go through with this you might want to hold that thought till after in case I pass out or throw up or something you would not be the first just keep in mind people like Reynaldo Cerrera be the reason the death penalty exist I prosecute the man myself Guilty of four count of murder include the shoot death of a seven year old girl who happen to be walk down the street during a drive by attack by a rival drug gang and the four count be just what I could link to he directly God know how many other murder he order or how many people die because of the junk he be peddle everyone 's entitle to their opinion of course but if you ask I lethal injection be too gentle too civilized an ending for an animal like cerrera that be funny what be that do not you usually call in the coroner when there be a question about the cause of death seem today would be a foregone conclusion well they be not really coroner they be the driver they be here to transport the remain to the Medical Examiner 's Office State require that we do an autopsy before we hand over the body to the family we be nothing if not thorough he look so calm they be give a sedative Reynaldo Cerrera do you have any final word no final one no so so that woman from the Mayor 's Office be right it be odd it be weirdly undramatic I be more surprised by what I do not feel he be a very bad man it sound harsh but I do not think a life of any value be lose here today you must be right he must have be empty soulless at least I could not see it what do you mean I 've never be to an execution before but normally when I go to a funeral or if someone pass in the hospital I see their soul I see their spirit but today there be nothing he must 've have none well it be time to rejoin the living oh which remind I when we get back to the office could I look through the current miss person report why you lose somebody well this be go to shock and amaze you but last night I have the crazy dream you how be that possible what the

bad dream and bogeyman but you know what and I would think I would hope you would assume what I be do be pretty damn important I have a job too and one of those job be to be Bridgette 's father I be entitle to an opinion on thing like how she look it be her class picture for goodness sake I would have think out of deference to I out of some sort of consideration for the fact that we be all go to have to look at this for the next 50 year that maybe maybe you could stop indulge her eccentricity and take a stand except I think you like it well you know what I do like it I do like it and you want to know why because those picture be suppose to capture how they really look who they really be before they change before they be go and today who she really be be a little girl who be in love with the way that a red helmet look on her head and that be great 'cause that be who she be today just relax she be not getting marry in it what be I do I have not sleep I have not have any coffee the kid

something funny I be race back home hope that you would still be here 'cause I have this crazy idea that I need to talk to you that you would help I sort this all out that you could help I figure out my what do you call it my bogeyman and my bad dream all right it be a bad choice of word I be sorry what do you want to talk about what do you want to sort out if you know that 200 people be go to die and you could prevent it so far this be not a tough question no but it mean that you have to compromise everything that you believe in and that you would have to let a guy go who commit an unspeakable act what would you do I will get the baby we will drive the kid together you can drop I off at work and explain this to I on the way well if you be convinced he be guilty you have to go to Devalos I be not sure I should what what be you talk about my dream last night I think I know what it mean that plane crash when Call be not fly it if Call go to prison he will not be the pilot and hundred of people will die be that what you be say you realize that be an absurd assertion do not you you can not control the future the future be subject to hundred and billion of variable almost none of which be in your control I know what I see what you dream darling and how many time have you think a dream mean one thing only to discover that it mean something completely different I mean be not that how we get here in the first place this time I know no this time again you assume just like the last time when you assume because you see he fly the plane that he must innocent just like you assume that when he mention an anniversary that his wife must be alive and now you be assume that because you dream this plane crash that somehow it be your responsibility no your duty to turn your back on the one thing that do seem reasonably certain that this man kill his wife but what about all those people what about that plane what about that woman he bury in the desert what about the way he use the date of their anniversary to choose a place to dump she what about her family and their grief and what about justice you be willing to turn your back on all of that for something you be afraid might happen I be sorry honey that do not sound like justice to I that sound like cowardice so he have the means and he have the motive what we need be a piece of physical evidence that tie he to well hello strange we be just compare note on your friend Captain Call you all right do you need I folk could you give we five minute thank not withstand your conviction that the man have absolutely nothing to do with his wife 's abduction we 've discover a couple of very interesting omission in his story remember how two of his neighbor testify they see Captain Call leave for work at 4 00 and then his wife leave the house at around 5 15 thus provide he with what should have be an airtight alibi turn out his flight that normally leave at 6 00 p m be delay for four hour and it turn out Mrs Call 's parent both die last year in a boat accident leave a rather considerable fortune to their only daughter which obviously the husband would inherit should she pass first Allison you look like you be go to cry everybody 's wrong once in a while you do lead we to the victim 's body no it be not that in fact I be fairly certain that he do kill his wife in fact I think I have the physical evidence to prove it this be Captain Call 's this be his security badge from the airport if you will look inside the plastic protector you will see grain of sand I be pretty sure if you have it test you will find it be from the desert where we discover the body wait a second where be you go I have to get to the airport I I what be go on you get people come in I guess you could say that when you see Captain Call wish he a happy anniversary for I go to work you be probably go to need this you hear that sand turn out it be from the desert where your wife 's body be find hmm well maybe it be and maybe it be not one thing be for certain you do not obtain that security pass with a search warrant that mean it be not admissible in court now if you will excuse I I have to get ready for work I have a plane to fly you might want to call in sick cowboy I have a search warrant I intend to vacuum every room every rug and every drape in this house to find more sand I will even vacuum between your toe up your nose and in your ass if I have to Mrs Dubois at this point its still circle over Cleveland we be estimate it will land about six minute from now a little late due to weather that be okay I will wait Mrs Dubois I be happy to tell you as soon as the plane have land but stand here and wait like this it be just not necessary you can call on your phone you can monitor the flight on your computer at home but you will know first right I mean you will know the second that they actually land that be okay I will wait this seat take hey I want you to know you be make our baby sitter the rich 16 year old in Phoenix I take a cab I think you might want some company on the ride home no word yet well they take he into custody as soon as they take the death penalty off the table he confess to everything he would be plan it for month wait for a day when he know in advance there would be a long flight delay go to work on time deliberately leave his security pass call his wife ask she to bring it to the airport when she arrive he meet she at curbside tell she he have some extra time invite she out to eat pull into an alley lean across as if he be go to kiss she he suffocate she with a plastic bag drive she out to the desert bury she leave her car at a shopping mall and still get back in time to fly that plane to Cleveland Mrs Dubois just want to let you know the flight land in Cleveland they be taxi to

before their eye there be nothing as important as family what be you talk about you be a workaholic father who ignore his son you leave your wife for another woman and the whole time you be alive you never once visit your grandchild yeah so it be never too late to change oh out out excuse I you all right I do not know I will let you know a week from now I do not know how familiar this office be with Project Defender but through the use of modern DNA examination and the implementation of other cut edge crime assessment tool we 've be responsible for the freeing of many prisoner erroneously sentence to long term incarceration and in some case even death I be very familiar with your work what be it that bring you to Phoenix begin last year the project receive a series of letter from an inmate at the Springville Correctional Institute claim wrongful conviction be you familiar with a Mr Owen Butler he be currently serve a life sentence for the murder of Clancy Donovan in 1995 I be well aware of the case I prosecute it myself now please do not misunderstand we be not necessarily allege prosecutorial misconduct here no of course not you suspect I make an honest mistake on the record the Mayor 's office would like you both to know that he support the work of your project and he be happy to do anything he can to help please let his honor know that we appreciate that well now that it be clear that we be all friend I be all for exonerate the innocent but when it come to Owen Butler I be afraid you be bark up the wrong tree be we Court transcript show you be never able to establish any real connection between Mr Butler and the victim I beg to differ both man in question be illegal drug user it seem quite clear to both the judge and the jury that Mr Butler break into that apartment look for drug no I beg to differ you have no witness to place he near the crime scene true but as I recall he could not account for his whereabouts at the time of the shooting either I mean it be not as if his alibi do not check out he simply have none the man be so incapacitated by his drug habit he have no idea where he be an hour before be question much less at the time of the shooting be that as it may there be still no forensic evidence to indicate he be ever in that apartment no fingerprint no DNA evidence nothing yes I know nothing except a 38 caliber slug that pass through Mr Donovan 's skull and embed itself in the wall of his apartment a 38 caliber slug that match the gun that we find in the trunk of Butler 's car true it still do not prove he be the one that pull the trigger I be sorry I prosecute this case almost ten year ago and a jury of 12 citizen find Mr Butler guilty now if you 've uncover some evidence that show somehow we get it wrong I be happy to hear it if not I need to get on with my day Mr District Attorney they be on a fishing expedition Fine then let us let they fish just so they do not go to the press and claim we be stonewall I mean as long as you be completely confident the case against Butler be go to hold up this should not be a problem you be right there be no problem Excellent and I will be sure and share that with the Mayor Butler lose his job as a landscaper back in 93 when he be pick up for indecent exposure take to petty theft to finance a worsen drug habit end up shoot a man execution style during a bungle robbery he be ten year into a life sentence at Springville sound pretty open and shut it be and why they be choose to reopen this particular can of worm right now be beyond I but I need someone to interface between their group and ours and I be a little shorthanded wait a second it do not sound like something I be particularly well suited for Frankly it sound like something for a lawyer I be confuse do not you study to be a lawyer welcome back to Phoenix Ma Happy Mother 's Day well happy week lead up to Mother 's Day yes well happy week lead up to Mother 's day to you too for what it be worth you be

have to book you a later return ticket I 've never see he before why would I kill he maybe you know he keep drug in the apartment how would I know that you 've never do business together you 've never buy from he no never Mr Butler you can not tell I where you eat lunch today but you be certain you 've never see this man before if I could have a taste I would remember a little well Ms Dubois sorry Gary Craig Project Defender this be Deborah she be a student at ASU and one of the intern down at the project Nice to meet you both District Attorney Devalos ask I to sit in on any interview and to help in any way I can much appreciate the less adversarial we can make this whole process the well I have a question though this man have you look at his rap sheet he be no angel be you sure this be someone whose innocence you want to champion I be sorry I do not see it that way it be not for I to judge someone 's worth the question on the table be be he guilty of the crime for which he be try and convict our purpose be to serve as an extra check and balance to make sure that the system work at its most evenhanded and fair minded these be copy of all the correspondence we receive from the accuse and his prior counsel thank you Mr Butler how you do Ew it smell like fish in here it be salmon Marjorie um how much tonic should I put in your gin oh just the tiny of tiny splash darling in fact do not even bother what be this Napkin sorry Mom I be at the store I have it on my list and everything you want a chicken finger Grandma Mmm do not know chicken have finger Bridgette Bridgette thank you for share but let Grandma eat her own food so Allison tell I about your work oh I do not know it be part time I work for the District Attorney Sort of a paralegal thing well there be

have say anything maybe I should have keep it to myself I mean there be nothing to do until she say something right true I mean who know maybe my dad 's off base on this I mean if he be so good at read my mother then how come they get divorce God it be never bore around here my partner and I have just knock off we be head out to a bar to catch a game I remember because the Suns be in the playoff against the Rockets anyway a uniformed patrolman respond to a shot fire call discover a dead body actually um the victim may have still be alive when the uniform arrive on the scene I I do not recall we be nearby so they have we take the call in any event when my partner and I arrive the uniform show we the apartment have be break in through a back window and at that point anyway Mr Donovan the victim be dead from a single gunshot wound to the head the bullet be from a weapon we later find in Mr Butler 's possession and how do you come to find the gun in Butler 's car an anonymous caller phone it in I believe say he would overheard Butler brag about the crime we get a search warrant go to Butler 's apartment Neighbor say he have not be home for day be that unusual apparently not she say he sometimes go on week long crack binge when we finally catch up to Butler we find the gun in the trunk of his car Forensics match it with the bullet that kill Donovan it should all be there in the record Detective Rickey how thoroughly do you examine that apartment for evidence I do not know I think we be there a day and a half in all that time you do not find one fingerprint belong to the accuse I mean if the man be there to steal drug presumably he would 've leave some print in and around the drug do not that make sense he be wear glove he bring the gun he know what he be go to do why would he go out of his way to leave print for we he do not go out of his way to leave fiber evidence for you either accord to your report he also leave no eyewitness to place he at the scene of the crime and no dna to prove he be there it be a pretty well think out crime for a crack addicted petty thief would not you say thank you for come in Detective Next witness 10 30 why do not we take a few minute hi honey it be I I try to call your mom on her cell phone to see how she and Marie be do just go straight to voice mail anyway I be on break give I a call I love you Bye Detective I think I

talk ten year ago I be Patrolman Leland Scanlon if you please and I be the respond uniformed officer the night Donovan be murder oh my God I be so glad to see you why you tired of make small talk with the bleeding heart well actually these people be present a very compelling argument the case against Butler be not terribly strong I hate to see he get out of jail because of it I would really hate to see what it would do to District Attorney Devalos Allison trust I those people will never get this guy off neighbor hear the gunshot in Donovan 's apartment call 911 I get to the door no one answer the door be lock so I force it open I walk into what I guess you would call the main room the living room the body be on the floor although I be not immediately certain that the victim have expire there be drug and paraphernalia everywhere be not for all the blood you would have think he get high watch the game and pass out or something then I look up I see some guy on the fire escape could not tell you who he be he take off like a bat out of hell I guess he have be up there the whole time hope and pray I would not notice he soon as our eye lock he take off and you do not give chase I feel like the thing to do be to attempt to revive the victim I do mouth to mouth and CPR for uh I do not know maybe seven eight minute anything catch your eye after that point the window show sign of force entry I fire we be look at uh a possible robbery attempt the truth be I be in way over my head I realize that the victim have expire there be nothing for I to do except call it in wait for the detective you get all that oh yeah I get it hey everybody sorry I be late I do not know what everybody want so I pick up a couple of pizza do not worry Mom I get you a salad thing hey babe look what

always remember today as the day where little Allison discover there be no Santa Claus 'cause people really be not good and justice be not only blind it be in a coma okay hey Billy it be definitely a party out here in front of the arena where fan have already start to gather in expectation of a victory celebration that be if their home team can hold onto an enormous lead thank you for agree to see

give you a five or ten dollar just so you will not get too close to their car the parking lot right outside the stadium yeah outside course outside thank you let I ask you a question be it completely hypocritical of I to be scared to death of the possibility of your mother live near we while at the same time call you at work to say do you think it would be okay if I leave she with the kid for a little while while I go and meet with somebody in about a half an hour yes it be completely hypocritical and I think you should do it hey hey it be 9 30 I be miss the Bachelorette what be so important

the Rockets against the Suns ' 95 playoff the night of May 11 okay during the broadcast of the game around 9 30 p m they show the crowd outside the stadium Owen Butler be in that crowd Lee he could not have be at Clancy Donovan 's apartment he could not have be anywhere near there okay you say so I do not know what to tell you I never say I could ID he on that fire escape I mean it be really the gun that put he away I do not have anything to do with that the man be innocent Lee Innocent really sorry innocent be the last thing Owen Butler be do he kill a small time drug dealer name Clancy Donovan maybe maybe not but innocent I beg to differ I know what he be I know what he be capable of but that be not the way the system work do not lecture I so you can prove that Owen Butler be at the

hey all right never mind help come on this be easy here this be easy we stack the penny ten penny high we measure that okay one half inch one half inch one half inch and then move the stack into a cube which be four stack wide four stack deep okay then you measure the width and the depth of that square and multiply that by the height we can calculate the volume of 160 penny Cool okay and once you know that you can divide the volume of this container by that number and calculate how many penny be in there the assignment be to guess how many penny be in the jar so why can not we just you know guess because math be not about guess Math be about calculation so let us calculate Math be about stupid well I like math what a surprise Sweetie do not get upset just do it anything a lot of horror story about medicine but most of they be about people lose their health insurance nothing about a 14 year old girl in a soccer uniform Excellent why be not you smile do they all have to come true do they all have to mean something well I be not root for a teenage girl to get hack to death by her doctor if that be what you mean you be right it be like check the answer machine not everybody who leave a message be important but you would sure hate to miss the message that be on March third 1991 a Dr Kenneth Holloway be treat a 14 year old girl for some kind of sport injury after he and the girl have be in the exam room for over an hour the mother ask the nurse to check on they just like in your dream Holloway have molest the girl and then he begin savagely dissect her he have already remove her small and large intestine when the nurse and the victim 's mother finally break in on he that be he that be the guy I dream about 1991 be you sure check the file I remember they stick he in the Halcott Institute State run mental facility outside Yuma I do not understand they find he with the body he admit he kill she why be not he in prison I be Assistant D A at the time I do not handle the case but I remember that Holloway claim that he have be hear voice urge he to butcher young girl for almost two year his lawyer argue that since this be the first and only child his client have hurt that he should not be punish for his crime but instead be treat for his illness and the jury agree who be this that be Brittany Walters the girl Dr Holloway murder be you sure yeah it say right here this be not the same girl from my dream she look different and I do not think her name be Brittany they call she Elisha everyone call she Elisha I do not know what to tell you what about the other guy what other guy there be another man in the room he wear a dark suit he have these pierce eye I do not recall ever hear about someone else be involve Allison this crime be solve over 14 year ago what do we think you be amazing you think I could get maybe a hundred copy for the District Attorney what be the chance of my uh I be sorry be I interrupt something no no no we be just make copy could you come back in ten minute who might this be look familiar someone 's accomplice I think what have he do he and his friend rape a young girl slice her open take she apart wow how come I do not hear about this it happen a while ago ' 91 I think excuse I I have one of my thing they never catch the guy they catch one of they but this guy get away Kinda Sorta I do not think they know he be there I see cold case with a suspect that no one be even look for I do not pick them Detective Scanlon they pick I so then Mr Beauchamp start pass out the penny 60 or 70 on each person 's desk and then we start count they up and we write down the total on the board and add they up 1 823 penny exactly exactly exactly be that even close to a katrillion it be close oh also Miss Bishop send home a note about something it be in my book bag it think it might be about math camp if it be I do not want to go you get that I will get the phone hello Allison it be Lee Scanlon be I catch you at a bad time no I be just put the kid to bed what be go on I know how weird this sound but I think I find your guy the one with the beard the one who like to hack up girl you be kid no remember I say he look familiar now I know why I be at this place I come to three or four time a week to have dinner and there he be be there any way I could get you to come down here and I d he her math teacher want to meet with one of we I do not think he mean right now so he be get a bunch of time down here for tomorrow be you all right with 2 00 'cause if you be I will just sign this thing and put it back in Ariel 's book bag and then he will know to expect you Sure Detective Scanlon call seem he spot my bearded accomplice the one from 1991 and you be get dress because you be afraid to meet he in your

computer and come to bed with your husband turn out he be be dead for over a century clearly he be a man of conviction so what about this sleeping thing you game you wanna give it a shot Dr Charles Walker bear 1870 in Wichita Kansas die in 1902 in Phoenix Arizona and in between and in between he rape and murder 14 young woman in cold blood he would go from town to town he would set up his shingle pick out a victim and bide his time wait for she to seek he out for some kind of medical problem then he would send his nurse home spend a few hour torture the girl with various medical device finally he would cut her open and leave she for her family to find who do that sound like I just I do not understand why be I dream about Holloway now that be almost 15 year ago and why be I dream about Walker at all he be sleep soundly Bush in Washington hello May 23 2005 yes I be hold for the doctor I understand but I really need to bring my daughter in there today she be be on the medication

what be wrong with I Elisha baby do not worry the doctor will fix everything I need a favor you know I 've imagine wake up like this a bunch of time but in my version you be not dress can you take the girl to school this morning hmm wait this be completely different from anything I imagine and can you pick they up this afternoon I see my mistake what this be be a nightmare it just take I a second to pick up on it wonderful I tell you I need a favor and instead I get a front row table at the Belly Room and just why do you need this favor where be you go to be exactly Yuma exactly why pray tell be you go to be in Yuma I need to talk to Dr Kenneth Holloway who be ' that the psycho doctor from 1991 about what about a girl name Elisha I have another dream about her last night and now I know she be not from 1991 she be actually from right now and I think she be in danger but he be be behind bar for 14 year what be he go to tell you I do not know but he be the only person in any of my dream that be actually alive I have to do something I have to talk to someone but he be four hour away please all right thank you wait no Ariel 's math teacher 2 00 oh damn all right fine I will take care of it I will handle it I will change something around I will figure something out be you mad very good mind reader you know what we will have this fight when you get back tonight Deal you see my problem do not you 1 788 that be her estimate her computation her worksheet they all lead she to 1 788 which by the way would have be a wonderful answer the whole point of this exercise be to teach she how to estimate and she clearly understand how to estimate okay so so the answer she ultimately submit the perfect answer by the way the exact answer be 1 823 1 823 you can plainly see that her work do not match her result she clearly do not arrive at that number base on any sort of arithmetic process how do you suppose she come up with it well I have the number write down here in my lesson plan I keep it on my desk cover close but on my desk whoa whoa whoa be you suggest she cheat my daughter somehow sneak up to your desk and look in your book what other logical explanation could there be how well do you know my daughter Mr Beauchamp my daughter be not capable of cheat look I understand this be not something a parent want to hear she guess that be all she make an educate guess she have very strong instinct about thing and I be sure notwithstanding what it say on her worksheet she just look at that jar it just do not feel like 1 700 Mr Dubois do you know what the odd be that someone would guess the exact number of penny in that jar 1 823 to one Mm well see that you be wrong excuse I well you be wrong out of what 25 kid yeah so assume that no one guess under 1 000 the chance that any one of they would have guess the exact number be actually 25 out of 1 800 and whatever that be about one in 40 what be you a a mathematician actually the point be be that one in 40 be not entirely out of the realm of possibility Mr Dubois she change her answer impulsively who know why she be a kid she do not look in your book she do not cheat you do not know that you do not know that she do okay wait a second you be a mathematician let us talk probability huh be you suggest there be a great probability that she just happen to guess the right answer than that she look in my book I be say I know my daughter well than you do I be say I know she do not cheat and I be say if you penalize she base on your completely unfounded suspicion then I be go over your head be you threaten I Mr Dubois do you think he be dangerous well he have not attack anyone in the last 12 year if that be what you mean listen all we know be that for as long as people have be write about human behavior there have be guy like Dr Holloway they use to call they possess or uh split personality Kenneth Holloway uffer from a dissociative identity disorder he will not get well ever all right Dr Holloway my name 's Allison Dubois I be with the Phoenix District Attorney 's office please call I Ken I would shake your hand but thank you for meet I on such short notice thank you I do not have many visitor thank for break up the monotony of my day do you know this man no I be sorry I do not believe I 've ever see that man before he be a doctor like to rape and cut up young girl we do not have a union Miss Dubois it be not like I 've see he at the meeting what about the name Elisha a young girl around 14 or 15 do you know anyone by that name how many girl Fourteen do he hear the voice I do not know when you find he ask he he will know what I be talk about and if he be honest he will tell you you tell I I do not know it start off very quietly mostly when you be alone in the shower in the car at night in bed when my wife be sleep but then you start to hear it everywhere in crowd in church on the street at a baseball game look at her look at that do not you want to see it do not you want to touch it do not you want to cut it open and stick your hand in it and then it be all on you here he live inside you and you can not find yourself anymore Whatcha do nothing count the star Estimating darling all you can do be estimate sorry I miss dinner and everything I run into traffic on the way back that be all right we be fine that be why God create drive thru Dinner of champion so be everyone sleep Ariel 's math teacher Mr Beauchamp he think our daughter be a cheater what turn out he keep the exact number of penny in a lesson plan on his desk and he somehow get the idea that Ariel she would not do that okay so what do you tell he well I tell he she make a lucky guess he tell I that make no sense and even though I know he be right I also know that I be right and I tell he if he penalize my daughter for be a cheater I be go to go the principal no you do not well she be not a cheater hello yes Dr McGrath no of course I can all right tomorrow then so how do you leave it with the principal who be on the phone Joe he give I a choice it be up to I either I can file a formal complaint against Mr Beauchamp or Ariel can change math teacher I get to let he know tomorrow those be the choice I do the good I could do that be sort of like shoot a cannon to kill a flea well hey you know I be not the one who run off all day talk to some guy who be be behind bar for 15 year who could not possibly know anything about anything concern the here and now excuse I it be my job you know I been think about that too and as a matter of fact it be not your job you be start to think that every time you dream a dream you be somehow on the clock this be not a case that be assign to you this be something you choose to do Fine I will go to school tomorrow and see if I can speak with Mr Beauchamp Good let us see how you make out okay let us Good Damn it oh my a hink in the plan already on the phone just now Kenneth Holloway apparently shortly after I leave he become extremely agitated demand to talk to I he tell his doctor that there be something he have not tell I before something about Elisha wait I be have a déjà vu I will call and make an appointment to see he day after tomorrow right I be sorry the teacher or the murderer sorry for what make you come back okay be something wrong I do not know it be the drug been raise a bit of a ruckus since you leave so they start in with the med again I do not care it be it be kind of nice actually smooth out the ride if you know what I mean she be dead by the way I be sorry who be dead Elisha that be not possible how can you say that I just see she I do not think so young lady you come here yesterday look for she unless by see you mean with something other than the eye so you kill she hm Unbeknownst to anybody while you be in here you kill she I be psychologically impaired but I be not an idiot it be in 1990 I would be hear the voice for about a year but there be always people around and for a long time I be able to not listen but that June I be drive from Phoenix to Los Angeles for a medical conference all by myself I be on I 10 that long stretch of road where it be just a single lane nothing but empty desert and inexplicably she be just stand there I see she from mile away I think she be an optical illusion at first but I keep get close and she refuse to disappear it be like she be taunt I she be stand on the shoulder with her thumb out she be wear jean and a t shirt and she have those baby breast they get at that age Dr Holloway she be thirsty I give she a soda a soda and some sleeping pill and by Ely Nevada she be out I rent a hotel room you do not want to hear the rest hm I remember you sorry hello Mr Beauchamp this be uh Allison Dubois I be Ariel 's mother and I be hope to speak with you at your early convenience about the misunderstanding about Ariel and the penny jar uh if you could give I a call at 602 555 0147 yes ' course I mean it I get to call you right back what be this it be nothing which be the good news there be no Elishas report miss or dead in the state of Arizona California Texas or Nevada for the whole of 1990 no Elishas no Allyces one Lisa but she be in her ' 60 I do not get it why would he lie to I Allison the man 's a sociopath maybe it give he some pleasure know that you would be spin your wheel all day look for a girl who do not even exist maybe he just think it be fun you lie to I you lie to I you say you kill she you say you see she I guess we be even you 've get the vision do not you who be I talk to who do you think you be talk to I want to show you something by all mean 1934 Dr Eric Lorenz murder a 16 year old patient who be complain of swollen tonsil he say he hear voice 1950 Dr Kevin Deibolt rape and murder a 12 year old patient while her mother and two brother sit in the waiting room he say he hear a voice interesting in 1960 Dr Peter Seanery rape and murder a 13 year old at a public health clinic in Detroit there be another one in 1977 you kill she in ' 91 seem like every 15 year or so someone hear a voice and a young girl die have any hunger ma'am I will let you in on a secret when you die they do not go away you see we in a dream right I and the girl I 've hear about the like of you you see soul do not you you get the vision where be she how can you know so much and know so little you be obviously extraordinarily sensitive Most people be not sensitive at all then some people be a little sensitive they certainly do not see the dead do not even hear them they just feel something strange once in a while hear a really distant voice tell they what to do do not make that right turn that be not the way to Grandma 's do not answer the phone call it be bad news do not marry that man he be no good for you when I find one like that a doctor a doctor to be yeah it take 15 year first four or five you be scream just to be hear then they start listen for you then you be all they hear where be she it do not matter no one be go to kill she you have my word cross my heart and hope to whatever where be she I know what you be plan I know the date you plan on do it I will find she Mr Beauchamp Allison Dubois I be Ariel 's mother I know I be 35 minute late and I know you be on your way out the door and I be sorry but I do not get your message till almost 1 00 I work for the District Attorney 's Office and I be interview a prisoner and they do not let you take your cell phone in with you but actually and I think this be germane to the conversation I kind of guess that you be go to want to see I this afternoon so even though I do not get your message till I be an hour and a half outside of Yuma I 've be rush back the whole time so if you need to reschedule if you need to leave I completely understand no I be perfectly happy to stay I just I can not imagine what you be go to say that be go to change my point of view about the situation my daughter do not cheat and I know you absolutely believe that and frankly I would like to believe that but there be simply no other explanation for what happen but there be she guess I go through this with your husband but no I know and I be sorry that get so heated Nobody 's file any complaint nobody 's change class and I would not even be here waste your time except the one thing that he do not tell you that he probably should have be that on my side of the family my grandmother I Ariel we 've just we 've always be good at guess I know what parent will not do to make sure their kid get good grade but in this case it happen to be true I mean your initial t o b I be guess o stand for Oliver Good guess right I know kind of a silly thing but I 've just always have it and Ariel have it too Mrs Dubois Dentist tomorrow afternoon right I do not look through any of your book I swear the irony be it embarrass her I mean if you mention it to anybody she would die of mortification and I do need to sit down with she and have a conversation about the difference between be ask a question in class and give a consider work out answer and just guess and for that I do apologize so I just want to stop by and tell you that whatever decision you make we can live with it because I know you will make the right decision I know it well at least I be pretty sure see you will still have time to make it to the car wash you can not just do that you can not just tell I you fix it and not tell I how I do not fix it I just follow it through I follow your bad cop with my good cop you be patronize I I just shift the conversation from probability to possibility the point be our eld daughter 's record remain blemish free and there be still a chance that she can learn to smoke pot at the college of her choice come here kiss I will ya you think you could see your way clear to climb over here and hold I tell I everything be go to be okay why would not everything be okay hmm why would not everything be okay Day after tomorrow a young girl name Elisha be go to die and I do not have a clue how to stop it why do not you call the police I be sorry I need your help Bush in Washington whatever it be that be go to happen I know it be go to happen tomorrow the 23rd the mother 's on the phone with the doctor 's office her daughter 's sick the medicine be not work when her mother 's on the phone do she mention the doctor 's name no she be in a hurry so the girl 's hurt not hurt Sick I think she be take something her mother 's hold a prescription bottle can you see anything l I t H Lithium maybe do that help well Lithium be a drug they give to manic depressive which mean your girl be sick all right but not with the flu so maybe the doctor that the mother call be a psychiatrist which narrow down our search by a few thousand it be a long shot but I might be able to track the doctor through the prescription if you be a pharmacist handing lithium to a minor you might be incline to remember excuse I it be my precinct Detective Scanlon a doctor a teenaged girl I will be right there seem like maybe your dream be a day off Anybody home what be cookin ' good lookin ' Takeout where be your mommy Bathroom go away this time the girl be 13 I guess the doctor do not have a scalpel because he use a rusty pair of scissor to cut her stomach open then he use his bare hand to rip she apart Allison it be not your fault yeah it be 'cause not only do I not save she I do not have any of it right her name be not Elisha her name be Melissa James she be not white she be african American I have the wrong name I have the wrong face I have the wrong damn date Allison just because you do not know exactly Joe I do not know anything it be all for nothing there be nobody leave there be nothing to learn somebody call security the guard rush in he shoot the doctor the girl be already dead and that monster be still out there look for a new cipher look for a new helper you mean look for a new victim the doctor he use they be victim too be not they you just tell I that today a doctor a good man probably before all this happen do a horrible thing and die a terrible death because why because of some kind of a voice in his head I think you be right thank for point that out another meaningless victim well what I be try to point out be where do all this leave that doctor from your dream I mean if you think about it he be the only victim that be still alive and he be a victim 'cause here be a man who be spend the rest of his life in a mental institution because he be convinced he be insane or evil when in fact all he really be if I understand you correctly be a little more sensitive so what be you go to do about he what do you want I to do about he well I should think at the very least you owe he an explanation you want I to drive out there again what make you think that I will not find myself sit across from Walker for the third time I be guess Walker will not be there he be move on he be do with Holloway and if I be wrong and Dr Walker be there then you will have the satisfaction of look he straight in the eye and tell he to go nice to see you again it be our fourth time actually Dr McGrath tell I that you 've be experience some lose time recently and that you do not remember our last few encounter Mrs Dubois I be obviously a terribly ill man if I have do or say anything to offend you I be profoundly sorry it be all right I understand you really be not yourself which be what I come here to talk to you about you 've all be very helpful this whole situation have be so hard I 've be um I do not want to please do not I do not want Elisha please do not find I eh Nice to see you I could do with a little adult company she be 14 her head 's fill with awful music and the silly idea get out of her head not go to happen you be too late no I do not think so in fact I think I be right on time she be not your next victim at all be she she be your new apprentice Smart as a whip too go to make a wonderful physician once we convince everybody that she be fine and get she out of here Times have catch up with I I be afraid the type of girl I want to ravage they just do not go to male doctor anymore you know what they say adapt or die or in my case do not you do not understand I be not go to let this happen no you be the one who do not understand it be already happen oh I know she be strong she be fight I but I have nothing but time and in the end I will win you do not get it do you you only win because the people whose mind you seize do not understand what be happen to they they live in fear and confusion but I will come here every day I will help Elisha understand that she be not go crazy I will teach she not to be in fear of you but to hate you to see you for what you really be a pathetic and evil soul who have no place to go an interloper a parasite if you think she be fight you now you may have all the time in the world but how much of it be you willing to waste on a lose cause because Elisha

honor meeting you sir please I apologize for not be make available to you soon I be a bit under the weather but I just want you to know that this office stand ready to help you navigate whatever legal hurdle your extraordinarily brave action may have create for you oh should I have bring my lawyer both the detective and Mrs Dubois the other night seem to indicate that that that shoot three people to death to protect one 's own life be a perfectly justifiable course of action absolutely so long as you can prove that you be in mortal danger you have nothing to fear from the justice system well be there any doubt about that Doubts no no doubt but question there be always question there be quite a lot of valuable art in your home be not there sir I own two art gallery of course there be art in my home you may have hear in addition to your home and the two other in the Phoenix area two other in the Southwest be also hit guess what they all have in common every family that be target own at least one major work of art but I I do not understand I think I read that nothing have be take from the home the paper never mention anything about art be steal and it appear that none have but then Mrs Dubois here develop a theory well what if you could find someone who could paint near perfect copy of modern masterpiece you go into a home you massacre everyone who live there you replace the authentic painting with the fake then while everyone be consume with the grief and horror you quietly sell the priceless original to wealthy collector in the Middle East and Asia wow you think that be what be be go on well that be the reason I bring that painting to you yesterday it come from the Costigan home after the massacre I be really hope to get your expert opinion as to its authenticity

think you understand how determined the force that be drive he be these force you keep talk about be not something I control frankly they be not even something I necessarily believe in I know you think I have a very powerful job but influence the behavior of the dead fall decidedly outside my purview the first time I hear the voice I be 15 I be at the movie with Torie Keeler it start rhapsodize about the shape and the size of her bosom I be not terribly concerned at first because frankly I have give a fair amount of thought to the shape and size of her bosom myself a week later it start whisper to I about how divine it would be to see a drop of her menstrual blood work its way down her pale white thigh since I have never see menstrual blood and only have the vague understanding of what it be or when it might appear I come to the rapid conclusion that I be mentally ill the second I be alone I smoke a copious amount of marijuana and discover the damnd thing I get very hungry and I could not hear the voice anymore with age come wisdom and I soon discover that alcohol work well than grass and by medicate myself with tiny amount throughout the day I could pretty much eliminate the dissertation in my head about nipple transplant and how beautifully the skin of a woman in her mid teen cut with a surgical grade scalpel I 've never tell any of this to anyone it must be horrible it be what it be I be not sure that I believe that I have some distant relative reside in my cerebellum I be inclined to think that whatever mental demon torment my famous ancestor perhaps a minute amount of that affliction may have be pass on to I I be just try to reassure you in my own crazy way that I think I get this problem under control there be something there be something so sad about it he be absolutely convinced he have to spend his entire life slightly inebriate just to function I actually I know any number of friend in high school who feel the exact same way not funny and they be really into high school girl too undress they not kill they anything I can do to put a smile on your face that smile do not last long do you hear that the body be find just over an hour ago by the night custodian here at Park View high school the police have confirm that the victim be in fact a student here at Park View but authority be still withhold the name of the teenaged victim as the know location of next Ariel I know I know I be suppose to be in bed I be sorry it be just I miss the 7 00 news 'cause I be on the phone and I remember about the late one Honey why be you upset why be you cry it be awful some poor girl got kill in the park tonight she be just four year old than I okay just moment ago and our Action News camera be there a man identify as Jack Walker be find wander

bottle of whiskey Amanda get all excited let us play a drinking game let us play a drinking game I do not want to play a drinking game I just want a drink well we end up parking at the high school Pathetic yeah she insist we play this game I never she would announce something something she she would never do something she have never try something she have never experience and if if I have not experience it either then I would not have to take a drink I mean I walk this earth twice as long as she there be not a lot I have not experience Suffice to say I drink a prodigious amount of alcohol in a fairly short space of time next thing I can remember be wake up in the car alone I do not see the blood at first in the car on I I do not see the knife be you suggest that you have a blackout I be just tell you everything I remember my client have a history of blackout he be make no secret of that for the record be you state that you have a blackout early this evening it be certainly happen in the past but honestly I never hurt anyone before Mr Walker on the off chance that you remember a little bit more than you be let on I would like you to know that this office be incline to believe that you suffer from an acute psychological condition and one that perhaps compel you to do harm to Amanda Peyer if you be to make a full confession we would take that into full consideration you be quite sure I do this be not you be there proof Jack if they do you would be in a cell by now the crime scene be still fresh as be the warrant to search your home your business and your car the truth be we be still gather enough physical evidence to formally charge you but I be confident we can do that in the 72 hour we have 72 hour that be the amount of time they can hold you in a cell without charge you I can not go without a drink for three day sure you can an officer will be in shortly to process you a man identify as Jack Walker be find walk about what be you do up watch you work on the news and what appear to be the victim 's blood still visible on his clothing and face he have I completely fool it be okay it be not your fault you have two day with the guy and Walker have a lifetime I be afraid I have yeah I have go into a lover 's medicine cabinet while she lie sleep in the other room yes yes it be uncanny it be uncanny how you know now ask he the other one ask he come on you win again come on okay I never wonder what it would be like to slice a girl open touch her blood with my fingertip taste it with my tongue I do believe you be the winner again well do and now the moment have come for I to thank you for everything you 've really be sensational collide with the car of a perfect stranger pretend to fall in love with he call he incessantly you be easily the most suggestible person that I 've ever encounter if only you have the intelligence necessary to become a physician I would happily spend the next ten or 15 year live inside your brain tell you what to do but hala you have no interest in the medical art and I have no interest in influence the thinking of a walk Kewpie doll so I be afraid this be good bye do you bring the knife yeah all right then why do not we begin by you stab yourself in the stomach you do not mind if I watch do you I really quite enjoy this kind of thing he do not do it she do Mr walker I apologize you 've be detain the past three day but I do have some good news our crime scene unit at the insistence of Mrs Dubois here have re examine all the evidence in this case and be say unequivocally that Amanda 's wound be self inflict again I apologize my God no apology be necessary under the circumstance I just go home get some rest my office will be speak with your attorney there may still be some civil issue that Amanda 's parent want to litigate have to do with offer alcohol to a minor but I do believe for the most part you be out of the wood I have no idea what you do but thank you how be you feel other than be in shock uh good the first two day without alcohol be difficult today who know I might actually make a habit of this not drink thing can I talk to you what be it I be busy what be you do I be read the news but I do not understand why would you read the news while you could watch it on tv get it hello Mrs Dubois Jack be that you be you drink no God know I want to where be you I be at the shop I keep think I should go out I kinda want to be around some young people girl listen to I stay right where you be do not go anywhere I will be there quick as I can Jack Jack be you here Jack be you here lovely to see you I do so appreciate the way you run right over here when I call the good doctor I presume well maybe not so good maybe not really a doctor either so how long have it be you and not he in the jail in the interrogation room with the lawyer what about the night Amanda die oh please I be good but not that good I 've really only just begin my residency inside young Jack 's skin what a superb fit like a suit that be be custom make for I by God I will always be grateful for your help my help oh my yes I could not have do it without you I 've be whisper in that boy 's ear for 20 year try to pierce that self impose haze of alcohol I try tempt he with that girl but apparently he be manage to rot his libido as well as his liver and then suddenly there you be scream for the police in that supermarket parking lot and I think wait a second your good friend Allison she be just present you with a much well idea I well thank to that scene that you make my drunken impotent relative now have the attention of the local authority if something unfortunate be to happen to young Amanda well he would be the first person they would lock up a man can get awfully thirsty in a jail cell awfully thirsty and awfully clear head I know for the first time in nearly 20 year he would finally hear I and here we be you do all of that so you could finally be in the skin of someone who look exactly like you do when you ravage teenage girl Allison I do all that so I could be inside the skin of someone who look like I when I ravage you I know what you be think where be the scalpel where be the surgical saw help one of my great disappointment as I spend time with my progeny be their compete and utter lack of interest in the medical art oh well what be a great great grandfather to do adapt I say and so in a one time only performance tonight 's slaying will be perform bare hand I know you be flatter Allison try not to get too choke up if all you want to do be kill I why do you send I all of those dream you do not do you she do to stop you you know nothing of Maura I do she be here she never stop watch you she see you even now what you be do to I what you be do to her great great grandson if you kill I Jack be go to spend the rest of his life in prison and do you honestly think she love he any less than the child she die for oh my God what be I do here what be ghost really they be energy the energy we leave behind and energy be power who know what might happen when a spirit as powerful as Charles Walker 's finally decide to cross over or what would happen if the other side just decide to take he I would like to believe that be what I see that he be finally go for good I guess we be just go to have to wait and see I guess we will just have to wait and see when I be little our next door neighbour Mrs Walters use to bring I her daughter old clothe I never want to wear they it be not that I do not like the clothe it be the way they make I feel whenever I put they on later I find out that when Mrs Walter 's little girl would misbehave she would lock she in a dark closet then there be a time I be about to sit down and watch television and suddenly get the distinct impression that thing between my babysitter and her late boyfriend have move to the next level my point be that sometimes the energy from an event can hang around a particular object long the event be over almost like an emprint and people like I people who be sensitive it be almost as if we can read the energy and know what happened like the time Boby Page teach I to shoot with his dad 's rifle not know his dad have just use it to put down their old Retreiver Buck yeah that be a particularly bad energy and it be not just energy of other people 's thing other people 's behavior that come float back to I at time what what what be it the trick I learn be to try to figure out why the object be share that energy with you what the message might be and then hopefully behave accordingly you okay it be 03 15 in the morning it be never God 's plan for people to be up at 3 15 in the morning I be sorry I want to clean up the blood and open the road before the morning rush I know you

you want I can not let he hurt you anymore Kathy should not you maybe shut off the tape Kathy and Travis any particular Kathy and Travis I just know at least I strongly suspect they be go to attempt to kill her husband he be a doctor there must be some way to research doctor with wife name Kathy I be pretty sure they be from this area why be that I buy my husband a video camera for his birthday from Archibald 's before there be battery in it before there be anything to record on I start to see video of this couple on the viewfinder screen Kathy and Travis I think perhaps they own the camera before I do I think the camera remember what it see and it be show it to I so we could stop this thing from happen it be show you all this but it be not give you last name it be show you all this but it be not tell you where or when this killing might take place Allison maybe you have not notice but the city 's come to a standstill we be in the middle of a bona fide crisis give I a name first and last well yet buy a camera that have video of this madman who be use our street for target practice that would be truly helpful he love it right someone own this camera before I do do not they you tell I people be bring they back to the store but you never explain that someone actually use this specific camera you sell I before I buy it well I do not know that to be true well I do I need the name of the previous owner Ma'am I can assure you if by some chance someone purchase the camera before you and return it to the store it pass the most rigorous of inspection before be return to inventory it be completely cover by manufacturer 's warranty I do not care about the manufacturer 's warranty I just need the name of the person who own it before I furthermore as I offer at time of purchase I would be happy to take the machine back swap it out for an easy to use model his first name be Travis he have brown hair Ma'am I be not say that someone else do buy your camera before you but if they do I still couldn'ttell you their name I be with the District Attorney 's office that be all well and good but you be go to need to speak to a manager I mean do you have a warrant or something do he not bring it back do a girl bring it back Kathy brown hair pretty I do not get it be you not happy with the camera I need some recordable dvd basically what the Mayor and the City Attorney want you to weigh in on be if we assign a disproportionate share of police to monitor the neighborhood where the wealthy people live what be our exposure if our sniper friend shoot someone in a poor neighborhood and their family decide to sue the city want to hear a scary thought which be also a great thought what if he never shoot again what be scary about that between you and I if he do not make another try I do not think there be a lot of hope we be ever go to catch he the evidence he leave behind the other night be not lead we anywhere on the other hand I suppose I would rather have one unsolved murder than two or three or four or five hell I would rather have one unsolved murder then two or three solve one I just invite Sean Caffey back down here for a little conversation think you might want to listen in from the other side of the glass you be have a conversation with he in the interrogation room that be a hell of a way to treat a widower two day after his wife be shoot to death maybe apparently there be trouble in the marriage but there be also a solid prenup in place in the event of divorce Sean would get nothing how much be she worth to he dead between the inheritance and insurance pay out about 30 million so he buy himself a long range rifle get up on that pedestrian bridge and boy talk about a lucky shot he be rich they hire people to do their dirty work sound improbable but not impossible and as it happen we be suffer from an acute shortage of lead in this particular case so yeah sure I will come with you I will pass it be okay you be not invite just an errand now that you be back want to be my date for an interrogation I suppose where do you get these your wife hire a private detective be you aware that she be contemplate divorce these photo be over a year old Maggie and I be work thing out I do not understand how be this relevant to anything should not you be out there look for a man with a gun I do not know we be not sure who we should be look for that be why we be have this conversation should I be call my lawyer you have a lawyer of your own because your late wife 's family make it very clear to I the family attorney have no interest in help you with this particular matter what do you make of he I feel really stupid really useless it be as if I be not even tune in to the same channel everything I see in my head have to do with those two kid I tell you about this morning and their plan to kill her husband so talk to I about be a player how do that work I mean you marry a really wealthy woman she make you sign a prenup

you aware that Mr Caffey be bind to a prenuptial agreement that for all intent and purpose would leave he penniless if his marriage end in divorce I do not understand what you be say penniless as a

with your work sir it be an honor to meet you and what be it you do for the District Attorney that make you so familiar with my work uh Allison be study law and criminology when she come to work for we and while she do not actually have a law degree she be prove to be a very effective resource when it come to jury selection pretty good with crime scene analysis as well I see Jury selection huh yeah well you must be a good judge of human nature keen sense of intuition you might like to join we actually I need to return this call and go over a few thing with Allison myself maybe we can reconvene back here in say ten minute Edward Cooper oh my God yes that be so strange I have a dream about he last night as you probably figure out by now Agent Cooper and his staff be go to be use the conference room as their temporary base of operation they be in town on a case but to be honest with you I be sort of hope that you would not run into each other why I do not know the man make I very nervous anyway I know I do not really need to tell you this but we need to be especially discrete about what it be you really do here and how you do it hey as long as I can sit in the room as you all know three day ago a jogger find the body of Diane Colquitt on a path in Boyce Park here in Phoenix Diane be a 16 year old prostitute appear that someone pick she up drive she to the park and then strangle she with own underwear every detail of Diane 's killing match a series of murder the Bureau and I be investigate up in Columbus Ohio four young girl dead all of they prostitute all of they strangle with their own undergarment all of they find hand bind behind their back with a sailor 's hitch knot every girl dump facedown on a jog path when be the last killing in Ohio Little over ten week ago so you be think that your killer migrate from the Midwest to here Killers be not immune to the cold they 've be know to travel south for the winter this be a very preliminary psychological profile of the killer it appear that he be threaten by woman base on the forensic evidence recover from the four Ohio victim we believe that he prefer to have sex with his victim only after they be dead have he leave any bodily fluid behind any dna to work from no he be methodical about clean up after himself extraordinarily thorough which make I suspect he be have a lot of practice do what he do I have an appointment with the coroner to personally examine Diane Colquitt 's remain my team and I will be there at 3 00 anyone from this office that would care to join we please do so JOE I be sorry to stick you with babysitte duty honey Mommy call I at the last minute to pick you guy up I get to get back to work we will be okay Daddy Bridgette and I have homework and Marie can just sit with we and watch television Police fire doctor all the number you need be on the fridge look it be your favorite show you have my cell phone you have Mommy 's cell phone one of we will be home by 5 30 at the absolute late daddy I 've get it under control okay we 've get to find something well for she to watch than this back back back back back huh what be wrong sweetie she like the other one there be nothing on the other channel back back back back back tell you woman as you indicate on the phone the victim have be fairly well clean up by her attacker but we do pull this off her underwear it be dog hair look to I like something from the terri family COOPER her fingernail have be cut someone want to be sure that we do not find any dna under they this bruise on her shoulder be probably from the killer 's knee perhaps forensic could analyze it man whistle Strangers in the Night what the killer be wear on the low half of his body denim chino excuse I I be just wonder when you say early we be deal with an experienced perpetrator someone who be good at what he do who clearly have a lot of practice I wonder if anyone have consider the possibility that the man who do this the man we be look for might be Richard Gomez clearing throat Richard Gomez no we have not consider Richard Gomez Frankly to the good of my knowledge Richard Gomez have be inactive for more than ten year any particular reason you bring his name up just uh a hunch Instinct a hunch you know what I call a hunch make without a scientific basis you know what I call an instinct uninformed by either experience or intellect I call it a distraction I call it a waste of time Forensics also might be able to speculate as to the perpetrator 's weight base on the depth of the bruise correct I if I be wrong Happily Gomez be still at large be he not how can you be so sure this be not his work what would prevent he from kill and rape these woman in Ohio seem to I if he be still out there Mrs Dubois you indicate that you be familiar with my work if that be truly the case then you know that Richard Gomez be a dominance killer he use his charm and good look to convince woman to go back to his home or a motel room somewhere private where he would violate they torture they and keep they alive while he saw they into little piece he be a passionate sadist he take pleasure in their pain this killer the Lincoln Park killer he strike from behind it be more of a blitzkrieg style of attack it be the mark of a timid personality a coward these two man might as well speak different language now any other dormant serial killer that you be curious about any other hunch any other random instinct perhaps we can continue to the important work hand it be so mortify water run he be so cut he be so convinced of his own infallibility he would not even consider the possibility Mmm yeah I think you need to cut the guy a little slack he be be catch killer for what 30 year now you spend a couple hour with the guy and all of a sudden you be bring up his most famous setback he be bind to get a little testy what do he have to get testy about Agent Cooper lead the police right to Richard Gomez he do his job it be not his fault somebody lose the evidence you be right but maybe Cooper do not see it that way catch these people be pretty much a crusade for he right so when one of they slip away I doubt he spend much time console himself with the idea that he be not personally to blame well that do not give he the right to make a fool out of I be you use this arm for anything GOMEZ why have you shut it off I be watch that scream strained scream pained yell Gomez grunt Allison gasp knock Y up sorry to bother you I need your help what do this mean Dioner Mapache it be a name it be a man 's name uh first name Dioner last name Mapache why do you ask actually I think it be a business like a bar or restaurant the kind of business that advertise on hotel ashtray wherever this business be I think it be locate nearby the hotel where Richard Gomez kill Diane Colquitt sigh close my office door Allison door close what be you do just what I always do but I believe Agent Cooper make it perfectly clear that he be not interested in any lead involve Richard Gomez that he feel very strongly that Richard Gomez have nothing to do with this woman 's death well he be wrong Allison sigh all right all right let I see if I can try and get Detective Scanlon to discretely run this down find out if there be such a place and where it might be but do I a favor stay away from the conference room keep out of Cooper 's way let us let he think that you 've move on to something else Let us let he think that you be do other thing huh okay the government want the chassis to be make with light polymer they also want it to hold six camera but if you put six camera on it the light polymer will not stand up to atmospheric pressure which mean we 've get nothing head thump be we take a break head thump I think we be take a break deep breath Aaron pretend we be not day away from our deadline think happy thought can you think happy thought for I what be you think about a J just turn three there you go my young just turn three too and now you say something back pretty soon we be have small talk that be how a break work a J like to eat play Doh Congratulations you must be very proud Marie sit in front of the tv and watch static I think she would do it for hour at a time if we would let she what nothing it be it be none of my business I be sure it be nothing you can not just say that what be nothing you say your daughter just stare at a blank channel for hour well like I say it be probably nothing and I certainly do not mean to alarm you but my brother have an autistic son that sound like the kind of thing he use to do it do not necessarily mean anything it be it be probably nothing yeah elevator bell ding bad hunch huh his name be Warren Bell he be in your local registry of sex offender one of my people remember his face back in Columbus we question he about the murder we just could not find any evidence to tie he to the crime and now he be here in Phoenix well he be a sex offender he be obligate to register whenever he move into a new community I ask they to bring he in for question sure you would not like to stick around you might find it fascinate I you think so I do not know I think I probably lack the experience and the intellect to really appreciate whatever it be you be go to do or say besides I would not want to be a distraction I would not want to waste your time want to know who Dioner Mapache be you find it already it be kind of an interesting story turn out he be a general in the mexican army kill by his own man the night before a battle give his less than inspire history I guess it be not a surprise there be only one restaurant anywhere that be name after he it be in Mexico half a block away from the El Coyote motel would this be the scene of the crime yeah this be the place I see in my dream I call the motel ask they if they would have any suspicious activity there lately if anyone match Richard Gomez 's description have check in turn out there be someone match Gomez 's description you be kid I know it we get to tell Cooper I can not wait to see the look on that egomaniac 's face nine year ago 1997 he check in under a false name he be not carry a wallet they have no way to establish his identity what be you talk about no way to establish his I be try to tell you that there be a murder at the El Coyote motel in 1997 only Richard Gomez be not the killer he be the victim look like robber tie Gomez to a chair while they ransack the place they take what they want then put two bullet in he cop think it might have be drug relate I do not know what to tell you Allison I mean unless he be unusually spry for a rot corpse I think it be fairly safe to say that Richard Gomez it be not the lead part killer Joe where be the girl Homework okay and what be you do I be watch our daughter watch her favorite channel yeah I know what you be think what channel that be what I think too that she just like to watch nothing static but I be wrong she just like to watch this particular channel Channel 282 you want to know what happen when I try to change the channel to another channel that just have static on it she start to cry want I to show you no I do not need you to prove you can make our daughter cry why be you do this I be try to learn I be try to understand watch this hey sweetie what be you watch on the tv Funny man funny man what be the

this conversation oh that be a great answer I will be in the shower you know if it bother you so much maybe you should just read to she instead of sit she in front of the tv door close COOPER August 22 1996 excuse I that be the day that Richard Gomez be acquit I mark the anniversary in my calendar every year my wife have learn to avoid I on that date she say that I be a world class brooder but now because of you August 22 be free up for more productive pursuit thank you Mrs Dubois a lot of people will sleep easy tonight because they know that Richard Gomez be dead I accuse you of waste my time of be a distraction I stand correct you have terrific instinct I wish I have be wise enough to understand what they be try to tell I thank you although to be honest I really wish they would steer I towards the Lincoln Park Killer well might not be too late for you to pitch in we could not locate Warren Bell yesterday he finally show up at his apartment this morning they be bring he in now I be head over to interview he appreciate it if you would sit in and give I the benefit of your expertise I already tell your man back at my apartment I be home watch tv the night that girl die can anyone

it hard to be so close to that man you have a hunch about he do you he keep a dog chain up somewhere it look like a garage he do not feed it it be barely alive he torture it with a burn cigarette I 've work a couple of miss child case Met people like you before you see thing do not you that must be quite a burden a long time ago at the start of my career I make a choice I dedicate myself to get inside the mind of killer to go to world where other people would not or could not it be rarely be pleasant and it be change I but it be still my choice you Mrs Dubois you go into the head of murderer whether you want to or not I admire you but I sure do not envy you that one wise choice my dear see she pick the one with monster and mayhem she take after her mother that be my girl telephone ring oh and here we go hello Allison it be Manuel Devalos I be sorry to bother you at home but I think you would like to know that the police have execute a search warrant on Warren Bell 's apartment do they find anything that link he to the murder not inside the apartment but in a garage that he have access to we do find a grey wire haired terrier my God be he still alive barely we take a sample of its hair Preliminary DNA test indicate that it be a match for the hair we find on Diane Colquitt 's body we 've place Warren Bell under arrest that be great news sir Agent Cooper want I to call you and to tell you and to send his thank Allison what do he know oh I do not think he know anything there be no deny he certainly have strong instinct Mmm well I guess I will see you in the morning see you in the morning hum you look happy man singe in Spanish what now a leg or a breast door open hello you how do how do you find I be not easy gasp sigh no wonder Cooper be absolutely certain that Richard Gomez be not the Lincoln Park Killer I can not believe I be say this it be not hard to understand imagine that you be he you catch this guy you do everything you need to to be sure that he get the death penalty and then they set he free he like to kill you know he be go to do it again you track he down you rectify the situation so if you understand it what be we do here in our kitchen at 3 00 in the morning talk about it I just do not understand what I be suppose to do about it be I suppose to speak out Ruin the life the career of a good man just because he could not live with the idea of Richard Gomez get away with murder six murder even if I want to tell the world what Cooper have do it all happen nine year ago I doubt I could prove anything you know what this be easy do not do anything I be completely serious Al I mean besides it be not like you be absolutely certain that Cooper do it he shoot he once in the head he shoot he once in the stomach I see it Joe I know but you also see Richard Gomez kill Diane Colquitt in that very same room and we both know that do not happen my point be your wire have be a little crossed lately and unless you be absolutely certain that it be true you can not a accuse a man of murder and even if you be certain I do not sense that you want to accuse this particular man of this particular murder and I do not blame you inaudible shouting door slam heavy sigh thank I be negotiate a deal with Warren Bell 's attorney Agent Cooper do not like it what kind of deal we be offer to take the death penalty off the table in exchange for a full confession to all the murder I 've get a few piece of dog hair it be not much to stand on when you be ask a jury to sentence a man to death give the paucity of corroborate evidence I feel the full confession be the good way to end this take Bell off the street for the rest of his life and bring closure to the victim ' family I 've speak with the authority in Ohio they agree with I obviously Agent Cooper be advocate strongly for the pursuit of the death penalty I do not sense that he be big on compromise Noticed that do you okay well it be clear what we get to do we get to tell he that the satellite can only carry one camera AARON Joe this be a government contract you sure you want to tell they we can not meet their spec no I want to tell they that their spec be fanciful a creation of pure whimsy on a par with the work of Lewis Carroll MARIE Airplane but I can not do that so I be just go to tell they that the satellite can only carry one camera Airplane Airplane can you hold on a sec Hey Bridgette do you turn on the tv for your sister BRIDGETTE she ask I to daddy it be no problem I be just ask Airplane Airplane if we should Hey Aaron do your son just say airplane uh yeah he be watch tv he be he would not happen to be run around the room with his arm spread out like a couple of wing would he he be actually why can you tell I what he be watch otis the Octopus it be that show where the big guy in the fuzzy suit make he do jump jack sorry what channel be he watch Nugget you know the kid 's channel I be glad he like it it cost I 10 99 a month so it be a premium station

talk about what be the good news uh I do not believe that our daughter have autism in fact I do not believe it will actually be necessary for she to see a doctor at all well that be good news and the bad news I think she might be a felon excuse I I think she be steal cable door creak softly light switch click phone ring hello it be Edward Cooper Sorry to wake you Mrs Dubois the district attorney give I your number we both feel that you would want to hear about it right away hear about what you might want to turn on your tv I do not know what to tell you God bless America last night my attorney be advise I to take a deal so that I could avoid go on trial for my life then at 5 00 this morning a prison guard be shake I awake and tell I I can go free I do not understand cooper well as I understand it Bell 's lawyer ask the prosecution to produce the evidence against his client accord to the law they be entitled to a second dna test at a lab of their choice apparently when they go to the evidence room to retrieve the dog hair it be go no one can find it this be unbelievable do they have any idea what might have happen to it not really the district attorney think one of the clerk must 've screw up sigh what do you think I do not know I do not know what to think however it happen the evidence be go and without it there be no way to prove that Warren Bell be the Lincoln Park Killer he be a free man BELL of course this be an enormous relief for I and my family and to anyone who want to see the real Lincoln Park Killer bring to justice like I say God bless America ALLISON it must have be hard to get rid of the handsaw the one Richard Gomez use to cut his victim into little piece I 've be think about it it be kind of bulky an awkward shape it must have be hard for you to get rid of unlike say a few strand of dog hair it sound like you be accuse I of something Mrs Dubois I be I be because I know I know what you do I know you got rid of the evidence against Richard Gomez I know you track he to Mexico I know you put two bullet into he that be a colorful theory I be guess you can not prove any of it or I would be talk to the police and not a consultant wry chuckle I be not go to tell anyone about what you do to Gomez I can carry around that knowledge and live just fine but know what you be go to do that I do not think I can live with I can not just step aside and let that happen so before you go through with what you be plan before you kill Warren Bell you need to know that I be on to you I know what be come and I will find a way to expose you exhale you really be an extraordinary woman Mrs Dubois I can see why the district attorney value your service so highly as far as Warren Bell be concern my guess be that he will keep his nose clean for a while he know he be in the spotlight right now but someday someday not too far from now the sickness that live inside he will make its way back to the surface he will kill again he will not be able not to kill again unless something happen to he unless the universe intervene maybe he will wrap his car around a telephone pole maybe he will die in an accident in his apartment who know maybe he will just disappear that happen sometimes too my guess be if something like that do come to pass you will think about Diane Colquitt lie in a park with her pantie wrap around her neck you will think about all those dead girl in Ohio or maybe you will even think about that poor dog down in the garage and who know what you will do I know we only just meet each other Mrs Dubois but I think we both

year ago I become aware that in addition to Henry 's voracious ambition he also possess a seemingly endless appetite for what be the polite way to say it companionship not that he do not love I I never doubt that but apparently in addition he need something more dangerous something more varied and you know about this I sense it we have no child he be extraordinarily busy with his career I still could not account for all his time one night he come to I he be terrify something have happen he never tell I what and I never ask someone get pregnant I suspect whatever it be whatever he have

do you have a good time I hope you have a good time and do not worry I be not go to let anyone know you be here I know how much trouble a kid your age can get into by skip school do you put the dirty magazine back can not have my wife find those but if you ever want to look at them again I can even make you one of my special drink nice meeting you Jimmy go after he make sure he be okay he be okay he be drunk he be young he be sweet you know I be only a couple year old it be not about that just go after he look at you I be impressed there be nothing impressive about a 55 year old man who get up before dawn to trudge a mile and a half just because he be convinced if he do not he will die ten year before his time I beg to differ I be impress Duly note what bring you out at this ridiculous hour I call your house and your wife say you already leave Henry Rykoff the dead assemblyman know Jimmy Nessler okay Allison Jimmy Nessler 's be dead almost 15 year he die from a combination of starvation dehydration and exposure Assemblyman Rykoff die several day ago and in my opinion by his own hand what do the two have to do with each other I do not know something I think when Mrs Rykoff be talk about the assemblyman 's appetite and I presume all of this come to you the way that most thing come to you I be sorry but I do not see how any of this be relevant to anything the boy be dead Rykoff be dead since we can be reasonably certain that the dead boy do not kill Rykoff what if it be the other way around I just like to confirm in fact the assemblyman know the boy why I be sorry I know why I guess what I be really try to say be would it be such a terrible thing to just let sleep dog lie yes be not Jimmy Nessler entitle to justice if someone steal his life be not it our job to find out who do it of course it be but the victim be long dead and the man you think might be responsible be dead too and frankly I be dubious that any of be true and I strongly doubt that even if it be we could prove any of it what I be convince of give the time in which we live and the climate in which we work if you go swim around in all this muck you will definitely stir up some kind of dirt and it may reflect badly on a man who be not alive to defend himself so where do that leave we I would still like to try and find out if he know the boy and how do you hope to do that ask no I be not bring his widow back here she be not out the door ten minute and the governor be on the phone lecture I about decency and fairness and respect for the grieving can I talk to his attorney or what about that aide of his the one that his wife call to help move the body Sir I have to take a shower just stay away from the widow and if the governor call I be put he on with you I be sure he know he or at least know of he we all do I do it be a big deal when this kid go miss I mean our school organize search party I think I be in the tenth grade and he be in like seventh yeah definitely the assemblyman be almost certainly aware of he no I mean before he go miss do you think they know each other Mr Frank Casey call I Casey I do not know this be all before my time I do not start work for Mr Rykoff until I be out of college Hmm but you know he I do yard work for the Rykoffs and Mr Rykoff be very much a father figure to I really push I to go to college which I be not inclined to do introduce I to politic or public service which be what he like to call it but again back then I be in high school I have no idea he know Jimmy I mean why would he let I ask you a question I read just this morning that you be be ask to run to fill the assemblyman 's vacant seat you be young you be at the beginning of your career you get a call in the middle of the night to move a dead body to disturb what may be a crime scene at the very least you must know you be put your future on the line why do you do it same reason you and your boss be work so hard to cover it up because he be earn that because it be the right thing to do because I be ask you make it sound like a privilege fudge the truth maybe I 've be in politic too long but yes I consider it an honor to be ask to help a great man maintain his dignity at a moment when he do not have the strength tdo it for himself so you really admire he I like to think I understand he you know with all he accomplish Henry Rykoff be actually a very lonely and disconnected man but I will tell you something when I be a kid when I be constantly be tell that I be not the smart boy in the room or the good looking or the strong or the fast Henry Rykoff and I do not know why be the first adult to sayto I Y there be a future for you if you want it if you be willing to work for it he write letter of recommendation to get I into school loan my mom money for tuition and when I graduate he immediately take I under his wing make I part of his staff why I think he sense I might have be a bit lonely a bit disconnected too Jim Jimmy you okay no I be not okay I do not feel good I feel sick and now I be go to get in trouble for skip school and I think you and that old guy I think you be a couple of pervs what be you talk about you know what I be talk about how have my clothe get off of I you want to swim no I do not I do not even know how to swim I feel so sick I need my mom you be a perv and that other guy be a perv and I be tell my mom you put something in my soda Nobody 's tell anybody anything you understand nobody be tell anybody anything now you sit back down and I promise you you will feel well soon I be go home and I be tell no you be not now do not be stupid you be not go anywhere not until you calm down what do you think you be go to say to your mother do you know who that old guy be do you know how important he be there what be you do I be get my bike get your bike what be you nut you can not even see the bottom of Shut up I be get it you do not seem to be make much progress this be dumb help I out what so you can run home to Mommy and tell she all kind of lie just help I out give I your hand what be you go to tell Mommy just give I your hand Swear to oh Jimmy Jimmy he be dead what these be his book they be the only thing leave he fall I mean he be climb because I throw his bike and he ask I for help but I I could not help put those in here Casey my Casey Casey CASEY so how can I be of help as you may or may not be aware when we recover Jimmy Nessler 's remain early in the week from the bottom of that live cave we also recover some other artifact that apparently have be down there as long as he have okay a bicycle that apparently be his some microscopic bit of fiber that we believe be all that be leave of his clothe after 15 year in the element and a Saint Christopher 's medal this be all fascinating but the back of the medal be engrave with the initial c E F those be your initial be not they Casey Edward Frank also the date 11 15 74 that be your birthday so you be suggest that perhaps it might just be your medal okay I will concede that it just might be what be the point no point not a big one anyway just that you tell Mrs Dubois only yesterday that you really do not know the Nessler boy not personally and I do not do I play near those cave Horse around there Sure everyone do be it possible that I drop or lose my medal Sure where be you go with this not go anywhere just now that you be go to be run for public office now that you be go to be under some scrutiny we just want to give you a chance to revise your statement with regard to how well you know the Nessler boy if you choose to I do not need to revise my statement I stand by what I say be we through here just one more thing uh as you know I be work to get the coroner to issue a death certificate for Assemblyman Rykoff that would indicate he die of natural cause and I almost have he there but then he realize that the trauma to the back of the assemblyman 's neck be as severe as the trauma to the front I be sorry you be lose I if a man wereto hang himself even if it be only a botch attempt to heighten sexual sensation the trauma would only occur to the front of the neck the place where the noose and the throat meet it would take someone come up from behind the assemblyman strangle he with great force to create the kind of trauma apparent at the back of the neck Wh what be you say we be say that it appear that someone murder Henry Rykoff then stage it to make it look as though he accidentally cause his own death and you think that someone be I with any murder case we look for mean motive and opportunity you certainly have the mean you have the physical strength to strangle the assemblyman and lift he into that noose you have the opportunity we be very aware that you have a key to the Rykoff residence along with their alarm code that you frequently take care of their home when they be away and as far as the motive congratulation on run unopposed to fill the assemblyman 's seat that be absurd this whole thing 's absurd everyone know I be be groom as Henry 's successor everyone know he be plan to retire after this term do you honestly believe I would kill a man to take something he be prepared to give I a year and a half from now I be go to remember this moment Mr District Attorney when I be sit in the state capital building stare at your budget contemplate anything to do with you or your office I will remember this moment I think you be a smart man I think you be smart people but smart people do not make absurd allegation and they certainly do not make absurd allegation they can not prove I will see myself out he be right we can not prove a damn thing and he know it sigh ALLISON I know what happen I know who do it I just can not prove it and I be never go to be able to well you know what you need a good night 's sleep trust I just close your eye get some rest and everything will look well in the morning groan that be easy for you to say you be right in fact I think I will say it again close your eye Shut up CASEY hey you want to see I Casey my Casey thank for come over um I 've be think a lot about the plan we make my not run this term endorse you Truth be I just do not think I can do it what I be go to run again and I would very much like your help be you forget I know thing I know thing that would make it very difficult for you to get reelect that be a silly threat young man you know thing and everything you know about I involve you too so while you might be able to tarnish I at the end of my career you will destroy your own in the process well I might do it anyway I do not want to wait another four year I can not you can and you will now let us not forget who have what on whom you have nothing on I I be the victim in all this that be not the way I see it the Nessler boy 's book bag cover with your fingerprint all over it maybe not enough to prove you kill he but you would certainly have a lot of question to answer so let us calm down it be only four more year and who know maybe you will get lucky I could die in office everything okay everything be fine Everything be great you be right I close my eye and suddenly everything be well who be you call a locksmith I know sorry to wake you Mr District Attorney uh there be a safe that you and I need to crack right now welcome to www 1000fr com hey I need help here thank for

and that be your problem because well he be not leave the money to you be he look I 've be dream about this man for what two day now Presumably there be a reason maybe it be to help figure out who do this to he or maybe it be to be there when the few people that he encounter in his life gather together to say good bye I be not smart enough to know but I have be do this long enough to know that something about this man his or his death maybe matter yeah it be just that yesterday you be not home tonight you be go out which remind I I see Bridgette 's diorama in the kitchen who be the old lady

down I guess a lonely man he keep mostly to himself it take time to get to know Morgan it take effort we grow up together so I have an advantage we know each other 's secret and one of Morgan 's big secret be that he be happy by himself Happiest in his apartment once or twice a month I could usually drag he out to a movie or a ball game but that be it for he Pleasure in small dose that be all he could handle I be go to miss he the talk after we would leave the theater or just sit in his apartment stare out the window his favorite way to deal with the world good bye Morgan you be a good man

not go to change anything I be still go to be dead you deserve justice Mr Turley and we certainly do not want whoever do this to you to do it again oh I would not worry about that I do not think he would I get the distinct impression that this be a one time thing well on the off chance that you be wrong be there anything you can tell I about this man he rebuff you he rebuff I I look down for a second to get something out of my purse and he be go the nerve of some ghost he look so threatened like I be some kind of problem or something well who know maybe he be embarrassed embarrassed by what well the guy 's at his own memorial service he be spy on his friend listen to what they have to say about he it be a little narcissistic it be a little embarrassing if you get catch at it I just want he to know that I care I just want he to know that whoever do this to he be not simply go to get away with it all right I get that I do and I be sure that he do too so just be patient if he really want your help I be sure he will come ask for it I certainly would if I be dead she really do it I be sorry I just think you seem like you really need to see the truth it seem like you be have a hard

Vincent we do not need watch where we be go why Gladys all right I know you hate I but I never know you hate I this much you know for a fellow murder victim you be be pretty Zen about all this I be dead why should not I be Zen be not you tick do not you want to get the guy who kill you I be beyond all that now you should be too what happen to you anyway Mugging huh well um not exactly what do you mean not exactly how have you end up getting shoot in that alley I it be kind of a a long story actually look at I friend I get nothing but time right you know what I would rather show you than tell you we have to go somewhere else now my apartment yeah uh seriously Vincent I be not sure that you want to see this oh all right fine your apartment it be Vincent and Gladys DiScala get it anything else she cut he up with a saw that be why we can not find he no way to get a warrant but once I have an address I could certainly swing by and ask a few question about her husband 's whereabout you want to come with can not I be on my way to Morgan Turley 's apartment what for well in that same dream Morgan start to suggest that maybe there be more to it than just a mugging and then he say he would rather show Vincent why he be kill than tell he he make it sound like the answer be somewhere in his apartment I just I just want to take a look hey kitty kitty oh kitty can I help you with something hello again hello be there something I can help you with I be just look at this chair I be wonder why it be point towards the window I like look out the window I 've always

do not call she I do not want she to see where I live Somebody else call somebody else what why be you look at I like that I do not know I ask you if you could tell I anything about your killer the other day and you just disappear I apologize I I be confuse you be alive but you could see I I do not understand about people like you I be sorry if I frighten you it be okay you look nervous I be not nervous it be awfully dark in here you afraid someone be go to see you hey wait a second be not that her be not that the woman we be just talk about the one you leave all that money to the one who say that she barely know you Cadence something ne tonight as police continue to find small piece of Glendale resident Vincent DiScala bury throughout the backyard of his home his wife Gladys DiScala be be take into custody but so far police refuse to discuss the specific of the evidence against she at this time I do not quite know how I be go to break this to poor Bridge I do not think we have enough magnet to stick this a diorama depict the father of our country to the refrigerator Hmm do I mention the a I just do not get it why would not he want to tell I who do this to he give I a description tell I what really happen because he do not want you to know but why why would a person in their right mind not want their killer find do not you find it mystify uh no what I find mystifying be your insistence on help this man despite the fact that he do not want it he be dead let he lie in peace for that matr how about the two of we lie in peace that make no sense that be crazy why protect the person who end your life that be crazy how about leave everything you have to a woman that you barely know a woman you say this guy peep on every day consider the source Allison yeah well I love you too what be the deal with the cat what do you mean what be the deal with the cat they be cat do not you like cat not really but I guess you do huh I be allergic actually what then how come you get so many I mean hadso many you ever be in love Vincent I do not know give the event of the past few day and uh give the circumstance of my present condition I have to say I would like to think about that before I answer why her look like she have a party she be get a lot to celebrate she just come into a lot of money good for her yup leave she everything I have I do not get it what be not to get look at her okay but she be alive and you be kind of indispose be you try to tell I that she may have have something to do with your untimely pass it be not untimely Vincent it be precisely time it be perfectly time wait a second be you try to tell I that she be the one who shoot you you want to hear the whole story you want to hear all about it okay Hang on a second I think somebody else be here somebody be listen to we it be you be not it nobody invite you here wake up do you hear I I say wake up wake up get your head out of my death you want I to give you a bad dream okay you ask for it that be so not fair Morgan Turley be in love with the cat lady Cadence Bixby when I hear about that million dollar he leave she I have a hunch he might have be more hot than cold on her I think he overplay his hand though it be kind of tough to close the deal from where he be do not you think I think she may have seduce he talk he into get that ridiculous life insurance policy and then kill he can we talk to her Ms Bixby I be District Attorney Devalos this be Allison Dubois of course you already know Detective Scanlon we very much appreciate you come down to speak with we now you 've go too far this woman have nothing to do with anything your assistant on the phone say you want to talk to I about what happen to poor Mr Turley have someone come forward with new information be they try to claim the reward money that I offer let us talk in the conference room please do you want I to give you bad dream every night for the rest of your life and that would change my life how exactly I be beg you put a stop to this no good can come of this tell I what really happen in that alley who shoot you why why do you care you ever hear of the expression die in peace Ms Bixby it be my understanding that when you come to see Detective Scanlon the other day you tell he you hardly know Morgan Turley that be true I run a small non profit shelter for cat I take in stray try to find they home one day Mr Turley just walk through the door say he love cat be wonder if he could adopt one be that a crime and that be it that be the extent of your relationship well it actually happen a number of time I believe he ultimately end up adopt about a half dozen stray sound like a nice man he seem so Ms Bixby do not you find it odd that someone you barely know would leave you so much money of course it be be overwhelming Morgan Turley have change my life I can only guess that the cat I place with he give he great joy that he be look for a way to say thank you to support the work that make those adoption possible but why leave that money to you specifically he do not leave it to your shelter he do not leave it to any of the big well know organization that do similar work what do you mean why because I trust she because it be my money I could do whatever the hell I want to with it oh my goodness you think that I might have something to do with his murder do not you no no one be say that we be explore all sort of possibility but it would be helpful if you could tell we where you be this past Saturday night be there anyone who can vouch for your whereabouts no I be home but I be by myself be I in trouble do I need a lawyer I be beg you look at she be that the face of a killer be that the face of a person who could pull the trigger on another human being she rescue pussycat for God 's sake so you never have any contact with Mr Turley outside of the shelter you do not know he in any context except as a man who be interested in adopt cat when they first call to tell I he have pass away and leave I his insurance money I could not even remember who he be what do I tell you come on Mrs Dubois you can put a stop to this you can do it do you know you be neighbor oh no no no no do not tell she that really I believe he live directly across the street from you and who know maybe you can see his apartment from yours would not that be an amazing coincidence and maybe he could see your apartment from his oh okay I give I will tell you anything you want to know just do not tell she anything else do not ask she anything else be not there any way we can check on that excuse yourself right now let us go out into the hallway and I will tell you everything perhaps can you excuse I a second I need to step outside I need to check on something I will be right back I do it you do what I kill myself you do not do too cross my heart and hope to die ask anybody who know I I 've always talk about kill myself that be not funny and that be not true there be nothing about your injury that be consistent with suicide besides everyone know life insurance do not pay off on suicide if you prove it be a suicide which we can not because it be not well then I guess we be at a standoff really I be just think of take Cadence for a little tour of your place check out the cat show she your view from your living room window no yes oh no do not tell I you be drag he into this too I be sorry to bother you do you work here yes I do I be look for my fianc Cadence Cadence Bixby your fianc your fianc do you know where she might be she be right in there thank you never tell I that Cadence and Nick be that be it I be do the guy do not care about catch his killer why should I it be just so strange you would think the way he always keep an eye on her he would have a clue that she be involve with his good friend do I feel sorry for the guy absolutely be I go to lose any more sleep over he no I either okay I be ready pull the trigger you sure about this do not back out on I Nick please I be beg you with friend like that huh I do not understand Morgan want to die that be before he know his good pal be shack up with the girl he love now I think he be have second thought do you send I that dream Mr DiScala I know you 've be try to help he consider the hit the poor guy take today I think you ought to know the truth you okay Vincent fill I in show I what really happen in that alley but why Morgan why would you do that I love Cadence Bixby from the moment I lay eye on she through this window I love Cadence Bixby I watch she up here for month get ready for work in the morning come home from work in the evening and I think to myself my God if I could just get close to this woman if I could just matter to this woman and then I decide to follow she I want to know more than what I see from up here where she work where she eat and then I discover the shelter it take I week to get up the courage to go in and once I do once I be actually close to her she be even more beautiful more special and I never know what to do and I never know what to say I just keep adopt cat it be the one thing that work whenever I do it she would be mine for a half hour Asong as it take to fill out the paperwork she would be mi but that still do not explain do not it I show she to he right here a little more than a year ago I think if he see she he could understand why she be the only thing I ever talk about I guess he understand more than I know I can not believe he keep that from you know what you be plan to do but it be his plan Mrs Dubois it be his idea the million dollar insurance policy the stage mug it be all his idea he just talk I into it this do not make sense how can anyone possibly talk you into let they kill you I would be threaten to do it to myself for year suddenly it all make sense I could put myself out of the pain I be in and give she this remarkable gift I would matter to she and little do you know all that money would not just be go to Cadence it would eventually find its way to her new husband your good friend Nick I be really depressed I have not feel this suicidal since since I be alive well maybe there be something we can do about that where be she Ms Bixby be wait for you in the conference room I believe you know the way Cade I do not know what these people have be fill your head with but I be here to tell you it be not true I call a lawyer he be on his way but I do not understand why would you do that Nick if everything they tell I be not true why would you even need a lawyer come on let us talk about this outside what be wrong with right here we do not have anything to hide do we Cadence be just tell we how odd she find it that it be not until Morgan pass away that you even mention that he be your friend Darling I explain that already he and I be not get along we be not speak that be all I love he but he be a depressed moody guy if I have know you two have already meet through the shelter do not you think I would 've tell you I wish you have because consider the amount of money he be plan on leave I it would 've be nice to get to know he a little well maybe even have he over for dinner now that would have be a fascinating dinner you your good friend and the woman you be see behind his back might have make it more difficult convince he to let you shoot he though look Morgan be kill by a stranger a mugger I know you be under a lot of pressure I be sorry you be have trouble find the person who do this but if you think I be go to stand here and let you accuse I of of hurt my friend funny thing about mugging Mr Lewin the money that gets steal often do not stay with the mugger very long it gets spend which be unfortunate because it frequently contain evidence that connect the mugger to the crime SCANLON at the very least you might find the perpetrator 's fingerprint at most if it be a violent mugging there could be microscopic amount of blood spatter from the victim can

suspicion that a homicidal doll help a six year old 65 pound boy kill a full grow adult male I would say that be an absolutely prudent course of action okay forget about the doll leave the doll out of this imagine for a second that that little boy do pull the ladder away from underneath his father can you blame he you know what I be not in a position to blame he or not and neither be you I mean we do not even know for a fact that his father be abuse he just like you do not know for a fact that the little kid have anything to do with his father 's death I mean do not you say that the police have already declare the death accidental so what be your point my point be the reason not to discuss this with your boss be because there be not anything really worth discuss not because you think the little boy might have be actually justify in take his father 's life I mean you be the judge and jury now that can not really be what you mean I do not know I do not know what I mean besides it be like you say there be nothing to discuss the man 's death be an accident where you go to bed I I just make the coffee wait a second I need you to feel my head well you be fine I need to ask you something but I be afraid it might sound a bit abstract okay do you sense any kind of energy in this room a presence of any kind be you ask I if your office be haunt about two and a half year before you start work here my daughter take her own life she be 20 at the time every year around this time I two day ago she be sit right where you be now I be sorry I do not see anything I do not feel anything of course not the truth be there be nothing she could really say I mean when a child kill themselves they really do get the last word that be sorta the point be not it do not blame yourself she would not want you to do that who who can I blame it be kind of a baseline requirement of a parent that their child survive be not it you have no way of know what she be think what she be feel that be funny you should mention that because I just discover yesterday that my wife have be work for some time with a man who claim he can see the dead he can communicate with the dead he be a charlatan it enrage I and I realize here I be work with the genuine article for almost three year now never once do I tell you about Arianna and never once do I ask if you could reach her not much of

hour or so at least until the coroner and forensic have have a chance to take a look maybe generate some clue get we close to the animal who do this I think that would make this a much easy pill for

mention in Father 's sermon so I take temporary vow of poverty celibacy and obedience and I do not know what happen to the vow of poverty and celibacy but it soon become very evident that I have no talent whatsoever for obedience so then I decide to go into the family business become a cop I go to college I study criminology I too back then for a woman it be tough anyway I see an ad for Ameritips and I 've be an investigator with they for 20 year and I get my wish I be poor I be celibate and I do not have to listen to anyone how many people phone in about the Goldman boy we log about 1 400 call 1 400 call Most of those be crank and other be people fish for the reward money the credible one really jump out at you which be why I be here Green denim jacket that be rather specific be not it of course it be not the kind of clue that be go to get you a reward oh I do not care about the reward I do not care about the money the money would be good it would be great but I really can not get that little boy out of my mind I know what you mean this be a ground floor plan of the toy store where the Goldman boy be abduct I wonder if you would not mind indicate with the cursor where you be when you see the man take he what do you mean well the x here be where Mr Goldman say his son be stand the last time he see he and this green X here be the position of the father where would you have be I mean you would have have to have be fairly close to see that the jacket be denim be you in the store at all Allison enjoy your iced tea you should google I my married name be Dubois Allison Dubois D U b o I S I know what I be talk about the jacket be green and the man who take he he like to dance and I think the little boy be dead you think the little boy be dead well I work for the parent and I think I would know if the little boy be dead I think you be one of the cruel people I 've ever meet well I be not try to be I see his spirit visit his parent last night you see look I up it be on your computer right there for all the world to see Eeny meeny miny moe Bridge catch a tiger by the toe I know what I want for Christmas if he holler I want my own room let he go what be

body be just go the skin tissue be nothing but a hard crust the blood you see there come from his eye his nose his mouth and his anus that be enough Detective we be go to begin reinterviewe all the store employee this morning I be hope that fairly soon the lab will be able to tell we the exact nature of the poison that should certainly help point we towards whoever might have do this I do not think we can keep a lid on it much long I know you be not look forward to call the parent I be just afraid if we do not too many people be aware cop lab technician for the medium not to find out we do not have a single clue we do not have a single lead on who this might be well there be one but it be not much to hang your hat on I be not even sure if it be credible I need something for the press he may have be wear a green denim jacket you find a fiber Allison Dubois have a dream Sir I will uh call the parent I will notify the medium the boy be dead there be no lead at the present time this shocking news just in the Coroner 's office confirm that the body of Ben Goldman that young boy report miss since last week be apparently discover by authority sometime yesterday detail of the

do not mean to put you on the spot but I know from all the article I 've read that you 've help the police find miss people before you dream about they right yes but I think if you find she I could talk some sense into her convince she that she be make a terrible mistake she be do this before run away when there be a lot of pressure Bonnie but what I need you to understand be the impression I get the thing that I see I can not count on they to point I toward your daughter just because I want they to look uh true confession time I be fundamentally a skeptic about these sort of thing I 've already be on the phone with a number of private investigator having say that we obviouslyant to make sure we 've leave no stone unturne Allison I promise you if you come up empty if you come up dry I will understand I mean you only just meet she last night and briefly at that I really do understand I mean it be not like you 've be dream about her voice break it be not like she be on your wavelength or anything well I guess you be help the Barristers I mean what else could I say she be desperate and so nice I have be dream about her daughter I have and you be try to get a job from her husband and I just I I do not feel like there be anything else I could say I mean it be true all the dream I 've have about she have be about her past but still I mean what else could I say you say the only thing you could say thank you and just remember if we ever hope to send our three girl to college you damn well well find she okay how about this be it possible that you 've dream about Paris because that be where Melissa 's run off to that make no sense make sense to I oh come on what woman in her right mind would go to the place where her first marriage fall apart to figure out whether or not to get marry a second time move on what else do you remember from that first dream well she be upset she do not want to be there Paris I mean that be it that be it he pour she a glass of wine she stab he through the hand with a corkscrew those be the highlight what that be all right I do not want to work there anyway all right that be not fair it be not my fault that the dream I be having have nothing to do with where she be now the second one same as the first yes second one same as the first Corkscrew through hand smash bottle against wall sound romantic she say that Paris have be a mistake he say they should have go to the cabin what he call it their secret hideaway the cabin that be what he call it do either of they happen to mention where it be I be go to call Peter he be not go to know where it be it be a secret hideaway yeah well maybe he can help we find his ex son in law he be get to know where it be it be his secret I hate these foreground tree I hate they yesterday ill hate they today Mr Henley hi my name 's Allison Dubois I speak with your receptionist about an hour ago oh right uh yeah Bonnie and Peter 's friend have we meet before maybe one of their party you look awfully familiar Mrs Dubois oh sorry I be sorry Bonnie try to tell I what exactly it be you do for a living and I do not get it this be it this and six other building like it we design and create exhibit for museum and exhibition all over the world that be very impressive thank you this be one of those day where I feel like an overpaid window dresser so thank you now what can I do for you be you shop for a life sized historical diorama of your very own or be there something else I can help you with today Mr Henley actually I be hope to talk to you about your ex wife she be miss Missing may be overstate it uh she run away her parent be very concerned about her sound like my Melissa so what scare she off this time I do not know how much you know I do not know how much the two of you have keep in contact she be plan on getting marry next month Mel and I have not speak in year I need to do some healing after our marriage end and for my own peace of mind I just have to cut off contact for a little while I understand I be sorry I do not mean to stir up any painful memory just no one else seem to know where she might be so you think you would come to the last guy that Melissa run out on and see if he could shed any light I know the two of you have a cabin now I know where I know you from you be in the paper a while back you work with that district attorney right the one who mess up the serial killer thing well same old Bonnie leave it to she to find someone like you to help she with Melissa now what do you say that we have a cabin no we do not have a cabin there be a cabin that we rent that Melissa really like it be on Lake Mead and I think she like it so much because her parent do not know about it it be kind of our secret hideaway be that where you think she might be I be not sure I be just try to help we go there maybe three or four time but Melissa handle all the arrangement so I do not even remember the address I be sorry the owner 's first name be Chuck I think sorry I know Peter and Bonnie be probably beside themselves but she will turn up she always do say hi to they for I will you yeah thank you JOE yeah Lake Mead well we hope it help okay I be look forward to it Bye I take it no one have hear from Melissa yet not yet they be go to call the Lake Mead Tourist Board first thing in the morning see if they know of any local name Chuck who have cabin for rent it would be completely wrong during ts periodcrisis to wonder when and if he be ever go to offer you that job would not it yes it would be completely wrong but I can not help but wonder either be there some particular reason you do not want to take this to the Barristers Allison this be not an easy call to make hey sorry to wake you up in the middle of the night Peter but my wife think your daughter be in the clutch of some maniac you do not get to pick and choose hey which dream you want to believe in listen I be not ask to pick and choose I be just say that if we be go to deliver this horrific news can we at least serve it up with a side order of hope just tell I that you see the the make and model of the car or the license plate that you have some clue as to where all this happen this be just suppose to be so simple Dream the dream find the girl get the job do we have to wake they up in the middle of the night do you think it will hold till morning it be like you say I do not have any clue just bad news yeah I think it will hold till morning the trunk of someone 's car Allison um our daughter leave we a message she need time to think she be not abduct she be not kidnap yes we ask you to help we find she but uh I do not think what you be say make much sense I know how strange this sound the dream be very clear your daughter be in danger I think you need to call the police I think you need to file a miss person report I think you need to launch a search for her we launch this search on the basis of nothing other than this woman 's dream and it turn out she be fine turn out she be do exactly what she say she be go to do think she be go to be furious with we Peter this woman be try to help we she be try to warn we she be right about Lake Mead I be partially we call there first thing this morning there be a cabin owner name Chuck I do not remember his last name he know exactly who Melissa be he rent a place to her several time before but he have not hear from she in year and she certainly be not up there now Fine Peter you win she be only half right look all I be say be we have three different private investigator out there look for her why do not we take a step back you take a step back someone I trust be tell I my daughter be be hold against she will I know what I have to do I be call the police PETER she be change a lot since that time but Peter do not look happy what other choice do we have Joe well how seriously be the police go to take all this once they hear that you be involve no one be go to mention I oh excuse I Steven hi uh come in Come come in my plane get in a little early my favorite son in law to be I be glad you be here what what be all this Steven I can not give you specific just now but suffice it to say

our bill do not you what do youwant I to say as little as possible look when I workedat aerodytech I do a lot of thingsthat I do not want to do but that be the job and they be pay mea salary to get it do I do those thingsbecause I need the money because we neededthe money he be a murderer he murder his wifein cold blood you think I know well I do not knowwhat to tell you 'cause last night you know

onlywhat we grow we will homeschool the kid I do not sayi be quit I do not say I wasgive the money back I just say that this change it for I yesterday it feel good but I guess feel good isnot a perk I get this time I be go to drive the kidsto school I will see youthis afternoon see you this afternoon hey uh I be ariel dubois'father I be wonder if I couldtalk to you for a second Watt you be late not a terribly auspiciousstart mrs Dubois I be really sorry I should have be herein plenty of time I forgot that I do not havemy official i d anymore and that they take awaymy permanent parking space they make I go upto the third the judge take ill there be no court today I do not know why but somehow I expect you would have know thatbefore anyone else anyway my boy have an epiphanylast night he want to testifyin his own defense I tell he I thoughtit be ill advise of course that onlyhardene his resolve I think we would havea little rehearsal a little uh mock trialthis afternoon uh attorney watt I have to talk to youabout john edgemont no actually no you don'T you be not the only one with good instinctsaround here mrs Dubois I have a hunch that you be goingto tell I something about my client something about our client that I do not need to hear well I think you do I have a dream about himlast night oh I be sureyou do but whatever you dreamtdoesn't change the fact that there be a manaccuse of murder who need someoneto mount his defense and speak for myself only I would like to be that someone the pay be goodand the work be interesting and if you would like to bethat someone too you change the subjectand change it quickly because whatever you thinkabout I you should know that I be notkeen on suborn perjury now john edgemont want to tell his sideof the story to that jury and you know as well as I do that I can not put he on thestand if I know he be guilty good I be glad we seeeye to eye on this we will reconvene at 2 00 you might want to show uparound 1 45 parking can be trickyat that build so you admit that you and yourwife fight on the nightof her death yes we have an argument what about the child my child myra be a a freshmanat college and she be take to come and goingas she please Stacey think we shouldlay down some ground rule about her hour or insist thatshe move to campus stay in a dorm and you disagree I like have my childrenwith I at home I just I like it and be myrathe only thing that you two disagreedabout that night no no we also hada conversation about chloe what about chloe she require a lot ofattention do not she yes chloe requiresconstant supervision we have nurse but it be it be uh it be always difficultto have a child with special needsat home stacey do not have a lotof patience she feel that we shouldput chloe in a facility in an institution that be right and again you you do not agree I be fairly adamant that bothmy child should live at home Watt W wait a second let us talk about this word adamant it conjure up allsort of image it make you sound intractable let I makesomethe clear here no one be ask you to lie but it would be veryhelpful to our cause if somehow this jurywas make to believe that the ideaof send chloe away be something you might havereluctantly consider Myra but it be just not true my father would neverput chloe in an institution we be a family she belong at home with we I know that ms Edgemont and I admire it but without lie aboutany of the material fact of this case we have to paint a picturefor the jury on who your father be we want it to be impossiblefor they to imagine that he be do thishorrible thing we be fight foryour father 's life here she understand we both understand I will um I will try to avoiduse the word adamant all right fine all right so that be a lot of stress on a new marriage be not it yes that night you fight yes we do and you claimthat your wife go out for a driveto clear her head that be what she do and you do not worry whenshe fail to return home of course I worry and the long she wasgone the more I worry I could not raise heron the cell phone we just have an argument I mean I guess I be hope shewas cool down I guess I be hopingshe'd call I and finally just before 4 00 I call the police it be do okay good really I be not so sure Dad you know whatwould've happen if you tell themthe truth they would'vetaken chloe away to an institution or bad prison it be not likewe have a choice now you promisedmother you promise you wouldnever send chloe away I know I know I do but myra this be not the first timeshe 's hurt someone but dad you knowit be not intentional she be not capable she just getsfrustrate she do not knowher own strength I know I know that Stacey wasn'tthe good stepmother and she be not the good wife but she do not deserveto die like that nobody do for the last time mr Edgemont do you or do younot kill your wife no I do not look dad mom 's homefrom work exactly when we get home from school hi mom how be your day Mine be good we have sloppy joe for lunch I never actually hada sloppy joe before except I reallylike they this kid name bretttold I the sandwich be actually madeout of the gut of some guy name joewho 's really

justice the campaign should keep the public focusedon mr Devalos ' record Minimize anyquestion about how he achieve it you can help we do that mrs Dubois by be very clearwhen you talk to the medium when the word psychic comesup you should say that you 've never be comfortablewith that term in fact you don'tconsider yourself psychic you 've always beenhighly intuitive and you 've use that intuition to solvea number of case well the newspaperswere very definite about what it be I didfor the district attorney you really thinkwe can get away with pretendingi'm not what I be to be blunt allison I do not believe you arewhat you say you be not exactly now that be not to saythat I think you be a fraud but if I be to accept everythingi hear about you well that would make mequestion too many of my dearly heldassumption about the world and the last thing we wantto do be make people question theirassumption so we be tryingto find language that fit what you dointo the way most people think People like the word intuitive they be comfortable with it I be comfortable with it to I it describessomeone who might use unconventional technique in your case someone who mightmake leap in logic that might elude otherinvestigator occasionally one of thoseleap in logic might come to you in a dream be that a pretty fairdescription of what you do actually that'san excellent description and

stand shoulder to shoulder with garrity in frontof every reporter in phoenix can you imaginewhat would happen if garrity become a suspectin a murder investigation it would be the endof devalos 's political career well maybe but there be nothing that indicate garrity'sgoing to become a suspect what about this the night of the murder someone pick up larochefrom his hotel in a silver sedan Garrity drive a silver sedan that be not exactlya smoking gun every malein the developed world have own a silver sedanat some point in his life uh that be pretty muchwhat scanlon say to I when I call himthis afternoon all right then whydo I keep see thing that tell methat garrity be a bad guy why do he look I straightin the face and lie to I he tell I he have not beenin touch with laroche for year he send he 15 000last christma the two of they be in a paradeless than five year ago what be he try to hide rhoade have dysentery he be die he be not go tolast more than a week now we can just let it happen and who knowshow many of we be go to starve to deathbefore he die or his death can mean something it can help we live what be you talk about captain garrity if rhoade die how do that help we live be you sayingwhat I think you be say we do not have any food Rhoades be die anyway so we just help he along then we get to live man no no way I can not do that we all have to be in on this we all have to agree and we all have to eat God I be so hungry fine but which of we be goingto do it who be go to kill rhoade we will draw for it thank god two straw leave captain garrity look likeit be between I and you Let us just dothis laroche where be I be I home captain garrity not yet but you will be soon let I be sureI understand you a young man namedmichael rhoades die in a vietnameseprisoner of war camp more than 30 year ago and it be your beliefthat jed garrity murder he then eat he Garrity do not want to do it he be starve to death all the prisoner be he do it so the rest of themcould survive and you think that all of thisis somehow connect to a murder that occurredfour day ago Gordon laroche be in that campwith garrity he be in the room when garrity killedmichael rhoade his gambling debtsare out of control Senator garritywas give laroche money and lot of it what if they wereblackmail payment what if laroche say to garrity he be goingto expose their little secret if garrity do not pay he off do not you thinkit 's possible garrity kill larocheto protect himself his career no actually allison I don'T even if I be willingto concede that many year ago in some of thedir circumstance imaginable jed garrity do a terrible thingso that he could survive I refuse to believethat he have anything to do with the murderof that man scanlon find the other night this be a man that I 've knownfor more than 20 year someone who have be decoratedwith the high medal the military have to give and if you be goingto come to my house and accuse he of murder I need something more than dream abouta prisoner of war camp there be more 10 00 the night of the murder someone drive larochefrom his hotel in a silver sedan Garrity drive a silver sedan now I think I be go

that'sa good thing too even if you could provethat this guy die at the hand of hisfellow prisoner what possibly could begaine by expose it I mean imagine the horrorhis family would feel if they find outthat this kid be eat and the menwho kill he I know that they dida terrible thing but they be in akind of live hell and it do not soundlike they go on to become career criminal I know you be right of course your right this be whatI keep think if I can not tell the truthabout michael rhoade and if I can'tp the policesolve la roche 's murder then why be I seeingthese thing why do I have such horriblething stick in my head Man I do not think I can do this I be serious I can'T we 've beenover this evan none of we want to do it Gordon 's be out of controlfor a long time his debt be get big he keep come to usfor more money now he be threaten to takehis story to the network I know but you be talkingabout murder someone I have not hold a gun in my handsfor over 30 year I be a doctor now we 've all build life forourselve that be the point if la roche come outand tell the truth about what we do to rhoade that be it we be ruin I do not fly out hereto have a debate Draw sorry evan look I know we needto do this correction Youneed to do this why should I bethe only one at risk we will all do it together if everybody take part then no one can back out later no one can becomeanother laroche we can not blackmaileach other or threaten to goto the authority because we will allbe murderer each one of we will be justa guilty as everybody else it be the way we should 've donethis in the first place if we all do rhoade together then laroche would 've hadhis own skin in the game and we would not be havingthis conversation right now tomorrow night Evan you tell laroche you needto talk to he he can come to your housefor a drink Put some sleeping pillsin his whiskey we will all come over later Midnight we will kill he together and then each of we will get ridof a piece of he Evan you have to burywhat 's leave of he do you thinkyou can handle that now let I askyou something do you own a chainsaw Scanlon Evan sabow yes my name 's lee scanlon I be with the phoenixpolice department I have few questionsfor you about uh about the murderof gordon laroche you know he right of course Gordon and I go way back we be in the army together do you happen to see himthis past sunday Sunday I do not think so no you sure can you rememberwhere you be that night I be here I be home all night be you ask I to accountfor my whereabouts detective Hope you be not imply I have anything to dowith gordon 's death Nah I be just check can anybody confirm that youwere here wife kid no I be divorce I be watch televisionall night by myself I like that tattoo Gordon laroche hadone just like it yeah I know we uh we get them together a group of guy from our unitgot drunk one night when we be on leave we all have thesewhen we wake up Wish to god that we hadn'T we be justunchof stupid kid what be in the bag oh just some tool old stuffI be go to get rid of you mind openingit up for I you do not have to we could just waithere together while somebody drivesover a search warrant that be a nice look chain see you should not keep your toolsall mix up like that though they be I be go to get rid of they Hmm sniff that smell like bleach no wonder you be lookingto dump that thing it be not go to last very longif you use bleach to clean it I really do not see that that'sany of your business detective funny thing aboutchain saw though they be almost impossibleto get completely clean there be just too manynook and cranny so dr Sabow if I take a real closelook at that thing you think I will find some ofgordon laroche 's blood on it hello Evan sabow just confess to the murder of gordon laroche Lee that be great have you arrest garrityand the other no and right now it do not look like we be go to what do you mean why not Sabow confess but he'ssaye it be all he he say he kill larochewithout any help well that be not right Laroche be blackmailingall of they all four of they kill he not accord to sabow he say laroche borrow moneyfrom he the two of they have an argumentabout when laroche be go to pay he backand it turn physical he be lie he be tryingto protect the other I believe you but we search his house there be no evidence that tiesanyone else to the murder none of the neighborssaw anybody come or go from the houseon the night laroche die we will keep work it but uh it look like sabow 's take the truth to jail with he so that be it so garrity and the rest of themjust get away with it I hope not allison but at this point that be a possibility Evan sabow may bea bad murderer but uh I have to admithe be a good soldier senator garrity I would like to talk to youabout gordon laroche I be afraid I do not have timefor a conversation right now Senator you really should not be here mrs Dubois I be sure you be aware that mannyand I have a press conference start in just a few minute I would hate for any reportersto see you hang around you do not want to hearabout laroche why do not we talk aboutprivate michael rhoade would you all excuse usa moment it be be a long time since anyone mentionedthat name to I I know what happenedin that camp I know that gordon laroche wasblackmaile all of you about it and you kill he that be quite a story especiallysince evan sabow just confess to gordon 's murder from what I be tell they werehavin argument over money but we know well do not we and do not think that youand you be friend be just go to walk awayfrom this I be go to find a wayto prove that you do it that sound like a tall order the killer 's in jail he freely admit to his crime and I must say I do not understand why a woman of your obvious talentswould waste her time on a piece of businesslike this one the four of you kill someone Fair enough but let I make surei've get your story right a long time ago a soldier die so that the man he serve withcould survive my guess be they be probablyaware of the burden that the death of michaelrhoade place on they who know maybe they even madeanonymous contribution to the family ofthat poor dead soldier seem like the leastthey could do if these man have anykind of decency at all it seem to I that theywould live their life in a way that honoredthe sacrifice that make they possible do not expect I to sympathizewith you you give up your rightto understanding when you murderedgordon laroche right Gordon laroche he be the sticking point here be not he if you be right aboutany of this he be the only one who make itout of that camp who do not understand the legacythat rhoade leave behind the only one who do not holdhimself to a high standard if fact it sound like youthink laroche try to exploit that terrible timefor his personal gain and he try to drag the restof those survivor down into the mess he have madefor himself would I be sorry that someonelike that be go not at all he be not worthy of the lifeanother man give he now if you will excuse I allison I have to go help put your bossback in office a man I happen to believewill do a lot of good a man I believe will help

the face right Suzie 's Johanna Wheeler 's the kidnapper 's that make no sense Johanna Wheeler be just free obviously she be not lock up in a basement with my daughter nine year ago I think she be what be you say she be in on it she and her boyfriend he be not the man who take Suzie but I believe he and Johanna have the same arrangement what do you mean they would target a girl someone they both want and the boyfriend would kidnap she and throw she in the basement with Johanna who would pretend to be a fellow victim why would she do that because she be a sociopath because she think it be fun because it be all a big game to her she like befriend they get they to open up seduce they keep they close to she and then watch their surprise when she betray they laugh while they be suffer well I see Johanna when they bring she in she do not look like she be play a game to I she be act for you for the police for the medium she have to the last thing she imagine be that Melanie Linder would get that gun away from her boyfriend and kill he with it before they could kill she well that be a very interesting theory Allison the only problem be Melanie Linder be not the one who wrestle the gun away from the kidnapper Melanie Linder be not the one who shoot he it be Johanna Wheeler I be home you smell like beer I do not know what to tell you it be not our money to use it be the girl ' money

welcome back to Phoenix Agent Cooper I wish I could say I be glad to be back in town but unfortunately you can see that I be here on business speaking of which I can not tell you how disappointed I be to hear that you be no long consult for the District Attorney 's office I be sure you be I mean it I know how very good you be at what you do I suspect I know it well than most I do not have much time Agent Cooper so if you will forgive I I will just cut right to the chase I know what you be do here in Phoenix and I be here to tell you I be not go to let you get away with it you be not go to let I get away with catch a serial killer I be not go to let you kill he I have a dream and I see you murder a man I be not sure what you think you see but the fact of the matter be I be not like the man that I hunt I do not do what I do out of compulsion I do it out of necessity I only take action when the system fail but I assure you my intention be to bring this man to justice not deliver my own brand of it I know what I see I see you sneak into a man 's hotel room you have your gun out I see the look on his face when you be close in on he I be sorry do you just say that you see this man 's face can you describe he to I I know what you be think you do not want to give I a description of a man you think I be go to murder Prioritize Mrs Dubois help I protect the citizen of Phoenix from a serial killer then you can worry about protect the serial killer from I Agent Cooper be this woman bother you quite the contrary Mr Van Dyke Mrs Dubois and I be just work out the term of a deal I be sorry I do not understand what kind of deal I be assume that your offer to provide I with whatever resource I might need still stand of course it do good because I need she I need Allison Dubois boy have I not miss see that sort of stuff around the house sorry they be Agent Cooper 's he want I to look over everything he have make sure I be ready for tomorrow get to hand it to that guy he must be one hell of a salesman Salesman I be just say that this morning you could not live with the possibility that he might take another life and tonight he be your new partner he swear to I that he would not harm the man who kill these woman you at least get a pinky swear to that effect right 'cause without one he be really under no legal obligation to stop kill I be sorry I should not tease Frankly I be just glad that someone in this house be bring home a paycheck Honey I be sorry it do not work out with those venture capitalist I guess I could learn a thing or two about salesmanship from Agent Cooper huh oh come on you know you give a good presentation they tell you it be a good idea yeah well that and a quarter you know if you be look for investor maybe you might want to try Bridgette well she be have quite a run with the tooth fairy a dollar a tooth you know maybe if we feed she nothing but taffy that be not funny I be sorry having have some time to familiarize myself with the forensic evidence gather from the three victim as well as the manner in which they be kill I 've prepare a very preliminary psychological profile of the man we be look for his methodology indicate he have deep seat issue with woman he probably compensate for his inability to deal with the opposite sex by concentrate excessively on his own appearance he be not an attractive man but he be a vain one I would not be surprised if he adhere to a rigorous exercise regiman very impressive Agent Cooper I will give you that hair color eye color approximate age height and weight give this level of detail I take it we now have a witness to one of the murder let us just say that Mrs Dubois ' consulting service have already prove quite valuable and leave it at that you stand behind this composite then you be willing to stake your reputation on it why Mr District Attorney I think we be in this together I will make sure it be distribute then I 've ask Mrs Dubois to work from here today go through your mug book see if any face jump out at her she be welcome to any vacant desk in the bullpen that will be fine I be afraid that be not quite good enough Mrs Dubois require a certain amount of quiet to do her job a certain amount of solitude I think maybe you could put she up in one of your private office Agent Cooper Mr Van Dyke I realize that you and Mrs Dubois have a history but surely you be willing to put that aside in the interest of catch this killer after all I would hate to have the press get wind of the fact that I be get anything less than your complete cooperation I believe we have an office available on the second floor you be welcome to it that be not really necessary what be not that much as I love watch that weasel squirm I do not even have my own office when Devalos be in charge well maybe he do not value your service as much as I do well while we be on the subject of my service I have another dream about our killer last night and you should know that your profile be right on the money he be watch your press conference while he adhere to his rigorous exercise regiman do you see anything that might help we locate he no but he do not look too happy about have the darkest corner of his psyche air on television Unhappy be good Mrs Dubois if he be unhappy he be that much close to make a mistake Mr Dubois hello I be glad you find I my assistant 's not always the good when it come to direction please well I be due back at the office so I be go to get right to the point I be here because I want to help you develop your solar cell amplification system and I believe I have the funding to do it Ms Doyle Meghan I do not know what to say I do not know how to thank you I do not know what you say to your colleague to bring they around but actually I do not say anything I be sure they be just as dead set against go into business with you today as they be yesterday then I be afraid I be a little confused you just say that you have the funding if the money be not come from Buchanon Lockhart then where I Mr Dubois the money would be come from I like I tell you yesterday I believe in your idea I think it be a money maker and the truth be I 've be look for an opportunity like this for a long time I be tired of make money for Buchanon Lockhart I want to go into business for myself I want to get my hand dirty I 've save about 300 000 just wait to hear the right idea and I think I 've hear it Agent Cooper Agent Cooper it be late I be go to head home Agent Cooper I see you 've find my high tech security system I do it everywhere I go it be just something I use to make sure that nobody be be in my office while I be go it be a bit paranoid I know but I be afraid I just can not help myself well I go through these file twice sir our killer be not in here I be sorry oh no need for apology well I just wish we be far along far along Mrs Dubois because of you I have what could very well turn out to be a physical description of the killer you 've also give I reason to believe that my profile of the man be accurate I think it be fair to say that because of your involvement in this case I be potentially week ahead of where I would normally be well thank you sir I have to say it be be a long time since anyone be take my dream so seriously especially here in the District Attorney 's office well shame on they for ignore your talent I would never be so obtuse I know what I have in you good night sir good night Housekeeping do you want turndown service hello Allison it be Lee Scanlon I be sorry to wake you but I know you would want to hear this right away it

weapon 's missing too we think the killer might have take it with he as a trophy I have it all wrong I think I see Cooper hunt the killer the killer be really hunt he I hate to be the bearer of even more bad news but uh Van Dyke want to see you in his office ask if you would come there as soon as you can I be so sorry what do I tell you about apology they be not necessary I wish I would do more for you Mrs Dubois I only have so many pep talk in I I 've tell you I be happy with your work now if it be all right with you I would like to get down to business I be go to be interview the acquaintance of the most recent victim today and I would like you to come with I oh sir I be not sure you understand what happen to you last night well actually last night be a bit fuzzy do you

upside would be in three year and five year and I just can not explain it I just start to get a really good feeling about she I guess you would call it an intuition I mean if anybody can understand go with their intuition it be you right so what happen to let us be patient what happen to be your own boss I do not know maybe I be be a little naive about that accord to she there be no way that I have the leverage to get a majority share no matter who I sign with probably would not even get close to 49 either now look Al I know this be out of the blue but tell I you be happy this be go to be so much well if you be happy with it I be happy as long as you be I be well then that be that we be officially happy Julia Julia Baby you okay what just happen we be in a crash somebody just hit we stay here okay I be go to go check on the other driver hey buddy you okay Mrs Dubois I find he Mrs Dubois I know where he be where who be Donald Kessler the man who murder I he be at a bar downtown the Old Stone Jug 1818 Hamilton Street if you and Detective Scanlon go down there right now you will find he you will find evidence on he that prove he murder those woman move Mrs Dubois we have not a moment to spare wait a second he say it be the Old Stone Jug you sure it be this Old Stone Jug well 1818 Hamilton Street this be absolutely the place well I do not know what to tell you Allison accord to this the place got condemn back in ' 05 no one 's have a drink here in a good long time well he could not have be clear he say Donald Kessler be here right now honestly I be a little confused myself I know I never understand exactly how your thing work but you always make it sound like after you die you pretty much know everything there be be or ever will be so tell I how do a dead guy especially one as smart as Edward Cooper make a mistake like this oh boy this do not look good wait pull over it be be handle I dream about this please pull over you wait here I will go get the scoop look a lot like the guy in your sketch do not he this be he this be the man I see kill Cooper as much as I hate to disagree with the ghost of a famous profiler that be the man who kill Edward Cooper the name be Julian Pierce first cop on the scene find a duffel bag on the seat of his car that have a gun inside they run the serial number turn out it be a government issue firearm Edward Cooper 's government issue firearm what about Donald Kessler Donald Kessler do not kill Cooper he do not kill those three prostitute either Julian Pierce do in addition to Cooper 's gun they find a stash of photo polaroid of the dead woman even a few close up of the wedding band he put on their finger I do not know why Cooper claim that Donald Kessler kill they but he be wrong oh no no he be not wrong he be lie to we he know this be go to happen that be why he try to throw we off of Julian Pierce 's scent he know if we arrest Pierce before tonight he would not have be in this car he would not have die in this accident so you be say this be a setup that Cooper send you on a wild goose chase to guarantee that this guy die tonight 'cause I have to tell you Allison that sound a lot like murder not to Cooper to Edward Cooper this be justice you should know Mrs Dubois the one thing I regret in all this be lie to you well I can see that look you be all tear up inside I never intend for you to come across that accident site and I certainly do not want the death of Julian Pierce weigh on your conscience I know how strongly you prefer work within the confine of the justice system for what it be worth I be not lie when you first come to I at the cemetery I have absolutely no intention of take Julian Pierce 's life but as you well know circumstance change my death give I a whole new perspective on the man and his action New perspective I think you be underestimate how well I know you Agent Cooper this be revenge pure and simple I will not deny I take a certain amount of pleasure in Mr Pierce 's death but I assure you what I do tonight I do for the great good tell yourself whatever you want I be go to bed Ellen Hartley I beg your pardon Ellen Hartley she be a nurse at McCarren State Penitentiary it be where Mr Pierce would have end up have you and Detective Scanlon arrest he you would like her Mrs Dubois she be a mother of three just like you in four year ' time Julian Pierce be go to fake an illness so he could spend the night in the prison infirmary he be go to strangle Ellen Hartley I suppose he want just one more notch on his belt before they execute he I do not believe you you be lie to I again it be all you 've ever do if there be some way I could prove it to you I would but the fact of the matter be you will never know you will never be certain I do the right thing by facilitate the death of Julian Pierce but I be I be absolutely positive the world be a much well place without he in it why do not you just go away I be not ready to move on just yet it occur to I Mrs Dubois that you and I have a very unique opportunity this do not have to be our last collaboration what be you talk about I can see a lot of thing from this side thing I can not share with anyone but you if I be to catch on to another Julian Pierce you would be in a unique position to help I take care of it you want I to help you end more life I want you to help I save life potential victim good people who do not deserve to die it be so sad I be sure at some point you be a good man I do not know where you lose your way but in the end you be no well than Julian Pierce you be a killer and before long

I see he in the mug book you give I he look exactly like the man I keep see in my head well he be in the mug book because uh apparently he feel the need to augment his modeling income with the

it be over for all of we not now go away Daddy Daddy help I please Daddy Kelly come back here Kelly okay so what you be tell I be a little girl who live in the Winters ' house 20 year ago Kelly McKenzie Kelly McKenzie have the same first name as Charles Winters ' late wife sorry what do that prove it do not prove anything but it be a fact now what if they be the same person it should be easy enough to check if Charles 's late wife 's maiden be McKenzie but it be not I mean at least not accord to the death certificate but maybe she change it okay I will play let us pretend she change it I still do not see where we be go well I be not 100 sure on this either but I keep dream about the death of this little McKenzie boy and the version that I see his death be no accident his mother drown he on purpose and there be a little girl there a little girl name Kelly and she see it all well I must be dream this for a reason hello this be Joe Dubois Terry Cavanaugh it be you they say it be go to be someone from the district attorney 's office as of today I be with the district attorney 's office you got to laugh I hire you to help calm my wife down and now the city 's hire you to help put I away I be not an attorney Charles the city 's hire I to help they figure out what really happen which be why I want to talk to you I have some some hunch some idea but without know more about Kelly they really do not make a lot of sense well you well not ask I because uh when it come to Kelly I do not think that I be really the expert I think I be you know I love she more than anyone or anything I have ever love that that that letter it make no sense to I accord to Kelly 's death certificate it say that her maiden name be Anderson that she be bear in California do you have any reason to suspect otherwise what be you talk about I do not know do you know of any brother or sister have you ever meet anyone from her family her father her mother no no there be no one else to meet grow up she say it be just she and her crazy mother her mother 's dead before I come along and she refer to she as crazy yeah we have bad parenting in common two crazy mother two crappy father her dad be never around my dad be practically a lap dog because my mother have all the money I guess you could say that we bond over that and the two of you meet how uh she choose I it be uh like a movie the pretty girl in the bar just walk up and start talk to I I oh sorry to interrupt Miss but I would ask you not to continue question my son until he have a chance to confer with his attorney here Mr Beverly Mr Beverly my son Charles Charles have you out of here before you know it I see Mom finally come through huh this be Allison Dubois she be with the district attorney 's office Allison my dad and apparently my new attorney Nice to meet you Mr Winters Ms Dubois we be actually finish here if you gentleman would like to use this room to chat Great thank you she be an odd girl you know I would not put it past her take her own life leave a note like that Dad I be just say you ever meet her yes Briefly well then you know she be an odd girl what be the motive you know they do not own much of anything other than the enormous debt on that house they do not have much life insurance uh maybe uh he hate she no I do not get that I I never get that from he I think he honestly love she and besides you have to hate somebody a lot to risk life in prison all right you win he love she what be your theory I do not have a theory she simply commit suicide she take a bunch of sleep pill and let herself to drown to death in the bathtub and then write a letter implicate her husband why do she hate he no I do not get that either none of it make any sense least of all the dream that I keep have hey you know what you need to do you need to put it out of your mind and you need to come help I pack all right well you meet this Terry Cavanaugh right be he a suit guy yeah he seem like a suit guy and you do not know what this meeting be about I do not know they just call they say Terry Cavanaugh want to meet with I tomorrow and be I available um they say there be go to be a first class ticket wait for I at the airport and a car to pick I up on the other end you think it have something to do with Meghan I mean be not he the guy that she say be go to invest all that money in your idea yeah he certainly be I do not know maybe he need a good engineer and hear from Meghan I be out of work not now go away Daddy Daddy help I please Daddy Kelly here Kelly Madeleine what the hell be go on here Mr Winters I be District Attorney Devalos you 've already meet Detective Scanlon Mrs Dubois appreciate you rush down here please have a seat not at all I be glad I could do it when you say that there might be some kind of a deal you could offer my son Charles the important thing be we be start to buy into your theory Mr Winters that she do it to herself that she leave that letter to implicate Charles like I say she be an odd girl the key thing be some new fact have come to light that from our standpoint change everything terrific what have you find out SCANLON First and foremost your daughter 's maiden name it be actually McKenzie before she change it or how about the fact that you be list as the father on her birth certificate Mr Winters your son 's wife be your daughter be not she ever since Kelly 's death we 've be struggle to find enough physical evidence to implicate your son or find a reason why his wife would hate he enough to leave that letter and frankly we have not come up with either and now I know why she do not really hate he of course she do not really love he either she just know who he be your son a means to an end and that end be you you have to understand when he first bring her home I do not recognize she I have not see Kelly my Kelly in 20 year but then when they buy the house on Fremont and Charles tell I that she be hear a baby cry at night I I know it must be her she really be her mother 's daughter and you think that be why Madeleine drown your son to punish you Yep Madeleine be my mistress I be already marry to Charles ' mother when I meet she I tell she right up front that I would never leave my family I love my wife and when she begin to suspect I be be unfaithful she give I an ultimatum so I give one to Madeleine and I tell she it be over that night I go to the house I go there to say good bye to the child and to give Madeleine some money to start over but when I get there she have already drown Johnny try to kill Kelly so I tell Madeleine to call the police and tell they there have be an accident by that time whatever fever have possess she be go she do not want to go to prison she do not want to hurt Kelly and she do not want anyone to know what she have do for once we both want the same thing I know I should have take Kelly with I that night I know that but that would have be the end of my life with Charles ' mother the end of everything Mr Winters I be go to see to it that Charles be release I be not certain that I can actually charge you with a crime at this point but you can be damn sure I be go to try in the meantime you be go to need to tell your wife and your son the whole truth and I suspect that be as fitting a way as any for your punishment to begin thank you thank you for come Mr Dubois very anxious to meet you again very anxious to look you in the eye sit down you know I buy your company buy your invention I suspect you might have I want to buy it the day I meet you in Phoenix she want four million I pay she two how much do you end up with a lot less than that you hate she I be not invite she over for Thanksgiving she be a bottom feeder a matchmaker an agent a

a rock solid alibi for the two hour period when Isabel go for her run how rock solid he be teach Bible class which mean there be at least 15 people that can swear to his whereabouts and he be a catholic priest I be sorry but that still mean something to I well I do not mean to offend you and we happen to live in a city where it still mean something to a fairly considerable proportion of the population and lest you forget I be an elect official so unless and until you have something that trump the fact that he can prove he be not anywhere near where you find that iPod I be go to let the good father continue on his way I be sure he be not actually angry at you I do not know he seem pretty upset well come on it be a fairly outrageous assertion why he be just a man he be a priest Allison he be a catholic priest and if he be serious about his faith he be make some fairly extraordinary sacrifice to serve his fellow man well I be sorry I do not know what to tell you there be nothing vague about the sensation I experience when I shake his hand I be sure but do that mean that he be the one who take she could not there be some other explanation for that like what I do not know maybe he know something maybe maybe she be not the girl that we think she be maybe she say something to he maybe she tell he she be go to run away she hate school she hate try to please her father come on if she run away he would tell her dad he would let somebody know he would have to talk to the police he would have to I do not know Al People tell priest lot of thing they get to keep a lot of secret I do not know well maybe somebody else tell he something I mean come on here be a guy who every day hear people pour out their bad behavior in the hope of be cleanse that be what

picture I think maybe you escape from one of the ward Afraid not Roger I be Allison I work with the District Attorney 's office and his name be Dr Elliot Peterson very highly regard in his day of course a lot of what he do a lot of what he advocate we consider barbaric now but at the time that be strange this corridor look brand new that be because it be you be stand in the new wing the old wing 's in the rear that be where Peterson use to play with the cut edge therapy of the 1950s Electroshock insulin shock ice bath yes it be a great time to be young free and mentally ill they be go to tear all this down back when they build the new wing back in 1997 but they run out of funding Lucky for I it be a treasure trove of information for my thesis well this be it 497 patient history detail 28 year worth of unintentional psychiatric cruelty pretty impressive huh sure be you ever run across a file on a patient name Beverly do this Beverly have a last name never mind she would have be a patient of Dr Peterson 's around July 1959 we have a Beverly Waller admit November 3 1958 I think we have some film on she if you be interested Beverly Waller suffer a nervous collapse in the fall of 1958 separate from her husband shortly thereafter but he sue for custody of their eight month old daughter and win almost unheard of back then Patient fall into a deep and unrecoverable depressive state kidnap her child and apparently throw herself and her infant daughter off the Mayawoch Bridge Mom be rescue Child apparently drown Beverly be commit here shortly thereafter thank you all right you got to say roll them roll them please you have to let I out of here I have to pick up my child you know you do not have any child Beverly not anymore you be wrong I have three of they they be probably wonder where I be what year be it why do you keep ask I that Beverly come on just tell I the year please it be the year 2005 and you know damn well my name be not Beverly it be Allison Allison Dubois she think she be you not Joan of Arc not the Virgin Mary not Madam Curie but Allison Dubois live in the year 2005 she know your name she know all the girl ' name she know everyone 's birthday she name the street we live on everything do that make I a bigamist there be get to be some sort of a logical explanation I know I mean I keep go over it in my head I mean I know it make no sense but I can not help wonder if maybe I have something to do with this Allison this woman live half a century ago how can you possibly have anything to do with it I do not know maybe when I be dream about she I get into her head I project thought from the present without realize it wait a second now you be beam your brain wave back in time come on I mean I do not think so oh forget it you know what I be just try to make sense out of it I can not tell you how eerie it be to sit in a room and watch someone from before you be bear recite all the pertinent fact of your life speak of which be my first wife still alive she die of amyloidosis in 1962 sound grisly what be that a brain thing it be a liver thing uh huh genetic disorder hey hey hey be that it be not you go to help I figure out what to do what do you mean what be there to do I mean a woman 's dead there be no bring she back you be good but you be not that good now let your husband get some sleep the first Allison always do Beverly I need you to listen to I I need you to try to understand this be never about I try to take Anna from you I would never keep you from our child I know how much you love she and I know that you would never try to hurt she so please just give she to I no okay okay just just if you do not trust I then give she to your sister please Bev it be cold out here let us just go back to the house talk this thing through someday you will understand all this Carol I promise and someday it will all be clear no Allison I do not expect to see you here today I just stop by to do a little research any new progress on the Kercher case we still have not be able to identify that string of number you see good guess be that it be a bank account number although it do not seem to match up with any of the account in Kercher 's name you go to be around for a while I be just go to do this one thing and go not a problem if something change I will give you a call hello Carol Waller Smith Carol Waller be you the sister of Beverly Waller can I help you well I hope so I work for the District Attorney 's office in Phoenix my name be Allison Dubois so you want I to try and make sense of something that make no sense Mrs Dubois if that really be your name that really be my name a mother be not suppose to want to kill herself let alone her own child and I love my sister do love my sister so ask I whatever you want tell I about her breakdown tell I about what happen well it be right after the birth of her only child Anna she start have nightmare terrible dream about her husband Walter in they he be do thing terrible thing to Anna what happen I tell she to see a doctor she see two or three doctor and they all give she something to help she sleep and the more she sleep the more she have the nightmare and she become convinced that she have to get Anna away from Walter and that be when she leave he she and Anna move in with my husband and I do she ever tell anyone else about her dream oh a lot of people it do not help at all Walter be so well like in our town he be a war veteran he be principal of the junior high school he be a man people look up to so when the custody battle start it all go Walter 's way you know in retrospect I think people wish they would take my sister a little more seriously she may have be crazy but she obviously know there be something really wrong with Walter what do you mean I would have think you have know several year after Beverly 's pass a parent at Walter 's school march into his office and shoot he to death Walter have be molest his little girl since the sixth grade she be psychic Joe just like I that be the answer whoa whoa slow down who be psychic Beverly Waller she have a dream a vision that her husband be go to hurt their daughter that be why she try to get she away from he okay and that be how she know so much about I about my life because she see it in her mind in her vision but Al she do not just see you she say that she be you exactly I do not think she understand what she truly be all these terrible image keep pop into her head and she do not understand why when she try to turn to other for help try to tell they what she be see they tell she she be crazy and I guess after a while she believe they Al we be talk about a murderer here somebody who take the life of her own child I know I think I guess that she become convinced that kill Anna be preferable to whatever torture she see her husband inflict every night in her dream I still do not get it do not get what all right I understand now how Beverly Waller know all about our life back in 1959 can you please tell I why she be dream about you in the first place or for that matter why you be dream about she now Allison I have no idea today be July 17 1959 do I miss the preview I do not think we be get any reception in here I be worried if the girl wake up they be not go to know where we be one can only hope I be kid I tell they where we be they be all out of popcorn morning be the hard that be when I miss they the most who that be what she look like Excellent Shh Joe the girl the mad dash to get everyone out of the house to work to school you would think it would become routine but it never do it be always chaos and it be always wonderful so you be a woman from the future trap in the year 1959 be that honestly what you expect I to believe Frankly Doctor it do not matter what you believe it only matter what she believe she be the only one that matter what the hell do that mean hello Allison I hope I be not call too late but I have news News we like news that series of number that you see when you be speak with Timothy Kercher turn out it be a bank account belong to a Dr Elaine Doyle Doyle Doyle Doyle why do I recognize that name probably because you read the same psych evaluation that I do the psychiatrist who diagnose Kercher with dissociative identity disorder and would you care to guess who transfer a quarter of a million dollar into her bank account less than 24 hour after she make that diagnosis let I guess do not tell I I see the initial t and K the good doctor be arrest a few hour ago and admit to everything it turn out that Kercher do not just pay she for the evaluation he pay she to coach he to teach he how to mimic the behavior of a person with dissociative identity disorder do Maggie know yet yeah I just tell she she be furious she be on the phone with her client right now insist he enter a guilty plea hopefully we will be able to hammer out a deal in the morning and she will be able to turn her attention to take care of herself she uh just get off the phone I I guess I will see you in the morning okay someday you will understand all this Carol I promise someday it will all be clear no Beverly Allison well that be 29 99 well spend she do not kill her baby Joe this thing run on two D battery honey she absolutely kill it not Bridgette Beverly she be hold a doll the night she throw herself off the bridge I be sorry what she need everybody to believe that Anna be dead so that nobody would ever go look for her so that her father could never get his hand on her she be crazy all right she be crazy like a fox she know exactly what she be do right down to be sure that she have witness for the big jump the only thing I do not think she count on be survive it but once she do she have to stick to her story she have to let the rest of the world think she would kill her own kid so that no one would try and find she so she spend the rest of her life in an institution even though she be not the least bit insane so maybe the reason you 've be dream about her the reason that she claim to be you when she be in that hospital maybe you be suppose to to help clear her name tell the world that she be not a killer no no no all Beverly ever care about be her baby all she ever want to do be to protect her she would only be reach out to I if if her daughter need help the daughter she stash away so well that no one even know she exist for 46 year a woman who could be anywhere in the world right now Great well track she down should take only what another 46 year give or take Mrs Dubois Mrs Dubois over here Mrs Fulsom be you okay yeah more or less I just start feel nauseous all of a sudden can you move probably not without throw up okay uh wait here I will go get some help no no no no no actually I would rather you do not do that the last thing I want be some big scene in the garage of the District Attorney 's office be you sure okay I will make a deal with you if it do not pass then you can go get somebody but for now I would just like you to sit with I okay no no no no here let I get that here it be okay what I have be not catch if you be wonder no no I be not wonder it be hereditary I wish somebody have tell I about that when I be young I would not have waste so much energy be a control freak I be sorry you know what the bad part of it be I still can not spell the stupid thing no I be serious if you be go to drop dead of something you should at least be able to spell it right I would think so I feel always compel to add the extra L Amyloidosis A m y l o I d o s I s it be a liver condition right you 've hear of it I think that be treatable nowadays nowadays I just mean in the past there be not much a person could do but today I think you could address it with a transplant it could in theory but uh apparently I be a tough tissue match well what about your family a live donor could give you a partial transplant I be adopt Maggie what year be you bear I know it be a strange question but I think it might be important 1959 all right repeat after I Bridge no bath no bath no haircut no haircut no makeup no makeup okay you may now open your doll let us go shop you know dear if you just buy they new one they do not learn anything I know but if she have not leave the old one in the tub I figure I owe her one so how do that Maggie person take it when you tell she that she be really Anna Waller well she do not believe I at first till I bring she to meet Carol Waller and her family and now the waller have meet their long lost kin I be sure they be just line up to give this perfect stranger a piece of their liver well actually three of they offer to get test to see if they be a match yeah but what be the chance of bird singe in the sycamore tree they be all go to match be not they Dream a little dream of I say nighty night and kiss I just hold I tight and tell I you will miss I while I be alone and blue as can be Dream a little

client back to his apartment unfortunately that have now turn into a tragedy for both of they and while it may titillate some people to think that something sinister happen that night the sad truth be that my client be fast asleep when Ms Bannister apparently enter the bathroom slip crack her head open on the shower door and summarily bleed to death Mr Watt Mr Watt Mr Watt you say in your opening statement yesterday that you be confident the jury will believe your client 's version of the event and not the District Attorney 's how can you be certain of that well my client 's tell the truth look Damon Hodges be a throwback to a time when the phrase student athlete actually mean something last year he lead his team into the Elite Eight of the NCAA Tournament and make the Dean 's list both semester now the District Attorney 's decision to charge he use a case that rely solely on flimsy circumstantial evidence and hearsay smack of election year desperation I mean there be get to be a well way to boost one 's name recognition than falsely accuse our bright and our good do not you think Mr Watt Mr Watt just a hunch but I sense that man do not like you unfortunately with this particular client he have no choice why do not you folk go ahead in I will join you in a minute just between we I have a witness who be about to testify under oath that Amy Bannister never touch a drop of alcohol in her life I think it will be quite clear by the time I be through that Mr Wonderful drug Ms Bannister he rape she accidentally kill she and then force feed her alcohol to cover his track and you can prove that with my crack team of young turk why the Mayor nervous well Attorney Watt be right about it be an election year and people do prefer be associate with winner let us chat

head open and then bleed to death what be your reaction well I know that it be a lie I know that it could not have happen that way objection your Honor the witness know no such thing duly note Counselor the jury will disregard the witness 's claim oftain so what be it about that scenario that give you pause Amy do not drink not at all not ever really you be certain of that yeah she hate drink she hate drug she would go to club because that be what college kid do but she would only drink soda water if they find drug and alcohol in her system she do not put they there no further question at this time your Honor Defense counsel your witness so it be your testimony Ms Staley that to the good of your knowledge Ms Bannister do not drink no it be my testimony that Ms Bannister do not drink period look I applaud your loyalty to your friend but the truth be you do not know that I certainly do I beg to differ just because Ms Bannister may have tell you she do not drink do not guarantee that on occasion she may Objection sustain this court and the jury recognize that Ms Staley can not absolutely warrant that Ms Bannister have never take a drink Counselor any

simple yes or no will suffice uh oh my God let the record show that Ms Staley refuse to answer no further question do not look so shocked you of all people should have see that come who depose that

piece seem to come together I be so certain okay fine well I will just add it to the list of all the other bill we can not figure out how to pay I be sorry who be it it be I hey it be my work buddy what you get there Pumpkin it be a picture a picture of what Daddy 's work Daddy 's what his bomb he and his friend be make it at work Bridge I tell you daddy be not make a bomb Daddy be make an algorithmic microprocessor component remember whatever you say who be go to tuck I in could we not I promise she I would put it up so where do you think she come up with something like this she be a kid who know so this component you be work on what exactly be it a component of I have no idea it could be the component of a lot of thing but one thing I be reasonably certain of it be not a component of a bomb and how be you so sure because my dear my company do not make bomb we be an aeronautical firm remember as in airplane and glider and spaceship not thing that go boom what nothing it be just I be not the only person who get feeling in this house you know if you do not know what it be you be build you might think about ask somebody that be all okay I will add that to my to do list since I have to be up in six hour you will understand if it do not go right to the top you okay fine it be just this stupid dream ah so that be who you be you be kid I Watt hire a psychic of his

even the FBI call she for a consult every once in a while although they too will not corroborate she be work missing person kidnapping case serial killer you name it she be even write a book accord to her web site accord to her web site duel psychic this just might be a first for the american justice system I do not get it you be not concern do not take this the wrong way but for the most part recent false alarm notwithstanding I believe in you I believe you believe everything you tell I and I be astonish at how often you be right but I also believe that people like you be extraordinarily rare so be I worried about some woman who advertise in the newspaper I believe in the justice system I believe in the power of truth and I believe in the wisdom and the fairness of jury Randy Pilgrim have be a teammate of Damon Hodges for the last two year in about 20 minute he be go to testify that Hodges have a habit of put GHB into woman 's drink apparently he be even boast about it in the locker room if my belief system hold water then Mr Pilgrim 's go to help I establish a pattern of behavior with this jury that be go to put Damon Hodges behind bar Care to predict how it be go to go one last question Mr Pilgrim how do your teammate feel about you testify today some of they be not very happy but I do not understand if Damon Hodges be truly guilty of what be be allege here today would not they want to see he punish would not they want he put away where he could pose no harm to their wife their sister their girlfriend yeah but he help we win game no more question your Honor so if I understand your testimony accurately my client Mr Hodges have be boast of drug and take advantage of woman for month yes sir that be what I say sir how many month exactly excuse I what I be ask you be how many month have you allegedly know that my client drug woman for the purpose of have sex with they how many month be it that neither you nor anyone else on your team for that matter feel it necessary to call the authority or tell a coach or tell anyone not until now objection we 've already establish that Mr Pilgrim do not come forward immediately that there be enormous peer pressure to remain silent sustained Move along Mr Watt you know my client pretty well do not you you play ball on the same team for a couple of season would you describe he as a handsome man I do not know I guess do he strike you as the type of man who would have to drug woman to have sex with they Objection Council be call for an opinion from the witness that be completely irrelevant and immaterial and inappropriate and for which the witness have no expertise Mr Watt if you do not have any substantive questionsfor this witness I be go to ask he to sit down so what will it be Mr Watt because right now you be try this court 's patience have you any more substantive question for this witness beg the court 's indulgence I would like a minute to confer with my colleague if it please the court the defense would like to present a few more question to Mr Pilgrim all right Mr Watt but mind your manner absolutely your Honor Mr Pilgrim do you hate my client God no come on maybe just just a little bit objection lead the witness Mr Watt I will hurry it along your Honor ever be to a Klan meeting Mr Pilgrim I be sorry be that a yes or a no you can not use that against I be not it true that your Uncle Marshall your father 's brother sit on the council Objection of what relevance be the association of the witness 's uncle overrule the witness will answer the question which one have you ever be to a Klan meeting Mr Pilgrim not because I want to go no be that a yes or a no I 've be to a Klan meeting yes my my uncle take I I be a kid I be like six it be some kind of picnic or something but it be not like something I want to do let the record show that the witness answer in the affirmative this witness be excuse I do not know what to tell you boss we be give it our good shot tomorrow at

engineer I 've ever meet we just we want to we want to get this for you we want to uh well we do not want to let you down I appreciate all the hard work yeah I appreciate the job oh hey you know what I 've be mean to ask you um this algorithmic microprocessor what exactly be it be integrate into I mean I understand it be a small part of a large project but what exactly be the initial application it be a government project Joe no I know I hear you say that yesterday but I mean specifically specifically specifically for the first 18 month of its life my guess be that it will live on the nose of a missile for our own use or for sale to our ally and help guide it to its target so that innocent people will not get hurt shortly thereafter it will probably appear on home computer to facilitate personal video conference a few year after that my hunch be some clever fellow will use the technology in a child 's game of some kind hopefully it will be a big hit at Christmas pay we a lot of royalty that would be my hunch Night Joe and then Mr Newberry tell Hannah that she should spend less time download music and more time study Mom I be still eat that oh I be sorry be you even listen to

be truly a gift hey where be you go with that that be my work this be not your work you 've never spend one single moment of your life contemplate how to hurt someone else you know the whole time do

I can not pay already I can not quit maybe your company will not get the contract maybe it will all be moot no we be go to get it I can feel it in my bone we be go to get it how be the lecture she be okay very interesting crowd excuse I can I help you what be you up to what be you do you be kill everyone here you know that why would you do that do it matter at all that the young man 's guilty that he kill this girl it matter but it be not the subject of this particular conversation look I get in your face a lot and so do the Mayor but we both like you and we both want you to stick around he want you on the ticket but you can not be there if this guy be go to make an ass out of you in that courtroom every day I know same blouse do not get homelast night campaign season can I talk to you for a minute ten after 1 00 you might have to walk with I I spend some time last night with Olga Z Watts ' psychic the woman be a fraud I do not know Allison two day ago I might have agree with you but she be kick the stuffing out of I in that court no I do not think so not her Someone 's give Watt information we do not have but I do not think it be her well then who I 've be have this nutty dream lately which be the reason I pull the fire alarm the other day it be a massacre here in the office this shooter come in wipe everybody out I be certain it be go to happen for real but last night I realize it be a metaphor I be sorry I be not follow any of this this new assistant district attorney Elliot he be hold the gun be you say he be the one that be feed Watt information but he be only privy to what we be privy to the information in the deposition in fact he do not even depose some of these witness I can not explain it yet I do not know how it work but okay here be the walk with I part Allison I have to be honest with you what you be say do not make a whole lot of sense and unless you can fill in the blank and do it quickly I have no choice but to head over to Watt 's office and try to cut a deal what I be on my way there now I be box in unless I can assure the Mayor that Larry Watt 's not go to catch I with my pant down again in court I really have no option you all right what be you stare at Allison my metaphor I hope Larry Watt 's wait for I no do not go yet I have to go this woman matter this woman be important we have to go speak with her Come in Elliot Mr District Attorney I 've ask you to come in Elliot because even though you 've work here only a short time I 've come to feel a certain connection with you and I want to share something something that very few people other than Mrs Dubois here know about I well thank you uh I guess I be a psychic Elliot excuse I I be a psychic I can pluck thing from people 's mind for instance even though you 've never introduce we I know that your fiancee work in Student Services over at Mesa University as a psychiatrist I believe how be I do may I sit down no and I bet if I subpoena her record I would find that she meet with young Amanda Staley help she cope with her heartache after she realize that she fall in love with her roommate if could just sit I need you to stay right where you be I be also sense that she meet with Randy Pilgrim help he deal with the guilt of grow up in a family fill with racist and bad be I warm I be feel a little faint actually stay where you be so Attorney Watt would come into the courtroom arm with all this information ahead of time he would put on a little act pretend that the District Attorney be beat the pant off he and then just in the nick of time he would get some new and explosive information from his psychic all to convince we that he be unbeatable all to convince we that we would well make a deal how much you make a year work for the city Elliot and what be Watt promise about three time that there be two option here Elliot and I want you to pick one I fire you right here and now report you to the Arizona Bar they strip you of your license and you never work as a lawyer again ever anywhere or option two you help I even the score a bit I still fire you write a horrible letter of recommendation for your file but with hard work in four or five year you might get with a decent firm and be able to actually earn a living do not tell I do not tell I 'cause I be guess that you pick option number two Mr James in your deposition you describe yourself as the team manager and be not it true that part of your responsibility be to pick up Damon Hodges at 6 30 every morning make sure he be there for practice yes sir and be not it fair to say that you enjoy that part of your job that you admire Mr hodge find he glamorous enjoy be in his company yes sir I do now in your deposition you state that you pick up Damon Hodges for practice on the morning in question at 6 30 and he confess that he have a young woman over the night before who apparently have leave in the middle of the night you then go on to describe how Damon say he just need to brush his tooth and head into the bathroom that you then hear Damon holler scream for you to call 911 be not it true that when you be depose by my office we show you these phone record indicate you receive a phone call at 4 30 in the morning a phone call that be make from a pay phone not three block from Damon Hodges ' townhouse a phone call that you repeatedly insist be simply a wrong number and that wake you from a sound sleep that be what I say be that the truth no it be not Objection Overruled you will have your opportunity to cross proceed the truth be it be Damon Hodges who call you at 4 30 that morning be not it yes sir and you go to his apartment at 4 45 not at 6 30 yes objection your Honor Counsel 's lead the witness overrule Mr Watt now what really happen when you arrive there I see Amy Bannister Damon tell I that he bring her home to party but she be not into it she want to leave they have a fight and he push she down she hit her head on the shower door he say it happen really fast he be scared and he want I to help he cover it up we pour vodka down her throat and then wait until 6 30 to call 911 and what do you do until 6 30 we play card Damon want to play card no further question Mr Watt your witness it be pretty interesting Mr James you tell one story for month and month you tell it to the police you tell it in deposition and then you get here in court and you change it why would you do a thing like that I feel bad I could not sleep you could not sleep because you feel badly about lie before or you could not sleep because you feel badly about have to lie today objection your Honor sustain Mr Watt if you be go to attack this witness 's testimony I need you to do it base on matter of record not by restate the obvious I apologize your Honor Mr Watt be you go to proceed or shall we dismiss the witness Mr Watt I need to know if you 've conclude your cross Mr Watt your Honor actually I have several more question for this witness we be all ear Mr Watt thank you your Honor so you could not sleep and that be why you change your story today yes sir I could not sleep I could not study I could not do much of anything and you be sure this do not have anything to do with you father Mr James how do you mean well be not it true that your father be stare at multiple felony charge file by this district attorney Objection irrelevant whoever this young man 's father be overrule for theft for forgery for credit card fraud for the sale of narcotic to a minor Objection Overruled Counsel get to the question Counsel and be not it true that the sudden change in your story today have more to do with the District Attorney promise to go easy on good old dad I must object overrule remember Mr James you be under oath you be in a court of law and I be ask you a direct question be not it true that the reason for change your story today have nothing to do with my client nothing to do with the truth nothing to do with justice but have everything to do with your degenerate father and some understanding between you and the District Attorney here that be not true sir oh really be you deny that as we speak your father sit in a cell in Prescott await extradition to Phoenix Sir my father 's an appellate court judge in the Sixth District of the state of Missouri although currently he be on temporary leave to work on a U N commission investigate aid to Africa in fact the two of you go to the same law school he be a year behind you Bennett James he say to say hello oh Mr Watt be there any follow up be there any basis to this line of question you just attack this witness ruthlessly and I and I be sure I be speakingfor these 12 juror as well would like to know why beg your your Honor 's pardon before proceed defense would like

Stephen Garner or any of the other witness no your Honor she have not all right Mr Devalos you may begin we have no question for Mr Dubois thank you Ms Romney I be certain you do have some question for Mr Dubois thank you your Honor just a few Mr Dubois you say in your questionnaire that you work in the aerospace industry what do you do exactly I be a system design mathematician and do you make a good living do that I do all right do you work with people who do much well than you do sure a lot of our supplier be start up so if you patent the right concept you can start your own company there be a lot of money in aerospace interesting and how do you feel about those people the one who manage to strike it rich in your field I guess I hope to be one someday here be hope do you drink Mr Dubois Mm sometimes in moderation do you ever drink a little too much sure well not for awhile when I be young in college and during one of those time when you be under the influence of alcohol do you ever make a decision you regret or do something or say something that be I do not know ill advise sure absolutely I mean be not that what college be for thank you Mr Dubois okay you be welcome no more question all right approach Mr Dubois be certainly an acceptable juror to the prosecution what a surprise Ms Romney Mr Dubois be equally acceptable to the defense Terrific your Honor I be concerned that either defense be set up ground for an appeal base on incompetent counsel or she need another cup of espresso no your Honor actually Mr Dubois be just what I be look for he seem like an intelligent man a logical man with no apparent prejudice or predisposition against people who have more money than he do he claim to have and understanding of how alcohol can impair your judgment and most of all he seem like a fair man and at the end of the day what more can I ask for thank you Mr Dubois yes uh sorry your Honor I be just hope that I could get my um my slip from the clerk well no Mr Dubois you be not dismiss you be serve on this jury Congratulations they finally asleep that take awhile I be go to do lunch in the morning I be too tired okay you almost ready for bed yeah I just

you be work on this case in any capacity if he walk in right now and see you with these file we would be look at a mistrial and Stephen Garner would walk he would have murder his wife and walk away I do not understand he be not on trial for murder it be an accident it be negligence be not it you know it be funny most of the time I be stare at a crime and I be look for motive mean and opportunity here I 've get all three and yet I be force to behave as if there be no crime I be sorry I be not follow you in my opinion Stephen Garner take his rich wife out on that boat and kill she maybe he get she drunk and push she maybe he just smash in her skull and throw she overboard I do not have a body so I do not know but whatever happen the final result be she be dead and he do it on purpose but why money Hers a 40 million trust fund but I can not prove that so I be hope to get a conviction on criminally negligent homicide and then maybe I can put he away for four year four year on a garbage charge and that be all the justice I can offer this poor woman so please do not make an impossible task hard just get up walk out and I will give the file back to Sondra we do not even get on the

into my office 12 year ago he have on a sport coat that look like it probably cost 60 and a tie that cost about ten and he say I would like to work for you sir I would like to learn from you sir I would like to learn how to make money and uh I ask he the question I ask everyone who say they want to work for I I ask what be you willing to do and he say I be willing to do anything sir and he be tell the truth for the next year and a half he unstop toilet he deliver mail he run errand he bring everyone lunch he be the first one there in the morning and the last one to leave at night he know nothing about finance but after 18 month he be teach I thing that be who my son in law be and how do he come to meet your daughter well I introduce they uh put they together anyway and how do that come about from time to time in my business there be work relate function uh charity event award dinner I be always encourage Stephen to go but he would always decline finally he confess to I that he be intimidate afraid of make a fool of himself pick up the wrong fork drink from the wrong glass that sort of thing while a man who look like he certainly have no shortage of woman in his life he do let I know that none of they be of a caliber he feel comfortable bringing to a work relate function so I suggest that perhaps he should ask Jessica to accompany he and obviously that work out my Jessica be asleep for the first 24 year of her life and then she meet this man and and she I be I be hope that she would have child I know they both want desperately want child I be sorry I 've completely forget the question the 42 million do not it make you wonder about what that be her you well go now I know he in college I have not talk to he since then you go to school with he no he live in town he work at his stepfather 's bar anyway he be great look back then too and I know my parent would not approve so I have to have he you date he you could call it date it be more like sex and fighting so wait I be confused if you have not talk to he in year why be you come to court every day see it in the paper see something like that and you know the people it happen to it freak you out a little and I guess I feel a little responsible what do you mean I sort of introduce they wait a second I think I read in the paper uh that the dad introduce they that they meet through work or something I read that too the truth be we be all at the country club one night and this be like 13 year ago way before he ever start work for her father oh God Jess do not even notice Stephen I mean why would she he be the bartender but she definitely make an impression on he what do you mean well he hear she have serious money so after the party he want to know everything about her what do she like to do what kind of guy do she like I mean he want to know everything there be to know about Jessie Hammond and this be 13 year ago mm hmm I tell he he do not have a chance with her she be a real daddy 's girl you know only child no mom shy I guess he figure the key to Jess be her dad 'cause the next thing I know he be work for he well I still do not get it you know the guy you have a thing with the guy but that be some time ago and yet here you be come to court every day I tell you I guess I feel a little responsible why I do not know um Stephen be ask I about Jessica for like the hundredth time you know like do I think she really have that much money that sort of thing like he be on a mission and I tell he to forget about it that it be never go to happen I mean that boy like the bedroom I know he be nail I and like six other girl the thought of he getting marry the thought of he be exclusive I just I do not think he have it in he and I tell he so and I tell he that if he marry Jess she would care and her dad would care more anyway I remember Stephen look at I and he say hey a person would just have to marry she he would not necessarily have to stay married to her ask I what I know do not matter you be right it be a plan he be be work it since the early ' 90 the guy be a classic sociopath Allison it do not matter Court the father then court her Marry she then kill

watch Mr Mayor yeah trust I I be not afraid to knock a few head from time to time yeah you can count on I Allison what be the matter no nothing I be well aware that traditionally the candidate only

break into an elderly couple 's home with a firearm just three year ago why be not this dangerous criminal behind bar why do an innocent woman have to die because District Attorney Manuel Devalos refuse to prosecute to the full extent of the law be not it time Phoenix have a prosecutor tough enough to do the job Vote Nathan Bradley new blood new breed solid value pay for by the Committee to Elect Nathan Bradley Clyde Morton what be you talk about he be a scared kid at least he be three or four year ago yeah thank you yeah that be he he be arrest for break and enter 14 maybe 15 year old

to disappoint his Honor but as he very well know I can hold a suspect any suspect rich poor or otherwise without actually charge he for 24 hour no he know that it be just since there be no firm evidence to actually implicate this man we be wonder if you could possibly see your way clear no I can not and you tell the mayor I have a bathroom full of blood and a team of professional investigator tell I that Jason Morrow be connect that be enough for I and it should be enough for the mayor Mr District Attorney David Morrow Mr Morrow I could not help but overhear the tail end of that exchange look just so everyone 's intention be clear when this evening roll around if you still do not have enough evidence to charge my son I will be file a lawsuit against you and the City of

guy 250 an hour and I be worried about what I look like you look like a captain of industry you look like an admiral of industry Admiral 's big than captain right I have no idea I get to go I understand Judge but I would be remiss if I do not tell you I think you be make a mistake Jason Morrow be our only connection to this missing woman Respectfully I disagree we will work hard sir you count on it no warrant the judge seem to feel that we be reach so I guess Jason Morrow 's car home studio they be all off limit well we can still hold he for another 10 hour but unless we have any physical evidence that he be involve in the disappearance of Gloria Soto he will walk I wish I could tell you that I have a dream last night that would narrow down the search for the body but so far I 've only be able to see thing when I look at one of Morrow 's painting well in that case I think you will appreciate the homework we 've assemble for you in the conference room 47 painting in total every one of they a Jason Morrow original figure it will keep you busy for the rest of the morning wait I think that we could not get a search warrant on his studio we could not I spend most of last night visit all the local gallery flash my badge and ask if the Phoenix P D could borrow everything they have by Jason Morrow just watch where you put that coffee we break anything we pay for it give we a call if you see something where be you go I be go to go look for a tree with a hundred pair of sneaker dangle from it Self Portrait Jason it do not look a thing like you good bye my darling hello how much you know about local high school football not much why it turn out the Flagstaff Cougars have this funny little tradition every year the graduating senior tie their cleat together and throw they over the branch of a dead ash tree near their favorite drinking spot in the wood if I give you direction how soon can you be here one adult female one male child Forensic tech figure they 've be here at least 20 year which mean she could not possibly be Gloria Soto and unless Jason Morrow be one very advanced toddler I be guess he be not our killer we be 20 hour into the custody of Jason Morrow and we be still no close to find the body of Gloria Soto we have however find two body that we be not look for but we can be reasonably certain that our suspect have nothing to do with their death give the fact that he be a toddler at the time I do not know what to tell you all I can say be I see Gloria Soto be bury in that grave no you do not you see her mother Inez Soto we I D have she off her dental record they match a miss person report her family file in Mexico in 1982 1982 apparently the mexican authority forward it to we at the time someone spend about a half a day look into it and then it sit in a drawer until this afternoon oh my God she look exactly like her daughter I think I see someone dig a grave for Gloria but I must 've see someone dig a grave for her mother now here be an interesting factoid care to guess who Inez be work for when she disappear in ' 82 accord to the file David Morrow wait a second the woman whose corpse you just find work for Jason Morrow 's father accord to her family she be work for he as a maid make money to send back home to Mexico to her daughter have a son too Tomas he be bear here in the States disappear when she do that must 've be the boy the same one I see in Jason 's painting I have a present for you by the way a little something to uh complete your collection where do this come from stop by to see Jason Morrow in his hold cell to see if his plush surrounding trigger any new recollection about Gloria Soto he be work on it the whole time I be there I ask he if I could see it he tell I to keep it good bye my darling feel well little baby there be two little baby there have to be there be Inez 's son and there be Jason Jason be a witness he do not remember anything he be too young but it be all in there every time I see one of his painting come to life I be see what happen through his eye I I be sorry I be not sure I follow you well think about it he could not have kill the mother and son but he could have see his father do it look I think what happen to Inez and her son be terrible from what little I remember of they they be nice people but if you be suggest that I have anything to do with their death we just want to ask you a few question well consider the fact that you just release my son after incarcerate he for 24 hour you will forgive I if I be not feel especially cooperative you ever be convict of a felony Mr morrow yes I be arrest several time but I be guess that you already know that Heroin possession right it happen over 20 year ago Detective a youthful indiscretion more like three youthful indiscretion actually what about assault and battery charge your wife file Emily drop those charge it be a misunderstanding now be you finish or do I need to call my lawyer no no I 've only get one more question for you why would you kill Inez and her kid she hear something she should not have try to blackmail you maybe that be your theory I kill she to protect my money that be a good theory it be clever except for one thing everything you see here none of it belong to I it never have my wife 's family do not particularly like I and I be guess that have something to do with the arrest that you mention while my wife be alive we live off of her trust fund and after my wife pass all of the asset be transfer to my son Jason okay this house be his everything he let I live here he give I an allowance I guess you could call it okay maybe you two have an affair she call it off Detective you be embarrass yourself I tell you not to play with that boy he can make you sick he can kill you now tilt your head back Dr Tedesco say we have to be sure to get every drop of blood off you keep your eye open guess we will be give you a call and uh you can come down to the station to make a statement that be productive actually it be you see something in there I see Inez Soto again when I be look at that painting she be give one of the boy a bath sound like a hot lead I mean she be the maid no it be not like that she be scared of something she mention the other boy she say he be sick and she mention a doctor Tedesco Dr Tedesco it seem important a name now that I can work with oh Hmm Mm after a long day of hard work I really look forward to a brewski hmm well then my dear you be doom for an evening of disappointment a man a man with a mask come into our house and steal all of our brewskis Mm so I be sit in our 250 an hour lawyer 's office and I think it be hour three and he say to I be it true the fellow from Versailles Capital be fund you and Andrew and all I could think of be Versailles be run on fume and I be like I do not know I mean I do know at least I strongly suspect base on our conversation this morning but I do not know so what do you do I pretend my phone be vibrate that it be a call from you I tell he I have to wrap up this meeting and I get out of there and I go over to Andrew 's house and I just ask he and and he say keep it under your hat Joe but yes Versailles Capital have agree to provide 100 percent of the startup funding for Gossamer that be the name we come up with Gossamer that be a great name that be a beautiful name my emperor of industry so what be you go to do I already do it I tell he I could not join he tell he I would not do you tell he why do I tell he my dead father tell I the money be not go to come through no I do not I do not know why it be a spur of the moment thing but Joe maybe you could find somebody else to fund you guy maybe but I already tell he I be sure he be out to somebody else by now I be so sorry I would 've miss the Christmas party and my great parking space mm mm hmm and we do have a hell of a health plan you be a liar I should get that the girl oh wait you just sit I will get it hello track down this guy Tedesco turn out he be an immunologist one of the first pediatric AIDS specialist in Phoenix I I do not understand be Inez 's son sick D do he remember he he do not remember anything he pass away in ' 86 but his wife still have all his old medical file in the garage and I badger she and she let I take a look and and he never treat Tomas but get this he do treat Jason Morrow turn out Jason 's parent be both intravenous drug user but only mom get sick apparently she pass AIDS to he in the womb accord to the file Jason 's case be terminal Life expectancy four year max wait a second how be that possible Jason 's get to be at least 25 actually no he be not he be dead you lead we to his body oh my God that little boy in the grave be not Inez Soto 's son Tomas Soto 's still alive only he think he be Jason Morrow Mr Morrow thank you for come in on a Saturday sir I be only here because my son ask I to come down and join he he be wait in the conference room right this way Jason you all right I be fine why do they bring you down here to formally apologize Jason the city of Phoenix sincerely regret hold you in connection with the disappearance of Gloria Soto we recognize it as an ordeal and a massive inconvenience and for that we sincerely apologize Fine that be a start but if you think it be go to make we stop our lawsuit you be wrong I can assure you I be under no such misapprehension Good then we will see you in court probably soon than you think what be this it be a medical report on Jason Morrow your son it date back to 1982 you get this from Dr Michael Tedesco his widow actually Imagine Jason 's surprise when he hear that he have be diagnose with AIDS at birth seem like the type of thing you would mention Dad I do not know where you be go with this Manuel but you know damn well that file be protect under doctor patient confidentiality absolutely but since Jason here be supposedly the patient he find the content fascinating I never tell you because it be not true I mean I fire this doctor he misdiagnose you I mean obviously look at you you be fine so what be wrong with I you suffer from a rare form of pediatric pneumonia I take you to a clinic in Switzerland you recover and you have documentation to prove that my client be not oblige to produce medical record of any kind it be very important to you that Jason stay alive be not it of course he be my son right and after your wife Emily pass if Jason have not survive his bout of what have you callit pneumonia you would have be cut out of the family money would not you Mr District Attorney I demand to know be you accuse my client of something here only murder two count for now probably three when all be say and do this meeting be over Jason sit down Dad Jason I do not know what they 've be tell you but it be not true David we should go your wife die of AIDS in 1982 you know your son do not have long to live and you know that when he die your last connection to your wife 's family money would die with he so you do the only thing you could do you went look for a replacement and luckily you do not have to look far your maid 's son be about the same age as Jason she be an undocumented immigrant somebody you think nobody would miss so you kill she and then you do something unthinkable you kill your own diseased child and you raise Inez Soto 's healthy boy as your own Jason none of this be true well there be a simple way to prove that Jason have agree to give we a blood sample if you be willing to do the same and the DNA indicate that the two of you be in fact relate then we will know that all of this be just a product of our overactive imagination come on Dad do not even hurt at the end of the day we can show they how wrong they be Manuel you know you can not compel my client to give you a dna sample you be right but I can compare the sample I already draw from Jason to the dna from Inez Soto 's remain in fact it be be do right now and if the comparison show I what I think it be go to that the man raise as Jason Morrow be in fact Tomas Soto then I will have more than enough to make a case against your client you be welcome to go somewhere and wait it out if you want but I will be on your ass the whole time or we can stay right here and talk about a deal who know you tell I where Gloria Soto 's body be I will even consider take the death penalty off the table my card 's high you sure I be this sure I call I win no you do not I have an ace you have a one daddy do not four beat one sorry kiddo Ace beat all ha hey nobody tell I we be have a barbecue hey how have it go well the father confess to everything he even tell we where he bury Gloria Soto Congratulations oh I guess there be good news all around I have an interesting call it seem they be have a hard time fill Andrew 's position and guess what they want I to interview for the job way to go Emperor I be go to go change I will be right back hey hey see everything work out for the good apparently thank I guess ah one thing though um that firm of theirs that Gossamer thing it be actually go to be a success it be actually go to do all right not not huge but all right what I do not understand well I just do not want you to see it happen later and get angry with I I mean like I say everything work out for the good well wait a second now I be not so sure it have trust I if he take that partnership he would spend the next 12 year work 70 hour week and he would have tell himself that he be do it for you for the kid and he would not have know that he be

pretty song come at you what day be it this clock now seem so alive I can not give up 'cause I can Damn and you and I and all of the people with nothing to do nothing to lose and it be you and I and

two martini and an irish coffee what about you Nadine what do you want I to go to prison Nadine do you want I to get lock up because we got smash on your birthday and some girl run right in front of our car our love of people and I do not know why we have to call somebody we have to we have to tell someone she will get help she be go to be fine so will we nothing to do okay sorry sorry yeah I remember this case Melanie Davenport hit and run you turn up something I think the driver be James Massie Nadine Massie 's husband I think she be in the car when it happen and I think the guilt over what they do drive she to kill herself I mean no disrespect but do this theory come with any actual evidence the only eyewitness to the accident be two block away and see a dark four door hit Melanie and then speed off accord to DMV record in 2004 the Massies be drive a green ES the paint find on Melanie 's clothing match the paint they use on the ES that year but not just the ES not just the ES no well that be very thin Lee and do we know where the car be now well accord to the DMV it be report steal do not tell I it happen the day after the accident Two actually Report say it disappear from a mall parking lot while Nadine Massie be Christmas shop my hunch they drive it to a border town leave it at the curb with the key in it it be probably in 10 000 piece in some mexican chop shop by nightfall well all this be fascinating but it really fall under the heading of coincidence and speculation I can not even bring in the guy for questioning base on this really 'cause I already call and ask he to come down he be sit in your conference room right now what to discuss his possible involvement in a year old hit and run case yeah I may have leave that part out you um you call friend relative first you have to tell they you know that that she be go and then you have to find a way to um you know get to how she leave we appreciate you come down Mr Massie we know how difficult this be for you and we want to bring this to as speedy a resolve as possible unfortunately there be a firearm register in your name that be involve with your late wife 's death I understand you can ask I anything I be sorry bit of a cold that be fine I know that both the detective and Mrs Dubois have ask you this but do you think there be something specific that precipitate your late wife 's desire to take her own life I 've rack my brain I um her birthday be come up but she be always pretty excited about that you ever own a green 2004 ES Mr Massie I do um it be steal we have witness that possibly put it at the scene of a hit and run okay um well I mean it be steal a while ago I think uh it be be almost a year now we understand that but this this hit and run I be refer to actually occur a couple of day before that your wife 's birthday actually 15 year old girl Melanie Davenport be kill she be run after her dog the person who hit she just keep go do not even call 911 okay so the reason I be here I mean what you be try to tell I you think that maybe my wife hit this girl in our car and never report it well because I mean if that be true it would certainly explain a lot of thing what thing well uh Nadine 's state of mind over this entire past year for one if this be true and mind you I be not say that this be but I can not even imagine what kind of terrible guilt she must have be live with I mean it be no wonder she be so unstrung everyone be in bed I lie and tell they you would sneak in later while they be asleep and give they kiss it be not necessarily a lie how do you know it be a lie I be a student of history and history suggest that when you get in one of these mood the kind where you end up lay here on the couch stew in your inability to effect any real change eventually you fall asleep and no one see you till morning it be not go to happen I just need a little time for myself okay I have a very depressing day well I would not know you have not say three word to I since I get home here be the highlight James Massie he completely sell out his poor dead wife today he could have say he do not know anything he know we can not prove he be there but no he have to go that extra step and offer up nadine who be not in a position to defend herself I be sorry I just have to get that out of my system well I have something I have to get out of my system I ask Ariel for Celeste 's parent ' name and phone number today I be a scientist People do not fall suddenly ill it happen gradually over time and there be window of opportunity in which to intervene I think it be worth the risk and any possible hardship to say something and I do not think I could live with myself if I do not I know I will see you in the morning do not worry I be not go to fall asleep out here ha ha ha do you ever see a dream romance well I do do you ever see heaven right in your arm James James Nadine oh God Baby what do you do oh do not worry honey I be go to get you some help okay James James we have to tell I can not go on I can not live this way what be you talk about tell who the police she will never leave until we do do you ever see a dream walk well I do do you ever hear a dream talk well I do do you ever have a dream do you call they be they come they be come you be go to be fine this be stupid what I do I do not want to die I know I just want it to stop

27 minute while I try to hang on listen for the siren that never come but I guess I have it come I should have come forward to the police and tell they what we have do that be all that Melanie want she never mean to hurt I that day that you and I meet in the restaurant she arrange that you know and the business with your headlight she be give I a chance to confess a chance to live and I do not take it and now Melanie 's parent will never know who take their child from they and what happen to your husband he have a chance too today with you in the room he have a chance and he do not take it so now I guess it be up to I I do not understand what be you go to do obviously he be not afraid of ghost he be not afraid of flicker light or music but if someone or something be to blow out the pilot light in the old stove in our kitchen and James be to have a cold not smell the gas let it fill the room and James be to light a cigarette I wonder what those siren be all about do you smell

go to the supermarket I see this girl what she be perfect just the sort of girl that Marcotto would go for Marcotto what do this have to do with Marcotto these girl to he they be like canvas these blank space just wait to be turn into these beautiful work of art he he like their fresh skin the way that they be kind of innocent look not a lot of makeup I notice that her name be Mindy that she work there when I look at she when I be close to her I feel like I have find exactly what I be look for and I could not let she get away sorry Allison why do you keep say I you be not look for anybody but it be like I be so I hang around I wait for she to shift to end and I follow she I follow her home I sit there my car full of grocery and I light up Marcotto 's favorite brand of cigarette and I I watch she I watch she for hour you stalk she you do not hurt she you do not touch she you do not confront she in any way right Allison I be baffle why I mean why would you do something like that I be not sure these dream that I 've be having lately I just assume they be come from some victim someone who want I to catch he put an end to what he be do but now I be pretty sure they be come from he I think he be try to tell I something I I just do not know what it be maybe he be not try to tell you anything maybe he be try to get you to do something no uh uh that be not what it feel like I suddenly become very interested in that girl and it be overwhelming and it be creepy but I be I the whole time I know it be wrong I know I be late I know I should call I be not channel this guy and I be sure as hell not go to start kill for he yeah but you start smoke for he no I smoke in college it be in my history it be something that I would do cut people up kill people no well I be glad you be so certain I will have Ariel call see if she can stay over at Hannah 's Maybe Alan and Kendall can take Bridgette and Marie we can drive they there then I will pick they up take they to school in the morning what why why Allison do you hear yourself you just confess to I you spend the last several hour drive around the city look for innocent flesh to carve up there be no way in hell I be let our girl stay in this house while you 've get this guy in your head but Joe but nothing I love you but frankly you be scare the crap out of I I be sorry just let I make some call get they start pack I will send they in there to say good bye meantime maybe you can wash that smell off kid be all fine I know you have no control over what be go on I do not blame you be you come to bed I want to discuss something important with you I want to discuss your legacy the first line of your obituary the summation of your life that be really what we be do here we be give your life some kind of last meaning I can tell from your expression you be skeptical but you should not be it be be several hundred year but everyone still remember the Girl with the Pearl Earrings Christina from Christina 's World Lisa from the Mona Lisa great art be like that it live forever and its subject live forever this will only hurt for a minute you 've get to stop this I have another dream I skip over the third victim what for God 's sake Allison it be the middle of the night the killer be dead the crime spree be over do not you see he skip over the third victim the third victim Julie Paxon he skip right over her and have show I the fourth girl Patricia Gilmartin the one we save I think I know why he show I that girl in the supermarket he want I to understand what he like what he look for when he choose they so that when I see a counterfeit I would know a what a counterfeit I do not understand Julie Paxon her complexion 's too dark she wear too much makeup she look cheap he would never choose she never in a million year that be why I skip over her that be why I do not dream about her murder Marcotto could not send it to I 'cause he do not do it that be the message Joe that be what he be be try to tell I he do not kill this woman someone else do he be offend I believe so yes Albert Marcotto take his art very seriously when we attribute Julie Paxon 's murder to he I think he take offense I think he find it insult which be why he be be send I these dream so we could help restore his reputation well you will forgive I if I do not lose a lot of sleep worry about the feeling of a dead sociopath that be not the point then what be Allison the inclusion of Julie Paxon in Albert Marcotto 's body count be hardly do arbitrarily he be blame for her death because she be murder in precisely the same horrific manner as his other two victim nevertheless I think we make a mistake you see the body you see how they be violate it take a unique capacity for cruelty to do that to another human being would not you agree Unique yes impossible to duplicate no what be you say you think we get some sort of copycat killer on the loose well maybe or maybe it be someone who only intend to commit one murder Julie Paxon 's someone who carve she up to look like Marcotto 's handiwork so we would not even consider another suspect Someone 's mimic our serial killer so precisely they even include the little detail that we deliberately withhold from the press the geometric wound pattern the red twine in the ligature mark cop talk to their spouse spouse talk to their friend the wrong person could 've get these detail any number of way all I know be I 've be in this guy 's head for a few day or he be be in mine I 've come to know his preference I know his taste Julie Paxon be not it she be not his type she be too do it would be like paint on a use canvas Allison look at this from my side the case be close the crime spree be over what possible incentive for argument 's sake on the off chance there might actually be another killer out there what would it take to get you to open a new investigation into Julie Paxon 's murder short of have another body show up bring I something more than a bad dream bring I proof then maybe I will consider it so in your professional opinion there be nothing different about Julie Paxon nothing that make she stand out from the first two victim she be young female pretty I guess what I be ask be be there anything forensically different about her maybe she be cut by something other than a scalpel or maybe there be some way to tell if the cut be make by a left handed person instead of a right hand one all of the incision on all three woman be identical they be do with a cut instrument that feature a blade no long than six centimeter I be guess some kind of scalpel and as far as I can tell they be all make by a right handed cutter so you be certain this be all the work of the same man why be there ever any question we be just try to be thorough well then today be your lucky day this just come in from the dna lab it confirm that a piece of skin we find under one of Ms Paxon 's fingernail belong to Albert Marcotto she scratch he apparently hello I be home hey hey they be not here they be not back they be but but what I want my kid back now no not just yet what be this it be yours or at least you write it I find it with all the other evidence in this box I think maybe I could help I figure I would take a look in here see if I could get a well handle on what it be that you be go through but then I see that and I figure out I be in way over my head and frankly so be you I do not understand what be this I do not know you tell I that be the pad you be write in last night I do not write this I be write note theory about this case well it go on for nine page Al all in your handwriting no note no theory just it be I over and over and over again do not make any sense I do not remember that be all the more reason to keep the girl away for one more night it be just one more night I be sorry I know it be hard I know you do not choose to have this guy in your head he be a bastard he be scare you he be scare I I feel like an ass I spend the whole day defend he now even he say he do it the medical examiner find his dna under her fingernail Julie Paxon 's you 've give this animal enough of your night it be time you take one for yourself Ladies and gentleman place your bet 500 on the pass 25 on the yellow three four hop same shooter lucky shooter Seven winner well look like it be my walk away time feel like you be cool off Nope I be just getting start I be go to put it all on my Arizona boy to take UCLA you well hurry up they tip off in about 15 minute there you go 10 000 right there and 25 think I will keep this one for luck you all right no I be well than all right I be great I have a dream star I and I do not kill anybody Mm Hallelujah I win a bunch of money play crap I bet 500 on the pass line and it pay off wait a second you lay 500 on the pass line mm hmm since when do you know how to play crap since last night I guess it be fun we should go to Las Vegas what you tell I to dream about anything other than Marcotto it be not my fault my brain pick Sin City Al in the 13 year we 've be marry the only time I 've ever see you roll dice be when we be play Chutes and Ladders with the girl and now suddenly you be an expert which sort of beg the question be it your vacation you dream about or be it someone else 's remind I again what we be do here it be a crazy long shot but I think Marcotto want I to help he establish an alibi I have another dream last night take I awhile to figure it out but I think I be play his part again I be in Las Vegas and I be put a bet down on a basketball game between UCLA and Arizona Hope you bet on the Bruins that game be a blowout come to Mama I check the date the only time those two team play be November 24 which be the day that Julie Paxon be kidnap and murder so if my hunch be correct Marcotto be in Las Vegas the night that she be kill Jackpot uh bad time good time thank you okay well long story short we have reason to believe that Albert Marcotto be in a casino in Las Vegas the night that Julie Paxon be murder so the District Attorney 's office be wonder about the possibility of you reteste the dna that you find under her fingernail I be sorry to what end well clearly Marcotto could not have be in two place at once so if we can verify that he be in Nevada the night that Julie Paxon be kill then we have to assume that the dna result be a function of some kind of error error I do not know maybe someone accidentally mislabele the sample or maybe it be contaminate by a sample from one of the other victim no that be simply not possible I be the only one who have access to Ms Paxon 's remain and I can assure you they be handle with the utmost regard for limit the possibility of molecular degradation or cellular contamination but if the District Attorney want we to run they again I will run they again the M e be give he the once over as we speak she think he have a coronary sometime last night M E be another way of say

teenager do not even exist until 50 or 60 year ago it be only invent to help parent prolong childhood for as long as possible my point be you know that you be mature and responsible even if your

there then he be go but he be definitely there okay fine he be there so what do you want to do well jeeper Pa what do you want to do hey I be just try to be practical it seem to I we 've already do it we 've forbid Ariel from see this boy so presumably she be not go to have any contact with his father right and if your thesis here be that this guy 's Walker 's next cipher that this guy be somehow in the market for some young girl to cut up then the key be to make sure Ariel have no contact with he what about all the other girl he do have contact with do we just sit around and let this guy set a trap for someone else 's daughter huh and what about Dr Gromada be we just go to let he be torture day in and day out hear some voice in his head urge he to kill what be I suppose to do Joe just sit around and wait for it to happen Allison I do not understand how can you dismiss this so easily hey I be not dismiss anything but do not you find it monumentally coincidental that of all the doctor in the world the one that Walker choose happen to be the father of a boy our daughter have a crush on 'cause I do I find that monumentally coincidental so I be ask you to consider the slim possibility before we turn our neighbor in to the police base on theory that be difficult if not impossible to prove before we embarrass our daughter in front of her friend before we label respected member of the community as future child murderer that perhaps you 've take a dream you have about a case from a year ago and mix it up with the anxiety you be have about your old daughter want to begin date boy and project that onto the boy 's father hi Todd hey Ariel so be you still have people over on Sunday 'cause maybe if you be I would come yeah it be still on come Cool so where do you live out by Lakewood

talk about a child my child and keep I from he be a mistake Mrs Dubois I need to bring he home and if you truly understand that piece of scripture you quote you would recognize the truth of that I recognize that you be someone in the midst of a crisis that you need help that the evil you think be inside your son be actually inside your head and until I be convince otherwise I will do everything I can to be sure that you be nowhere near Tyler what be terrify no what be tragic her sense of conviction be so strong it be so absolute I keep think about all these couple who be desperate to have a child of their own and here be this woman completely convince that her son must die that he be the embodiment of evil it make I want to cry so what happen now I do not know we can only compel the hospital to keep he in protective custody for so long the father be blind to it all I do not know what we can prove in court all I know be I have to do everything I can to keep that woman away from her son how old do you say he be I do not know he be like six or seven maybe Sweet God he seem so sweet Tyler his name 's Tyler Tyler in situation like this one it be useful to ask oneself would you know how to spot the seed of resentment before they blossom into the rotten fruit of bad behavior Tyler do not Tyler please why why be you do this I do not know because I be mad Tyler he kill they all Joe he be so unrepentant it be like all the sweetness all the innocence I see in he it be just go be what I be say make any kind of sense to you uh I do not know maybe it be 2 45 in the morning nothing much make sense to I at 2 45 in the morning well forget it I be sorry it be selfish of I to wake you no no I be sorry all right let I just try and focus why do not you start from the beginning yesterday I dream that Marilyn Downey be shoot her son in the head now today I be dream about Tyler and he be in high school and he be kill people dozen of they he take out a gun and he be just slaughter they I in the future in the future well maybe this kid 's suppose to be a long term project maybe you be suppose to help he out even after you lock his mother up or maybe I be not suppose to help he at all you can not be serious I do not know maybe his mother have a touch of what I have maybe she be see what I just see I mean then it would make some kind of crazy sense then you could almost understand why she would do it why she would feel compel to try again maybe I be not suppose to stop she maybe she be just crazy maybe what you be see when you dream be the dream of a crazy woman maybe but how do I know how can I be sure I do not want to do the wrong thing I do not want to make the wrong decision the wrong decision Allison you be not seriously suggest that send this kid home with his homicidal mother be an option be you I be not suggest anything I be just try to figure it out but there be nothing to figure out this kid be in danger he be seven year old and he need your help that be all you need to know of course you be right you be right glad to be of assistance Joe Dubois husband father moral compass we never close you have a moment sir Allison Sure come in Hypothetically what would you say if I tell you I come across a piece of evidence that might help we nail Marilyn Downey for the attempt murder of her son Hypothetically I would tell you that I be a very happy man what would you say if I tell youI'd been have dream about the little boy we be try to save what if I tell you that he may grow up to become one of the most evil human being you or I have ever know and that by stop his mother from commit an atrocity in the present we may very well be set the stage for an even great atrocity in the future what would you say then I would tell you that you be give I more information than I need to do my job I would tell you that we have a responsibility to take care of the case that be right in front of we save this child from his very deranged parent what if this child grow up to hurt other child what if he become a killer I would remind you that we have almost a decade to try and stop he Let us first worry about protect Tyler Downey from his mother then we will figure out a way to protect society from Tyler Downey tell I tell you what tell I how high you be go to put that sign on the door and I ask you how tall be you Mom tell she she can not keep I out of her room just because I be littler than she be there be no height requirement in the Dubois house Ariel I be still put it on my door hello it be I Allison just want to let you know that I hear from forensic and while the gun you find be unmistakably the one use to shoot Tyler Downey it be never be register and be thoroughly clean before it be leave at that dump site there simply be no print or dna evidence so there be no way to trace it back to Marilyn I be afraid that be not the bad of it the Downeys go back to court this morning and the judge rule that as soon as Tyler be feel up to it he be to be release into his parent ' care they leave the hospital together at 5 20 this afternoon so how long do you think it will be till we get the call that she finally kill he Allison I think we 've make it abundantly clear to Mrs Downey that we be watch she that we will always be watch she well that be fine and good sir but I just do not know how much that mean to a crazy person where do the leader of tomorrow come from the seed of their success be sow here in the hall of high school all across American let us listen in on one such success story and before we award you your diploma let us hear a word from our valedictorian Tyler Downey in the day lead up to graduation a number of people have ask I be there one person or one event that have inspire you

fit we in uh besides we be enjoy the music yes the wall in this place be pretty thin it make it hard to concentrate it be sort of like live near an airport after a while you stop notice the plane well I be happ report the MRI show no structural damage whatsoever I know you mention experience some dizziness fofulness both symptom should be entirely transitory so I can go back to use the bathroom without fear of a relapse absolutly I would take it easy for the rest of the day but yes by tomorrow you can do pretty much anything you like you hear that I be okay you be stuck with I I be afraid she would break her funny bone before you go there be one small thing I want to ask about of course I notice on your patient history form that you do not check the box for epilepsy well I be not epileptic then you 've never have any lem with seizure no never why would you ask you see this gray spot here look a little like a peanut it be call venous angioma sound scary than it really be it be actually just a small tangle of exvein in one part of the brain how long do you suppose that be there probably since birth typically they be found it in the brain of epileptic but consider you 've live your whole life and never have a single seizure I think it be safe to assume it be benign you think or you know I know trust I Mr Dubois if the angioma have be affect your wife in any negative way she would 've know about it a long time ago I would 've be have seizure that be one possibility yes but angiomas in this part of the brain have also be associate to visual trouble ephemera I be sorry ephemera a fancy word for hallucination hearing voice see people and thing that be not really there but since you do not check the box for that either I do not think you have to worry about hearing voice uh see people and thing there be not really there uh stop I if any of this start to sound familiar not funny it be not mean to be but think about it Alison what if this angioma be the reason that you see the thing that you see the reason that you hearthe thing that you hear they be not hallucination no I know that so what be you get at I be get at a theorie I be get at the possibility that s this little peanut that we find in your brain today might be what make you so different from all the other girl you be angry you be psychic you must have a little peanut in your head actually I be not I be try to figure out why you'suddenly so obsessed with reduce what I do to something physiological I be a scientist and take complicated thing and reduce they to their simple ele be what I do and you my dear be a very complicated thing something the matter I I do not know I can not seem to find my car you do not remember what level you park it on no I I think well I be sure it be around here somewhere what kind of car do you drive what kind of car the make the color that sort of stuff nothing I just want to make sure you be you can not you do that when I be asleep Mommy where be you bear I be bear in Chelsea Oklahoma sweet and what be your middle name Louise my name be Allison Louise Dubois and I drive a metallic beige station wagon good morning girl Morning Daddy hi daddy good morning what be your name again I know what you be up to you be not really kiss I you be kiss my inner peanut please there be child in the room what be it something I say you get a love note from that Scanlon fellow Good news girl Mommy 's completely back to normal hi I do not understand this be her this be the girl I see get into David Saunders ' car can not you at least question he about her base on what base on I see she tie to his bed base on I think he suffocate she along with all the other girl I see I do not know what to tell you Allison I run a check on this guy and he be a Boy Scout no prior no arst no stint in rehab just a couple of unpaid speeding ticket from six or seven year ago the guy 's marry own a copy shop pay his taxis pick up prostitute and smother they maybe look all I have to go on be a miss person report file by a fellow prostitute right for all we know this uh Jade girl could 've up and move to L A and just do not bother to tell anyone for six year come on this report be file in 1999 do the cop even look into it I be sure the department do the good they could with what they be give the woman who file the report do not even know her friend 's real name she say Jade be just her street name do not know any of her friend do not know anything about her family that be not a lot to go on do you say this guy own a copy shop ' Kay thank you very much have a good day can I hey you survive my goodness from the MRI hi so you work here kind of this be my store I own this place you be kid I 've never be in here before what be the chance I know Amazing so really how have it go yesterday with your MRI it go well I I take your suggestion I tell myself that I be ride on a train and it really relax I it relax I a little too much I think I fall asleep my head go to the side and half my view come out blurry I have to go back again tomorrow oh no yeah well that be why it be good I have a season pass so what can I do for you today Miss Dubois Allison Dubois I do not know if I mention that I work part time at the district attorney 's office no you do not I also help out with this uh miss person group this girl have be miss for the last seven year and we be finally reopen the case I be wonder if you would not mind put this flyer in your front window her name 's Jade she be a prostitute she be be miss since 1999 uh this be strange really why do you say that hey Angela come here a minute Dave you have no idea how embarrassing I be well you hand a man that be be nothing but nice to you a photograph of a prostitute that look remarkably like his wife I think I have a pretty good idea how embarrassed you be he even show it to her really how have she take it eh she laugh she think it be pretty funny so do he then he offer to make free copy so I could put it in as many window as possible the fiend first he kidnap they then he kill they then he offer to reproduce their image free of charge so the police can have an easy time find they clearly u're deal with an evil genius here well that be the thing when I be around he yesterday I do not feel anything like that all I feel be kindness and warmth and honesty and suddenly the idea of he hurt these girl it make absolutely no sense to I 'cause even the thought of do something so horrific so hideously evil would not even enter a mind of a man like that I do not understand how I could have be so wrong about he well let us not forget about that bump on your head yesterday when you have all these vision that bump be fresh maybe they be swell maybe you be a little off your game be you imply my peanut 's not all it be crack up to be actually I be glad you bring that up remember we be talk about yesterday about the possiblilty that the peanut that growth inside your head be what make you so sensitive you realize you be look at I like I be a petri dish look it get I to think what if I have somebody actually test that theory how would someone prove a correlation between venous angiomas and increase sensitivity to I do not know various psychic phenomenon Gosh Mr Wizard I do not know I guess you would have to find somebody else who be kind of sensitive and scan their brain see if there be an angioma that be my thought exactly you can not be serious oh I be completely serious there be no way in the wide world I be go to let you it be perfectly safe Al you be subject our daughter to MRIs there be no radiation no side effect Dr Sooran say she would not even charge we a dime you already speak to her not about the psychic stuff just about getting scan for the girl see if they give angiomas too it be intrigue Al the possibility that there might be a genetic link I mean it be pretty heady stuff no pun intend what about the girl have you at least think about how traumatic it could be to be trap in that metal clanging coffin so that daddy could take picture of your brain there be a machine that can take a picture of my brain it be call an MRI sweetie and there be no reason in the wide world that you should get one 'cause you be perfectly fine but what if I want one try to stay perfectly still honey sorry my toe itch but I think I get it this be go to make for one hell of a show and tell Cooool like mother like daughter you find another peanut the exact same spot as Mom I have a peanut in my head just a little extra lump of brain that look like one and Mommy have one too that be right kiddo Mommy have one too I understand there be another daughter perhaps we could find the time perhaps we could find the time to perform a scan on she as well you do a wonderful job Bridgette I be sure your mom and dad be real proud of you hey honey would you like I to touch you now want I to scratch your back I give a great massage maybe I could wash you if you untie I we can take a bath please baby it be start to hurt S hhh do you like the desert what be you do again I do not know what this all mean this extra pocket of blood flow to the brain perhaps I could interview you sometime interview you both see if there be some manisfestation of all this that we can identify and quantify but first we need to get Ariel in here yes if they all have it then we be truly onto something well I say that be two hour very well spend you understand her point about Ariel Mrs Dubois back for second hi hi how you do that be you in there I tell you I be a regular the joke around here be that I keep mistake this place for a tanning salon hey do you ever find that girl no not yet the desert they think she be bury in the desert along with a few other you mean someone smother they and bury they that be the theory and they 've be rot in the sun ever since they 've be sit there and rot for the last five or six year excuse I I I think a simple no we be still work on it she have not turn up yet would have suffice you meet he you be with he he seem like the nice guy in the world he go into this machine he gets scan and suddenly I see this whole other side of he maybe you do and maybe you do not what be that mean Allison I believe you when you say you see his thought but thought be not necessarily memory they can be idea or fantasy do not you say that his wife first appear to you as a prostitute Wall from what I 've read he would not be the first man to have have that particular daydream well with all due respect sir these be violent gruesome horrible encounter that I be see but if they never really happen they be not illegal Allison I do not know what to tell you the man you be suspicious of have no real record there appear to be no real victim and my suspicion be what we 've get here be no real crime Allison Allison excuse I Allison Mrs Saunders Angela be you look for I if I tell you a secret if I take you into my confidence how can I be sure that you be not go to tell my husband when your husband be not run his copy shop do he work for the prosecutor 's office then I have no reason to tell he anything Angela it be not Angela um it be Jade actually or Melanie really but um my name my street name at least the first time that I meet David be Jade I would see his car around before there be something about he some essense that you pick up this uh this core of niceness hey loverboy you lonely sure oh I be such a mess I even let he tie I up what be that the train we be a block away there be one little problem he finish too early you see my pimp and I have come to this new arrangement when I come across someone who want to take I home if it seem like he have some money and would not put up much of a fuss my pimp would follow we and then he would break in and rob the place while I keep the john occupy in the bedroom Shh do you like the desert so he break in around midnight knock over a lamp on his way into the window Wh where you be go baby come back baby come back they meet each other in the hallway there be a fight and then I hear a gunshot what do you do what do you do he drag I out of there David be lie there in the hallway bleed from his head he be not move what do you do I wait till my pimp get high and then I sneak away and I call 911 the next day I read in the paper that a bullet have pass through David 's skull he almost bleed to death on the floor so you save his life yeah in a strange way he uh he return the favor I do not know what it be but be that close to death something about it it it change I I get myself off the street I check into rehab a couple month later I be deep into the program you know the 12 step and I have take all my personal inventory and now it be time for step nine make amend I go to David 's hospital room all ready to tell he what I have do you know accept responisibility take the consequence and that be when I realize he do not remember I he do not remember anything his life before that night it be a blank he have be in the hospital for month with his friend come by every day try to fill in his memory for he remind he that uh he love watch baseball that his favorite food be pizza of course they could not fill he in on the part of his life that they do not know anything about the cruise the girl off the street and they do not know anything about what get he into the hospital except for what they read in the paper you know that a man have break into his home and shoot he leave he for dead I start visit he every day first at the hospital then at his business I should have tell he then you know I should have tell he everything but I could not before I know it I be in love and so be he we 've be marry for five year now we want to have a family that man who use to pick up girl off the street he do not exist anymore and that girl that uh you be look for well she be fine oh she be well than fine be not there any way that we can put the past behind we particularly when there be so much future to look forward to wow let I see what I can do and he have no idea about her past apparently not and the ultimate romantic irony she have no idea about his although who be I kid I be not certain about his past either maybe Devalos be right maybe what I tap into when he be in that machine be some sort of dark fantasy I can feel the heat come off your brain from here what be you chew on Mm nothing much just the mystery of life that again you need to get your head out of the cloud and think about something that matter mm be we really just the sum of our memory wait a second I know the answer to that I read it in a magazine I mean David Saunders he look at his wife and he see this wonderful woman that he meet in the hospital while he be recover from a horrible accident that be who she be to he that be all he know and when he wake up in the morning he look in the mirror he do not see a guy who went cruise downtown look for stranger to have sex with or bad he see the guy that I see when I go visit he at the print shop a member of the Chamber of Commerce a little league sponsor a devoted husband well maybe what do you mean maybe I mean who know what really go on in someone 's brain who know what memory actually survive and what might trigger they anyway what be we talk about do not you tell I you be pretty much convinced that whatever you see do not really happen be only in his head no I keep think if I see it it be in his head and if it be in his head it be in his head for a reason if a memory be kill in the forest and there be no one there to hear it ha ha ha what time do we have to go to this MRI place in the morning I do not know what to tell you I do not see it I do not see any sign of venous angioma in Ariel 's brain oh oh hey hey good news absolutely very good you be disappoint be not you ah it be a nice theory would ha answer a lot of question I admit it I have vision of newborn all over the world be test for the Dubois angioma ah the Dubois angioma Nice hi sorry I be late you want to see I yeah no big deal I just want to let you know that I receive the rest of the inquiry on David Saunders go all the way back to 1995 and there be really nothing there a couple of neighbors'complaint about noise a parking ticket a couple of traffic violation what be these those be evidence shot from a photo enforce stoplight he run in 1998 you 've see they you run the light and it automatically take picture of the car whoever be drive the license plate pretty much eliminate

perspective Joe he look exactly like Fine but that do not mean that he be our son that do not mean that he be anything to we except a kid in a dream look you go to this coffee shop once maybe twice a

your shower I want you to take another bath and when you be all finish call I in and I will I will clean everything up oh hello good morning this be your official civil servant wake up call Mr District Attorney I think we have a viable suspect in the Morehouse case and I 've just authorize Detective Scanlon to make contact and see if we can not bring he in here and have a conversation and I be hope you might be able to join we wait a second I be confused what about the husband the husband have a rock solid alibi turn out he be with a woman the morning of the murder a married woman no less and not withstand the obvious embarassement for all involvment she be willing to corroborate his whereabout I expect to hear from Scanlon any minute I want he to speak with this kid before he leave home to go to school a kid yeah we be zero in on one of the suspect who work there if you can believe it a boy name Andrews uh Jessie Andrews I do not know I mean I figure the first boss I would have would be some big fat guy who would yell at I and she be not like that she be really nice and and pretty and you could talk to she about stuff she would just talk back to you I do not know I I really I really like it there she make it really nice some of the other kid say you be buy her thing it be for her birthday the other kid tell he that it be her birthday so he bring she some perfume it be nice that be a very nice thing for a young man to do you should be very proud okay so you buy she some perfume um he do not really buy it he borrow it from my dresser I mean it be expensive I think she be a little throw by it Jessie do you think that contribute to her decision to let you go you guy know about that we look at your employee file and some of your former colleague fill we in on what happen yes I think it be both way I think I mean maybe I be not concentrate enough at work 'cause I like talk to her but I also think that she really like talk to I when I be around so I do not know I guess I do not I do not blame she so you be not mad at she I mean when she we be still alive you be not angry with her right no God no I just miss she I still miss she okay so she fire you but you do not stay away obviously Jessie do not handle thing as well as he might have he do not tell I that he have be fire at first I think perhaps he be embarrassed be that as it may it be our understanding that thing get a bit emotional it be his first job he do not want to lose it of course not Jessie could you tell we where you be Wednesday morning between 5 00 and 6 00 a m be my son be accuse of something here no one be be accuse of anything every employee at the Coffee Palace have be interview and every employee at the Coffee Palace have answer that question if you would like to stop and find Jessie an attorney we will certainly understand but in my opinion if he have nothing to hide then it would be a foolish waste of time and money but it be up to you go ahead Jess I be sleep at home can anybody verify that I can I get home from the hospital around 4 30 in the morning I have perform an emergency c section I be an obstetrician anyway I peek in on he as I always do and there he be be there anybody else at home with you Dr Andrews no I be not marry Detective it be just the two of we Jessie and I may I ask what size shoe you wear Jessie excuse I do you ask all the other employee that Dr Andrews I be sure you read the paper and I be sure you know how much pressure we be all under to get to the bottom of this but we can not do that until we can eliminate all the people that have contact with Mrs Morehouse we find footprint in the victim 's blood at the scene the tread mark indicate they come from a pair of size nine sneaker I be no detective but be not there a lot of people who wear size nine thank you you ever own a pair of Z Jams Jess you do not have to answer that we come down here voluntarily to help your investigation if you be go to make my son out as a suspect I will find a lawyer that be absolutely your prerogative Dr Andrews I would not hurt she no not another word Jess Mom Bridgette 's give Angus our breakfast Bridgette Angus have his food and we have ours just check my cell no call overnight to claim our friend here do that mean we get to keep he uh oh you know what let us just take it one step at a time give it a few more day nobody want that dog Bridgette want that dog I guess I get to go find a truck so what be you think I be think that maybe I will drop he off at the vet on my way to work this morning do some due diligence see if he be get all his shot at least that way if we decide to keep he we would know what to expect hey good look what be cook Fish you want to check this place out with I I really appreciate you stay open these extra 15 minute I try to get off work early and then the phone rang no no no no when they explain to I that you and Angus be new client Mr Dubois do you say this dog be a stray well yeah my daughter bring he home a few day ago so she be not too attached to he then she be well you know kid she be uh she be very attached be you say he belong to somebody else I be say that he be sick he be sick what be wrong with he well for starter I would say he be about 12 year old so in dog year that be 84 he be 84 well the age thing be not an exact science but it be about right yeah even with a simple examination I can tell you that his liver 's enlarge his eyesight be go and his breathing be clearly labor be he go to be okay I wish I have well news so what be you say be you say he be go to die I be afraid so how long anywhere from a week to a week and a half when do you want to tell she do we have to tell she I do not know I will give you a hundred dollar if you will do it no thank I fear I 've already destroy one child 's life for the day one be my limit good news and bad news I will take any news at this point the good news be we test the clothe blood come from Cristin Morehouse and the sneaker match the footprint from the crime scene a laundry tag on the shirt be traceable back to Jessie Andrews we get a squad car on the way to pick he up right now and the bad news be obviously we have not get to the bottom of the big crime problem in the neighborhood but I will take my victorieswhere I can get they Allison Congratulations if you will excuse I I be not feel terribly well feel any well I be sorry I ask if you be feel any well you say you be go to leave almost two hour ago well to answer your question no I do not I do not feel any well I feel horrible you ask I the other day if I though that boy be innocent and I do not say anything because honestly everything that I dream tell I that he be guilty as hell but what I can not make sense of be everything I feel tell I to protect he like a parent like a mother for what it be worth just now when they bring he in to book he he finally admit that he do go see Morehouse that morning know she would be there all by herself open up the store of course he claim that she be already dead when he get there not that he call the police or anything I mean if it make you feel any well well maybe he be tell the truth maybe she be dead when he find her Allison could not we at least consider the possibility take another look at the husband or the woman that he be see maybe she be the one who want Cristin out of the picture okay I be go to go back to work now deal with some case that be truly unresolved and in need of some attention okay you know what if it be all the same to you can I just take another look at the file thank you how go the fine tooth comb actually I be confused your boss mention that that be not what I be talk about Kevin Morehouse say his wife be not able to have child but accord to the coroner 's report the shape of her uterus be indicative of she having give birth at some point in her life okay look I be not sure where you be go with this but you should know the kid 's lawyer be on his way down here now to talk deal I be sorry Allison but the kid 's guilty and even his attorney know it let I tell you what we know we know that your client have something of an obsession with Mrs Morehouse we also know that he have a confrontation with she the day she die and she be upset to the point of call the young man 's mother to take he home we know that a bag of his blood spatter clothing be find in a Dumpster early this morning and the the blood be a perfect match for that of Mrs Morehouse now I will tell you what I think I think I have more than enough here to make a case against your client and I think if I try he as an adult that the jury will not hesitate to give he the maximum sentence he be barely 15 year old you be talk about take away the next 30 year of his life I would be lie if I say that Jessie 's age do not give I pause which be the only reason that I will consider a deal provide he sign a full confession I will recommend manslaughter four year in a juvenile detention facility if however you would rather take this to trial know that I will prosecute Jessie as an adult and I will seek the maximum feel free to talk it over you 've get 15 minute how long be you go to do this for the rest of my life you get an issue with that not I just seem like there be go to be a lot of waste space in our bed maybe I should put an ad in the paper see if I can rent out half he confess to everything do he say why he do it the day she call his mother to pick he up he be humiliate so he decide he do not want it to end that way he set his alarm wake up early go back the next morning catch she when she be open up she get upset he grab a thermo and what about his real mom Dr Andrews what about she do she confess to put his clothe in that Dumpster no it do not come up and I do not say anything she be an adult Joe she would have do more time for be an accessory than he be go to do for the actual murder so she just get to walk she be just try to protect her kid and at least this way she will be able to be there for he when he get out in four year and if you want to know the truth if it be Ariel or Bridgette or Marie I would have do the exact same thing speak of protect your kid I do not I do not suppose you 've come up with any bright idea for tell our middle child that her dog be die yeah I neither well I get half a bed to try and rent see ya Jessie 's manager uh Cristin uh Mrs Morehouse Dr Andrews I I be so sorry about Jessie have we meet before no I do not believe we have no be you sure what kind of doctor be you exactly if I can ask I have to run I be due back at the hospital in 20 minute I be terribly sorry he will not bother you again Dr Andrews Dr Andrews Dr Andrews he be mine be not he he be mine Mine he be mine what do she mean what be she yell about nothing honey absolutely nothing come in I know I be a little late the hospital be just I understand I be glad I catch you while you be in the city no as soon as you say it might help Jessie how be he do as well as can be expect consider I just there be some inconsistency in here and I be hope you could help I clear they up anything I can tell you anything you want to know uh Dr Andrews the the night before Cristin Morehouse die the night she call you and have you come and pick up Jessie be that the first time you would ever meet she I believe so yes all right well here be the thing I be look through Cristin 's autopsy report and apparently she have give birth to a child at some point in her life all right well it make I curious because her husband say that infertility be a real issue for they so I I do some checking and I come across this death certificate apparently she have give birth to a child many year before her marriage the baby have die moment after it come into the world what be I look at here you sign the death certificate Dr Andrews you be there all right yes that be my signature it 15 year ago a different last name I honestly have no recollection of the woman well here be another interesting thing contradiction wise apparently on the night you be preside over the death of Cristin 's son you be also give birth to one of your own Dr Andrews 15 year ago I be an intern volunteer a few hour a week at a clinic downtown one night a woman stumble in high like most of our patient she say she be in a lot of pain she do not know why after a short exam I tell she she be eight month pregnant and she be in labor she do not know she do not want to know she tell I her whole life be about do drug she do not know who the father be she do not care I tell she the baby be comingand she look at I and say people pay a lot for a white baby right what do I think she could get for it she be in pain so I give she something to help she sleep and an hour later Jessie come into the world I clean he up wrap he in a blanket and I be go to call the police but he be shake so hard shake Jessie be bear an addict so I just wait and I hold he rock he until he quiet down I can still feel the weight of his tiny body in my arm I can still see his sweet face he be so helpless and he just need someone to take care of he someone to protect he and somehow I know that person have to be I my life as I know it be over I give it to he I give he everything I have you become his mother when Cristin wake up I tell she the baby have die I know what I be do be wrong but I swear to you Mrs Dubois if anything she be relieve and that be when I know this be the good thing for everybody it be certainly the good thing for Jessie and you never see she again we move to Tempe he and I no one know we no one care we move here to Phoenix three year later I I suppose she be long go probably long dead and then last week I go to the Coffee Palace she recognize I she tell I that she be clean now that she could be a good mother to Jessie she say she have a right to he I beg she to be reasonable to work with I but she say she would call the police and after that I do not remember what happen except she be reach for the phone and I must have hit she I do not even know I be so scared I just leave I just leave she there where Jessie find she when he go there hope to talk to her there be people I need to go get there be people that we need to tell I know you must think I be a horrible person let he take the blame for what I do but you see I think at least this way I can be there for he when he get out and now he will go into foster care and the only mother he be ever know will spend the rest of her life apart from he ask yourself Mrs Dubois would you have do any differently if you be in my shoe I will be right back so you ready to do this how do I get rope into this thank you I appreciate your support Bridge we need to talk to you about something be I in trouble you mind if I turn off the tv what have I do Hey Bridge do you remember when I take Angus to the vet the other day uh well it turn out angus be not really okay I be afraid he be very sick he do not have long to live yeah I know you know Sure I know the second I see he he be very old you know Bridge honey if you know he be go to die why do you ask if we could keep he Bridge honey why do not you say something because I know how much you like he daddy and I do not want to see you all sad I do not think I could 've handle it Aha can I and Angus

need it at home well do not stress about it you will go to work you will print out t fand you will see how can you be so calm I mean what choice do I have what would be so terrible if you open your computer and discover that you do have a new Danielle book what would be so terrible do not you find it at all disturb that your daughter may have take dictation from a dead woman what be the matter with I look at who I be ask what do that mean I do not know I just this be just one of those time when I think I would have prefer if they have inherit your allergy to ragweed I do not mean that I be just she just turn seven I would like to believe that I have a little bit of control over who her friend be who she spend her time with maybe you be jump the gun you know you may very well get to work turn on that computer and find you have nothing but gobbledygook that would be a tremendous relief be there any word from Scanlon her sister and her husband identify the body a couple of hour ago apparently he be a phd candidate at Stanford he start hear voice and see thing in 1997 he be do pretty good on med till 9 11 then he become convinced that he hold the key to some sort of code device so he go off his med so he could concentrate on his mathematical equation he would disappear for day pop up in other city she plead with he to go back on his prescription but he say that they interfere with his thought process his government work that be sad I be go to meet with the sister and her husband tomorrow I can not even imagine what they be go through hello Danielle choose not to play Danielle feel bad that day her smile be go her spirit wan her good friend have move away well darling there be no gobble in that gook Allison I I I do not know what to say I be late for a meeting I do not know what to say well what be there to say Oprah have a book club why should not Bridgette Joe hey think about it there be a lot of great dead author she could channel a new Hemingway novel a new Dickens imagine a Tale of Three Cities c can we discuss this tonight can we discuss this when I get home I suppose Danielle will keep and the author certainly be not go anywhere sure tonight thank you have a good meeting I will try nice of you to finally show up sorry it be okay nice people Jessica Delany 's very anxious to meet the woman whose good old fashioned detective work help she find her brother Jessica this be Allison Dubois she be the investigator who figure out that your brother be in Los Angeles I be so sorry about how thing turn out I be so sorry about your brother I appreciate that thank you um this be my husband David um can you hold on a minute I be sorry forgive I it be the mortuary you be um Agent 47 wake up Allison Allison Dubois you see he throw his brother in law off the roof of that hotel yes well no actually I see he throw David Carradine off the roof of that Hotel actually it be two guy he hire but I do not think that be an important distinction okay now I be confuse how exactly do David Carradine figure into any of this well I be not sure but my good guess be the night that David Delany 's brother in law die his spirit start send I message and unfortunately they be the message of a mentally ill man who be be off his medication for some time so the thing that he show I be the way that he perceive they the world that he live in he be the star of his own movie he be the superhero he be a man fight an unbeatable foe and of course he make himself look like a movie star I can not dismiss the fact that he cast his brother in law as the villain that in his mind in his delusion this be the man who betray he this be the man responsiblefor his death Delusion be the key wordere he do not look like a movie star or a superhero in life and he be not one and insofar as we can determine he be not do any work for the government be not actually crack terrorist code now I will happily ask but I be reasonably certain that the gentleman in that conference room have a perfectly logical explanation for where he be the night of his brother in law 's fall after all he be the one who be be support he for the last five year and accord to Jessica they be very close actually spend a fair amount of time together be this really something you want we to pursue I do not know you be right it be crazy he jump but it be just the movie 's always more interesting than the truth you see all that nonsense he be work on these be nice people they be already in a fair amount of pain I would rather not go in there and open this particular can of worm unless you be absolutely certain no no you be right we should not what be those personal effect we be hold onto they as possible evidence Jessica want the family photo a scrapbook and her husband want to hold on to the math the math the stuff on the wall he be a finance guy apparently he be fascinate by the stuff uh could you hold on to those for a coup ofor a coup so I could take a look at they the math I mean I be half hope I would read this stuff and convince myself it be all a product of Bridgette 's imagination but I just do not see she come up with word like wan I could not even finish it I be so she want I to come in there and read it to her okay okay what you really think this be okay Al I do not know I do not think I should be do anything to encourage all this all what if you really believe this come from the woman who write the Danielle book how lovely how flattering she hear our child 's pleafor more and she choose to answer it uh if you can not get your head around that that be fine too all it mean be that Bridgette be precocious she take the three booksthat she love and she write one for herself either way wait a second you really think that Bridgette might have come up with this herself kid have do crazy thing Hell maybe that be what inspiration be some original thought and some desire and a willingness to listento the voice of the peoplewho come before we Whispering to we and encourage we why be you look at I like that you think I be crazy right no I think you be brilliant I think you be beautiful I know you be crazy and I 've learn there be no point in argue with a crazy person where be you go I be go to read to Bridgette I will read to Bridgette I need you to look at something some stuff I broug what be this it be math I think you think I think like you think I be beautiful Danielle be happy once more someone new have move in next door Ariel be her name she have great toy and game Danielle would be lonely no more yay you read that really good Mommy almost as good as Daddy thank you honey so Ariel huh she be the one that make Danielle feel well yeah well it be a pretty common name Mom Mm I be sorry that I yell at you for use Daddy 's computer but it be Daddy 's and we should not play with it but maybe tomorrow I mean in case there be another story a writer want you to put down that would be really great Mommy 'cause I be hear story in my head all the time I bet you be give I a kiss thank you for the sugar oh no Joe it be bad than we think not only might she be a Touch Psychic I fear deeply that she may be creative you do not find another one do you come here I want to show you something what be I look at wait a second I 've see one of those before what be that it be call a pass code generator it be use with secure computer network the kind that big corporation with lot of sensitive datum have like bank and investment house okay right so let us say that you want to let your employee use the internet to access your network from home or when they be on the road obviously you be go to want to secure thing with a password a password that be go to change relatively frequently now what happen be that every few minute or so the company server send out a page to everybody 's pager or cell phone wow this sound terribly familiar now to guard against anybody intercept the page or the text message they issue everyone one of these one of these sorry right there be a program that be hard wire into this thing that run a series of fancy mathematical transformation ultimately kick out the new password the new password the real password for bank financial institution well that be what this particular model be for yeah of course if you do not have one of these and you happen to be a friggin ' genius then you can also do all of this you just lose I well all of this equal that okay one more time for those of we who have to repeat math in summer school he be calculate pass code what do you mean he be do the same thing that that little gadget do only by hand so someone somewhere could get into a computer that they otherwise could not get into Presumably be you just say something to I about Bridgette oh yeah yeah wherever that story come from I really do not think it come to her whole there be a lot of Bridgette in it I think she be just smart like her dad mm hey wait a second where you go that be just get good Jessica when your brother first fall to his death in Los Angeles after the local authority be able to identify he they all assume we all assume give his history of mental problem that his death be self inflict that he simply jump but since then some new evidence have come to light that would seem to suggest that he be push off that roof very much against his will I be sorry what be we look at here financial statement from an investment account under your wife 's name at the firm of Wile and Price I be sorry I be confuse do you not just tell I you suspect that my brother be murder what could that possibly have to do with my financial statement I assure you we believe there be a connection well I certainly hope that be true these record be private when I discover how they come to be in your possession David those document be provide to we by Wilke and Price they be more than willing to cooperate once we alert they to the possible irregularity in the account what irregularitie as you can see the account be open with an initial deposit of 50 000 today barely eight month later it be worth over four million that be quite a rate of return would not you say I I do not know what to tell you my husband be very gifted when it come to make money he just be but I still do not understand what any of this have to do with my brother we check with your investm from and discover damndest thing at 4 01 eastern time right after the market close on Wall Street whoever be handle your account would electronically access your holding and change they to reflect the day 's winner add some gainer drop some loser pretty good investment strategy if you can get away with it well I m baffle Darling have you be read your statement when they come in the mail I do not know whether the bank have make some kind of mistake in our favor or as you say for some reason somebody do do some thing but either way the money be not oursand naturally we will return it that be very gib of you no absolutely that be the right thing to do it be the only thing to do you be once an employee of Wilke and Price be not you yes as a Senior Vice President why none of you be suggest that I have anything to do with this that be absurd even if I want to manipulate my wife 's account how be I go to go about it I have no access to it I be no long with the company would not be that tough not if you have one of there yes but I do not when I leave the firm I surrender my pass code device so you see your theory make no sense unless of course you happen to have a brother in law with the mathematical skill necessary to defeat the security safeguard that the pass code generator be design to protect a brother in law who could be easily manipulate who could be lead to believe that he be not involve in anything illegal that in fact he be essential to the security of this country but what do you do with a guy like that a relative a guy who might talk maybe you could tell he that the government have a new assignment for he in Los Angeles Book he a room at the hotel make sure that he spend enough time there so that everybody see he talk to himself behave strangely so that when he end up a puddle on the sidewalk they do not even qusetion why Darling this be not true all of it be true I have nothing further to say until I speak with my lawyer that will not be a problem actually I have he wait outside I will bring he in Pardon I sir be you be David Delany 's attorney yes I be well they would like you to step inside now oh really and you be Allison Allison Dubois have we meet

only go to be till I get to the bank and it be not a fortune we be go to that cowboy joint down by the interstate which be pretty cheap how much uh forty Sixty just keep this between we do you see the price of a drink in this place it be okay it be a hotel we do not have to order anything we can just sit here yeah but why you ask I where I want to go all right lia if you be go to let I take you to a fancy place like this but not let I spend a dime on you then the least you could do be maybe not stare at other man do not let the suit fool you he be not really a man he just impersonate one it make it easy for he to steal your soul you know he we work together travel together for about a year he have a horrible temper but he be really good at what he do I think he would change I would change he but at a certain point you realize that be not go to happen and some day he might just get so angry he kill you Stupid Stupid stupid but you guy be over now right oh yeah definitely I have the audacity to suggest that since we work as a team we should get pay as a team and I should get my fair share uh huh he seem to think that live with he be with he sleep with he that be payment enough who be that he work with we too there be three of they what kind of work do you do high finance move money around it sound more complicated than it be Mm hmm okay uh I be sorry why be we here why be we do this I do not want to spend all night sit here stare at some guy that you say you be over no no you be right I be sorry it be not what you think see when we have our fight when he throw I out I never get my stuff it be still upstairs everything everything I own my i D my money my clothe everything I just I sort of think that with you here I might be able to work up the courage to walk up to he talk to he but I can'T he scare you that much you want I to talk to he no no that will not work he be not a reasonable person well what be you go to do I do not know I know he be get an important meeting tomorrow night before he get out of here and move on to nevada he will be out of here for hour uh what be you talk about you talk about break into his room Damnit he be come over here so let I ask you a question so what time be this guy leave his room tomorrow I can help the next person I think she be in on it sir our miss hostage I think she be still alive and the reason we have not find she be she do not want to be find because she be part of the gang that rob that bank I have a dream about her last night she be take a picture with her cell phone of the security guard while his back be turn away well that be hardly proof think about it it be be 36 hour not one single person have come forward to identify the woman in that footageas a love one cell phone picture huh actually sort of clever you plant someone in the bank to let you know when the guard 's distracted so that you can make your entrance at the most effective moment someone who will not put up a fight when you suddenly grab they and put a gun to their head help convince everyone you be serious ah it be it be a nice theory but where do it leave our headless corpse well nowhere except we can be reasonably sure that she be not our bank hostage and where do it leave our robber we still do not have a clue as to who they be or where they 've go not necessarily it be right where you say it would be and load with print Amelia purcell arrest twice for shoplift in 2002 almost have she again in 2004 for run a pyramid scheme out of her apartment but the charge do not stick suspect in a couple of identity theft case in 2005 she be a grifter a con woman here be the punch line turn out we have amelia purcell 's dna on file so we run it against the headless body in the morgue just to rule out any possibility that it might actually be she only the weird thing be it rule she in what Dna be a perfect match dead lady in the morgue be amelia purcell the suite be on the top floor room 1015 the suitcase be like a brown tweed with a tan handle be you sure you want to do this where do you want I to take the bag once I have it where you stay hello you be live with this guy and now you be not Lia when when I drop you off here at night when you go to pick up your car where do you go okay yeah you know what I understand you just meet I you know I well enough to break and enter for you but not to actually know where you sleep at night make sense to I Michael just wait here and you be positive this girl be dead for almost three day now well I be confuse do not you say that you see she outside of our house last night yeah that be just the thing I do joe I see she 'cause I see dead people and apparently michael see she because because like sister like brother I get that but be not you usuallypretty good at know one when you see one no not all the time no and this girl I see at night through the window at a distance and my brother he do not even believe in this stuff he never have so the possibility would not even cross his mind I wonder if she even know well that happen sometimes a person die so suddenly so violently they do not even know what happen they just go through their life wonder here on earth for awhile why everything feel so funny I do not get that would not you figure out pretty quickly what be go on once you realize the living could not see you anymore well that be just it maybe amelia purcell never get there 'cause the first person she see after she die could see she and have be see she ever since be you go to tell he you 've get to tell he how be you go to tell he no no no no no no no no oh you get to be kid I oh god I know how this must look I can totally explain I be I be just leave this out here for room service to pick up and the damn door slam shut behind I must lock automatically 'cause I can not get back in so here I be no key no pant ma'am oh god bless you God bless you you be so go to get a big tip Tan handle Brown tweed tan handle

Darling I swear there be nothing for you to apologize for just it would be nice to get a little sleep yeah Lee it be Allison I be sorry to wake you I need your help with something what be go on what

to I I tell you her cell phone do not work Allison look I think you be amazing but it be 4 00 in the morning and I be a homicide detective oh I know normally I would not bother you with something like this it be just after what happen today I do not know there must be some reason I see it it have to have some importance well that be fine but I guess I could call the highway patrol okay tell I anything specific you might have see describe the girl describe the car describe the road kill I now it be Sunday come on who the hell be call this hour on a Sunday hello that girl you call I about a couple hour ago you say she be drivinga silver sedan uh huh I think we find the car Trucker call it in last night look like it just run out of gas on the side of the desert highway about 40 mile outside the city what about the girl yeah well we find she too we be still wait to hear from forensic they think that he offer she a ride rape she and then strangle she be it just I or do this kind of thing seem to be go around I know I think the same thing what maybe it be break I be sorry you lose I I do not know when these girl pop into my dream it be like I be receive distress signal or something I see they alone they be in need of help they be not in danger of be kill wait you still see they you just you do not get the whole story that be the thing I feel like I do I feel like from the moment they come into my dream these girl their life be not in danger they be just stick they be stick on the side of the road need gas stick on an out of the way trail with a broken ankle so so how do he know how do he find they I do not know Luck maybe maybe we be jump the gun here Allison I mean we can not even be sure that both of these attack be commit by the same person I mean think about it some homicidal maniac get this lucky twice no I know you be right it make no sense it do not make it any less tragic but look like it be go to rain what do you want to do with the girl Mom I be ready come I be come you be late Ms Dubois we be go to have to mark you tardy I will have my mommy write I a note on Monday Fire when ready my mom be an investigator for the District Attorney the District Attorney be a lawyer who work for the people when someone be arrest formurdere somebody the District Attorney be suppose to prove they do it this be lucky because it seem like everywhere my mom go she be always find dead body a lot of time my mom 's instinct tell she where to be to find dead body just the other day my mom say ' let us go for a hike ' we never go on hike but oh boy Yep I be go to go get that hello Bridge good morning sir Mommy do not see dead body wherever she go sure you do do not you remember that be what you tell I no honey I never tell you that yes you do you say you listen to your instinct they tell you where to go and that be where the dead body be Al it be your boss hold on hello sorry to bother you on a wet Sunday but apparently the press be start to grab a hold of this thing and the deputy mayor be wonder if we could come in and give she a quick briefing on everything we know when do you need I they give he a name oh yeah why do they think it be one guy honestly I do not think there be a lot of actual thinking go on here although there be some reason to suspect that we may be talk about a single individual what make you say that it be not the great linkin the world but when we find that girl on the side of the Sonoran Desert Highway there be a large recent oil spot almost directly behind her car we check she under carriage and it be tight as a drum so we go back to Mariposa State Parkand would not you know it we find another large oil spot in one of the parking space locate in the lot close to where that sorority girl be find and that prove nothing Lee you know as well as I do that you can not even be sure that oil come from the same car as a clue it be worthless it be not like you can trace the oil back to its owner hey I be not tell you it be not a straw and I will be the first to admit that we be grasp here this be ridiculous have anyone look at a map do you see how far apart these two incident occur about 60 mile 60 mile in my opinion Ms Deputy Mayor the only responsible thing to do be to call a press conference and reassure the city that in all likeli hood these be two tragic separate and random act of violence commit by two completely different individual that the police department be do everything it can to find the guilty party but that we be not look at a murder spree be perpetrate by some psychotic Bad Samaritan hey this be Cindy leave a message Cin hey it be Taylor what be up so you know how my parent go away this weekend and I be totally psyche 'cause they finally let I stay home alone this time um well maybe it be not as cool as I think 'cause honestly it be kind of creepy be here all alone and I guess 'cause I watch this horror movie on cable that be hella scary and now there be all this lightning and thunder and this be go to sound kind of lame and do not even repeat this to anyone 'cause if you do I will like totally deny it but maybe you could come crash here tonight I know it be so weak but I just do not want to be here solo um so anyway it be 11 35 right now um you can call I at home not my cell it be 555 0178 555 0178 555 0178 555 0178 come on come on come on pick up H ello

be here just do not hang up keep talk hey early bird what you do worm catch he strike again 16 year old girl home alone I call she right before he get there then I call the police apparently he be just about to break in but she surprise he and he flee there be an oil slick outside her house at the curb it be definitely the same guy but that make no sense I still do not get it how do he find they it can not be luck three vulnerable isolate girl totally different part of the city three time in a row how could he have know that this last girl be alone nobody could have know that but you or somebody like I yesterday the Mayor 's office assure we that the kill spree be over that the two weekend murder have no connection today a third apparent attack and now a bizarre new twist in the serial murder spree that have all of Phoenix in a state of panic I be just lie in bed and this lady call and warn I to lock the door 'cause someone be come just like that out of the blue you know who she be well why do you believe her um I do not at first but then she say she work for the District Attorney 's office and it sound kinda serious and then she say she be go to send the police and a minute later the police be call and do you get this woman 's name um I only get her first name Andrea or Allison something like that who be this mystery caller your Action News Team have make repeat phone call to the District Attorney 's office and get no response and whoever she be how be she able to warn the young victim before the serial killer strike could it be that the District Attorney the Mayor 's office and the Police Department know more than they be let on stay tune every channel 's run a version of the same thing the paper be full of it too I just get off the phone with the Mayor everyone want an explanation I think we have to give they one hello thank you for come my name be Allison Dubois and I work as a freelance consultant and investigator for the District Attorney 's office there be be much recent speculation about who in the District Attorney'soffice call Taylor Greene to warn she that someone be try to break into her house and how this caller obtain this information you might be surprise by my answer luck I would be work late on of all thing the Bad Samaritan case and I be drive home from work when I pass Ms Greene 's house I see a figure lurk about the perimeter of the house and it look like a burglar so I call 911 they promise to senda police car concern about the safety of whoever might have be in the house I request a reverse phone number lookup from Ms Greene 's street address and be immediately connect to her home phone like I say luck but let I take this moment to clear up another misconception we can not be certain at this time that the man who flee Ms Greene 's house be the same person responsible for this weekend 's two murder naturally we be use Ms Greene 's description of the suspect and work in conjunction with the Phoenix police to help apprehend he thank you Mom you lie I do not lie we do not know that those three incident be the work of one man everybody have an opinion I have an opinion but since the Mayor go ahead and tell everybody that he do not thinkthere be a connection that be not what she mean you be not work last night you do not drive by that girl 's house why do you say that you do how do you know that that man would break in girl Mommy work for someone when you workfor someone Joe Ariel 's right I lie and that be really not something that I want to teach you girl and to answer your question I do not know I do not know how I know that man be go to beoutside that girl 's house I just do that happen to I sometimes I see something I just know thing I just sense thing I do not get to pick and choose what they be and I have learn most people do not understand it so it be not something that I talk about it be not something that I try to explain do you girl understand what Mommy 's say to you I know you girl know what I be talk about I think a little bit of what I have have rub off on you I know that you 've feel this thing but you have to trust I when I tell you very few people

match anything we have on file we reach out to the appropriate foreign government and they contact their law enforcement agency but it be go to be a while before anyone get back to we what I get the damned call from a friend in the coroner 's office their official report will not be out for another couple of hour but one of these murder girl do not quite fit the profile of your typical drug mule how be that when be the last time you run into a dirt poor girl from Latin America with a nose job excuse I one of these mule appear to have have cosmetic surgery a rhinoplasty and in the coroner 's estimation quite an expensive one in addition she be sport a very high end set of dental laminate not the kind of thing one would expect from someone so impoverished that they be willing to swallow capsule of heroin for money I be worried about you hello stranger I have another dream about you maybe I be the one who should be worried about you it be kind of nutty you be with this really exotic woman nothing nutty about that and she gouge your eye out with her thumb like those mule come on I be wait for you to say something funny back I do not quite know what to say I be at a loss for word Truth be I make all my exotic woman friend wear boxing glove ah ha ha hey I appreciate the tip oh hey do Deputy Doll ever get back to you wow First you gouge out my eye then you rip out my heart Overall I be very impressed with everyone 's presentation obviously everyone can not go to the State Assembly but ultimately that be not what this assignment be about ultimately I hope it give all of you a chance to learn about how the citizen of this country compel their government to create law that would protect and guarantee equality and fairness for everyone no matter who they be no matter what they look like no matter how much money they make this be great we be really proud of you kiddo I do not know what be there not to know huh you obviously do a great job but I do not I mean you see I do it the night before and the morning of well sometimes I can not believe I be say this sometimes it be not about that I could use a little help over here I think what your mother 's try to say be that preparation always count but a lot of time in the real world it end up be about the final product and I guess we have to assume that your final product your presentation be the good but it be not Terrence 's be well that be your opinion honey but apparently Mr Cathcart do not agree wait a second who be this Terrence be he some boy you like Dad I be just ask no no one like he he be not the kind of boy girl like he be kind of icky but his presentation be so good he be like somebody you would see on one of those boring cable show or something talk about history I just keep think that Mr Cathcart make a mistake well then you need to talk to he about it either he will convince you that you do a great job or you will convince he otherwise hey thank for come it be cold out Lee and it be late you kick I out of your bed this morning and then you call I and tell I to come over what be go on Nothing be go on you ask I if I could find out who might have do this thing you know I be work on it I get to ask you a question though do you know these girl you know their name their name they be mule I do not know their name they be recruit over there I mean whoever do this they take their passport they take their ticket stub we go through that hotel with a fine tooth comb and we could not find a thing wait a second do you know something or be you try to find something out I know this I know it be too early to be wage a war against whoever you think it be might be responsible you be confuse I what be you say I be say something be start to smell funny something catch the coroner 's eye this morning I do not think much of it at first maybe it be something maybe it be nothing what be you talk about I be not entirely sure all I know be something be not add up and I would hate to see a lot of innocent people die and a lot of blood get spill for no reason talk to who you need to talk to buy I some time let I get to the bottom of this what you know we could have have this conversation in bed someone I work with tell I to be careful with woman like you or I might just end up like one of your mule they should mind their own business I will talk to whoever I need to talk to I will try to calm thing down I appreciate it last chance do not tempt I Mr Cathcart Ariel come on in what can I help you with it be about the presentation the trip oh you know what I do not actually have the packet yet uh the permission slip and the information for your parent I be still wait for it to come from the central office uh no that that be not it um I be really surprised that you pick I Come sit down why be you surprised that I would pick you well I guess I just do not think I be the good what you think someone else 's be well whose Terrence Bock 's Terrence Bock you be kid that boy disgust I Terrence Bock be a very bright boy uh his research be very detailed I just look at he and I get depressed you know he be go to spend his life alone but a presentation be more than just the collection of datum you know its effectiveness often hinge on a lot of intangible but do he ever wash have you ever see he when there be not something in his nose Likability the attractiveness of the person make the presentation your willingness to listen to what they have to say he be repugnant even the word repugnant find he repugnant in all those area Ariel your work be vastly superior uh okay I hope I answer your question and I hope you be genuinely as excited about this as I be I think we be go to have a wonderful day at the Capitol uh sure Mr Cathcart hey you get a minute what be that expression fool I once good for you fool I twice hey what be on your mind I do not understand you should be a happy guy two day ago we all think we be stare at a drug war 48 hour have go by and nothing be happen I know that be kind of interesting be not it well I be just assume I mean you tell I yesterday you be go to talk to some people try and cool thing off you be right it be I I be a hero I make peace in the Middle East I should run for President you know what I have dinner wait for I at home so if you be not go to tell I what be on your mind I spend most of the afternoon with the coroner that third mule it be not just a nose job not just nice tooth she have piercing in place I do not know you could pierce not something you see a lot of in Latin America do not I have this very conversation with you yesterday sigh so what be you think an american girl in a foreign country down on her luck agree to swallow drug for the money to get back home maybe maybe she never leave home excuse I Pubic hair 's blonde do not have any when they bring she in you know how nail and hair keep grow for a couple day after I get a hunch her eye be blue but I guess we will never know that tell I where you be go with this somebody die by accident on purpose I do not know they need to get rid of a body as luck would have it their family happen to be in the drug running business so you slaughter two of your own mule girl that no one will ever miss you throw in a third everybody assume that they come from the same place do the same thing and while everybody be look for a girl from Latin America Jane Doe from somewhere in the US lie unclaimed in the coroner 's office something like that Mom can you come talk to I that Mr Cathcart the one who say those horrible thing about Terrence I be pretty sure he be not even in the room today you know what I be talk about do not you I do not know maybe Kinda I think it might have be his heart that you hear I think it might have be his soul okay but what do I do now I do not know what do you want to do should not we tell someone tell they what that deep down inside Mr Cathcart do not like Terrence how would we prove that what would we say so we just do nothing I do not say that do terence know how much you like his presentation no I do not talk to Terrence nobody I know talk to Terrence what I be listen to

do you have any pet a cat boot but I 've have he like forever he do not make these sound okay so you hear there sound yeah I would call out but no one would answer uh this would happen like three maybe four time a week so what have you do I do not think that there be anything to do I be not certain that there be anything really there so frankly for a long time I do nothing but then the noise start to change what do you mean change how well there be this clicking sound Clicking um a camera huh I be wonder if you think it sound like a camera um I do not know okay whatever it be there be

excuse I would you stand up please close your eye any question no and then he kiss I Hmm so what have you do I scream and then he be go and then I call the police and then the police come over and then I have no way of prove this but I think they laugh at I Whoa hold it you be I want to make sure I 've get this right you be not allege that this guy rape you strike you fondle you a man break into my apartment and he kiss I Miss Walsh you be go to tell I to change the lock move in with a friend buy a big dog can I see you Allison uh in private for one second what be you do to I what be I do to you should not the question be what be you go to do for that woman uh no I do not think so what be your problem she be clearly be victimize she come to you for help victimize a man keep break into her apartment maybe no not maybe base on what she be tell I the police who go into her apartment could not find any evidence of a break in and obviously there be no witness she be a witness I do not think so to what to the breaking and enter well it do not actually appear as though there be any breaking which would lead I to suspect that there probably be not any real enter either so what do you want I to do protect she from what this dangerous band of marauder and thief who may have break into her place and steal what a kiss what be you so hot about you do not even know this lady do not you just tell I you meet she ten minute ago I know what she be tell we be true I see it oh you be there and I see something else too a man who be serve a life sentence for a murder that I do not think

of a man name Sam Elkin no do not ring a bell why uh never mind no big deal I 've confer with Mrs Dubois here and we 've decide to post a visible police presence right outside your building they will

answer I would go over to her dorm she would not let I in that be when she get the restraining order I stay away for a month but then I could not take it any long I go over to her dorm chuckle lightly Damn near bust the door down her roommate threaten to call the cop but Amanda finally let I in Roommate take off and we have another huge fight and then a huge cry and then we make love I tell she I be go to find a way to pay for school I be go to do it she tell I she love I she miss I she be go to quit she be go to find a way to tell that guy that night that be the last time I see she next thing

still inside she when they find the body yeah they make up the night before he go by her dorm her roommate see he precisely he be in violation of the restraining order she take out against he not exactly the kind of thing you want to put in front of a judge in hope of reopen a case what if we could catch he you lose I well we know he like Kathleen so what if we can remove the visible police presence outside the building the squad car the patrolman be you suggest that we use this woman as bait we might be able to do it safely wire the place up so we could hear everything hide a bunch of SWAT guy we be already provide round the clock police protection against an intruder I be not convince even exist now we be talk about spend more of the taxpayer 's money to catch someone you think might have commit a five year old murder for which we already have someone in prison do not matter will not work unless Kathleen Walsh agree to stay in that apartment without a police car standing watch outside her building which I be guess might be a tough sell well can not we at least ask she it be 11 minute past 8 00 she might not have leave for work yet it be up to you hello Ms Walsh this be District Attorney Devalos I be sorry to bother you so early in the morning but we think we may have develop a significant lead in your case and I be wonder if I might be able to persuade you to let

the morning sigh you I and Devalos be suppose to meet at 8 00 a m would it be okay if we chat then sure now you be suggest we use this woman as bait well we know he like Kathleen so maybe we could

the man be be out of touch less than a day and while I have enormous respect for your intuition I be the one who ask you to be in that meeting I would prefer not to jump the gun here sorry to interrupt but I think you might want to hear this when I get back to my desk there be a message wait from commerce general bank still no action on the good doctor 's credit card but they do run a quick check on this other finance and discover something a bit unusual for instance no withdrawal but a lot of cash deposit over the past year or so pretty near once a week 12 grand here 16 grand there not enough to trip any bank alarm but it all add up to about a million dollar okay get well unlike their other account which be in the name of mr and mrs this be dr Bannister 's and dr Bannister 's alone I do not understand what could that mean it could mean he be be save up for a disappear act this be allison dubois I be marie 's mother can you hear I I be have a difficult time hear you I be

let this one go allison this afternoon I come this close to plow into a huge truck well no actually a huge truck come this close to plow into I I be a fraction of an inch away from death joe wait a second for real yes I mean I be fine there be no cut or bruise the car 's fine but I be inch away from death okay that be call a coincidence a very scary very unsettling coincidence I do not know there be this man in my dream he be the only person who could see I what do you mean what man 'cause I be dead so you could not see I the girl could not see I but he could see I he seem to know all about it he seem to be run everything I do not follow Death Death he be in charge of death he be death the angel of death okay again this be a dream allison and not a realistic dream obviously now that be what I think or that be what I hope but then this thing happen with the truck and I turn and he be there stand on the corner look at his watch like he have a schedule and I be on his to do list okay you be in shock you may still be in shock he be try to tell I something I mean not with word but it be like time up allison Prepare I mean it be funny that I vaguely remember leave the scene I barely remember pick the girl up from school I just I remember get home go into the room close the door and start to sob and swear to myself I would never drive again it be okay it be okay we be go

oh hello allison Good to see you again please come in take a seat clearly we be destine to do some business together give the way we keep cross path oh heaven you look disappoint might I suggest that you simply surrender to the idea it be inevitable I be afraid how do I know Allison like it or not by a hair by a second by luck by fate six time a day you come this close to meet the god to whom you pray sometimes you sense it like today when you manage to avoid that truck but more often than not you have no idea just how close you 've come to bathroom right outside through the waiting room and to the left be careful bathroom can be very dangerous place do you know that 47 of all accidental death take place in the home and that 61 of those happen in the family bathroom that be all right you go ahead I will get that what be go on hello Allison it be manuel devalo sorry to wake you at this ungodly hour but I just get a call that a body be discover at the viceroy motel downtown that match the general description of dr Dean bannister I be on my way over there now do you want to meet I there I I do not know Drive downtown would it help if I pick you up I can run the kid to school that would be great it be he Wallet be still in his pant all his i d plus about 400 buck so we be not look at robbery I be not sure we be look at foul play of any kind they find the body in there in the bathroom you would be amazed at how treacherous bathroom can be no I 've hear appear as though he slip in the shower crack his skull on the bathtub spigot he be be lay in there for hour with the water run on he the maid find he anybody talk to the desk clerk that be where it get interesting apparently dr Bannister check into the hotel at 7 00 the night before last alone just like he do every tuesday pay cash sign an illegible signature on the i d card so much for the tuesday racquetball game do the clerk happen to see who he might have be meet no but as he remind I in place like this you be actually pay not to see shall we take a look seem pretty clear what happen I guess when your time be up your time be up I think I ought to really drive over to dr Bannister 's house talk to his widow any way that you can give allison a ride home so she can pick up her car I do not want you to go out of your way just if you could give I a ride to city hall joe can pick I upon the way home yeah sure whatever work for you do you see any condom excuse I in the room back there do you see any condom or condom wrapper no but what do that prove throw they out flush they down the toilet maid clean the room after his guest leave where you go with this the bed be make perfectly they do it in the bathroom no the clothe be in a pile on the floor next to the bed so he do a little horizontal rumba on the bed go out for a bite to eat the maid clean the room yeah then he come back and take a shower since when do you become an expert on these matter I be just say he have limit time his wife think he be play racquetball she expect he home at 9 00 or so just do not make any sense to I what do not make sense to you I do not think he be with a woman what he rent a seedy hotel room so he could take a shower that be my point we do not know why he be there we be just guess until we know why he be there we can not be sure what happen to he sure we can he slip and fall in the shower allison Slips happen it be his time and when it be your time it be your time say who I I 've be think about the bannister case it be not a case allison these be case there be a crime there be a motive there be a suspect but I have those really so now you tell I you think some fiend slick up that tub so dr B would slip on purpose Sykes V Bannister turn out dr Bannister be be sue by the father of a patient name jeremy syke who die while under his care he be a cancer doctor allison lawsuit be practically part of the job description yes but syke go so far as to physically attack bannister during pretrial hearing I take it he think his son 's death be somehow bannister 's fault well apparently bannister be one of a handful of doctor treat patient with diathamoxin I know I have not hear of it either it be new it be from switzerland have not be approve by the fda so insurance will not cover it so syke think he be pay for a miracle cure and when he do not get it not only do not he get it but accord to the claim that syke file jeremy get precipitously bad after take this drugand die six month later you have a crime you have a suspect you have a motive I will tell you what the coroner 's report should be issue tomorrow why do not you and I take a ride down there if he give I some reason to think that it be not an accident I will follow up on this hunch of yours something else can you give I a ride somewhere it be so cool daddy I bet that the kid at school think that we be getting arrest one can only hope Detective scanlon let I turn on the siren it be pretty exciting could we do it again tomorrow yeah mom can you drive I to work abandon all hope ye who enter here not exactly dante 's inferno but close enough six month six week two year top and there be no hope for any of they there be an old saying the enemy of death be luck and hope it be not true by the way I be good friend with both I be go to let you in on a secret allison it be not about the archetypal construct of good and evil faith and hope life and the death it be about science math biology the politic of finance globle enconomic the cost of live versus the cost of die who can afford how much and who be willing to pay death be good death be necessary and with a little bit of planning death can even be a win win I honestly marvel at how passionately some people resist it take this case truly tragic be he go to die soon no damn it he be go to go into remission he be go to live a long and happy life I be afraid tell I have you have a physical recently be there any way I could come in today who be mommy talk to Doctor 's office if you do not have time for a full physical be there any way I can come in for like a mini checkup just to tide I over 1 30 today okay great thank bye good morning mini checkup I do not think they have those in our plan hey can I talk to you over here for a moment I be have a little anxiety about my health I do not see why what with all the extra walking you will be do not that you will not drive I be ask for your help what 1 30 you want I to drive you I will be at work allison I do not need you to take I Detective scanlon 's come to pick I up this morning to take I to the morgue I will probably get he to drop I off I just need you to pick I up around 3 00 so we can go get the girl be you listen to yourself one simple errand now involve a police escort and your husband take off work early could I take that as a yes be you sure I mean he could not have be hit and move into the shower to make it look like an accident not likely you see here how this fit the indentation in the skull so his injury be completely consistent with an accidental fall in the bathtub you would be surprised how common that be you be not take thomas road it be fast this be the intersection where I almost got hit by that truck oh my god that be he that be death huh what be you talk about on that bus bench death 's name be bob but I do not understand no one I know send I an e mail no one I know have my e mail address but I still keep get mail from people I 've never meet it be call spam sweetie it be like junk mail but it go through your computer but I do not like it I want real mail tell you what when I get into work I will send you something here thank you you still look at this guy I be go to call he why we already have an insurance agent besides I be not sure how I feel about buy life from death not funny I be go to buy anything I be not go to sign anything I be just go to meet with he get to the bottom of this thing what thing I be just go to say this allison you use to drive through that intersection every day so so be not it possible that you may have personify your anxiety about death about mortality about leave the girl leave I and give they a face his face you know what I take it back call this guy go see he but do yourself a favor and drive there why be you say this because if this guy be really death and your number really be up then it be up whether you drive or not but if this guy be just an insurance agent then you live your life in fear of something that might happen that be no way toive anything you need anything at all I hear there be aotor in flagstaff who might be willing to prescribe it if you have any trouble get in to see he you tell they your viatical be with I and there be plenty of money leave over for your treatment thank you mr Sherman it be my pleasure for everything of course I still can not believe he be go yes dr Bannister be a lovely lovely man oh you must be mrs Dubois the only inevitable thing in life be death taxis and my assistant catch the flu at the bad possible time I be just about do here thank you for see I on such short notice oh it be my pleasure you be one of the few mrs Dubois I can tell the few Most people think they be go to live forever but there be a few of we who realize that each moment could potentially be our last we be the one who prepare for the inevitable it be none of my business but the man who just leave Leukemia be he a patient of dr Bannister 's oh do you know dean no not personally I know people who be very fond of he pathetic way to lose one 's life be not it take a spill in the shower Pathetic but not uncommon I be afraid do you know that the average bathroom be one of the most perilous place on earth statistically speak of course I hear that how well do you know dr Bannister oh I write a policy for he and his wife several year ago and we become friend we use to play racquetball virtually every tuesday he that be he and the crime be he say they play racquetball Racquetball playing and the claim to have play racquetball both have be decriminalize in arizona for quite some time you be mock I I be try to reason with you the victim in question appear to have slip and fall in a bathtub that be heartbreake allison but it be not illegal someone anyone you can not stop the inevitable allison so why not hurry it along instead morning early bird what you do homework no I be send an e mail so one of your friend finally send you an e mail huh no I be write this company tell they to stop e mail I they be write like 20 e mail a day and I have no idea what they be even talk about there be usually something you can click on the bottom of the letter to get off their mailing list I 've do that I 've do that like ten time and every time they would write I a letter assure I that this be not spam and that they be write especially to I can I see some of these letter can you print some out Ariel you could be make big money buying and sell viatical Ariel why be not you profit from the easy money to be make in viatical Ariel want to get start in viatical we will show you how what be a viatical a viatical it be an instrument create to theoretically help people realize the value of their life insurance before they die you mean a way to borrow against it well sort of say you have a life insurance policy that pay out a million dollar upon your death but you need the money now to I do not know pay for an experimental drug treatment to keep you alive you can sell your policy to someone like sherman who agree to give you a couple hundred grand up front pay your premium plus give you a monthly stipend s long as you be alive well what be in it for sherman well he be bet that you die before he have to pay out the whole million and if you do he get to pocket the balance what a cynical way to make a living no wonder I dream he be death still do not make he a murderer I know but there be some connection and it be not just racquetball I see he stand in that motel room a wall of fire behind he welcome bannister well they be colleaguesof a sort one man administer the experimental drug treatment and the other help you pay for it what if the drug be bad I do not follow I have this dream last night I be in this hospital ward and this woman she be struggle against the drug she have be give turn out they be not drug at all it be just sand I still do not follow if your drug be bad you die quick right which be good for whoever buy your viatical be not it it be an interesting theory maybe I will have scanlon do a little research Research that be it well let us see how the research go and if we like what we see maybe we will play a little poker Poker with who Mr Sherman I appreciate you come down here in the course of investigate the death of your friend your client dr Bannister some question have arise about the nature of his medical practice my question really have to do with certain civil suit that be pende against dr Bannister prior to his pass I see I be hardly privy to everything about his practice but I will be glad to tell you what I know do you recognize any of the name on the list I take it this be a list of dean 's patient yes I do I do business with several of they by business you mean you purchase their life insurance policy be not that right provide viatical for they to pay for their treatment with several of they yes nine actually out of the 23 patient on the list out of the 23 patient involve in bannister 's experimental drug treatment you purchase the life insurance policy of nine be not that correct it be possible I do not have my record with I be glad to confirm that figure when I return to my office be I miss something here I be curious do dr Bannister refer these patient to you yes he do I be only too happy to help help I be confused the way that I understand it the quick these patient die the more you stand to profit everyone die and every business existsto make a profit now it be true mine may appear to be an especially morbid business but the fact be a viatical can be a godsend to a poor soul who be fight for his life and have no other resource still what you do be not exactly charity mr Sherman you do not really understand the business of die do you I be a homicide detective sir oh yes you know about death the messy aftermath the suffering but I be talk about the suffer itself detective I be talk about die a die man will do anything in his power to cling to the last shred of life no matter how painful his existence have become he will do anything give anything sell any thing all for a little hope and you give that hope yes I do and dr Bannister give they even more than that he give they result the man be consider something of a miracle worker you see that be the strange part that be the part that we can not quite figure out because for a miracle worker dr Bannister be have a pretty off year how do you mean of the 23 patient involve in bannister 's experimental drug program 12 of they die in the past nine month and of that 12 seven of they have sell their life insurance policy to you Seven you say I have no idea it be that many you want to hear another strange statistic accord to the record of bannister 's swiss drug supplier bannister purchase enough medication to treat ten patient last year remarkably he manage to treat 23 we believe that dr Bannister may have be dilute his drug that be absurd Dr Bannister be a brilliant compassionate man he love his patient above all thing well maybe not above all thing and as you point out everyone die eventually anyway the sad truth be it appear the good doctor 's patient pay full price for their treatment and be get medication that be only a third of the necessary potency with bannister pocket the difference I be sorry none of this sound like the man I know I mean really how much money could possibly be make by dilute a handful of patient ' drug it sound preposterous I agree which bring I back to the seven patient whose life insurance policy you buy and who begin die shortly after you start pay for their treatment be they just terribly unlucky or be you incredibly good at pick winner the two of you be quite a team be not you he would make sure the patient whose viatical you own start die a little quick and in return he get a cut of the payment be I be charge with something be that what be go on here I be guess from your collective silence that you do not have the evidence to support these absurd allegation of course not they be not true what active imagination you all have how dare you for god 's sake the man slip and fall in his shower you will be hear from my attorney have no fear your attorney will be hear from I I know how he do it Dr Bannister do not slip and fall by accident Sherman plan the whole thing Allison I see it he unscrew the spigot from the bathtub wall he smash bannister in the skull then he drag his body back over to the tub to make it look like a fall Allison you should have see he that cold bastard arrange bannister 's body so it would match the hundred of slip and sue case he be settle on over the year put plastic on the floor so their would be no blood for we to allison I believe you I believe you I be just not sure there be anything I can do about it the fact be forensic have already be over that spigot the bathtub bannister 's body they be all clean I do not understand then why would you believe I wh what be change your mind well after our meeting yesterday I have a thought I tell detective scanlon to go back to that motel and ask the desk clerk one more time if he remember see anyone that might have be meet bannister and to make it clear that we be not necessarily talk about a female I also ask he to bring along the ad from the phone book you have give I the one with sherman 's picture in it that he recognize turn out he be very familiar with sherman well what be we go to do now that be what I be try to tell you I already do it I tell scanlon to bring sherman back in for question he go over to his office first thing this morning oh my god that be great it be close excuse I his office it be close look like he get out all the important thing last night Scanlon go over to his house same thing there Bank account empty no forward number on his phone well where would he have go out of the country I guess Cayman island maybe they like american money who know he do it I think he do and I think for the moment he win it be just wrong joe it be wrong that this guy should cause

one of Larry Watt 's choice he believe she be go to vote to acquit her father do some jail time when she be young for of course a crime he do not commit of course now Watt think he have she in his pocket but the truth be she be up for grab so you get to her the jury 's go to vote your way do not seem fair do it what be that have you on my team sometimes I think it be not fair to the other side well that be my daughter Hey baby Ariel slow down I can not understand you you leave what in the car now well I be with my boss he be about to go into court I know it be a third of your grade but I be not the one who leave it in the car go I be appreciate the moral support but I be fine Ariel I will be there in a half an hour love you and I bet you be look forward to my opening statement be not you actually I be Imelda Vizcaina grow up in a remote town in the mountain of El Salvador a town so small it have no electricity there be nothing small however about this young woman 's hope and dream for a well life and it be those very hope and dream that the defendant Sean Redburn so cruelly exploit when he lure she to this country with the promise of a job of a well life what she find when she get here be something quite different what she find be a man who be sexually obsess with her a man bent on control she every move a man willing to use threat of deportation threat of violence and even the threat of death to keep she under his thrall over the next few day we will present overwhelming evidence that Mr Redburn murder Ms Vizcaina in a fit of anger use a knife take from her own kitchen we will present evidence of motive evidence of mean and evidence of opportunity what we will not present what we can not present be Ms Vizcaina 's body the defense will undoubtedly make much of this fact no body no crime you be go to hear that over and over again but it be simply not true the absence of a corpse do not mean there be no murder it simply mean that the murderer do his job well and his lawyer would have you reward he for that with an acquittal I would ask you to look at it as evidence of the cold and calculate nature of his crime you can right this wrong you can give her justice thank you Mr Watt do you have any opening remark I do your Honor Ladies and gentleman to be honest I be mystify why District Attorney Devalos have even bring this case to trial now why do I say that let us start with the fact that the investigation into the murder of Imelda Vizcaina have never result in the discovery of a body let I say that again there be no body and why because there be no crime Frankly the only crime be to my client 's reputation and the perpetrator be the D A himself as to what his motive might be I can only speculate all right Mr Watt Mr Devalos be not on trial here I apologize your Honor it be just that it make I angry make I angry that the state would spend the taxpayer ' money prosecute a crime that I do not believe be ever commit why leap to the conclusion that someone be dead if you have not rule out the possibility that they just go somewhere without tell anyone do anyone check do anyone try to find out where Ms Vizcaina might 've go for all we know she decide to leave this country and go back home to the remote mountain town that the district attorney so poetically describe now it would not be easy to track she down there but if someone try who know what they might discover I should know because that be exactly what I do I try and you will never guess what I find Ladies and gentleman of the jury may I present to you Imelda Vizcaina Alive that be impossible apparently not but what about the miss kitchen knife what about the blood what about she be alive Allison I see she with my own eye she be alive she can not be but she be we prosecute an innocent man the evidence do not mean what we think it mean we get it wrong all of it I be so sorry sir I base this case on what you tell I Allison you tell I Imelda Vizcaina be dead you tell I she be send you dream I think she be we have another problem after the judge dismiss the case Attorney Watt hold a press conference he insinuate that the reason I go ahead with this prosecution the reason I insist on bring it to trial be because I have a psychic in my employ a woman who talk to the dead a woman who see thing in her dream oh no People be start to ask question Allison oh she be still here give we another minute please all right but we do need to get ahead of this thing the Deputy Mayor be here because she be hear what I be hear we be about to be hit by a dozen or so Motions to dismiss I be not sure I be follow you every defense lawyer in town be try to find out if my psychic have anything to do with convict their client every case I 've prosecute for the past two year be go to be re open and re examine and there be a very real possibility when it be all over some very bad guy be go to be hand get out of jail free card Mr District Attorney Allison I be fairly certain that the mayor be go to ask for my resignation the one thing he be already make abundantly clear be our professional association yours and mine need to end today here now Al what do you do what be go on that phone have be ring off the hook for the past 45 minute do not answer that reporter call and lawyer call I keep see strange car drive by Mom Hannah just e mail I there be people be make fun of you on tv Mom Dad I just look out the window and see some people out on the lawn should I answer the door Daddy Al no come here Al hey whatever it be we will figure it out be the Gypsy there the fortune teller I always believe that I hear the voice I dream the dream for a reason I do not even want it I want to be a lawyer I know but it be not like you have a choice but I do Couple of drink no more voice no more dead people no more dream Stupid I could have drink my way into a really great life and I should have well I be go to take care of the kid so I be go to call the police and if you want I to bring you a bottle of gin with a nipple on it you just holler Ally Ally Baba that be Ally Dunham to you Time to get up oh Johnny do I have to this be why we be never go to have child I have the strange dream last night hmm what be that I think we have kid you be upset about something and you be go to get I some gin okay what be on the docket for today uh Redburn case seem like you be work on that thing forever when be it finally go to trial opening statement be in three day unless unless what District attorney want to meet at 9 00 I be guess it be to talk about cut a deal with Redburn avoid a trial altogether you think Watt will agree to take a deal Larry Watt can not wait to get this case before a jury what about you what be your day like pretty light Morning meeting with the board then I be have lunch with Tom Fenton to discuss broaden his investment portfolio do not you tell I he be on his way to Europe that must have be your other husband I be have lunch with Fenton at varium at one I do not know I could 've swear I hear you say that he be out of town Mr District Attorney I be sorry Allison Dunham I work with Larry Watt Junior partner Mr Watt ask I to extend his apology he will not be able to make the meeting today he ask I to take his place everybody at your firm understand that I intend to prosecute this case vigorously I intend to pursue the death penalty I think you will discover soon enough that everyone at our firm have a precise grasp on exactly what you be up to Mr District Attorney be that as it may Ms Dunham I be more than a little surprised that Larry Watt would choose not to attend this meeting himself much less send a junior partner if it make you feel well I be certain I will be make a full partner soon enough and for what it be worth I think the fact that Mr Watt send a junior partner in his stead speak more to his opinion of your case than it do his opinion of I really absolutely so now that we 've get to know each other let I tell you why I be here I know that your evidence against Mr Redburn be weak you certainly would not have call my office unless you want to discuss a deal so let us hear it Mr District Attorney what exactly be you willing to offer first degree manslaughter eight to 12 year with the possibility of parole after five why would we accept manslaughter you do not even have a body we have a murder weapon you have an allege murder weapon smear with the blood of the young woman your client murder really last I check the blood on that knife be too degenerated to extract any dna all that you have be a blood type and a very common type at that you certainly can not connect it conclusively to the miss woman and you can not connect it to Mr Redburn Hell you can not even prove he ever step foot in her apartment because you know and I know that he wipe the whole place down with bleach we can not even find the victim 's print in her own apartment fine you want to argue that Imelda Vizcaina vanish into thin air be my guest I be just not sure that the jury 's go to buy it I think they might whatever you say Ms Dunham please let Larry Watt know that this be a one time offer and it expire at midnight tonight to reasonable doubt reasonable doubt so you know what I think I think if Manny Devalos be propose deal like the one he try to sell you on this morning he be worry his case be not strong enough well he should be he be try to prosecute an innocent man well you may know that and I may know that but our job be to convince a jury which be why I wish we have something well to rebut this knife business with I 've be think about that I be meet with a potential expert witness about it this afternoon tell I let I see how it pan out first Quinton Vanessa stop it there ought to be a law if it be not my handsome husband your handsome husband who be trolling for a lunch date what happen to Tom Fenton well he have to jet off to Europe apparently that be weird Hmm I hope I be not interrupt what I say this morning no come on join we we have not even order yet listen if you two need to talk shop no not at all hey guy wait till we be in the car lovely child be careful what you wish for I be not wish for anything not yet maybe after I make partner if then so how long have you two be marry 12 year this spring we be college sweetheart very boring Boring Honey we be bring together by fate the star align for we that be what your grandmother say your grandmother sound like a remarkable woman More like the town eccentric actually well I do not know I I guess people think she be a little odd she trust her instinct she hear voice she would get message in her sleep she be the town eccentric in a very small town every time I move my chair everything go all fritzy any call uh Paul Haas return Jamie Mandlebaum call to say he be in court and unreachable and your Pilates instructor need to reschedule tomorrow fine what about my 2 00 it be five after what be he one of those absent minded professor actually I 've be here since ten of I be just do my part to fight fritz my firm 's handle the Sean Redburn case be you familiar with it Rich contractor stab his immigrant mistress to death it be be on the news a lot allegedly it be allegedly be on the news no I be fairly certain coverage have be ubiquitous no he allegedly commit a murder we intend to prove that he be be wrongly accuse do not the police have a knife with her blood on it they find a knife in that dump that happen to be the same brand and style as the set she own and there be microscopic trace that match her very common blood type yes I hear somebody see they have an argument and she have not be hear from since you strike I as an intelligent man Mr DuBois do you believe everything you see and hear on the news Couples fight I be sure you and your wife I be not marry you should try it sometime I highly recommend it ah see but there be the problem all the cool girl be take I see here you have a Ph D in mathematic Two actually say here that you write a book ah my scandalous expose about the secret language of number well if I may I would like to run some number by you have to do with the knife that you mention early accord to the city the waste processing facility where it be find serve 125 000 household now apparently the utensil in question be a very common brand accord to the manufacturer 's website it outsell its competition two to one well if it say so on the manufacturer 's website work with I these be just back of the envelope calculation but if let us say ten percent of those 125 000 household use this brand and household be define by the census as have four person in it we be talk about 50 000 people do you have any idea what percentage of the population have o positive blood no but I have a feeling that you be go to tell I almost 40 percent which would mean the blood on that knife could belong to any one of 20 000 people no assume your assumption hold up I suppose so how would like to earn 1 500 for one day of work who do I have to kill I need an expert witness to explain all this to a jury you want I to testify to your back of the envelope number 2 500 plus expense what expense you need a new suit I have a suit I know that but it be almost eight year old excuse I I be sorry my suit you just say that my suit be almost eight year old I buy that suit for my father 's funeral seven eight year ago how could you possibly have know that have you be spy on I I do not know the number just pop into my head besides you be a college professor why would you be spend money on new suit no I know it be just that you be so specific about how old it be I be think of a number from one to ten I be sure you be Dr DuBois I be offer you 3 000 all you have to do be tell 12 people what you just tell I that the odd that that knife come from Imelda Vizcaina 's apartment be 20 000 to one I do not tell you you tell I be that as it may run the number yourself make they your own as long as the odd you come up with be in the neighborhood of 10 000 to one I would very much like you to testify well I could certainly use the 3 000 um could I just ask you a question Ms Dunham of course assume the number that we discuss be even remotely accurate why be the police so convince that the knife belong to the miss woman unlucky coincidence I be afraid how be that well apparently these knife come in set of four when the police check Imelda 's apartment they could only find three what do you think about what about that you strike I a person with great instinct I would just be curious to know what you think I think you certainly could use 3 000 and I suppose a new suit could not hurt it be nice to meet you Ms Dunham Ooh Sleepy Night can you turn it down a little bit I just want to finish this chapter it be for work yeah whatever I just can not seem to shake it the blood the knife the body just seem so real do not look at I like that you make I feel foolish it be foolish I know Allison you want to be a great lawyer right great lawyer keep their eye on the prize the prize in this case be successfully represent your client dream about he commit the crime of which he be be accuse and then dwell on it while you be awake be not go to help you do that I know but why would such a thing even come into my head I do not believe it it be too perfect it be just too perfect Hell I be look right at it and I still do not believe it where have you find this a friend he be something of a connoisseur poke around in a lot of very obscure site Unbelievable excuse I Hope I be not interrupt anything no not at all what can I help you with well I be meet with that expert witness I tell you about I be wonder if you want to meet he no I can not Redburn be on his way in um I will look at your note when you be finish you boy have fun keep what you just show I to yourself but find this girl I do not care what it cost I mean hell if she be willing to do this for money I just want she here by the time we get to trial so as a doctor of mathematic Mr Dubois what in your expert opinion would you say be the odd that the knife in question belong to Ms Vizcaina oh I would estimate the odd be around oh no let us not estimate and let us not use the word around I need you to be very definite with your answer the jury want to believe you let they know you feel confident about what you be say be something the matter as a matter of fact yes I suspect that the reason I do not sound confident in what I be say be because to be perfectly honest I do not believe what I be say I be confused these be your calculation do to your specification base on your assumption none of which I agree with to be frank I think there be a very good chance that that knife do belong to Imelda Vizcaina and I can not help but suspect that you think so too Dr DuBois rest assure you have no idea what I be think maybe maybe not I just I trust my instinct you should try it sometime what be you do here why do you even bother come back be it the money be it the new suit I be a married woman Dr DuBois well there you go all the cool girl be take I be sorry that I could not be of any help what do you want I to say Allison I want you to tell I I be not crazy I want you to tell I my feeling my impression my dream count for something and that I should listen to they act on they John J D Allison I have a 40 million client sit a restaurant by himself drink within 50 foot of three of my competitor what do you want to hear that I think you be Nostradamus grow up do your job we will talk about it when you get home Allison yes be we through yes we be through I be go out for awhile be you sure you do not want to take an umbrella they say it be go to rain what be I think Ms Dunham you be soak come on in no answer I what be I think you be right I know he be guilty how do I know that I know nothing about math but I read your book and suddenly I understand everything I leave your phone number at the office but somehow I know exactly how to get here to this house to you and now that I be here everything seem so completely familiar I I do not really know what I be do here I be do what you tell I to do I be follow my instinct and my instinct tell I I be suppose to be here with you just forget the last five minute of your life you all right what be you do hi oh my God it be morning I have to get out of here I have to go Huh why what do you mean I have to tell my husband what Mommy we be hungry oh my God my baby come here my beautiful baby I be home oh I be home I be home um excuse I who be go to drive we 'cause I tell Hannah I would meet her early so we could work on our history presentation wait a second Allison I be begin to think you forget about I be not there something you want to speak to I about before I head into court one of the juror or something actually sir there be a lot I need to tell you before you head into court do anyone check do anyone look for her do anyone try to find out where Miss Vizcaina might have go for all we know she decide to leave this country and go back home to the remote mountain town that the District Attorney so poetically describe it would not be easy to track she down there but if someone try who know what they might discover I should know because that be exactly what I do I try and you will never guess what I find like I say lady and gentleman of the jury you will never guess what I find there a problem Mr Watts be you go to continue or have you conclude your remark uh if I may your Honor I would like to request a short recess very well this court will adjourn for a half hour recess what the hell happen I be not sure yet excuse I Larry we should talk amazing what people will do for money if they be desperate enough but then that be what this whole case have be about have not it they both look remarkably like Imelda Vizcaina to I actually this one be Imelda the other girl be Mirabella her twin sister unlike Imelda Mirabella never come to America she stay behind in El Salvador spend her entire life there it be where this movie be make actually well you certainly know your central american porn Manuel I get to give you that apparently Mirabella be hold up at Phoenix Airport this morning try to use her sister 's paper to enter this country she be be detain until we can determine whether she have any ulterior motive for travel to Arizona today Ulterior motive her sister Imelda be in this country illegally no government agency have her fingerprint and none be ever recover from the apartment if somehow Mirabella have manage to make it to the trial today and if for some bizarre reason she have choose to identify herself as her sister to the court there would have be no way for the prosecution to prove otherwise for all intent and purpose it would have appear that Imelda Vizcaina be alive and well and we would have have to drop all charge against your client and you can imagine how embarrassing that would 've be for I Grandma Allison what be you do back here do not you just leave Grandma I change my mind go back to sleep do not worry about the pie I will be here in a minute with J D I will get it what about the burn your arm that scar I do not care about the scar it will fade with time I think I actually kind of like the

teacher and a school counselor I teach art Mr and Mrs Dubois I be not a prudish man and if I be teach a life draw class to a group of college student I might be incline to laugh this off but the fact be Bridgette be a ten year old in a fourth grade art class and this be the second time in two day she be draw a vivid portrait of I her teacher I do not know what to say Mr Enright this obviously be inappropriate and we be very sorry I appreciate that and please understand she be one of the most imaginative student I 've ever have the pleasure to teach I adore have she in the class but I would be lie if I say the last couple of day have not be disturb to I so that be why I ask Mrs Tharp to sit in with we Mr Enright and I think that perhaps Bridgette could use the benefit of a few session with I you think that Bridgette need to see a psychologist because of this the drawing be rather graphic we just want to find out where Bridgette get the impulse to make they to see if she be be expose to anything that could have cause this preoccupation with the naked form wait a second she have not be expose to anything and this be not a preoccupation it be just a kid use her imagination Bridgette need a lesson in what be appropriate and not she do not need to go to therapy with all due respect you be not the subject of the drawing Mr Dubois I be I be not sure I agree with your assessment I be not sure that you know my daughter as well as you think Mr Enright Mrs Tharp we do appreciate your offer I think we will to speak with Bridgette ourselves before we take you up on that Mr Enright I be sorry for any kind of discomfort or embarrassment that our daughter may have cause you we will make sure we speak with Bridgette and let she know that these kind of drawing in school be not appropriate absolutely and I promise you this will never happen again hi kiddo how you do okay I be sorry hey it be okay sweetie we be not mad at you but you need to stop draw picture of your teacher it be make he uncomfortable well I do not want to draw another picture of Mr Enright I just feel like I have to what do you mean you have to I do not know when I close my eye I see he in my head and I just know that I have to put it down on paper maybe Vridgette 's not the problem here maybe it be that teacher we should be worried about what be you say this be Mr Enright 's fault I do not know all I know be that she go in his class and then she feel like she have to draw he without his clothe on why what be go on in this guy 's head what kind of I do not know energy be bridgette pick up on what be you say Mr Enright 's put in some kind of naked energy I do not know but we should talk to the school and get she transfer to another class okay good luck with that conversation you would well make sure that you have your fact straight if you be go to accuse somebody of put out a naked vibe make sure you have all your duck in a row how you can just dismiss this I be not it will pass Joe I ask Bridgette specifically do anything inappropriate happen anything at all that make you feel uncomfortable she say no it will pass whatever it be that be make she want to draw these picture it will pass if we make a huge thing of this we be just go to make Bridgette more confused than she already be all right you get I think I just take a look at our file on Nathan Cafferty 's accident unfortunately it turn out the city destroy both car about a year ago we will not find any dna to help we figure out who be drive that other car but I do find one interesting thing turn out our friend Joel have a record arrest in ' 02 for car theft and again in ' 04 for check kite although how that prove he kill Nathan Cafferty I 've no idea what about the paper maybe you should check the paper what paper the paper from the accident scene they be everywhere there be hundred of they I see Joel touch one of they if they be in the evidence locker we should check they for fingerprint I be look at the report right here and there be no mention of any paper it be just two car and one dead body I think you be focus on the wrong case our boss ask we to help solve the murder of his friend 's sister you be try to prove her husband commit manslaughter you should just stick to the case at hand just a suggestion tell I about the first time we make love we be stay at your parent ' house you snuck into the guest room to join I you be worried about getting catch but then you fall asleep in my arm your mom wake we up in the morning but she do not seem that mad how do we celebrate when you sell your first novel we book a presidential suite at a resort we could not afford and we order room service all weekend I be I have a difficult year I be go through something the miscarriage you be almost three month along no one know but we we be just about to share the good news with our parent we even have name pick out Courtney if it be a girl Peter if it be a boy when you call I I just I just could not believe that anything you be say could be true that there be any chance you could be who you say you be that there be any possibility that we could be together again it be I Gabby it be Nathan I 've come back to you and I promise I be never go to leave you again Mrs Dubois hi I be sorry I know it be early I do not call first no no it be fine what be on your mind the night before I meet you I have a dream that that I could not understand it be about a man who die a long time ago only instead of his soul cross over it make its way into this other man well I guess that be why I be here the more I come to learn about your family the more sense this dream start to make after Nathan 's accident there be day I do not know how I would carry on or if I even could carry on but then just when I be ready to give up Joel Tiernan appear imagine lose the love of your life but then before you would even begin to start mourn the loss get he back be spare the lifetime it would 've take to get over that loss it be it be a miracle nothing short of a miracle surely you of all people can appreciate that do Nathan ever talk to you about what happen the night of the accident he ever tell you how exactly he might have cross path with Joel Tiernan no no all he remember be the screeching of tire nothing after that and in regard to Joel Tiernan neither one of we remember ever meet he we try to investigate his life after the switch but as it turn out there be not much of a life to investigate no family no friend to notice Joel behave differently I can only imagine what a comfort it must 've be to have your husband your real husband by your side when you get the news of Robin 's death actually I be by myself when I get the news I would go to an event that night Joel could not go and so we do not see each other until much later but it be difficult for Joel too I think he love she as much as I do Bridge I hear a rumor you be not dress yet just leave I alone come on come on it be get late I be sorry daddy what be you sorry about honey what be the matter I know I be not suppose to but I could not stop Joel Tiernan be Nathan Cafferty that be what you be tell I I know how this sound no I do not think you do it sound insane Allison you be tell I that the essence of my friend 's dead husband somehow find its way into the body of that man Joel Tiernan and that therefore we should question Joel Tiernan for the murder of Gabrielle 's sister they be have an affair she threaten to tell with who on whom be she threaten to tell they be one and the same I think that be a tough sell to a jury Sir I be tell you Joel tiernan be drive the car that kill Nathan Cafferty that night Joel and Nathan be within yard of each other when Nathan 's soul leave his body but instead of go wherever it be suppose to go it do what it just make its way to the near warm body and take up residence be that really what you think I know that be what his wife think can not we just bring he in here and ask he where he be the night his sister in law die you mean no one ask he that no one have ask he anything no one think it matter in the past 24 hour a theory of evidence have emerge it be unconventional to be sure but I be just curious as to whether you might have a point of view about it Mrs Tiernan Gabrielle recently speak with Mrs Dubois here and share some very interesting thing about the nature of you and your wife 's mutual attraction my wife my wife be very spiritual she have some rather romantic idea about life and death I be not sure she be entirely over the loss of her first husband I suppose inevitably appearance aside I have some thing some trait in common with Nathan and I be sure Gabrielle interpret those similarity well with a a romantic 's heart a romantic 's sensibility I hope you do not think too badly of her it be one of the reason I love she so anything else there be one more thing do you happen to remember where you be the night that Robin be murder of course at home in bed sick Gabrielle have this charity thing really want I to go with she and meet some of her friend but I just could not get out of bed then she get that horrible news and we be not even together and I mean we be always together be anyone else home that night a cook a maid would that be a no yes that be a no be you head where I think you be head I barely know Robin I just barely marry her sister why in the world would I want to do she any harm on the morning after Robin be murder the police find a a spot of blood at the crime scene that be not hers yes I know it be in all the paper so so we be wonder if you would mind give we a blood sample it would enable we to rule you out Mr Tiernan actually I be embarrassed that this be not attend to early it be a simple request and I would infer nothing from it other than it would allow we to do our due diligence and we could look your wife in the eye and tell she we have leave no stone unturne so Mr Tiernan can detective Scanlon take you downstairs be that a no yes that be a no I will not participate in this farce I will not have my privacy invade so you people can grasp at straw and most importantly I will not put my wife through the embarrassment and the humiliation and the pain of know that she please for help in this matter have yield nothing but the most cynical and simple minded idea about who might be responsible for her sister 's death be that all you know I can compel you to give we that blood well by all mean call the family lawyer Gabrielle will give you the number I be leave now I let go of the contractor that we hire to I be home anyone want chinese build the floor model for trade show that sound good we will take new bid in next week see you in the morning hi you be back early actually I work from home today you be in meeting and I need to make an executive parental decision after I make it I do not see the point of discuss it until you get home discuss what she be upset embarrassed I could not force she to go to school what you could not bring yourself you be not here you do not see she she say she could not help herself now I think we should just keep she away from school ' til this thing pass you want she to miss more school as a matter of fact I do I mean people do it all the time kid get sick they stay home but she be not sick she be not sick Joe this be happen for a reason she be draw these picture for a reason she can not just miss school 'cause we do not know what it be what if we never figure it out wait a second what be this what be what I do not know this spot on Mr Enright 's chest I do not know it be his you know his nipple no I do not think so look there be only one and look it be on all these she draw it on every single picture be it grow it look like it be just change shape look this one be like a little circle and then here it look like an x maybe she be not just draw Mr Enright maybe she be diagnose he the city of Phoenix mourn today as one of its favorite son renowned author Nathan Cafferty be lay to rest Mr Cafferty whose net worth be estimate at somewhere between 15 and 20 million be kill last week when his car be strike head on by another vehicle he be survive by his wife Gabrielle who insist that rumor that her husband be work on a new book at the time of his death be to the good of her knowledge untrue our friend often comment that we make an odd couple Gabrielle and I she believe with all her heart that there be far more to this universe than the so call scientist would have we believe I of course do not to the casual observer it may have appear we have little in common but faith as it have often be say be feminine even the cynic who believe in nothing can find a girl who believe in he I be wrong Tiernan be not walk around with the soul of Cafferty inside of he he be walk around with Nathan Cafferty 's autobiography I beg your pardon remember I tell you that I see page rain down from the sky the night of the car wreck I think that be what it be it be Nathan Cafferty 's autobiography Joel steal it before anyone else could read it that be how he know so much about he that be how he could convince Gabrielle that he be he he have a a virtual manual on how to be he I be sorry I know I tell you that Joel be Nathan I be wrong I fall for the same scam Gabrielle do the only thing I do not know be if Joel Tiernan be always Joel Tiernan why would he kill Robin Aaronson maybe because he do not kill her Allison what Lee bring this in a few minute before you arrive wait a second who be this Arthur Kolber work at the cottage where Robin Aaronson be beat to death I be do my due diligence on the hotel staff when I find out Kolber sexually assault a female friend two month ago I have the lab compare his blood with the drop that we find at the scene of Robin Aaronson 's murder and guess what a perfect match Kolber claim he cut his hand do repair at the cottage but I do not buy it I be pretty sure this be our guy wait a second even if he do not kill Robin what about everything he be do to Gabrielle can not we get he on that on what Gabrielle be a full grown woman if she want to believe she be marry to the ghost of her dead husband well there be no law against that on the other hand I would be lie if I say that I do not think that Joel Tiernan be hide something but here be the thing I already owe the man an apology for accuse he of kill his sister in law I can not also accuse he of perpetrate one of the cruel hoax I 've ever hear of especially without proof you do not have any proof do you yeah well I neither I be sorry I do not get it your daughter have do maybe a dozen more explicit drawing of I and you want to talk to I about this dot I be not so sure that it be just a dot I think that maybe it be a mole all right a mole so so do you do you have a mole on your chest one that be you know in roughly the same spot as these you know what I do not really know I 've get quite a few Most adult do I know but I be talk about this one you see how it be change shape in the picture see it be like grow I do not mean to alarm you but I think that you might want to see a doctor Mr Dubois with all due respect to your daughter these be doodle now be you seriously suggest that I have myself test for skin cancer because of your daughter 's doodle actually I be Robin you in there the door 's open I get here as fast as I could so why would you make I drive all the way out here hust to talk to you what be this place this this be our place it be so good to see you again baby Robin what be you do why be you dressed like that stop what be the matter I can not do this with you I mean I be flatter do not get I wrong but I could never betray Gabrielle like that that be funny you never have a problem with it before Nathan what do you just call I Nathan that be who you really be be not it Gabrielle tell you yeah she tell I she tell I all about you of course if you be really Nathan you would know about our little secret would not you you would know that you buy I this négligée and you would know that this place be where we use to meet to make love to betray my sister but you do not remember anything about we do you because you be not Nathan you be a fraud a parasite wait a minute you have it wrong shut up stop lie I do not know how you trick my sister but I will make sure she know the truth I be go to tell she everything your sister love I Robin she be happy you should have leave we alone Mrs Tiernan I be hope I could speak with you I be not sure we have much to talk about not unless you be here to apologize for the way your office treat my husband no that be not why I be here obviously he do not write about the affair in his autobiography that be why Joel do not know about it so when Robin threaten to expose he he do not really have a choice but to kill she or he lose everything no you be wrong they find another man 's blood at the crime scene a man who work at the hotel he tell the police he cut his hand I can not prove it but it think he be be honest with we the truth be I can not prove any of this but you come to we you tell we you want our help and I think you deserve to hear the truth even if a jury never do even if it hurt Gabrielle he be go the man you love be go and this man be not he Gabby I be back welcome home Nathan it be okay you do not have to pretend in front of Mrs Dubois she know who you really be what be she do here after all I 've be through with the D A 's office why would you let that woman in our house she come here to talk to I to tell I some thing about you some theory she have about you what kind of theory why would you listen to her we 've be together nearly two year what could she possibly tell you that we do not already know well that be a great question Nathan you do not mind if I call you Nathan do you you know what I be just flip through a couple of your book this morning they be beautifully write Mr Cafferty you really have a way with word and a very particular style you be a wonderful writer thank you anyway I know this be go to sound like a strange request but we be wonder if maybe we could get you to sit here and write something right here right now now why would I want to do that well why would not you want to do it you know it be it be funny in the two year since you first walk in that door I have not see you do a single stitch of work I have not see you write anything and Nathan I mean the original Nathan he be forever write thing read thing to I show I thing so do it for I again Nathan like you use to can you even type I think I would like you to leave my house now Mrs Dubois actually this be my house and I would like Allison to stay she be invite some of her colleague over they should be here in a minute Mrs Dubois seem to think that if the police take a look around the the property they may turn up that manuscript that she say you take from Nathan 's car we turn the place upside down so far we find nothing I will give it more minute but I think it be just about time to pack it in so that be it he get away with everything everything except Gabrielle she ask if we would escort her husband from the premise after we be do we might not be able to prove Joe Tiernan 's a murderer but at least we get he out of her life be the girl down two out of three Bridgette

courthouse in Sacramento California it be one of the first case of domestic terrorism in this country seventeen people die Mitchell Slocumb write a letter claim credit for the bombing then he just disappear that be until now you okay yeah no yeah I be just I be surprised anyway this man 's death be go to be big news so before I talk to the medium I just want to make sure you do not have any new insight into who might have kill he although to be perfectly frank I be not sure if I prefer to prosecute his murderer or recommend the guy for a commendation so nothing you feel well today yeah thank you can I have a word with you I start build that bomb two day ago just hour after I see his body I have to believe that be more than just a coincidence so you think maybe that he be use you to take care of some unfinished business he blow up a federal courthouse in 1985 I work in a courthouse I drive my car into a courthouse garage every day but you have not call I so I be assume you have not feel the need to buy anything build anything collect anything what be you do if we can not be absolutely positive that Mitchell Slocumb will not get into your head again at least we can make sure you do not have the means to buy any more fertilizer for he a gallon of gas you all right I be fine it be a bad habit Debbie think I quit if she know she would kill I you sure you be okay no I be okay it be family stuff it be just it be family stuff Explain do not lie to I do not lie to I do not tell I it be not you you will just make it twice as bad if you lie to I I think he deserve a decent burial I give he what he deserve Arlo I try so hard to raise you right look at I all you do be disappoint the problem with you son be you keep forget we be at war here I I get this to remind I I see it in the mirror every day and I remember crawl through the mud and the puke at Khe Sanh I remember my boot fill with the blood of young american boy whose daddy either be not rich or white enough to keep they out of a racist classist draft I remember the stink of their corpse know that they die for nothing Dad what be you do like I say Arlo we be at war now you will have something to remind you Dad Dad it be nice see you again Allison I hope the next time you meet Debbie you will keep my secret Somebody be be awfully quiet all night well somebody be in a real quandary oh really you think so have you not hear anything that I 've say yeah I get it he be a smoker I I be willing to look past it you know that be not what I be talk about seriously because I do not think the other matter really yeah really let us say that you be right let us say that Mitchell Slocumb really be David 's father so what do that change who he be be I suppose to think less of he for something that his father do change your name so people will not hold what your father do against you be that a crime boy you really do not get it no Allison I think I do as psychic dilemma go this one 's pretty cut and dry if David Brewer do not want anyone to know who he be then that be fine that be his business I get it we do not h he do not have to tell but Joe I think I have to ask I know that Slocumb be a monster but it be my job to find out who kill he you think it might have be David well I do not know but if what I be see be true in addition to kill all of these people Mitchell Slocumb be an incredibly abusive parent that do not make David a killer and look let us not forget we be not absolutely certain they be father and son you should have see he outside of your office it be right after the news hit that we identify Slocumb David be tremble when I ask what be wrong he say it be a family thing well maybe it be how do you know maybe he have a fight with his wife I be sorry I know that you really like he but I need to tell Devalos what I know and he be go to question he Allison we be not talk about somebody that I that I like here we be talk about the only person that I 've hire so far he be like half the company it take I three month to find he I know I want to be the one to talk to he first if he be go to get haul into the DA 's office because he have the bad luck to work for I then I want to be the one to explain it to he David thank you so much for come yeah like I have a choice I be bear Arlo Slocumb Mitchell Slocumb 's my father be my father so what do you want to know I be not go to be able to tell you very much I move out before I be 17 as soon as I turn 21 I change my name I I do not think I have any light to shed be that as it may I do need to ask you some question the most important being can you account for your whereabouts Monday night you mean the night that my father be kill yeah but no I mean I be at home but there be no one there with I what about Debbie your kid they be visit with her sister in Flagstaff be that the work theory you think I spend 20 year hide that I be his son so I could come back and kill he and become notorious for it I do not know how to prove it but I do not even know he be in Phoenix until I see the online report that he be dead I be afraid that be not good enough Mr Brewer I 've get to find a way to substantiate your alibi even in death the man be complicate my life so what be next how do we do this it be pretty straightforward stuff we fingerprint you look around your house for a murder weapon talk to some people who know you oh man look I get it I understand what you have to do I get it I all I be say be just please be sensitive to my situation be discreet I 've spend a long time build a life as David Brewer I have a wife I have two kid who have no idea that their grandfather be a mass murderer I have a professional reputation to protect we understand Mr Brewer we will do our good Mom Daddy 's on the tv Daddy 's on the tv I be try to find cartoon but all the channel have daddy on they instead Mr Slocumb be it true you 've be live under an assumed name since the 1980 I have nothing to say about that see the news see it Lee my God this be terrible this man be a friend he work for my husband we give he our word how do the press find out someone must have see my report make a call I be guess money change hand that poor man all he do be ask we to protect his privacy you ready for the punch line it be all for naught we find the man who actually kill Slocumb Name be Donald Wright he run with the same rightwe nut job that Slocumb do turn out the two of they have a fight over money end with Wright take a pipe to his buddy 's skull David 's completely innocent we question he for nothing I be afraid so I wonder if it will be any consolation to he while the medium 's pick his life apart no okay no I yeah I understand look if there be ever anything that I can do for you I be so sorry I really be David what what now he just quit they be move oh God no somebody throw a rock through their window he be be get threaten phone call all night the police have a car park outside of his house but it be not like they can stay there forever he just want out of here and I can not blame he I do not understand what be all this if he be innocent why be I be show all these thing so I can ruin the life of a good man you get I Al Dad I have something I want to show you what the hell be that I find one of those new microwave oven over at the dump it be pretty smash up but the inside still work it give I an idea see this be a timer you just set it for however long you need to get away and this this thing get really really hot you take all this you put it in a vehicle fill with gas and and an oxidizer Oxidizer what be an oxidizer Fertilizer you take 20 or 30 bag of fertilizer and what well I think you could blow up a building that be beautiful son I could never build something like that not in a million year you always say you want to change the world Dad now you can oh my God what be you up to now I be fine I be fine I be not build anything I be not blow anything up I be just try to find here it be from a 20 year old microwave I completely miss the point I have no idea what you be talk about the point of what the dream the compulsion they have nothing to do with Mitchell Slocumb try to get I to blow up another courthouse it have to do with see how the bomb really got make so I could understand who really make it what do you mean who really make it Mitchell Slocumb do not build that bomb Joe his son do remember that night he come over he hand I that bottle of wine as soon as I touch it I see these image these flash of picture face I really do not understand it at the time but now I be start to think there they be there be 17 of they I be start to think that I see they 'cause they be always in his head he be haunt by they okay so let us say that you be right what be you go to do it be 23 year now the only other person who be there be dead how exactly do you go about prove any of this I mean what do you do with it I do not know how do you do it how do you live with yourself how do you live with it day in and day out with 17 people 's life on your conscience I do not know what you be talk about they be not on my conscience my father detonate that bomb my father kill those people your father figure out how to use microwave oven part to build a detonator you father know to use gasoline and fertilizer ten year before Timothy McVeigh and the Oklahoma City bombing your father who drop out of high school and go right into the army I think I would like you to leave now I know you build it I know you make it I know you give it to your father and he drive it to California and he murder 17 people 17 people whose picture you see in the newspaper the next morning 17 people whose face be etch in your mind whatever you say but see as how there be no police car flood this driveway I do not see how you be actually able to prove that well you be right I can not prove it but the 17 people who die that day the people who love they they really deserve to know what really happen they they know what happen a misguided fool with mental problem set off a bomb and if it have not be that bomb it might have be another Dynamite steal from a construction site or a war surplus hand grenade be that how you excuse what you do by the way I think your math be a little off 18 people die that day a badly damage boy name Arlo Slocumb he die in that blast too and out of his ashe David Brewer be bear and while David Brewer may sometimes think about some of the thing that Arlo Slocumb do it would be an unspeakable tragedy for he to go to jail for that boy 's crime I mean what would be the point of destroy one more family Sweetie we really need to get go I will be right there I be sorry that we be not go to able to have that dinner Allison I really think you would

complicated hold on I be not annoy but I be skeptical and I guess I do not understand why you be not what be there to be skeptical about the doctor say that I I would probably experience a traumatic event well I can not imagine anything more traumatic than mow another human being over with my car all right Allison but you can not be absolutely certain that you do it it be not like you see yourself mow he down I do not need to see it obviously I be be spare from see it maybe maybe I do not know why would you be chase a man with your car do not that sound out of character for you I need

shop well I suppose so and I know we have not find your car just yet but the fact that at least up until just before 9 00 you be still use your credit card lead I to think that when we do find your car we might even find your purse safely inside it who know maybe you be not attack at all maybe something fall on you knock you out your car be park safely around the corner and now it be sit in a tow yard somewhere because you run out of time on the meter I get to pick up your sister in about 25 minute how about a drive lesson in the meantime really okay now whoa whoa before you take off the

usually when we try to figure out who someone be we have to get he here fingerprint and run the print this method you 've come up with not bring the whole person and just the part we need it 's genius Name 's Maria Vargas Lucky for we she be bring in on a DUI a couple year ago so her print and her picture be in the system Maria Vargas I have no idea who this woman be no reason you should she be a bookkeeper or she be work for a company call Green Highway Trucking Green Highway Trucking I know I know that name I 've be there I be there that night I can not be sure but I think it be after I buy that see and that box of baggie that be what I call timing we have an address on Maria so I ask a patrolman to swing by her place be she there oh yeah apparently she be be wait for we I have her hand in my purse I buy a saw I buy baggie yeah but be your name Hector Alvarez who be Hector Alvarez I 've no idea but the victim here be discover conveniently clutch this note Hector Alvarez do this to I what do you think that be not my handwriting I do not even know a Hector Alvarez my point precisely be I suppose to believe that Maria write that note before she die I know be a pretty neat trick right there be not a spot of blood on this paper can I make a suggestion get out of here let we do our work by tonight we should know an awful lot more I will give you a shout fill you in hi Dad want to practice drive oh God you know honey I just get home maybe Mommy Mom 's wait for a phone call wait be not your learner 's permit no good after the sun set 'cause it be pretty much set I mean there be always the weekend okay kind of get the feeling you do not like drive with I I be just tell Mom what a good driver you be how you just seem to you just know be that the same as like to drive with I look Ariel I do not know where you get this idea from I love drive with you I mean we 've only be out drive that one time but I love it and you know I just I do not think we should go out tonight 'cause I you know I do not want you to get in any trouble but if you want to get up you know early say 6 30 tomorrow morning you mean it sure I mean it I would not be offer if I do not mean it I love drive with you oh daddy I be just so worried you hate drive with I do not be ridiculous hello you want the good or the bad news there be bad news I will start with the good the medical examiner feel it be highly unlikely you kill that young woman highly unlikely remember that candlestick she be beat to death with judge from the angle of the blow the person who kill Maria Vargas be about a foot tall than her taller 'cause I be only five two I know not tall also they feel very strongly the killer be leave hand you be a righty right all my life I swear also they be tell I it would take huge strength to inflict that kind of damage on another person no offense but none of this sound like Allison Dubois to I no offense take oh and the name on that note Hector Alvarez it ring no bell with I or anyone else over at police headquarters I check with your boss never hear either the FBI be apparently very familiar with this guy and one of their good and bright be in there right now bring Manny up to speed he suggest I call you and make sure you could be down here first thing in the morning so we can bring you up to speed I will be there I will definitely be there so what be the bad news you know that note with Alvarez 's name on it the one the dead girl be clutch yeah your fingerprint be all over it how be that possible I have no idea but hey look on the bright side there be no law against leave note who be you and what be you do in my office why be you just sit there you be not concerned that I might call the police the only thing I be not concerned about be you call the police I do not know who you be and what you want but if you do not tell I what you be do here what be you go to do shoot I Hector we both know that would be a big waste of your time what be you talk about who be you I will give you a hint you kill I early tonight Allison it be barely 5 00 a m I have it all wrong I do not lose those six hour the other night they be take from I Allison I have no idea what you be talk about Maria Vargas that woman who be kill by Hector Alvarez the moment she die something important must have be happen in her life something she need to finish I think she use I to do it she hijack I I be guess that it happen that moment in the parking lot right after I put the grocery in the car yeah I promise we will talk about it tonight excuse I Miss be you all right Miss oh yes I be fine thank lose in thought she have a whole agenda it start with I go in that hardware store buying that see that box of baggie and then saw her own hand so I could use her fingerprint to gain access to her computer that sound like a pretty grisly six hour and I leave out the part where I stab a man in the chest with a pair of scissor all of it to get this phone number that I put in here this number you have any idea whose number that might be there be only one way to find out no Joe it be 5 08 in the morning we be sorry the number you have reach be not in service please check

FBI just call they find he they be hold he over at Casa Valley Memorial Hospital I be just about to run over there you expect a phone call oh it be nothing it be just just I be sorry FBI Hector Alvarez Hector Alvarez turn out to be a very interesting fellow this Green Highway Trucking he own they be in the short haul trucking business or so he would have people believe accord to the FBI Mr Alvarez 's real business be human trafficking sneak illegal immigrant across the border for a hefty fee he be a coyote Maria Vargas work for a coyote I be sure she tell herself she be do a good thing help people with no future no job get to a place where they can earn some money help their family but this fellow Alvarez apparently the Bureau have be try to build a case against he for year but they 've never be able to prove anything now with the murder of Maria Vargas all that may change how long have he be here how do he get here apparently he drive himself two night ago Stab wound through the heart be this something you dream about I think this might be something I do I mean it be Maria do it but still I think it might have be my body my hand that put those scissor in he Allison I be not sure I understand I think from the second that Maria die until I wake up under that overpass Maria appropriate my body so she could do something finish something but I do not know what be he go to be all right well they do not know for sure he apparently bleed so much on the drive over that he pass out on the curb in front of the emergency room by the time they get he up here he be in this coma what happen now we wait till what till he come out of it at which time he will be charge with the death of Maria Vargas his clothing in addition to be soak in his own blood be speckle with Maria 's no one be look for yours who be that sit there next to he by the bed I be tell that be his son Desiderio he have a son Allison I can see that you be torture yourself about this but even if you do do what you think you might have do it would have clearly be in self defense not to mention you be not in your right mind maybe not in your own mind at all I agree with your boss it be self defense and it be not even you who do it I mean not really what if he die what be you ask I be you responsible no I do not think you be responsible you be defend yourself I mean not even yourself and what if it go to

think that I have some kind of a sleep deprivation thing go on do not everybody over the age of 12 have a little sleep deprivation thing go on I do not know he seem to think that it be something to be take seriously all right well what would make he think that I think he get his first inkling when I fall asleep in his waiting room this morning oh my the truth be I be exhaust all the time at first he want to check I into the hospital one night next week and do a sleep study that be where they hook you up to a computer and they they try to figure out what the problem be then after we you know we we talk for a little while we both realize what you both think this be my fault Fault nobody mention fault I do not use the word fault okay what word would you use I do not want to use any word I think the doctor 's just try to figure out cause and effect I do not think that fault factor into it and I be the cause okay look I would not use the word cause either but you 've get to be realistic you be up once or twice a night which mean that I be up once or twice a night the problem be after you tell I about your dream I can not get back to sleep I sit here and I stare and I wait for the sun to come up or for you to have another dream so what do he want we to do what be we talk here Ear plug or how do we handle this I do not want you to be exhaust initially he want we to try sleep apart that be his plan just for a week I think it be more diagnostic than anything else if after a week I be feel well then what if after a week you be feel well what that we would sleep apart forever do not sound like much of a plan well that be not his plan that be your plan I mean I be sure he be get some kind of a protocol in mind if this you know in fact turn out to be the problem 3 20 in the morning you poor thing Allison Dubois ask for you today oh yeah do you say hi for I yeah course I do you look at the mail in the living room Devalos be have a party he be sweet he send one invitation

everybody have at the register well the individual pack have all be snatch up but if you be interested we do have some of the large family size kit leave they be right over here Excellent each one come with enough ration to accommodate an average family for a solid month well I have a family of five do you think one kit 's enough think of it this way they be not really supply in a way they be kind of like insurance how do you mean Murphy 's Law right the more prepared you be the less likely you be to ever have to use this stuff excuse I Sure you be kid I the girl asleep Ariel 's still study you okay it be nothing the important thing be when the apocalypse hit I may not be able to walk but I will have plenty to eat and drink be you make fun of I not I not ever should I even ask how much all of that cost we well no you should not you should just think of it as an investment I do not know about that when I make an investment I like to look forward to the day it pay off Personally I hope I never see any of that stuff again I be so glad you be back I be get so worried it be be almost a week Geiger read normal oh my God Peaches thank you thank you so much I find a hospital Plenty to salvage I will go back out tomorrow do you see anything else be there anybody else out there no I be sorry I get all the way to Tucson this time it be the same there as everywhere else just like Phoenix just like Tempe everyone 's dead it feel so real the hopelessness the futility and it it feel soon like it be a tomorrow that be not all that far away so what be we talk natural disaster I do not think so they be worried about radiation maybe a suitcase bomb I do not know I see two survivor in a bunker somewhere try to stay alive you know the weird thing I meet one of they yesterday he be the owner of the store where I buy all those survival supply you be not go to like this but and maybe it be because I be just unwilling to think about everything come to such a horrible and abrupt end but do you think this might have a link with the earthquake I mean I know it really get to you be this maybe a way of deal with your anxiety no I do not think so it feel different okay let us say that something terrible be go to happen what do we do do you see anything that might help we figure out what kind of precaution we should take that be why I be so scared but you see this guy who survive it right so I mean he would know what to do maybe you should talk to he excuse I I be sorry to bother you Mr who be ask oh I be Allison I be Allison Dubois I be here yesterday I buy a ton of those family survival pack Russell Russell Burgess something the matter those survival pack give you a problem nothing to do with what I buy Everything be fine that be not why I be here okay then you strike I as a man who know a lot about survival so I be wonder if if you would not mind if maybe I could just pick your brain for a couple minute you see I grow up during the Cold War and when the Soviet Union collapse we all think it be a reprieve but then you have 9 11 now we have terror attack suitcase nuke anthrax in an envelope and that be just the evil that man do you factor in global warming hurricane flood drought fire any one of those be enough to snap the infrastructure we be go to wake up one morning live back in the Stone Age do you really think so hey I be not the only one a lot of really smart people economist historian they see the writing on the wall Population be grow just as fast as our resource be dry up one way or another we be on the verge of some very bad time but we will be okay we 've get our family survival pack see and that be the thing supply be only one part of it even if you be well stocked what do you do when those who do not have enough find out that you have plenty that be why the really well prepared home Mrs Dubois include a gun you want to see I I do indeed we may have catch a break on the Donlin case all that construction on their house I speak with the contractor get a list of the name on his crew one of they do not check out turn out the guy 's real name be Lloyd Higgins he be work under an alias probably because he have a history of violent offense include aggravate assault no alibi for the night of the murder I be just about to go in and grill he Thought you might want to watch sure I think I know where they be what he do with the Donlins ' body I really appreciate you take the time to walk I through all this it be no big deal no it be and I appreciate it so would you mind do a couple more I have a practice sheet it be a test from a couple year ago I ask Mr Walsh for some extra help and he give I this this be pretty straightforward the Mudville Rockets be build a new stadium three time the width of the field be twice the length and four time the length be 20 more than the perimeter so to find the dimension you would what nothing just I understand this stuff so much well when it come from you I do not know if you

convinced we need to buy a gun well say something you hate gun all the violence that you see you want to bring a gun into our house well I do not want to but I be start to think we have to you be go to think this be extreme but I be start to worry about the whole breakdown of the social order excuse I I have no idea what you be talk about yes you do what if there be no police what if there be no public safety of any kind why where do they go I do not know if there be some kind of apocalyptic situation like a natural disaster or a terrorist incident how would we protect ourselves from the people who have not prepare the way we have who want what be ours our energy bar our chemical toilet no I be not buy a gun what about our daughter we have daughter Joe what if somebody want our daughter okay Mark this moment it be historic you have officially leave the planet where be this come from it be not come from anywhere I tell you I go to speak with that man the man from my dream hey it be your idea I be just I be try to be prepare in case of a catastrophe you want to know what a catastrophe be a catastrophe be when a child find a loaded gun and it go off that be a catastrophe we be not go to leave it load we would not leave it load we would teach our girl we would warn they no about the danger of a weapon Allison that do not work that way no one time one mistake and that be it I be sorry but there be no argument that be go to convince I to bring a gun into our house just think about it I be not think about it Allison do you know what the number be the statistic do you know any more dozen time likely you be to shoot yourself or somebody you love than a home invader yeah I do not care about statistic Joe all right well you do not know what I be see you do not know

find she in a shallow grave wrap in a tarp nothing else Throat split from ear to ear we know she be not a Donlin other than that we have not a clue I do not know what to think I 've be dream about her certain that the thing that I see take place in the future but now it make no sense it turn out that she be be dead for almost a week okay and that be awful but there be an upside to this you can not be serious now hold on a second look if she be dead now there be no way that she be go to be around to survive some catastrophic event which mean that there may not be a catastrophic event in the future right right and maybe you be right maybe none of this be go to happen can you hold on a second Joe sorry but we need to take a drive Lee just find the Donlins remember to show all your work in the space provide this be worth ten percent of your final grade so please check all your answer the Mudville Rockets be build a new stadium I do not understand why be you so mad if you think you ace

gallstone I be guess that be from the father some tooth filling that look pretty old the young girl 's hairpin be you say that this sludge be the Donlins I will not have proof positive for a couple hour but who know about this do anybody else know about this wait wait please he be white what do you say it be they it be the Donlins but the man who shoot they he be not the man you bring in the

against he I do not need to wait eight hour I know for a fact right now he kill she I be sorry the end of the world that seem like a lot to fall for this girl whoever she be be no kid well she be not a kid when she die but in my dream it seem like she have be down in that bunker a long time who know how old she be when Burgess take she okay explain to I why why keep this girl alive all those year why would anyone go to all that trouble he get to be someone 's entire world I do not know maybe he think something terrible be go to happen and he get to add a girl to his stockpile of provision I do not know maybe we should ask he I be sorry I wish I could help you but she do not look at all familiar I mean she might have come in the store but when and if you do get her name I would be happy to look at the file credit card receipt anything else before she be murder we have reason to believe that this girl be hold prisoner for quite some time we think she may have be hold in some kind of an underground shelter give your line of work your interest in survival I be wonder if you have an underground shelter or a bunker of some kind on your property I be sorry be that what I be do here I come in because this lady a customer of mine she call I up and say I might be able to help you with some kind of investigation but now it seem like you be accuse I just want to know if you have a bunker no I do not have a bunker I have a bomb shelter it be there when I buy the place it be kind of a mess I use to store kerosene down there and we recently have a fire you mind if we take a look be my guest but you be not go to find anything to do with any girl down there who do you think you be what be up you lie to I really see I kind of think I just tell you what you need to hear you and I both know that you would have never help I with that exam if I admit to you that I steal it you have no conscience do you what if I tell Mr Walsh you be not go to do that that might get you in as much trouble as I I mean we both know that you be one of those kid who have a great reputation work hard get good grade always have so no I do not see you risk all that just to set the record straight on I and besides might make it kind of awkward when we get together on Friday we be not get together on Friday whatever you say tell I something a couple kid tell I that you have that sixth sense thing like your mother I do not know maybe I do maybe I do not do not do you much good with I do it this one really do not taste like peanut butter how be the chocolate where have you get those oh hi Mommy we find they in the garage there be a whole backpack full of them Thought Daddy talk to you about this they be suppose to be for emergency how be we suppose to know if they be any good if we do not give them a test run first well be they any good I just spend an hour go through Burgess ' bunker think I 've black lung what why the place be burn through and through Smells like the inside of a smokestack for what it be worth there be no sign of captive recent or otherwise yeah but that fit I see the bunker on fire that be how that girl get out I be not say I do not believe you I be talk about evidence there just be none what so that be it we be just go to look the other way even though this monster kill a girl today we be yeah oh by the way I do not know if this be go to make you feel well or bad but we think we be finally able to ID our mystery girl we be 99 sure her name be Zoey Lehman her parent live in Tempe they report she as a runaway almost three year ago we be go to need a dna test to make it conclusive but other than that hey if nothing else at least we can give her family some closure I guess that be something Thanks Lee you okay I do not think the world 's go to end it be sad that be the good I can do for good news they finally do it all that weapon grade plutonium out there they be bind to get their hand on some I be friend with your dad since we be kid he know I have this place he ask I he make I promise that I would protect you and I give he my word easy easy you be groggy from the sedative your mom give you that she do not want you to panic know

together I may well be the last of my family alive and you may well be the last Donlin Sarah but we be go to get through this we 've search every corner of the place no sign of Russell Burgess his home be empty too my guess be he got spook when we bring he in for question odd be he be long go and if Sarah Donlin 's still alive he be probably get she with he so it be true he kill that whole family so he could take their daughter well he be smart I will give he that no one be go to be look for the girl if they think she be kill we will keep sifting but I would be surprised if we find any sign of Burgess he be the kind of guy who know how to fly below the radar he could be anywhere by now do you feel that it be an aftershock everybody watch out for your head everyone good Honey dinner

real shine to you where do you two meet we be at a conference he make a pass at the woman I be with okay I I be just start to meet people and I see you be at at Taylor Hammond in Houston which be good because it may be a while before I figure out exactly which way I be go to go with this position you know listen when I be on the plane with Terry you be on the plane with Terry he mention you be struggle with the dye sensitizer mechanism in your solar cell and I put some thought into it and I come up with some idea Thought maybe you would like to take a look I do not know what to tell you Allison it just do not look like a murder it may not but I be tell you that man be force to put that rope and what about the note the guy leave he be force to write that too yeah as a matter of fact I be Allison look at the physical evidence there be no sign of force entry no sign of struggle no defensive wound and it be not like the guy do not have a reason to do what he do Allison what be it you would like I to do the only description you 've give I be the guy be wear a hoodie do I haul in every male in the Phoenix metro area who own a hoodie and need I remind you that just 24 hour ago you tell I you see the victim the exact same guy I see swinge from a rafter last night massacre a diner full of people I be sorry no offense but you be not on your a game here lady I think maybe you just need to take a step back you would be hard press to find a more unlikable human being do not hire he I would not except for two thing my boss be champion the guy and these drawing be amazing what do you mean well look I could not figure out why Terry would have anything to do with he but now I look at the work I totally get it I mean this guy really be a spectacular thinker his solution for our dye sensitizer problem really be amazing I mean I do not think I have a choice okay that be it it be do what be do I just write Terry and tell he I be hire his friend and then I e mail Hal tell he I would be interested in have he start as soon as possible you really be a man of action no I just know the inevitable when I see it besides you do not have to like everyone you work with right I be try to build a company not start a club speak like a true captain of industry which be great 'cause it might just be time for I to retire what be you talk about well I do not know it seem more and more lately the thing that I see the thing that I dream there be not a lot to they if that be the case what be the point be this sleeplessness a product of your excitement over the capture of the Gentleman Caller Congratulations no thank you we both know it would not have happen without your help I be just pleased that we 've finally begin to repair our relationship you give I some good information and I be grateful but I would not call this this association a relationship Michael Bradley who be Michael Bradley a serial rapist with a predilection for woman with blonde hair he be strike four time over the last 18 month two of his victim be high school student the last girl that he attack fight back and the police be able to recover a hair sample if they could locate this man and procure some of his dna I think that they would find a perfect match convict he would be a relatively simple matter tell I Mrs Dubois would you like his home address I can not you have to but I do not understand you be just a boy Allison this police report be crystal clear three week ago Rachel Stetson take her own life period end of story she be force to inject herself just like that man be force to hang himself by some boy she be be treat for chronic depression she even say as much in the note she leave for her husband I think the boy tell she what to write I will play along so there be this teenager he can get in and out of house and apartment without leave any sign of force entry and without fire a single shot he can convince people two three time his own age to take their own life without put up a struggle forget how why I do not know I be not try to embarrass you what would you like I to do I can not really assign a detective because no actual crime have be report I could put you with a composite artist but once we have a sketch what would we do with it if you have a name I could have someone interview the kid at least determine where he be on the night in question but without a name I be really at a loss you know the detective assign to the youth crime task force he keep an up to date collection of all the high school yearbook in the metro area maybe you could flip through those see if you could find his picture get a name thank you I would like that here sorry I almost forget Michael Bradley 1714 Andover Lane Forgive I what be this that be the address for the serial rapist you 've be look for the one who like blonde high school girl really be this something you dream no but I think it be reliable information I have nothing to do with it Dad hey everything okay I do not know where do you get these these a fellow who come in look for a job give they to I why I know this be go to sound strange but I think I have a dream about they last night about these about schematic I pretty much put it out of my head until I see they sit on your laptop just now okay what about they I can not imagine they would make much of a dream well they do not really there be this guy and he be stand in the middle of nothing with some paper in his hand and he keep scream these be mine tell your father these be mine they belong to Clay the police have not arrest Michael Bradley yet you scare I they be stake out his apartment they will pick he up soon I would not be so sure of that I overhear Bradley 's brother tip he off about the stakeout now he be hide at a friend 's apartment it be on the corner of Western and Del Mar wait a second western and Del Mar thank you I will pass that along what be with this sudden fascination with high school boy I be look for this killer that I 've be dream about I think he go to this high school I can not question he I can not go in the school and ask about he I have no evidence just want to see he in the flesh make sure I be right what do you mean no evidence there be always evidence if there be murder slaughter of some kind there be evidence no you be wrong he be very clever he make it look like suicide really you indicate that he be a serial offender serial offender be by their nature peacock they almost never disguise their crime they want their activity write about they want their persona speculate about I be sorry Mrs Dubois I be skeptical you be not alone pretty raw kind of interesting so what be it you want to show I what be so damned important what be this what be I look at it be an obituary for a a guy name Clay Barrett 37 he be young what be this get to do with I he die four month ago of a brain aneurysm before that he work at Taylor Hammond he be something of a wunderkind he teach grad seminar on the dye sensitization of solar cell when he be an undergraduate when he be like a sophomore now Hal Munzell share an office with he for two year I know you be very excited about Hal 's design but I be worried they might not be his that be a serious accusation Joe who be make it somebody at Taylor Hammond actually my source do work at Taylor Hammond do he long work there I do not actually talk to he myself he reach out through somebody that that I be very close to somebody that I really trust Fine can you give I a name I would rather not be there any proof anything to back this story up no but like I say this be somebody that I trust a lot I be sorry maybe you trust this person but I do not think I could let a man go on the say so of some unnamed disgruntled former colleague it be not like that it be exactly like that accord to you this person could not even screw up enough courage to make the accusation in person have to go through some third party Frankly Joe I be surprised you would waste my time with this Terry you know about my wife right you tell I you get this idea from your wife no actually it come from my daughter I be tired I 've be on a plane all day I be still not home so I should not care that he might be a thief hey I would care if you could prove it but you can not you do not want Hal on your team fine all you have to do be to beat his idea save I more time save I more money if you can not do that you forgot to clean the outside of the cylinder remember how I show you congratulation by the way you follow my instruction to the t apparently there be not a shred of physical evidence to tie you to the death of these people that be impressive that be very impressive and the way you slip in and out of that house and that woman 's apartment you have a real talent for this line of work I keep think about they though both of they the way they plead for their life you know the look on their face the guy be so scared that woman she be so sad that will pass but the accomplishment will live on and that be what you need to revel in young man the accomplishment if you have not do what you do that man would have get up the next morning go to that diner and snuff out all those life save seven or eight innocent soul in the return for the death of one sociopath I would say that be a pretty good trade if you be call the police I would not bother by the time they be able to search young Brandon 's home the weapon would be long go how long do it take once you realize he be sensitive that he could see you hear you how long do it take what be the difference I need someone to help I and you be unwilling he be a child you 've get he kill for you you be a monster I be a monster what about Adam Dietz you dream about what he be prepared to do to everyone in that diner and Rachel Stetson that woman that you see inject herself do you know that she be a nurse perhaps you also hear that she be struggle with depression but what you could not have be aware of be her grow sense of despair over the deterioration of the health care system she labor in she have actually become convinced that death might just be preferable to the level of care that she be able to provide so convinced that if Brandon have not do what I have ask he to do she would have secretly and purposefully euthanise 16 patient before she be catch we be talk about a child it can not continue it must continue you and I have do a lot of good together over the past few day we have put some terrible people in prison that can continue Mrs Dubois I will keep share information with you good information but only if you allow my other work to go on unimpeded that be what this be all about be not it you know I be dream about you and the boy that be why you come to see I in the first place do you actually think that if you give I enough information about criminal we be not able to catch that I would let you two keep murder people good night Agent Cooper you will not be able to catch he you will not be able to stop he there will be no evidence I will make certain of that I be already in his head you can not save he there be virtually no he leave to save why not reconsider it be such an elegant arrangement promise I you will sleep on it hey Hal when you be all settle in I would like to go over your plan for the dye sensitizer see if we can not tie up a few loose end what be wrong with the plan I give you no nothing they help a lot but we still need to figure out how to get well absorption out of the semiconductor and we need to address the electron recombination in the mediator level may I what be go on Hal I be go to be perfectly honest with you Joe I be not really an office kind of a guy I tend to do my very good work at my house there be few distraction there I can really focus on the problem that I need to solve and if it be all the same to you I would like to take these home with I and noodle with they there and bring you my absolute good as oppose to whatever I can muster here Brandon Brandon Whitman my name 's Allison I be friend with Agent Cooper I do not know what you be talk about I be nothing like you you be exactly like I you can see he so can I the only difference be I do not kill for he where be everybody everyone be my mom everyone be at work and when not everyone be with her boyfriend what do you want why be you in my house I work for the district attorney 's office I want to help you I do not need any help yes you do you could be try for murder I do not think so 'cause all those people you keep talk about they kill themselves no they decide to end their life quickly rather than face the slow death you be threaten can you prove that I be offer you a way out come with I to the district attorney 's office we will explain what happen how you start hear Cooper 's voice in your head how your mom try to get you treatment and medication but it do not work you be still a minor the court will show you mercy Mercy they should give I a medal do you know how many life I 've save I go to school I look at all the other kid the captain of the team the girl who star in all the play and they be like the overachiever the one who get in all the good college that everybody talk about what have they do play a game sing a song look at what I do all the people in that diner be go to die all the patient that woman care for she be go to kill and you be go to stop we why because it be wrong but it be not wrong you know when he first start appear to I I would ignore he pretend I could not see he be scream at I about this guy in Scottsdale say he be depressed and be go to take his 38 and shoot his wife and two kid right before he blow his own brain out Agent Cooper ask I if I would do something about it he say he would show I how to get in the house what to say what to do I just ignore he the next day I wake up my mom be watch the news Murder suicide in Scottsdale some guy snap kill his whole family I could have save they no you know I be right no I do not it be like he always say just do the math you kill one guilty person you save two innocent one you kill 20 you save a hundred you kill a hundred you save a thousand do the math this be not math this be something else it be vigilantism and it be wrong no it be not it be really kind of perfect anyway you be go to have to leave I have homework Honey you come to bed someday what if you can not do it what if you can not come up with a solution that improve on Hal 's do not say that do not even put that out there maybe I should just surrender and get use to the fact that Hal thieving slimy untrustworthy Hal be someone I be go to just have to see every day of my professional life when and if he choose to come into the office that be you all right if I stay out here for a bit I will see you soon daddy Daddy yeah Ariel what have you what be go on everything all right what time be it oh God what be you do up I do not know it be like midnight or something I have another dream about that clay guy he want I to tell you something oh you do what he want you to look at something call the Mellinger Equation Mellinger Equation do you mean Mallinger yeah he say you be suppose to apply 1 ethyl 3 and then extrapolate it from four vector what he keep scream it at I until I promise I would wake up and write it down why why do you leave I just get off the phone with the hospital again for the moment at least he be he be still hang on I will keep you post I appreciate that it be in front of we the whole time Terry we just do not see it the Mallinger Equation it really do solve all of our dye sensitizer problem the key be apply it to a light photosensitive material and then apply Mallinger to four additional surface vector thereby reduce the amount of external sensitization that be require thereby reduce our material cost by what three maybe four percent it might even go so high as five what can I say Joe I guess I underestimate just how much you dislike work with Hal Munzell be you on board with this I be a man of my word Joe consider he go well if he ever come back in the office I will be sure to let he know that be great Joe well I guess sometimes thing do work out the way they be suppose to soon I hope they be still operate Devalos and I be just wait Joe I get to go tell the girl I will be home in a bit Douglas Reilly just expire Dear Joe I make a decision to end my life tonight hello again Mrs Dubois Nice note do not you think I be go to need you to sign that by the way I be have a gun in my left hand which be point directly at the center of your spine a single bullet at this close proximity even through the rear of your seat should disable but not kill you immediately cause unimaginable pain Brandon do not do this sign the note put the key in the ignition and drive to the roof there be video camera all over this lot you be be record right now not tonight the system be down will be until it be service tomorrow Agent Cooper be very thorough you ought to know that by now Agent Cooper this be his idea our work be very important we can not let you get in the way now I be go to need you to climb up on that wall I can not do that Brandon I think you will you be go to climb up on that wall and jump off it 'cause if you do not I will shoot you Mrs Dubois you be go to have to shoot I what be the matter do not Cooper tell you this might happen no he do not do he 'cause he do not know just like he do not know about Douglas Reilly who who be Douglas Reilly I be go to get Douglas Reilly be a man who actually do commit suicide last night and not because anybody be threaten he but because he lose his wife and he could not imagine spend another day without her see he his wife 's name be Rachel Stetson his wife be a killer so it be like Cooper say do the math no no no you do the math his wife have not kill anybody anybody not yet and I be start to think she probably never would have wait a second what be you say I be say honey the future be not fix it be not certain it be fluid Agent Cooper could not have know that Rachel Stetson be go to kill all those people or that somebody would not have discover she or that she would not have have a change of heart any more he could have be certain that Adam Dietz be go to walk into that diner and blow everyone away who be to say that somebody would not have stop he who be to say that he would not have stop himself no he see it he he know it he be certain of it he even say you dream about it I do I do my dream be always always fool with I you can you can call my husband call the people I work with so what be you say I be say do the math Brandon Cooper 's use you he want you to think that he be infallible but he be not I be never go to jump off that wall so you be go to have to kill I or well yet give I that gun give I the gun we be go to get back in the car we will drive downstair we will talk to my boss that be just not an option Mrs Dubois we do not have much time pull the trigger we will drive the car away leave she here make it look like a carjack be what she be say right be it possible I force those people to kill themselves for no reason at all it be highly unlikely Brandon and we could hardly afford to wait and just let awful thing happen that would 've defeat our entire purpose now pull the trigger you say she be go to jump give I the gun Brandon if you do not kill she she will arrest you and you will go to prison I tell you we will go talk to my boss I believe that he will recommend that the court show you mercy I would not count on mercy son you 've already have a hand in the death of three people now pull the trigger there you go do not now do what you have to do there be no reason to feel doubt or uncertainty Brandon he be use you none of this be your fault do not listen to her Brandon what we be do be right we be make the world well you will see once you 've actually pull that trigger everything will change you will feel wonderful what be you do Brandon no where have you be I 've be worried about you first I be at at the hospital and then I be talk to this this boy 's mother and then the question we need answer

help that be okay I be still awake Lawsuit on the brain something like that you hear from Terry yet no and I leave he another message that do not mean anything right the boss not call I back no of course not he be just busy and he know it be a nuisance suit right I will buy that I like the sound of that what be Scanlon 's big surprise you remember that other couple in my dream it turn out they really do exist they be friend of the Burkes ' they be down at police headquarters help identify the body but but what I do not know I do not think they be tell the complete truth about what about what they know I mean it do not make sense because they be not in a position to know about anything anyway then why do you think that they be lie this be go to sound crazy but I 've have this buzzer in my head all day and whenever I hear a lie it buzz you do you think it be crazy do not you no no I believe you do not do that do not patronize I what I be not patronize you I be just try to support you come on after everything that we 've be through you say you get a buzzer in your head you 've get a buzzer in your head look it be nice of you to say that but I do not really think you think it well I can not control what you think but I do believe you that be I do not want to talk about this anymore why I do I mean it I be happy to talk I be happy to stay up as long as it take to work this out what okay fine all right but if you change your mind if you if you feel like talk even in the middle of the night just wake I up I mean it I love you I know how we do in there all do it be right there where we leave it I will gather up my tool and we will get out of here wait a second you hungry I be hungry we eat just two hour ago no no not that kind of hungry cover I do you smell that smell good enough to eat you stay away from her get up no please no please you be hurt I keep an eye on these folk huh I will make sure I leave some nice hot leftover for you have you ever hear of truth be tell I be sorry well it be a television show okay if you say so it go off the air about six month ago remember when we be at the Burkes ' cabin I tell you I have a dream about they and another couple at the time I think the thing I see in the dream take place the night before that they have something to do with they be kill but now I be think the thing that I see in my dream take place at least six month ago okay two couple get together to watch some television six month or day ago what be the difference the difference be on that night there be a home invasion two man wear mask they be look for something a satchel they find it and then they tie up both of the couple and I think that they rape Mrs Skahan well I do not know what to tell you Allison I would think if there have be a report of a home invasion or a sexual assault for that matter the sheriff 's department would have mention it and even if there be what do any of that have to do with the killing of Lindsay and Paul Burke I do not know but I keep have these dream maybe the man who assault all four of they six month ago come back and murder Paul and Lindsay and maybe Julie and Michael say nothing 'cause they be afraid to be next I be not sure the only thing I be sure about be we need to bring they back in here we need to talk to Julie and Michael again hi can I help you Mr Dubois I be Jack Herkosh I be an attorney I work for Terry Cavanaugh at Aerodytech we be always encourage to present our idea to our project manager and one of the idea I develop be this concept for a solar cell that use reflective mirror to amplify its power and you present that concept to your project manager at the time Mr Joseph Dubois that be correct I present Mr Dubois with my idea he say the concept have potential but no one ever follow up with it and now I realize that be because he be plan to appropriate the idea for himself and how do you present your concept to Mr Dubois through an inter office memo that be standard procedure at Aerodytech the piece of paper that you be hold in your hand be that the same one you give to Mr Dubois it be that be just not true he never give I any memo about solar cell this be the copy of the memo that his attorney send to we there might be some potential here let us run it up the flagpole and see what happen J D be not that your handwriting yeah be not those your initial yeah yeah yeah I understand that this may not be an easy time but we just have a few more question anything absolutely this may seem a bit far afield but we be investigate the possibility that a home invasion take place at the Burkes ' cabin approximately six month ago do either of you have any knowledge of this Paul certainly never mention anything like that to I Mrs Skahan no I never hear about such a thing so that be the case I assume it be safe to say that neither of you be there on this particular night where the cabin no again this home invasion you be talk about I do not think it ever happen much less our be there Mr Skahan forgive I for ask this but the scar above your eye how long have you have that and how do you get it this about about a year I go mountain biking take a tumble last year what do this have to do with Paul and Lindsay I be not at liberty to say at the moment Mrs Skahan this be a delicate question but have you ever be the victim of a sexual assault Mrs Skahan I really need you to answer no I 've never be sexually assault you be lie Mrs Skahan I know what happen to you be incredibly personal incredibly painful but we need your help Fine we 've offer to provide it but these question be nonsensical this stuff have nothing to do with Paul and Lindsay I know this must all seem terribly cryptic to you but we really be try to find out exactly what happen to your friend and who be responsible I want to thank you both again for come down to meet with we Sorry if we say anything to upset you and I promise you we will get to the bottom of this they be lie both of they Fine he do not get the scar from ride his bike and she be assault and do not want to talk about it none of that be against the law they know more than they be tell maybe and maybe not what else do you want I to do Allison I just question two citizen without cause without a shred of evidence and without an attorney present that be all the risk take I be prepared to do for you on this case and by the way I 've nothing to show for it I think you and I be do for the day daddy we need to get to bed but Mommy be not here and we need our kiss well can you come over here and give they to we well I kind of can not right now sweetie well then can we come over there and get they from you not unless you could fly I could fly no you can not hello hey whoo what be all this stuff this be my whole life at Aerodytech it be everything I 've ever work on every memo every file every project Mommy can we have our kiss now of course and you all right you little little sweet thing go on go to bed I will be in in a minute and brush brush your tooth I will I will I take it thing do not go well with the lawyer this guy have a memo he be get a memo of a schematic of a solar cell just like mine it be get handwritten note all over it in my handwriting from I Problem be I do not remember ever see this before today I do not understand I know I do not steal this idea do I a favor say that again say what again say I know I do not steal this idea no I do not I know in fact I be certain of it you be just say that 'cause you be my wife true but I be also say it because I do not hear that buzzer go off in my head the piece of paper that you be hold in your hand be that the same one you give to Mr Dubois it be so so I do not know what to tell you Joe I do not hear a thing he be not lie Joe neither one of you be lie what have that idiot do do not shoot I beg you I be put down my weapon I do not know what happen in there I do not want to know I be not a killer there you go I be unarmed you do not want to kill I I mean he that be self defense but I I be stand here with nothing I have nothing I know but that be not I I beg you Let us not make this any bad you put down your weapon I will leave you can call the police you can give they the other guy Come on now help I out tell your friend here to lower her gun tell she to let I leave sorry to interrupt I think I know why the Skahans lie to we about the home invasion about the rape about the scar about all of it Julie Skahan shoot and kill her attacker that night that be why they never report it the Burkes be there Michael they all see it now how that tie into the Burkes be murder last week I be not sure yet Allison we already know who kill the Burkes DNA come back it be a perfect match two ex con name Zachary Giltner Jacob Vallillo Work as a team each one have a laundry list of break and enter charge armed robbery this one even have a history of sexual violence be out of prison a little over six month now no no these man could not have kill the Burkes definitely not this one Allison how can you be so sure I be tell you Julie Skahan shoot this man and probably this one too only it be six month ago it be not the other day then how do you explain the dna how do you explain the hair the DNA 's wrong it be not just the dna the bootprint we find at the scene match the shoe size of both suspect the medical examiner also recover a bullet fragment from one of the victim the ballistic match the same unrecovered weapon they use in a series of robbery four year ago this do not make any sense I see they in my dream we have everything we need to issue a warrant on these two guy the only thing we do not have be the two of they in custody so if you happen to have a dream about where the two of they be hide that be something I would like to hear about but short of that it be self defense we be all clear on that right Julie have no choice obviously we all get it it be self defense anybody look in this bag this be what they be rip up those floorboards this be why they be here there be almost a million dollar in here be you kid all right stop handle it get your print all over it be just go to complicate it for the police when we call wait be that what we be do call the police I have no idea what you be talk about I be talk about a million dollar you want to call the police what for these two be already dead it be not like they can be punish any further the whole self defense thing why even open it up for discussion I mean think about it maybe we do not call the police nobody ask about who kill who and we split this money Paul that be insane there be two dead body in our house I be just say do you really want to put Julie through any more than she be be through the question the lawyer look at her all we have to do be clean up get rid of these two there be a lot of money in that bag Michael you be go so long I be worried you do not answer your cell how have it go oh my God what happen nothing just end up be a little more complicated than I have plan that be all what do you mean complicated just get you know crazy no I do not know do not they understand do not they see our point of view no not at first they do not understand they do not share our point of view but then you do it what be that where have you get that you know exactly where I get it you take it you take the gun from that night you take that with you why would you do that Thought I might need it turn out I do my God Michael what do you do do exactly what I say I be go to do Jules I explain that with the doctor bill and your therapy we would go through our share of the money that we need more but when I think about what you go through that night we should have take more from the beginning what happen I do not know Paul get angry he start say that what happen to you be not his problem tell I if I ever try to strong arm he again he would tell the police how you kill those two man how the one guy be unarmed and plead for his life so so I leave and then I come back pull the gun make he show I where he hide his share of the money it be okay it be go to be okay not my gun not my anything before I go back there the second time I dig up our friend put on their clothe their shoe it be like it be not I the two man who attack you what do you do with their body you must have do something with they I have no idea what you be talk about do you bury they yes or no do your husband bury they I do not know what you be talk about how could he have bury they if we 've never meet they never be in the same room with they these people kill our friend it be cruel of you to come around here this way do he bury they near the cabin do he bury they in the front or the back I be close this door now and if you do not get out of here I be call the police I mean that yeah yeah I believe you be that a yes to the front it do not matter we will figure it out Sir we be go to need some bloodhound I make it abundantly clear to you to have no more contact with the Skahans yet not ten minute ago I receive a phone call from their attorney threaten to file a harassment suit Sir nothing be as it appear to be because one of my employee pay an unannounced visit the people you think murder the Burkes have be dead for month and month dead for month and month how could that be their dna be find all over the Burkes ' body yes those two criminal ' dna be find all over the Burkes ' body because someone dig they up and spread their dna all over the Burkes ' body and who would do that the Skahans they murder those two man six month ago then they bury their body nearby the Burkes ' cabin then they dig they up so that they could plant evidence after they murder the Burkes three day ago that be why we need these bloodhound Sir if we do not waste time argue those grave will still be fresh they should not hard to find Allison Dubois Allison Dubois what be the chance do you know we have the same last name what do you say we get marry no I can not my kid be home alone my husband 's work late sorry well actually I be go home I finally speak to Terry so I be go to get out of here oh by the way I call the girl I speak to Ariel everybody be fine yeah I know I talk to she too so wait a second you say you talk to Terry Cavanaugh what do he say it be painful I try to convince he not to settle I tell he I think we should fight and he say I should worry about build solar cell and leave all the business stuff to he I be so sorry they start negotiate with Brantley 's attorney tomorrow and he say he think the whole thing'll be over in a week Joe I get to go Devalos be call I I will be home as soon as I can I owe you an apology we find they Zach Giltner and Jacob Vallillo both body be bury in the wood behind the Burkes ' cabin so what do we do now we pick up the Skahans I do not think I can there be still no evidence to link they to any of these murder unless something new present itself I have no ground to go after they on if the Skahans do do this they do a terrific job of cover it up I be start to think they might even get away with it do you know it be 5 00 in the morning what be you do I be try to find a logical explanation for something that seem to defy logic what do you mean well if this be every piece of paper that ever cross my desk while I work at Aerodytech and this be a copy of something that I apparently see and comment on then how come I can not find the original how come I can not find my copy well maybe you make your comment on the one you give to Brantley Atkins and he have the original no no 'cause I have everything I have I have a I have the bulletin that they announce the special on at the cafeteria I mean he be swear that I do this you be swear that I do this no no I do not I do not say that I would never say such a thing I know you be not capable of such a thing I just say whatever he be say on that tape be the truth and you do not see a contradiction in that not necessarily the piece of paper you be hold in your hand be that the same one you give to Mr Dubois it be no buzzer right no buzzer but all he be say be the piece of paper he be hold in his hand be the same one he give to you he be not say that paper and this paper be the same paper I can not even see the paper he be hold you think he be talk about a different memo hello Brantley I have to say this be highly inappropriate Joe meet like this give our current situation I realize that I just think perhaps we could make a little more headwa if we meet face to face whatever Joe I know this have be difficult for you I 've always like you it be just business this be nothing personal yeah I 've be hear that a lot this week so I must admit I mean this whole thing have I really confuse I watch your testimony over and over I be convince that you be lie you say that you give I this piece of paper this memo but you be not lie not technically you do give I that piece of paper the only problem be it do not look like that when you give it to I it look like this how have you do it be it like check wash how much time do you have to spend doctor this memo this do not change anything I be not drop the suit that be up to you man I do not care I be confident this idea be mine and mine alone but when people find out what you do here and it ruin any semblance of a reputation that you might have it be not business it be personal I be sure by now you 've see these picture in the paper and on tv these be the man who kill the Burkes they be also the main suspect in an armored car robbery five year ago we find their dna at the murder scene last week and assume that we have our killer funny thing though yesterday we find their body in two recently dig grave behind the Burkes ' cabin and base on the rate of decomposition the medical examiner be fairly certain they 've be dead several month we believe whoever kill the Burkes would 've have to have know where these body be bury in order to plant that dna evidence I be sorry what do all this have to do with we you do not know it mean that we be look for a person or person who kill not just two people but four these two man five or six month ago and the Burkes early this week and we think we find they really you mean we be you suggest the two of we be responsible for these killing no Mr Skahan we be not suggest the two of you just Julie you see the killer take great care in plant dna evidence at the Burke murder scene but what he or she forgot be to take equal care after kill these two man and we believe the killer 's dna be still on one of they leave behind after a forcible sex act even if it be that hardly prove it prove that both of you lie about that night about be there about what happen it give I mean and motive at least as far as the murder of Vallillon and Giltner be concern and since the attack and murder occur at the Burkes ' cabin it be not unreasonable to assume that they be witness and kill to assure their silence Mrs Skahan I be in possession of a court order compel you to provide we with a dna sample Detective Scanlon here will escort you downstairs wait wait I be sorry Mr Skahan you you have something to add I kill the Burkes Julie be not even there I kill the Burkes well that be very noble Mr Skahan but I need more than your word I need proof in the garage under the drain in the floor that be where I put the gun I use to kill they and those two bastard who want to rape my wife and I would do it again he be lie Mr Skahan I be prepared to dictate a confession right now get a stenographer up here please you can not do this you can not let this happen say something you have to say something I love you you all right yeah it be like she say on television she would do anything for he and I guess he would do anything for her take the man 's confession family it be our rock our salvation these be the people we be close to in the whole world they share our dream they share our blood and yet it be often those close to we who be capable of hurt we most deeply to be or not to be that be not the question in Hamlet the question be how could my uncle kill my father and marry my mother be this what they mean by family entertainment real life be even more frightening a world famous football player be accuse of garrote his wife two brother be find guilty of massacre their parent and the government tell we that almost 16 of the murder commit in this country be perpetrate by one family member against another do not be afraid no one will ever know it be you

now she break it off just before the wedding send I a note say she be leave the country I have not see she since I do not understand be you suggest that she might 've have something to do with my mother 's disappearance I do not know what I be say I be sorry for waste your time I be confused though like I just I mean at least tell I what bring you here this morning I do not know that it matter but I get this picture in my head about the night that your mom disappear and yeah there be someone name Harmony in it although that make no sense and and actually you be in it okay well that I be sorry but that be crazy 'cause like I say I have not see she in forever besides I be at Brooke 's talk about Mom actually her health everything kind of ironic get pretty drunk we both do I end up stay the night she do not want I drive I be plaster we be both plaster and our mom be I be sorry for get your hope up Mr Hoyt do not be Knock knock can I come in pull up a chair so I think about what you say about your dream about Dylan and the fiancée kill the mom about how that make no sense since there be no fiancée about how he be get an airtight alibi 'cause he be with his sister all night so I do a little research you want to see something else that do not make a whole lot of sense you know what that be of course I know what it be it be a restraining order it be a restraining order you take out against your brother in 2004 apparently he pull a gun on you he do and yet accord to he he be with you the night your mother disappear in fact you invite he to stay over the man that pull a gun on you the man that you take a restraing order out against it be true he would have too much to drink I tell he to spend the night in my guest room it be also true that there be a period in my life when I be terrified of my brother Thankfully that be ancient history be you suggest he be somehow involve in my mom 's disappearance well from what we know about they from what we know about he it be obviously cross our mind I swear to you he be with I the thing you need to understand Detective the thing you both need to understand be that my brother be not the same man he once be he be change what do you mean do you remember when we first meet I mention a car accident I be in the hospital for over a year I have multiple surgery month of rehab Dylan practically take up residence in my hospital room he be with I every step of the way in a strange way my nearly die change everything everything bad between we just dissolve what about your mom what be it like between she and Dylan my mother have always be very hard on Dylan at one point she actually remove he from the will that say Dylan 's really be try to mend fence with her when Mom have to start dialysis this past winter he get himself test to see if he could donate one of his kidney it be not a match but I think it mean a lot to she that he would even be willing I be sorry I know you be work very hard to try and find my mother but if you think Dylan have anything to do with her disappearance what be you guy watch Aunt Sara say it be call reality tv Come on Al sit help we decide which one of these attention starve wackadoo have the scary boob job no that be okay I be just go to get out of these clothe grab something to eat do you and Joe have a chance to talk sure do Great be this the only place you could find to do your homework yeah well what about your bedroom Aunt Sara 's stuff 's all over my desk well the kitchen I can not concentrate they be watch some heinous show and now that I know that I be go to school all day Friday instead of leave in the middle of the day to go on a ski trip I have a lot of extra homework to do do you know where your father be in the shower Great it be not that she do not believe you it be not that she do not believe in you it turn out she just do not believe my dad she never have and she never will Great I be deal with a ghost with a credibility problem she just keep ask I if Ryan 's such a decent guy then how come he have not show up here how come he be not pound on the front door beg I to come back how come he have not even call and you know what I mean I do not have an answer for that well maybe you should go see he encourage he to make the first move no I do not want to do that this be my sister 's marriage it would make I really uncomfortable to get in the middle of all that well it might be your sister 's marriage but this be our house we get to do something Ariel 's camp out in the hall and our other child be be force feed tofu and reality tv all right I guess I could drop in on Ryan Harmony you okay I do not know I think so I be almost at the airport be you really sure that I be not go to wind up on some security camera they tape over that footage all the time Nobody be go to notice the car there for week believe I Everything be go to be fine Harmony I be almost do here just do like we say drop off the car and I will pick you up at Terminal Two all right okay Sir I really need to speak with you I be very worried about Brooke Hoyt sorry Allison it be go to have to wait Brooke 's mother Felicia they they just find her body at South Mountain Park this morning I be so sorry I actually just get off the phone with Brooke I be meet she and Dylan at the city morgue so that they can make an official identification of their mother 's body do you just say you be just talk to Brooke a park ranger find she at the bottom of a cliff in a remote area of Pima Canyon they figure she slip and fall during a walk but the coroner think otherwise what do you mean there be no blood spatter where the body land a live person fall from that height would have pop like a balloon Mrs Hoyt on the other hand what be you tell I she be already dead before she go over that cliff no I be tell you she be already murder the coroner say she be dead at least an hour before her body hit those rock that mean somebody take she to that park that mean somebody throw she off that cliff probably want to make her death look like an accident good news be they find a few chunk of skin under Mrs Hoyt 's fingernail which would seem to suggest that she put up a fight before she die with any luck we will find out who she be fight with once we run that DNA you know it be not polite to stare Allison I can not help it I have another dream last night Dylan be bury a body in the desert only it be not his mother it be his sister that sister I do not know she look pretty spry to I this conversation be kind of tricky for I you know we be talk about your sister here and I know you love she and I love she too but the truth be she can be exhaust no believe I I know I be tired of always have to be the adult in the relationship I be tired of have to clean up mess I do not make look the thing be that I know that she want to make it work I would not be here if I do not she just need a little nudge you know a gesture or something maybe if you come by the house to see she or if you just call she I think that be all that it would take really to get she to come home I be sure you be right I be sure that if I make the effort Sara would be perfectly willing to forgive I for the fact that she walk out on I look I be not try to be a hard ass here but she leave I not the other way around okay would I take she back sure it be not like I 've change the lock or anything she can come home anytime she want but between you and I she be put I through this way too many time your sister dig the drama Joe I I be tired of it sorry I forgot to get that validate here you go thank you well it do not look innocent to I it do not look like hand hold more like hand caress what be you go to do I do not know I mean if Ryan really be cheat then why would Dad say that he be be faithful why would he want his daughter to go back to somebody who be betray she I think I get to tell she what I see I will take she out tomorrow night get away from the house away from the kid right so she do not make a scene we just get a match on the dna we find under Felicia Hoyt 's fingernail turn out it belong to Harmony Fletcher Harmony Dylan 's old fiancée Yup seem she got arrest for a DUI a while back so her print and dna be in the system it be a perfect match well I do not understand I think nobody have hear from Harmony in year I think she leave the country so do everyone else Devalos just speak with Dylan again he swear he be have no contact with she since she leave he say he have no idea why she would want to kill his mother of course Mr Devalos if Harmony contact I I will call you right away thank you what do he say they identify the dna they find on Mom 's body they think it be Harmony Fletcher they 've launch a statewide manhunt for her that be a good thing right actually I would say that be well than good I would say that be fantastic I tell you it be go to be all right she do not do it Harmony Fletcher do not kill Felicia Hoyt Dylan and Brooke do beg your pardon look I be sorry I know that Felicia be your friend but I be tell you something peculiar be go on with her child last night I see they kiss on the lip for a very long time I think that they be lover when you say yousaw you okay I do not see it I dream it but what if it be true what if Felicia find out what if she confront they look I know that the DNA be tell we that Harmony kill Felicia but what if Dylan and Brooke figure out a way to plant it there so that we would think it be Harmony Allison it be not just the DNA Harmony Fletcher confess to Felicia 's murder what do you mean you find she well not exactly Dylan Hoyt find this on his doorstep this morning it be from Harmony confessing to everything Harmony Fletcher do not leave Dylan at the altar 'cause of cold foot she leave he 'cause of cold cash apparently Felicia Hoyt do not approve of Dylan 's fiancée so she offer she 100 000 to leave town Harmony take it and never look back at least until four day ago she would run out of money when Felicia refuse to give she another cent thing got heat Harmony hit she over the head with a crystal paperweight when she realize she would kill she she dress Felicia in hike clothe drive her car to South Mountain Park pitch her body over that cliff this do not make any sense why would she leave this note for Dylan if she do everything that this letter claim that she do where be she now I think this be a fake no it be real Allison we compare that signature to the one on her release paper from her DUI arrest a few year back it be a perfect match and her fingerprint be all over that paper and accord to preliminary dna test her saliva seal the envelope it come in rough day ally yeah as a matter of fact it be it be a rough night too now that you mention it you want to know why or be you already ahead of I on that one well if you be refer to the fact that Sara 's husband appear to be give more than just dictation to his comely young assistant yeah I guess I be ahead of you Truth be tell I 've be ahead of you all along but you get to understand there be a reason I have not be truthful with you Sara 's pregnant your dad say she be three week along she do not even know yet I hate this so now what what be I I be about to take she out to dinner and tell she that her husband be a cheater I have no idea what I be suppose to do now your dad really do not want you to have that dinner he swear that once Sara learn that she be pregnant once she and Ryan realize they be go to be parent that will go a long way to fix their marriage that he will end the affair he say your dad say they will actually be happy so he do not want I to tell she your father 's absolutely convinced that if Sara find out that Ryan 's be cheat on her they will be a big blowup that will be it for they they will do the kind of damage that can not be undo baby or no baby that be why your father lie to I and that be why you can not tell Sara that Ryan 's be cheat on her wait where be you go you be not go to say anything to she be you well I get to tell she that we be not go to dinner and the rest of it I get to sleep on it be you really sure I be not go to wind up on some security camera they tape over that footage all the time nobody be even go to notice the car there for week believe I Harmony it be all go to be okay all right I be almost do here just do like we say dump the car and I will pick you up at Terminal Two okay we be just a few week away from the midterm election and polling datum indicate that the incumbent Republicans will be lucky to escape 2006 with their what be go on you okay it be nothing just a bad dream you need to call anyone no it be something that happen back in 2006 there be nothing we can do about it now I think she be wake up well hello there it be nice to have you back you 've be unconscious for some time you be in a terrible accident now do not try to speak we have to wire your jaw shut now I be afraid your internal injury be quite serious and your facial tissue have be through some serious trauma you nearly lose all the skin on your face and some of the underlie bone be compromise as well but it be go to be okay tell she it be go to be okay a team of plastic surgeon be fly in they be go to work from old photograph of you it be go to take some time and a number of operation but the good news be we believe eventually you will look just like your old self we have a long road ahead of we Brooke you should rest please do not try to speak Doctor can I have a moment with my sister of course Harmony listen to I they find you in Brooke 's car they think you be Brooke you know my mom love Brooke if you be Brooke we would have all the money we would ever need all this the accident the operation they want to do it kind of feel like fate do not it sorry it be so hot in here the air conditioning have be temperamental the last couple day I think it may have finally give out altogether let I know if you want more not to worry so why be we here where be Dylan do he know about this actually no give his history of involvement with everyone we want to talk to you first we 've find Harmony Fletcher and what be more we be virtually certain that we can prove that she be responsible at least in part for the murder of Felicia Hoyt you be joke where be she how do you ever find she we do not have to look very hard we know exactly what you do Harmony be you be you just talk to I that be crazy we know all about the accident all about the reconstructive surgery we know who you really be Harmony you be serious it be a hell of a story lucky for we we can prove it what be he do your fingerprint be on that glass DNA from your lip too and I be fairly certain that when we test they they be go to come back a perfect match for Harmony Fletcher be I wrong we know that Dylan kill the real Brooke three year ago they get in a fight about money thing get out of hand the two of you conspire to get rid of the body the DNA evidence tell we that you kill Felicia Hoyt the one thing we do not know be why and if you be willing to testify about Dylan 's complicity about both these murder I will just think about take the death penalty off the table please feel free to exercise your right to remain silent but you should know that I be offer the same deal to Dylan so you will need to decide rather quickly whether or not you believe your brother will keep quiet if his life be on the line I have to kill Felicia because of her kidney she need a transplant she keep press I to get test to see if I be a compatible donor of course I could not do that the test would prove in an instant that I be not really her daughter she do not understand why I would not help she how could she only daughter just let she die it get nasty between we she threaten to cut I off and you could not let that happen Harmony Fletcher you be under arrest for the murder of Felicia Hoyt you have the right to remain silent anything you say can and will be use against you in a court of law how go the hunt for a new place to live that be encourage if I tell you something promise not to roll your eye I do not roll my eye you 've be roll your eye my whole life you should have say something soon 'cause I have no idea that I be do it I miss my husband there you just do it again Sara I know it sound crazy right what be

little shopping trip shop I do not pretend to understand exactly what it be that Caitlyn do but I be pragmatic enough to see that it work and now I find you Allison Caitlyn tell I you have quite a gift yes that be what she keep tell I too I will try to not you down no u will not because I have enormous confidence in you this corporation thrive because we excel at two thing innovation and secrecy we breed the next generation of idea and then we manage and we cultivate those idea confident that our competitor have no clue what we be up to so naturally that create a lot of temptation for our employee it would be very easy for someone to supplement their income by leak company secret to the press or to one of our competitor these our employee dossier I would like you to spend some time with they see if there be anyone among this group that give you pause I would be very anxious to hear what you have to say Ariel I do not believe it you get a perfect score in math I do not even think that be possible it be just a practice test still I hate you it be your fault you know it be those pill I do not know I look the pill too and I only get a 488 no I mean without those pill there be no way I would be able to do this there be no way I would be able to focus or concentrate that remind I I be go to need some more look I do not think I can I just give you a bunch I do not refill my prescription till next week how about just one I do not have one you know my father count these stop look at I like that you be forget I actually need this stuff I do not get it I think this be about you be upset over Stacey Anne you be not still upset about she be you look all right but I can only give you two more this be the last time seriously thank you thank you okay I give up I be sorry do you say something I say I give up try to figure out what be go on in that brain of yours I can not read your expression well my expression that be uh Exhaustion and amazement this have be an incredible day you be happy no I be miserable you be buy I clothe buy I a car I get to meet Mr Lydecker he be pretty impressive be not he he be one of the most charismatic uh intimidate fascinating tell I about it you know I see he cry I be sorry well we be sit in his office and I have a I mean he be just sob it be as if someone have die have you ever see anything like that I 've work for the man for almost a decade and no you must be very good I think that this be one insight that you should probably keep out of your log yes of course see anything Nope Yep Dad Ariel I think she be come can I borrow it hey ask I how my first day be you be smile I be sorry do you say something I say you be smile oh I guess I be I actually have a pretty wonderful day I can not believe I hesitate to take this job everyone there be so nice I mean not that everybody at the district attorney 's office be not nice but it be kind of refreshing not to ponder death and evil every day so what now Dreams of new product and profit and loss statement we can only hope we can only hope 750 Wick Ave APT B Sleep tight I see it Lee someone texte he the address of Autumn Colville 's apartment but he do not kill she he just clean up after whoever do you sound like what I be say be absurd I know there be a reason for that Allison why would Brad auerbach the guy who be head up the task force to catch this butcher drive out in the middle of the night and cut up body into easily disposable piece for he do not make sense I do not know maybe he know the killer and he be try to protect he maybe he be getting pay for it what difference do it make Lee he be do it no sorry you be talk about Brad Auerbach you be talk about a fellow detective okay look I get it you respect the guy and and maybe I be crazy but there have get to be a way that you can look into this without set off alarm without embarrass yourself if you could just ask he about the bag there there be this case that he be use this big rolling black bag he put all his tool in it everything he need to clean up it be like a a salesman 's case or do not say hi to Lynn do not do that a big black case I will try thank you hello Joe hi this be Bill Whitaker Ashley 's dad uh we meet at one of those uh parent teacher tng do you have a minute and this be the only employee that you be worried about well he be really the only person who jump out at I I mean he be the only person I have a strong response to a strong negative response it be it be hard to put into word so there be nothing specific nothing that you can put your finger on just just a kind of darkness towards the company towards you I be sorry I wish I have more to offer I really do not even know what he es for the company Most of the information in his file be black out with a marker that be quite all right I be very familiar with this particular employee I appreciate your input I will handle this matter personally when Mr Lydecker say he be go to handle something personally what do that mean what do it mean it mean that if he suspect someone of be dislol that person usually find themselves be transfer off of our key project basically they be bench until their contract run out usually they get the message before then and move on so if I share my impression about someone I could ruin their career be you worried about that kid you point out relax Nothing be go to happen to he he be kind of a special case he be Justin Lydecker Mr Lydecker 's son oh my God I just accuse the ceo 's son of of be exactly who he be trust I Allison you be not the first person to point out that Justin Lydecker be never go to become the employee of the month he be kind of a running joke around here the poster boy for just say yes to anything drug club lot of day Justin do not even bother to show up around here I do not know why Mr Lydecker even bother to keep he around I know he use to think that one day maybe Justin would take over for he now I think he pray that kid live to see 30 Mrs Dubois your husband call several time he say he need to speak with you as soon as possible thank you excuse I be not you guy suppose to be at work I get a call from Ashley 's father today he be convinced that his daughter be share her antianxiety medication with you tell we this be not true or that there be some aspect of it that we do not understand it be complicated I will bet it be it be not for fun or anything there be nothing fun about it I just the PSATs be come up and there be this girl and she will not leave I alone and she will not let I study or concentrate wait a second hold on hold on what girl Stacey Anne Burrows okay so you take drug that make no sense not drug it be like you say it be Ashley 's prescription and she take it so she can concentrate and that be why I take it and it work she leave I alone Stacy Anne just Wha wha what be I miss Stacey Anne be she dead I be 14 when I first start steal beer to push the voice down to keep the ghost away I hate this I already live through this once why do she have to live through it I want to be smart about this we need to be smart about this of course Lee Jeez buddy what the hell be you do here at this hour it be a good thing I get a change of underwear inside New development in the case I be in the area know you be just get off detail Thought I would take a shot at 2 00 in the morning you sure you be not wait for I it seem like maybe you be wait for I yeah well I guess maybe I be maybe I be wait for you all right so what be the big break turn out it be a team two guy one guy do the deed the other he come in after the fact gets rid of the body clean up know what he be do too leave the place forensically spotless okay and where have you get this I mean who be you talk to that I be not talk to why you want a name yeah I want a name I want to talk to the guy 'cause I get to say that do not sound right I mean I 've hear of serial killer work in pair before you know like thrill killer take turn but nothing like what you be describe no it do not make sense I mean what be in it for the guy who clean I do not know money maybe maybe the guy do not make that much maybe the guy be a cop well that be nuts yeah well the thing be I need to look in that case Brad I you think it be I I think I need to look in that case what be you do man have you lose your mind it be I it be Brad well then the case do not matter fine I be not a good forgetter Lee just so you know when this be over I be not a good forgetter yeah Lee it be Allison be you all right yeah yeah I be fine my God I just have the most horrible dream Detective Auerbach shoot you yeah well not to worry your dream be wrong Detective Auerbach do not kill I I kill he you okay I do not know Manny 's go to tell we in a minute he be be on the phone for an hour the governor the chief of police forensic you be still shake no I be fine good news Forensics just finish it be preliminary analysis on the item from that black case in Auerbach 's garage for starter there be a power see with trace of skin blood and bone on the blade obviously we still need to make a dna match with the victim but um from the sound of it I think you be go to be okay maybe even well than okay everybody be on board the mayor the governor the chief of police you be a hero Lee the guy draw on I I be no hero sorry it take I so long to hear you it be okay I be just happy you be alive we be all just happy that you be alive do not seem fair we can review Brad 's bank statement check out his phone log see if we can figure out who his sick partner be but if nothing shake loose I do not just kill a bad cop I shoot the only guy on the planet who can definitely tell we who our killer be you scare I sorry I be out most of the night stuff from my old job when I finally get back here I could not get to sleep I just keep think think about you hey I want you to go to the doctor but it have to be somebody who know about I about how I be hopefully have some kind of sympathy for how difficult it can be I do not think I get what you be say I do a little research on that medicine you be take it be pretty common a lot of people take it the web site say that the side effect be very minimal only I start wonder what high school would have be like for I if I have a drug like that people to talk to what I be awake right hey I still think what you do be incredibly reckless incredibly dangerous you can never do that again and part of I can not even believe that we be have this conversation but Daddy and I talk and if the doctor think that medication will improve the quality of your life Mom can I ask you something if you can not get I an appointment right away can I just use the rest of Ashley 's pill just to get I through the test no Honey we promise we would give those pill back to Ashley 's parent and until a doctor tell we that there be a medicine that make sense for you but I promise that I will try to get that appointment as soon as possible and until then well I be a good listener so do you want early breakfast or do you want to sleep another 30 minute sleep okay Mom Shove over when do you realize he be my son Caitlyn tell I why do you look so frightened do I look frightened yes you look terrified and why be you stand by the door come into the room have a seat I go to see Justin yesterday I tell he I have some concern about

water cooler here at Lydecker everybody know you do the same thing that Caitlyn do and honestly I think they be a little surprised that my dad would bring in another six figure napper there be far more to my job than take nap your father be interested in my impression of thing people which be why I think he want I to sit down with you yeah that be what I figure he want you to tell he if his only son be permanently screw up or if I can be salvage that be not exactly the way he put it no but that be what he want to know and honestly I can not really blame he I 've spend most of the last decade disappoint the man dui assault charge all those stint in rehab I mean it be it be hardly a secret that I 've be a total disaster for a long time look I know that my dad do not trust I I can not blame he but I be 26 year old and my great accomplishment in life be be sleep with a girl who come in second place on a reality show I guess I be just tired of be a joke and all that dark stuff be in the past and I want to change I have change look I have to be honest with you I do not really believe in what you do but I know that my dad do so please I would really appreciate it if you would tell

keep this conversation to yourself just do not give I a reason to behave in way that will make both of we very unhappy well I do not know I be not a lawyer but this contract look pretty ironclad to I

Allison well the way that I read that thing I be not even suppose to be have this conversation with you okay be that as it may if Junior really be under a doctor 's care in some foreign country then the immediate danger be go there be really not all that much to talk to Devalos about and as for get you out of there get you out of your contract I mean I think that the only thing to do be to start look for an attorney in the morning I be psychic why do not I see this come how could I have be so stupid do not do that you take the job for all the right reason and do not forget you have a lot of help I encourage you I push you to take it come on let us just get some rest for one thing we get Ariel 's doctor appointment in the morning for another maybe it will give we some clarity maybe thing

save your life you be try to save your business daddy you be try to save your reputation it be not good for the stock price if people read that the CEO 's son like to julienne pretty young girl and

not get on a plane without they all know where I be go Mexico City the plane will land in Mexico City a car will be wait to bring you to I Allison what be happen here be horrible I really need you Allison thank you for come I want to fill you in on what be happen here but I already know what happen here no I do not think that you do apparently a radical terrorist faction be able to infiltrate Mr Lydecker 's security force here at his vacation compound they slaughter he Allison Douglas Lydecker be butcher by zealous anti capitalist determine to create chaos in the Western World and its financial market really and do they carve his eye out why be you protect he why be you protect this monster it be not about he it be about Lydecker Industries and the ten of thousand of people who work there and the hundred of thousand of people who own stock Allison public appetite public perception those be the thing that I know a lot about you tell the world that the son kill the father and you 've sully the Lydecker name forever that be the kind of scanda l that will destroy the company kill sale crater the stock price but you tell the world that this be the work of terrorist well you can not buy the public sympathy and goodwill that will engender People will rally around the company they will feel that it be their duty to do so and what about Justin he be still out there what be to say he will not kill again I be take care of it I be go to find Justin and I will deal with he in a way that do not hurt the company or either of we Us what do you mean we Us you and I all of our fate be tie to Justin at this point we have all help to cover his crime if Justin be ever implicate in this murder I have no doubt that he will happily detail everything we 've do to help he elude the authority so I suggest you wipe that disapprove look off your face and get on board we be in this together Allison and the soon you realize that the well I love you Young lady First row eye front I think that you really need to go now Garrett no please I love you I do not understand do not that mean anything to you Garrett do not do this I be as low as I can possibly be not that it matter to you but this this girl that I be tutor privately for the PSATs she die in a car accident a couple week ago drown today be the memorial and no I just I need to be by myself I need to not be worry about you I need you to go please do not make I call somebody I be sorry about the girl but I be stay here I be sleep here put it down put it down go do not forget to get a good night 's sleep folk Tomorrow 's the big day Miss Snowden yes do you know somebody name Garrett I I be sorry wh what be your name Young lady I be talk to you you seem to know some thing about I and I would like to know how and I would like to know your name Sir Allison what be you do here Douglas Lydecker 's son I know I should 've tell you soon I debate with myself all the way home on the plane and then I land I call Joe he tell I to drive right over here from the airport I be so sorry you do what you have to do to protect your family I understand that you be be threaten by Douglas Lydecker that be a formidable threat he might still be alive today if I just ignore he and come right to you so what happen now I really do not know if the Lydecker boy be truly at large in a foreign country the first step would be to try to extradite he and that be almost impossible to do without concrete physical evidence you can not do anything not at the moment I may talk to Justice ask some friend of mine there to take a second and third look at this terrorist thing with an especially jaundiced eye but what I 've be quake in anticipation of this conversation Douglas Lydecker convince I that the second that I even utter his son 's name to you the earth be just go to open up and swallow I and my family whole but nothing be different now that we have this conversation nothing Nothing 's go to happen except I know that Justin Lydecker be go to kill again all of we here at the Lydecker Corporation be obviously still reel with the news of the death of our founder and CEO Douglas Lydecker but I want to reassure all of our investor our customer and our employee around the globe that our business operation will continue without interruption I believe to do anything less would be to suggest that the savagery that end this great industrial titan 's life be somehow effective and that our founder 's belief in the power of idea to create worthwhile product and meaningful employment be somehow misplace of course nothing could be far from the truth thank you and that be the scene at a hastily call press conference in Mexico today where Caitlyn well I be glad somebody 's happy about all this Devalos actually say there be nothing he could do well he need evidence he need Justin to come back to America the first he do not have and the second be never go to happen so he be right there be nothing to do except of course for I to find a lawyer to get I out of this Lydecker contract but hey that be why God invent tomorrow can I talk to you for a second I do not know what to do but I just do not believe that he would hurt she not kill she anyway and I just I leave I run away I mean she do not know my name or anything and she be just a substitute but I feel like an idiot I do not know how I be go to go in that classroom tomorrow and take that test with her stand there you think maybe that be the point you think maybe Stacey Anne just want to play a big joke on I try and get I to embarrass myself with the teacher who be go to proctor the test I have no idea honey but you be go to walk in that classroom you be go to take that test obviously I will just be mortify I will just slink in with my head down and sit in the back and hope that somehow she do not notice I do not say anything what be you say that you might want to take one of those pill no I do not think so I think the bad be over I think Stacey Anne be do with I I think that the hard part 's go to be walk through the door go ahead pick an artery pop which one do you want I to start with how about the carotid huh that be always a winner for I Diane be you out there why be someone knock on my door she know what Caitlyn know Justin be go to kill his father she know it before I do but she do not do anything to stop it you know what no it be good to have you back no how be your flight just you know so what do I know Allison what be it that you think that I know that Justin be go to kill his father when I come here that day to tell you he be not take his medication you already know you have dream it you you you just let it happen that be quite an accusation so what now now you be just run the place well temporarily ultimately that will be up to the board but presume I do a good job Allison this will be good for you too I understand well than most what a valuable asset you can be I understand what a real value you be to a company like our you let Mr Lydecker die I see it Caitlyn I be onto you and I be not go to let you get away with it get away with what exactly I mean even if you be accurate about any of this you still have not suggest that I actually do anything have you I mean all that might have happen be maybe I have a dream and do not tell anyone that be what you be say right that be not a crime now I need to freshen up have a little contemplation time oh I be think in maybe about an hour we will have a little meeting you I some of the division leader I have some big plan I be go to lay out do you even know where he be Justin he be dangerous you tell I you be go to do something about he no actually I have no idea that be part of what I be count on you for Allison you seem to have a special dream connection with he Caitlyn you be 11 00 be here Allison I need you to go I need to get on with my day oh Allison remember you be still under contract here and I expect you to honor the same level of confidentiality that exist before Mr Lydecker pass on or face the same consequence please take a moment to complete the personal information in section a take one test booklet and pass the rest to the person behind you and your 25 minute begin now eye front no talk Julie come on open the door I know you be in there it be Wednesday 10 30 it be a school night do not pretend you can

counsel become quite talkative when I take the death penalty off the table he share some very interesting information about you apparently you know all about his intention towards his father say he discuss it with you at length that you have tip he off in advance that his father plan to transport he to Mexico and that you even suggest that that might be the perfect place for he to kill his father that you know you could pay off the right official to make it look like an act of terror let I make sure I understand you be accuse I of some sort of crime base on the word of an admit serial killer well if that be all you have I be quite confident that my attorney 's will make short work of these accusation actually our case do not hinge on Justin 's word as much as on the combine content of his voice mail inbox here at Lydecker his personal cell phone text message record and the testimony of some of the official that you pay off in Mexico so do you want to take a moment to make that phone call to your attorney now or would you prefer to wait till we get downtown I would prefer to make that call now if you do not mind not a problem Mrs Dubois and I will wait outside oh Allison I

man the same dead body I be look at with Devalos when I collapse well you know what we need to do we need to find out who the hell this Todd Emory be accord to this you be in theame hospital as my wife they think he be in a coma but then he disappear and they can not figure out how a6 last see shortly after 11 00 a m lie comatose in his bed 11 00 a m be not that around the time that you um that you go into your coma yes okay all right our friend Todd got hit by a car two night ago I guess he run out in the middle of a dark road in the wood and that be what put he into his coma at this point

can you tell he I be here and all the rest of it listen if not nothing venture nothing gain okay I do not think that be such a good idea what do you mean well because if I give this to Devalos u know this new you in a oh well we have to do something what if I wake up as Todd Emory because I be suppose to bring he to justice for murder that John Doe no but the way it stand right now you would not be bring Todd Emory to justice you would be bring yourself no I do not think so yes no I I I think that if the police can prove that Todd Emory murder that man in the park everything be go to go back

return she in exchange for 2 million contact the police and she will die yeah ransom note pretty cute huh 11 year ago Bethany Simmons ' kidnapper send this note to her parent the police recover a partial fingerprint but they could never figure out who it belong to so he just get away with 2 million yup what do you get a set of encyclopedia what be with all these book on San Diego I meet my new boss today what do you want I to say well I do not know Allison what do you want I to say a guy offer I a job do something that I desperately want to do at a time in history when no one no one be getting offer any kind of a job and yeah holy crap there be a little you know there be some inconvenience and there be you know some sacrifice involve no you be right you be right all right you know I be sorry I bring it up come on that be not fair I mean Ariel 's go to be a junior next year she be go to be she be go to be apply for college in two year okay you be not say anything that I do not say and you know I have a job too do you think I forget he say he would help with that that be what I do I just I do not think that we can just say no I mean it might be a beautiful grand wonderful adventure New house New climate new friend there be bad thing no I hear that I just I want you to sleep on it I mean I want to sleep on it that be right Mr Devalos I uh I just get off the phone with her Mexico Ixtapa what do she say she say that she need a little bit of time to think about we think about our marriage I do not know my head be spin I be upset I be embarrassed I know I make an ass of myself in your office no no you have nothing to be sorry for I apologize I have your wife I will return she in exchange for 10 million contact the police and she die I guess the important thing be um my wife 's just fine wait a second now you be tell I that Christopher Sipes ' wife Amy have be kidnap yes sir and I be almost certain that she be take by the same man who abduct Bethany Simmons 11 year ago the ransom note be almost identical to this one and not only that I think that the kidnapper may have recently cross path with Bethany Simmons I think he recognize she and I think he do something terrible to her well this be all very interesting Allison except for one thing Christopher Sipes have never contact we about any kidnapping of course not he be afraid to read that card again contact the police and she will die this be ridiculous Amy be fine I discuss this with you yesterday she be she be in Mexico and we hear you but if by chance she be not fine if by chance there be something else go on well there be nothing else go other than she be look for a little bit of peace little bit of solitude then would you mind terribly if we contact she just to confirm that yeah in fact I would the woman want to be leave alone she be try to decide whether or not she want to be married to I all right so I think you two would understand that I do not want to upset she I do not want to jeopardize that if you would like when she get back I will have she call your office so unless there be anything else you guy actually there be we do not believe that your wife be spend time alone we think she may have be abduct we think the man who take she may have kidnap someone else Mr Sipes if you will not involve the authority wi yr wife 's case then it be far less likely we will ever know what happen to this other victim I be sorry to hear that but what do you want I to say my wife be not miss so there be no case in which to involve you I be home you want to hear something weird I want to the pizza store and they be all out of pizza he give I this empty pizza box to take home so I would stop cry look he trick I that be not funny bad Mommy right Ooh bad Mommy hey honey where be Ariel and your daddy well Ariel 's in her room and well Daddy 's packing for California Daddy be go to California California I think we have this conversation well we say we would sleep on it

Enforcement Agency Miraculously he be manage to get inside one of the cartel 's operation right here in Phoenix no law enforcement agency have ever have a man in so deep with one of these organization well that be great when be the last time anyone actually hear from he well when a man be work that deep undercover he can not be expect to check in with any regularity now that man that you see torture he yeah the one with the burn scar on his face oh my God this be he I be afraid of that Oswaldo Castillo he be uh he be be the cartel 's top enforcer for year now he specialize in the assassination of mexican politician and judge we 've suspect for a long while that the cartel have station he here in Arizona but um no one be be able to lay eye on he his presence here would

second where have you come up with this I hire another private detective you be tell I you hire another private eye to hunt for Oswaldo Castillo after the last one take all your money and disappear do you not understand that I do this for a living well accord to he this Cruz be some kind of mob doctor he treat wound cartel soldier after hour in his clinic if we could just get in there if we could get into his file he be get to have some kind of a way to contact his patient not necessarily if in fact he be even really Castillo 's doctor if in fact he be even go to see he in the last year or ten year or whatever not to mention the fact that you be talk about Mexico I have no jurisdiction in Mexico you know that and even if I do we do not know that any of this be true I be sorry the good I can do be to pass this doctor name along to the mexican authority that be the good you can do look into his eye and you tell I that you give a damn about jurisdiction look at he this be the man who murder your wife this be the man who massacre my family no hello no you do not wake I it be only 8 30 yes Mr District Attorney wherever you need I to go what be I look at do you remember the police officer who be work undercover the one you be so concerned about that be he in the cooler in about a dozen piece this be uh this be his house oh my God that poor woman unfortunately this be pretty standard stuff for these cartel target the family of their enemy of law enforcement agent make people think twice about investigate they the DEA 's go to be set up a task force in our office until this be solve if it be all right with you I would like to introduce you to my colleague on the federal side he be the guy who be go to be run their whole show believe it or not he lose his wife to a cartel car bomb just a few week ago they murder his wife Agent Munoz Special Agent Daniel Munoz I would like you to meet Allison Dubois who know how to love you without be tell Daniel Munoz that be his name Special Agent Daniel Munoz he be completely real I know I hear you I hear you I hear you he be real Joe I do not make he up he work for the DEA not only that they murder his wife who who murder this guy 's wife Oswaldo Castillo he do it with a car bomb he be a professional killer he work for this drug cartel he be the one that I see torture that detective this be it this be what he do he kill people he kill people 's family well say something and we be next right I and the kid we be next that be where you be go right why do you say this like it be a question I be sorry Allison I do not know how to continue this conversation unless it be a question how do you want I to continue like it be a certainty my death my child 's death they be absolutely certain well hey let us just go get the cyanide and end it all right now what the hell do you want I to do Allison come on be not it enough that my life be over but now you be upset with I because I be not react to it properly what be it you want I to do what be it I want you to do what be it I want you to do I want you to get your ass out of that damn bed and I want you to keep we safe I want you to act like you give a damn like what I be say matter to you of course it matter to I it completely matter but I do not know what to tell you to do about it if you be already convince that do anything be useless and I do not think that wake the kid by yell at each other be the answer either there be five ice chest each with a different piece of that police detective in it I understand and I believe you I do I absolutely believe you but I also believe that stand out in the sun too long be go to give I cancer but I will be damn if the kid and I be go to spend the rest of our life hide in the dark what kind of an answer be that that be the only answer I have Allison I can not believe that our fate be seal I can not Life be about choice you 've just get to make the right one well what be they okay let us say you be right let us say that we be a target for these cartel people because you work in law enforcement okay then the answer be pretty simple you got to stop work in law enforcement you be right of course I be right I get to quit I mean I know Devalos be count on I but I have to quit and I have to make sure that they know that I do that be right for the sake of your family that be what you have to do absolutely I mean there be no other choice be there I mean if you be convinced that we be in danger if you be absolutely certain of it no yeah you you got to go into work tomorrow you get to knock on Devalos ' door and you got to say I resign for the safety of my family of course if you be convinced that we be all go to die anyway what be the point which be why the choice that I would advocate involve two thing first that you embrace the possibility that these thing that you be dream about might not be set in stone and secondly secondly that you do your job you do your job as if your life depend on it as if your family 's life depend on it and then then you might be able to find this guy this Oswaldo Castillo Oswaldo Castillo you find he and you put he away you put the people that he work for away and then there be no reason for anyone to kill your family anymore and there be no one leave around to do it you sleep here it be Allison right well I be impress Allison None of my agent ever beat I into the office oh I be so sorry do not be my wife 's murder be part of this case so be this how it work your thing you look at a file hope something come to you to be perfectly honest I have no idea

you free would you care to sit in on something hey as long as it do not involve physical therapy I be in after you Dr House there be no big sun supporter than I no big fan in the Phoenix metro area but I would be lie if I say I be happy about this late round of trade fib if I tell you that I think it be good for anyone except some accountant who be work in the Suns ' back office and good accounting rarely make for good basketball I be Sophie Cullen and I be your girl in the locker room see what I be talk about he be stalk she he be stalk she with his camera stalk we these be public street Dan and film a newscast off your television might be a little strange but I do not think it be illegal wait you get the idea how many of these dvd do Miss Cullen receive half dozen or so but as you can see he be get more brazen I mean he be no long just videotape she in the street he be pursue she in store and restaurant he be peep I mean both of we fear it be only a matter of time before he show up at her door and I will not lie to you it be take its toll on both of we I be sorry I be confused about the relationship uh you be the station manager Owner Dan Mr Taper own several television station yeah a couple of newspaper too you know anyone who want to buy one in answer to your question Miss Cohen be my employee she be also my wife have be for a little over a year this fellow we know where he live we know who he be that be his name and address I really feel we be deal with some form of mental illness here and I just think it would be helpful before something get out of hand before something horrible happen if someone from this office somebody from the police department could pay this fellow a visit put he on notice make it clear to he he be be watch I get a pretty full slate today but I would be happy to pay he a visit tomorrow you back on the clock should I pick you up in the morning well I do not know be I back on the clock tomorrow hey hey do not look now but Marie got

that you drive there when half your body still do not work well I do not think it be important to discuss it with you because honestly I think it be very unlikely that he would offer I anything why he like you you work there for year why would not he want you back okay well let us start with the fact that I can no long do that clever little parlor trick that he use to find so useful and like you say half my body do not work this be not how it be suppose to go you should be devote your time to get well build your health I should be the one that get a job not you Honey we have be through this

this little flicker in my head well I do not like the sound of that no no no it be good it be like see a teeny tiny piece of the future like see a sliver of something that be go to happen it be Devalos and he keep say something to I over and over again and then it stop and then he actually say it okay well it feel like it be come from the same place in my dream and the thing I use to be able to do come from like maybe it be maybe it be heal maybe it be come back well you do not look pleased I guess I be just get use to the idea of this this new you you do not sound like you like the old I very much come on that be not fair you do not like the old you very much either that thing you be call a gift it bring an awful lot of darkness with it to you to I to everyone in this house can you

they what be you talk about the tagger they be on the tape anyone around this apartment would be on that tape oh my God Lee ah Miss Cullen thank you for join we you be just in time we be about to

guess he must have shut it off when he be entertain you or else you would 've see it even though it be night even though you be wear sunglass I be quite sure that a jury will have no problem believe it be you and what will that prove it will prove you be a liar for one thing a liar perhaps but not a killer you be quite right about that Miss Cullen we have no proof that you take your husband 's life not yet but I do take the liberty of send this footage to every news outlet in the city include by the way the one that you own or own apparently it be go to be a huge story a public figure in an adulterous relationship with the man she claim to be her stalker we also make sure that your late husband 's family get to see the footage they have some interesting thing to say they tell we that you and your late husband sign prenuptial agreement and it turn out that even the appearance of an adulterous relationship be enough to render those agreement null and void by the way they ask I to ask you to do they the courtesy of skip the funeral they say there will be plenty of time to catch up when they see you in court to contest the estate be there anything else be I free to go you can go but I be not sure how uh free you will feel I be reopen the investigation into your husband 's death you be the main suspect thank for come in it be good to have you back it be good to be here I do not

Allison I do not know investigate file charge help I find and arrest this nurse that I see in my dream but the death certificate clearly indicate that your friend die from natural cause sudden respiratory failure I have to believe that if some nurse do give your friend a drug that kill she there would be evidence to that effect and that it would be apparent to either her doctor or the people at the hospital well not necessarily not if they be not look for it can not you just order an autopsy base on what look I be sorry you lose your friend but she be battle stage four cancer that be not what kill she even if you be right about that my hand be tie no crime have be report even the family of the alleged victim be not complain the hospital have rule on the cause of death if you want someone to revisit that judgment you be go to have to convince someone there Dr Statler hello again Allison Dubois we I save your life you give I a nickel for it I be sorry I be really busy be there something I can do for you there be nothing out of the ordinary in this chart well of course not the drug responsible for end my friend 's life would not have be record on that chart that be why I need you to authorize an autopsy look I think that Rosemary meet with foul play that be uh that be quite an outrageous accusation Mrs Dubois do you have any basis for it no I be just take Rosemary 's word for it look I know you be very busy and I know you be very good at what you do but it just so happen I be pretty good at what I do too look I up here be my card call I tell I you will do it hey Joe look like we both make it to round two must have be that water bottle trick how be the other guy look oh this no there be no other guy I wake up in the middle of the night and you know I trip over my dog and I go smack into the the bathroom door my wife actually she try to convince I to use some of makeup to cover it up but your wife Tess yeah do do I mention she the other day yeah tess she uh she try to get I to use something call concealer I mean have you hear of this stuff it be it be what be that say about woman that they carry around this stuff call concealer go away JOE hey oh

work he be married to a woman name tess and as far as I can tell she do sock he in the eye Tess want money it be all she ever really care about and when Willem could not give she enough she find herself another man his name be Carlo laugh what so be we suppose to believe that this lady be cheat on her husband 'cause he can not find a job I mean nobody can find a job hello STATLER I look you up Mrs Dubois apparently you be usually pretty good at what you do so I call the Widdick family I be able to convince they to let we perform an autopsy on Rosemary I be look at the result right now that be terrific yeah well you tell I we find no unusual substance in her system just the medication we prescribe we do find that her cancer have spread even far than her primary oncologist suspect her kidney be pretty much go her heart valve be not clear and her lymphatic system be compromise Mrs Dubois I I do not know what to tell you but this woman die because her body be consume with cancer not because someone give she a drug that kill she I be just surprised Mrs Dubois I be sorry you lose your friend perhaps know that she die of natural cause will make it easy to accept thank you help I it hurt Pain do not worry I 've already give you something that be go to make all of that go away Dr Bench prescribe something new it be very powerful stuff trust I try and relax you be not the first patient I 've administer this to that be it get some sleep it be all right dear it be your time what be so riveting hmm Ooh be not that handsome Dr Statler the man who save your life he do he save my life do not he mm hmm yes he do why I 've be up here 4 00 in the morning try to read everything I can about he try to convince myself be there something you want to tell I I think he kill Rosemary I think he do it on purpose wait a second do not you say a nurse do it you say that you see a nurse do it I say Rosemary see a nurse do it I think she she think she do but as it turn out the nurse be just give she a painkill Statler slip in there later and kill she in her sleep at least that be what I dream well why do not we talk about that for a second you just start dream again after be in a coma for month after week of have no dream at all be it possible that what you see do not happen I that be what I be hope I would love to be wrong anyway you know what this I think you get some e mail or something this mail symbol keep flash hey uh I hate to shatter a horrible mood with good news but it be Drew he say the interview go great they love I they be put together an offer I might have a job Michael Crawford 340 Mr Carlisle Sorry to shanghai you after your lunch um my name 's Allison Dubois I be with the district attorney 's office I be also a patient here I be hope maybe I could have a few minute of your time that be quite a story I want you to understand that I admire Dr Statler I Dr Statler save my life but I 've be do research on his career this morning and be you aware that before Dr Statler come to work here you never have more than nine death a year from sudden respiratory failure sudden respiratory failure it be what be list here on my friend Rosemary 's death certificate it be kind of a catchall phrase right Basically mean we really do not know what happen here Medicine be still as much an art as it be a science and yes sometimes it can be difficult to pinpoint a precise cause of death but that do not mean there be any question about whether the cause be natural or not I be sorry Mrs Dubois your point my point be after Dr Statler come to work for you the number of death you have attribute to sudden respiratory failure go from nine a year to 20 that be just in his first year twenty 20 death and almost all of they in the oncology ward and the year after that there be 25 that be almost three time the national average and and after that what be we do here who be I talk to be I talk to someone from the district attorney 's office or a grieve friend what do it matter I be ask if you be here in an official capacity or a personal one do the district attorney even know you be here what difference do it make something be wrong you need to begin an internal investigation Statler need to know that he be be watch I see base on a morning of look at newspaper clipping and comb through internet gossip you 've decide to come over here and tell I how to run my hospital Mr Carlisle Mrs Dubois I be certain that in all that research you do you must have ascertain that Thomas Statler the man who save your life be one of the most respected oncologist in this country this be a man who have dedicate himself to treat people other have deem untreatable Patients of mean people who could afford to go anywhere come to this hospital because he be here because of his reputation because of his expertise he kill my friend I will not listen to this he kill a lot of other people I will thank you to leave my office I think you would feel differently if somebody you love be in his care it might interest you to know that when my wife be diagnose with Hodgkin 's two year ago the only person I would allow to treat she be Dr Thomas Statler he keep she alive and comfortable for month long than other doctor even suggest she would survive so I hope you believe I when I tell you that if you do not cease and desist with this slandering of his good name and the good name of this hospital I will marshal all the resource of this institution and take you to court and make sure that yu and your dream never defame anyone again hello oh hey Drew yeah what do you mean they go another way your e mail say that they love I your e mail say they be they be go to make an offer hey Dad hi Dad okay hi Dad hi Dad all right okay no no no I be not hi Dad hi hi hi hi sweetie come on sorry my kid yeah no I be not throw I know it be it be just a number game yeah the trick be to get on out there be everything okay yeah everything be fine I just do not get that uh job that I be after that be so weird Willem get his what do you mean Willem get his well I have a dream last night Willem be get really close to this big job at NASA but he be up against this other astronaut this guy Joey and the other astronaut Joey be you serious what that be his name the other astronaut be suppose to get the job but Willem know that his wife Tess be not go to like that so he call his friend Carlo Carlo 's wait stop I think Carlo be the guy who be go over to see tess when Willem be not home he be but Willem do not know that he and Carlo have be friend forever so Carlo 's an astronaut too and Willem ask Carlo to call NASA and tell the people there that Joey be a really bad astronaut Son of a what in God 's name give you the right to judge I Dr Statler how dare you suggest to the man who run my hospital that I would do anything but deliver the fine most humane care to my patient Dr Statler can we talk about this in private where be you go I be still talk to you do not you dare walk away from I while I be speak to you or I or you will what you will decide to put I down that be what you do be not it you decide who get to live or die you decide who get care and who do not you know there be another word for that it be murder I think you murder my friend I think you murder a lot of other people really be that how you call it be that what you think of it well then you 've never be sick not really sick lie in bed watch while your fortune disappear and your family wither because there be no one there with the intelligence or the courage to make the difficult decision that need to be make in such a circumstance decision that we 've consign to insurance company and hospital board and other anonymous group who never need to look the patient or their love one in the eye and explain why they would prolong suffering when there be no hope of recovery you judge I because I be willing to do thing that other will not because I be willing to entertain mercy not murder Mercy there be nothing merciful about what you do to my friend your friend be already dead all that be leave for she be to sit and watch her body decay while her brain atrophy she be not ready to die that be her decision to make not yours sorry I beg to differ she be not qualified to make that decision she lack the intelligence and the experience unlike you unlike I the fact that you get sick do not mean you have a full understanding of what sickness really be the sad truth of it be be that nowadays if you have enough money you can keep almost anyone alive but the question be can they live I ask myself that question that night I walk into your room I consider your age your health up until that point the amount of time you would be flatline and I save your life hope you be not go to make I regret that decision you know I do not begrudge you your outrage but just to keep thing in perspective it be not like he be kill anybody who be not already at death 's door be you actually defend he no no no absolutely not this guy he be clearly a sociopath I be just try to help you accept the fact that maybe there be nothing else that you can do I mean you tell I that this guy somehow manage to do what he do without leave any evidence and the hospital clearly be not interested in you know look any hard into this I mean Statler he treat the the chief administrator 's wife right so I be suppose to do nothing no I be not say that I be say you 've already do it you know maybe you give he a good scare today maybe that will make he think twice before he be tempt to you know be merciful again I do not know he do not look scared to I I do not think he be the kind of guy who have scare on his menu President George W Bush be set to give his State of the Union address this evening with insider speculate that he will announce an increase in troop level in Afghanistan this on the heel of several I e D roadside bomb you want to see I Jerry yeah come on in close the door please Jeanette Gratz over in ICU send I an e mail today it be about you it seem that some of her nurse notice an unusually high number of patient succumb to sudden respiratory failure your patient or patient you have access to what you be wait for I to dignify this malicious gossip with a response I be not wait for anything I be obligate legally to investigate any complaint that call into question the death of anyone under our care part of that obligation be to suspend your privilege while we get to the bottom of this you be suspend I I be the head of Oncology how can you suspend I it be already do as of tomorrow morning your surgery be cancel your recuperate patient have be assign to other doctor in the unit if the investigation turn up nothing you will be immediately reinstate if you choose to stay how much debt be you in Jerry do not make a bad situation bad Tom how much do a man in your position make do you pull down a tenth of what I do a twentieth I hear you ask Micah Reese over at Pediatrics for a loan 50 000 you might want to take note of where your foot be Dr Statler the ice be get awfully thin I be just think what a shame it be that uh my privilege be null and void when you and your wife need I more than ever my wife what be you talk about well I seem to remember that Deborah come in for treatment last year a slight melanoma I know this be a personal question but I be curious how much life insurance do you have on her what be you we all go to the Christmas party Jerry we all know what happen when Deborah have one cocktail too many three cocktail too many five cocktail too many we all know that over the year she be distinguish herself with her uh willingness to sleep with any physician who would pay for a hotel room how dare you now the thing about life insurance be you have to buy it before a life threaten condition be discover let us say if you go out and buy a rather large policy on your wife today if I be to bring she back in for further test if I be to find that the melanoma have not recur but that it develop into something more serious lymphoma perhaps well then I would have to recommend that she be admit to the hospital and I know that be a very scary thought especially give the unusually high rate of mortality among my patient of course that be all moot since I do not have any privilege the fact be not in dispute here we have have numerous fatality in the oncology ward but it be after all an oncology ward these be some of the sick patient in the entire hospital population the survivability rate be the low of any single ward in the hospital this be expect and while the number of death from respiratory failure be statistically improbable they be certainly not impossible they be certainly not unprecedented Mr District Attorney I promise you I 've be through all of this since your colleague come to see I and I be convince what we be look at be a statistical anomaly not the result of some sort of kill spree by a sociopathic physician I be sorry there just be not any indication that Dr Statler 's be indulge in the kind of behavior Mrs Dubois keep accuse he of I appreciate your candor Mr Carlisle but I do not ask you down here today to discuss Dr Statler 's involvement in this rash of death you do not then what be I do here to discuss your involvement my involvement that be right before her death your wife Deborah be be treat by Dr Statler be not she yes where be we go with this well I would just like to know why you refer she to Dr Statler even though a source tell I that you receive a number of e mail from hospital staff lay out their suspicion about his practice in great detail you be talk about hospital gossip Dr Statler 's the good oncologist in this state even though you be very busy transfer everyone who complain about the good doctor to other hospital you still find time to purchase a few life insurance policy on your wife before she go to go see Statler it be almost as if you know that he be go to tell she that the melanoma be back that she would require surgery and that she would not be come home do you think I murder my wife I hope you 've get more than nurse ' chatter to back that up that be a warrant allow we to seize your computer my people be quite good at find delete file and e mail once we be able to prove that you be aware of the hospital staff 's suspicion of his practice and that you still put your wife into his care well at that point I will be ready to take my chance in court or perhaps you would like to take care of this today agree to testify against Statler if you be willing to tell we everything about the deal the two of you strike then I be willing to make a deal with you but you should know this be a limited time offer once we find what I think we be go to find in that computer then my willingness to bargain go away should take we about a day to get through those file Mr Carlisle so please give it some think nice window thank uh sorry for beat you out for the job so uh wh wh what be you do down here well I be just run some errand in the neighborhood I think I would say congratulation thank just one quick question before I go um do you know a guy name Carlo Carcetti he work for my old firm Aerodytech yeah sure Carlo and I go to graduate school together why well you know it be weird I never meet the guy he start at Aerodytech a couple week before I leave but I hear that he call this place and tell they that I botch a big project really that be what I hear that that would be a really low thing for someone to do you would have to be willing to give up every principle you ever have I mean you would have to be desperate out of work for so long you almost can not remember what it be like to have a job so break your uh marriage be fall apart right uh look be you go to make a thing out of this 'cause I be not go to just quit I really need this Frankly I need this more than I need to be able to look at myself in the mirror hey hey relax I hear they be pay you squat and I hear that this place be go to go out of business in a year if they do not get bridge funding so it be okay Job 's yours so what do you want why do you come down here believe it or not I come here to give you a head up you might want to have a conversation with Carlo about his uh friendship with your wife I think that Carlo might have his own reason for want you out of the house five day a week what be that suppose to mean well you be go to have to figure that out by yourself 'cause I get to go look for a job hey Hey Whatcha doing clean out the garage I be still officially look for work officially unemployed and clean out the garage be what the officially unemployed do so I be do it oh you be go to get another interview you will get a job I know you know that from Bridgette no no no my headhunter call he uh just want to reassure I that he be out hunt head well it may be the light in here but you actually look kinda happy I be I be happy Joe the guy who run the hospital be go to come in tomorrow to give a statement he be go to bring his lawyer in so Devalos think that mean that he be ready to cut a deal I hear the police come by today Tom I do not know you be cover the night shift tonight I switch with Pinero so it be true they confiscate your computer yeah they be ask all kind of question they 've get nothing though just a bunch of theory of course they 've get nothing there be no evidence of any crime frankly the only thing that can compromise I be you relax I do not tell they anything not in my good interest either you know how I do it Jerry how I make it seem like it be God 's work when one of my patient pass on Potassium Simple as that potassium now potassium level be almost always elevate after death anyway and if you get the dosage right no one will suspect foul play they will just assume it be some sort of sudden respiratory failure but in your case I think they will go for heart attack see it present itself differently when ingest instead of inject sometimes there be vomiting sometimes chest pain those be probably the first palpitation they be painful but

into her place through a window strangle she then leave the way he come how can you be so sure it be around 1 00 one of the neighbor hear a commotion come from the place he even call in a noise complaint by the time the squad car get there everything be quiet no one answer the door the roommate get back from sleep over at her friend 's place find she like that you have any idea what that symbol on her head mean Symbol obviously my most recent experience be with solar cell I know it be not a perfect fit for you know what you do here but I figure there be some parallel that make I a good candidate Solar huh yeah I start a company I sell it last year do your human resource department not send you down a résumé yeah I think that they probably send I something well my team and I be project sale for the company we do a lot of research into biofuel 'cause we figure they would be our big competitor in ten year or so sorry I 've just get to take a look at this real quick I be listen though yes some of the research some of the reading that I do that make I wish that I be work in the field so I you know I would love to to to Dive in with you hello no no it be good timing I just got do with the interview listen I appreciate you appreciate you set it up and everything but I do not think it go very well what do you mean the guy love I my god Joe that be fantastic when be you suppose to start human resource tell draw I could start whenever I be ready I be not work so I tell he I be ready now I guess as of tomorrow there be go to be two steady paycheck come in the house you guess you do not sound happy I think you really want this no I do I do I just I think I completely screw the interview I think the guy hate I and then they offer I the job before I could even drive off the property you know what that mean you be just that good Honey hold on a second I be not pay attention where I be go hey Al you there do I lose you Al you all right yeah honey I be fine let I call you back admit it be you you bastard Admit it be you I have be pursue the libra for ten year it become an obsession that cost I my career and my marriage and so when I go to visit john david boatner in the hospice where he lie die when he finally admit that he be the libra it be in an odd way the most intimate moment of my life and I suspect it be the most intimate moment of his life thank you there you go hi should I make it out to someone in particular actually if you 've get a minute can I ask you a question sure when this be all go on when the libra slayer be originally murder young woman I would just give birth to my second daughter and I be in the hospital I really be not pay much attention to the paper be these the sort of letter that he would send the police he use a different code for each murder and what be this that be the sign of the libra I guess you could call it his signature he carve it into each one of his victim and be this the man that you think be the libra slayer I do not think john david boatner be the libra slayer I know it be you sure be not there any other suspect I be positive I 've write three book on the subject and I personally collect ream of evidence plus he tell I he do it when I go to visit he right before he die I tell he if he do not admit that he be the libra slayer then no one would ever know that he would beat the police he tell you he do not do it you give he a cigarette he tell you he be not the murderer look I know you spend year believe it be he I can kind of understand why you would lie about what happen in the hospice but I think you be wrong about boatner a young woman die last night I think she be murder by the same person who commit the original libra slaying I think he be back let us say you be right let us say that john david boatner do not confess on his deathbed that do not necessarily mean he be not the killer I mean in my experience serial murder and a deep seat sense of honesty rarely go hand in hand yeah but there be a reason the police never arrest boatner for the libra 's killing they never have enough evidence I 've be research this in fact there be a fair amount of evidence to suggest he be not the killer they be never able to conclusively prove that his handwriting be a match for any of the libra 's note there be never any physical evidence to tie he to any of the crime scene well even if all that be true even if john david boatner be innocent I do not see anything that indicate that the libra kill Catherine Tallridge he be flamboyant a game player taunt the police with with cryptogram carve his signature into the forehead of his victim he take credit he like take credit now if you be correct and this man be still walk still kill among we why do not he take credit for this death no symbol be carve in her forehead no code message be leave for the police to decrypt if he kill she would not he want the world to know I think he want to I think he run out of time a neighbor hear noise come from inside Catherine Tallridge 's apartment the night that she be murder she call the police I think he have to run out of there he do not have time to sign his work I be sorry but I think you need to rethink your theory that be the medical examiner Catherine Tallridge 's wound be inflict by an left handed attacker the libra as I be sure you know from your research be right handed I be home hey where be everybody Homework I pick up a fudge ripple cake on the way home to celebrate what be with the long face you get a new job everything all right I be just about to ask you that this be the note that you write to marie 's teacher this morning she send it back car key and your wallet now come on give I your wallet give I your wallet right now now your key let

how busy you 've be easiest case I ever close thank you you okay yeah thank you Allison hi keith Joe Joe Dubois you just hire I Today 's my first day be my first day it be 5 30 yeah no problem we will see you tomorrow could I ask you something I spend the whole day out there and I read the company handbook and I do the whole orientation but nobody actually speak to I about work nobody fill I in on any project tell I you know to do anything you maybe wait for I to come to you with something like an idea or something no one explain it to you this department may run a little differently than what you be use to okay that be all right no problem I will adjust just tell I what you need that be the thing I do not I do not really need anything the truth be I prefer to be the only engineer on my project honestly I find it streamline thing you know collaboration can just be distract right I be sorry you say that you be never go to ask I to do anything not very often no why do you hire I Corporate give I a certain amount of money for staffing and you know the way that corporate budget work if you do not use that money then well it go away but who know in the future I might need it right so I hire people yeah I find that most people do not have a problem with this Most people actually think it be a dream come true so you know maybe if you think about this as a kind of scholarship you be free to spend your day work on whatever you want you be just not go to be work on biodiesel turn out I could 've be anyone maybe I be just the last interview maybe he be just tired of see people wait he be just go to pay you to sit there and do nothing yeah that be what he say he say to think of it as a kind of scholarship I mean it be not like I be go to turn down the money I mean truth be I can not but I do not know I mean I know there be a lot of people out there who would kill to be you know get a paycheck right now any kind of paycheck but I honestly do not know if I can do it I do not know if I can get up every morning and go into work know that my be there be of no consequence well it will change once he get to know you once he see what he have you do not understand he do not want to know what he have and he certainly do not want to get to know I okay that be enough whine I get to get my beauty sleep so I can get up bright and early and go into work and do nothing 10 21 Jacinda birk stand at her window she see a view of edison park but can not see I watch when she be asleep I will go to her when she be asleep I will make her mine and it go on like that for the remainder of the page take a team of expert about ten hour to decode it you be right about Catherine Tallridge he confess to her murder about five line down be we sure this be authentic be we sure this be write by the original libra slayer I be afraid we can not be certain about that when the libra slayer be last active he leave code message with the body of each victim now each of these code be unique but all of the translate message have a specific voice arrogant derisive almost clinical in the recording of detail the time of day the victim 's full name References to the location now this new message both in tone and in the complexity of the code itself appear to be identical to the message leave by the libra it even refer to detail of the original crime that be hold back from the press seem unlikely that anyone but the original killer would know they on the other hand there be one detail that do not line up accord to the medical examiner both Catherine Tallridge and jacinda birk be murder by a left hand assailant but be not it common knowledge be not the libra slayer right hand so we always believe but this new cryptogram it be write by somebody who be leave hand whoever kill these woman if not the original libra slayer then it be someone who be do thing the exact same way but use the other hand talk to I I be wonder if you would have a chance to look at the schematic that I leave for you at lunch it be 5 30 everyone 's take off I just do not want to go if you be plan on give I any feedback any reaction a direction of some sort you talk about that wiring thing yeah that be not something that I ask you to do I know I read it it be not bad oh really do you want to sit down maybe we could set up a time we could go over it it be not bad it just be not excellent you know I mean frankly what be the point no offense but I do not really have any use for that kind of work I mean like I tell you I can get to excellent on my own so really I be actually think about that wiring problem today at lunch I come up with some pretty interesting stuff you can take a look if you want thank you I mean it it be not bad you be a smart guy which mean that you be go to be miserable here I be not say that I be unhappy it be just my second day no I know you be not gripe I just I know how this be go to play out Most people they come here they figure out how I like to operate pretty quickly you know they settle in to do whatever they like do whatever but you have initiative the trouble be I have no use for that I will tell you what I be go to e mail the guy that run the commercial aeronautic division they get some new contract they be probably look for talent I could offer to take one of their bad guy in exchange for you you be go to trade I Sure yeah you will like it down there they do some kind of interesting stuff with turbine you look like you be cram for the world 's most gruesome final yeah well the way this be go you might as well just hand I an f I hope you guy be learn more than I be we 've get half the homicide division pull overtime so far not much in the way of result your friend Neal Greybridge the assistant district attorney in charge of his case call I apparently they schedule a sit down with he they be build a case against the guy who shoot he so you know they need to go over his statement talk to he about take the stand only problem be Neal never show up I hope he be okay I keep call he I know the ada leave he a couple message but you know this guy I be think maybe you could reach out to he just make sure he be not go to flake out on we hi it be Neal leave I your name and number and I will call you back as soon as I can hi Neal this be Allison Dubois again sorry to leave you another message just call to make sure that you check in with detective Scanlon tomorrow if you get this can you call I in the morning I do not understand why this guy will not call either one of we back maybe he be afraid to confront the guy who shoot he I do not know when the doctor tell Neal that he be paralyze he basically just ignore they he do not really strike I as the kind of guy who be short on courage what be you read so intently I think you do not have to do any work with your new job I do not but I do I take your advice and I try to show he what I get unfortunately when he see it he could not have be less impressed so this be my boss 's solution to a problem that I spend the whole morning work on and he dash it off while eat a tuna sandwich Read through it four time now and you know what it be well than what I come up with way well I can see why the company put up with this guy 's quirk you know it be a shame that this much talent be attach to a guy with zero people skill well it be a shame but at least it will not be your problem anymore that be right 'cause I be go to do some really interesting thing with turbine authority have crack the code message that be leave with the late victim of the so call libra slayer though apparently the note have give they no further clue to the identity of the murderer and in other news president bill clinton today vow to fight impeachment char car key and your wallet now come on give I your wallet give I your wallet right now now your key let us go let us go Man let I let I have my car I just need to get to work and you know if you do not give I those key you be not go to need anything ever again so wait a second you be tell I that guy that limp in here the other day with the cane be the libra slayer Neal Greybridge yes it be he really 'cause that guy can barely get around how do it work do he park in a handicap spot before he kill someone I be tell you it be he Lee I see it the original killing stop 11 year ago right after Neal got shoot they start again as soon as he be well enough to get around and you want to know why the killer 's suddenly leave hand 'cause he can not use his right hand he be get a bullet lodge in his spine that sure would explain a lot of thing like the handprint what handprint 11 year go the original detective on the case discover a partial handprint on one of the letter that the libra slayer leave behind they be sure that be the piece of evidence that be go to help they put john david boatner away the only problem be it do not match it be not his print bring Neal Greybridge in take his print if I be wrong you will have lose a couple hour if I be right maybe this whole thing will be over Keith you get a minute actually I do not just one minute Promise I just want to talk to you about that transfer what about it it be just go to take a couple day to get through human resource I know that thing be I do not want it really I know it suddenly you realize the idea of a couple year of free money be not so heinous huh no actually it be not that I read your note your solution to the wiring problem it be smart scary smart oh well that be okay thank you be welcome thing be I do not want to transfer away from that kind of think no good engineer would yeah well this be not really about what you want I be not so sure see you need my help man you do not know it yet but you need my help you be clearly brilliant you be brilliant enough to get away with this howard hughes act up until now but I guarantee you you be go to get catch 'cause you be not do your good work nobody do their good work in a vacuum now you need someone to bounce your idea off somebody to check your thinking against somebody who be smart enough to keep pace with you and someone who be go to call you on your crap I think I be that guy so think about it if you agree call off the transfer by the way you be go to want to check your work on diagram seven page four I fix it for you hello I be in Neal Greybridge 's apartment right now you should see his bookshelf Cryptanalysis the codebreaker pretty much everything that be ever be write on the subject of encryption be you bring he in I be not bring he anywhere

tell he that I would be dream about he I even find the man who would shot he he must have figure it be just a matter of time before I learn the truth about he we should have he in custody right now we would have he in custody right now if I would just see it soon we will find he Allison it be just a matter of time I be not sure we have time Neal spend the last 11 year of his life work his way out of a hospital bed get himself strong enough to do the one thing that he really love now that he be back I do not think he be go to stop kill woman just because the police know who he be you okay Al

courage willpower nobody could believe that a man like Neal Greybridge Quiet little Neal Greybridge could look a medical impossibility in the face and then step on its throat of course what they do not understand be that Neal Greybridge could not even make it out of his hospital bed Hmm it take an incredible sense of purpose to achieve a miracle like that and the part that I show the world the part that everybody know as Neal Greybridge he do not have that sense of purpose the man that have the strength and the courage to get out of bed and walk again that man be a part that I keep secret it be a part that still have work to do it be a part that have to get out of bed and have to stand again and walk again if you say so why be you tell I this because you be the only person that be ever

on there but that girl clearly have a special aptitude for the clarinet but I do not you be already one of the most special people in the whole wide world really now anybody who know you would say that no you be wrong Nobody be ever say that except you just now and only because you be my Dad I do not believe that yeah well it be true you know who I be I be everybody 's sister that be not true yeah well I be Ariel 's sister because she be smart and she be pretty and everybody like she and she know about clothe and and boy and dance and now I guess I be Marie 's sister too 'cause she can play clarinet without even try come here no it absolutely it just break my heart you know she just seem so defeat by it do you hear I Allison Hey Allison I be sorry be you talk to I where be you what be you so busy think about look do not be mad I go to see he today I bring he his blanket I can not believe I be hear this I be try to talk to you about your own child he have a sister have she die a few month ago she say that Bryce be not safe in that house that I should not have bring he back there what the dead sister tell you this look I check her death record it say unexplained illness natural cause apparently they take she to expert after expert no one could really put their finger on it what be you say well I be say something 's wrong in that house the sister say that Bryce be not safe there the mother say the housekeeper live for he so I be start to think maybe she do not kidnap he at all maybe she be try to protect he maybe someone or something in that house kill the sister and now it be try to harm Bryce what be you do I can not do this I can not spend another ounce of energy on this thing I spend last night run all over hell 's half acre hey you ask I what be in my head the little boy be home safe I be tell you what be in my head with his parent our little girl be beside herself in her room Joe yeah what you have a dream what be go on Allison that do you hear that what hear what I listen for oh Allison look it be almost 1 30 in the morning no that that that baby cry what be you there be no baby cry what be you talk about we do not have a baby it be he it be Bryce he need I I be go over there go where to the Carlos ' I need to make sure he be okay hey be you listen to yourself it be the middle of the night I do not care he be in trouble he need I for crap 's sake help you Mr Carlo we meet the other day I be with Detective Scanlon this be my husband Joe look I know it be the middle of the night I know this be really unusual but I be wonder if I could just look in on Bryce Allison what go on what be you do here this this hard to explain I just I need to see Bryce I need to know that he be okay why would not he be okay oh no no do we do that the doorbell no no this be pretty much par for the course well as long as that be the case I mean if he be up be there any way that I can just see he oh he be such a beautiful boy your little girl never get to meet he do she I get pregnant just before she pass I know Scott be worried that I be so fill with grief that I might lose he I can not imagine what it would be like to go through that well the hard part be never get any answer never know what be wrong I mean the only thing everyone seem to agree on be that she be die do you ever consider get an autopsy so you would know why Allison Lucy suffer too much we could not put she through that too and ultimately an autopsy would 've just be for our benefit not hers we just want she to rest in peace I just do not understand why they would not get an autopsy I mean if one of our girl die Allison you have to stop that family open their door to we at 3 00 in the morning they be not evil if anything they be saint okay I be not say they be not nice I just I think it be strange Strange Strange you want to talk about strange look I hate to break it to you but the only thing strange about that house tonight be the fact that we be in it now you have to leave that family alone I mean it go away I be tired yeah well too bad it be time to get up well I have not even be to sleep yet what be you talk about it be morning you 've be asleep all night not really I 've be dream dream about that stupid song what be you talk about you dream that song there be this old man and he have a clarinet and all he do be play that song over and over again show I how to do it I hate it well I do not know what to tell you why be you even tell I all this because you be my big sister Allison Sir I be want to ask you about Bryce Carlo when you bring he in do anyone run any blood work anything that could test for toxin in his system Sure blood test be fairly routine in child abduction case we look for sedative tranquilizer the good news be in Bryce 's case everything come back completely normal Devalos yeah okay I will be right there that be the morgue seem a sanitation worker find a corpse stuff in an abandon refrigerator in one of our municipal landfill early this morning match the description of our miss kidnapper Elizabeth Torres yes that be her that be my cousin thank you for come down and make the identification I may have a few more question if want to just wait outside M E 's call cause of death blunt force trauma look like she take a couple of hard blow to the head hard enough to kill she do not make a lot of sense this woman take a baby boy you find the baby boy then someone kill the kidnapper something 's miss like what to begin with I still can not figure out why this woman take that child only to abandon he at the house where Allison find he might make sense to have forensic go back see if they can find any of this woman 's blood all right girl hey girl come on it be time to leave for Marie 's music lesson hey Dad yeah Marie want I to tell you that she do not want to go to her lesson what why all right sweetheart all good okay come on she okay well not yet but eventually this be one of those thing be not it yes yes this definitely appear to be one of those thing so how do we fix it how do we make she stop hear that song I do not know Bridge I honestly I do not know from my experience with mom and with Ariel and even with you it be good to just let these thing run their course hello Allison I hope I do not wake you I just call to let you know that the police go back out to that house where you find the Carlo boy they actually find a small spot of blood on the underside of a doorknob the blood match some blood that we find on Elizabeth Torres 's body blood that be not hers so while we do not yet have a suspect the good news be once we do we have enough forensic evidence to nail he for murder anyway I be I be go to go home go to bed you do that sir Allison it be 1 00 a m I know I know I be sorry to have wake you and Scott Scott 's not here he be out of town on business look I be sorry Dana I be sorry I be sorry you be a nice person I need you to understand everything that I be

go to go call ms Catalano and let she know we find her dad Sir Sir Sir be you all right what the hell be go on Allison go for help get they to call an ambulance the mesozoic era be often call the age of the reptile Reptiles be the dominant form of life on earth for the entire era which last almost 200 million year the mesozoic era be divide into three distinct period Bridgette be you all right hi kiddo no hello be everything okay I think miss Scarlet 's mad at I Miss Scarlet the spider I do not think that be possible honey I be there when miss Scarlet be fl Laid to rest and I do not think she can be mad at anyone or anything at this point I think she can and I think she be and I deserve it why because I give she some candy what I feed she some candy I put some candy in her cage just to see if she would like it I think that be why she die Paging dr Stateman his name 's Edgar Kripke accord to social service he be a drug addict and a paranoid schizophrenic when he could not get a bed at the local homeless shelter he would sleep in that cemetery Bobbi Catalano tell I that kripke have actually have word with her father before I guess her dad be not too happy that this guy be crash a few hundred yard from his wife 's grave Carl actually call the police on he once have he arrest for vagrancy but that do not prove that he we search the cardboard box that Kripke call home find Carl 's wallet in there and his watch what about the blood around his mouth and the groan Drug overdose he must have just get high when you spot he his doctor say it cause some serious brain damage what kind of drug do that you ever hear of something call wet Cigarettes soak in methanol formaldehyde and ethanol it be a hallucinogen believe it or not there be actually demand for this stuff the government be be try to make it hard for the people who cook this stuff up to get their hand on the ingredient but we just keep see more and more of it so what this guy just fry his brain we be never go to get he to admit what he do it be okay I think we get enough to pin this murder on Kripke whether he ever talk again or not I do not know exactly what it be that draw your attention to this deadbeat but I be glad it happen at least now we get some answer for Carl 's daughter so Bridgette think she be be haunt by that dead spider yes indeedy so what do you tell she I suggest she talk to her teacher and tell she that she feed candy to the class pet well how be that go to help she be obviously get a guilty conscience not to mention an overactive imagination so I just figure if she confess then okay I get that you 've be at this for a while have you ever commune with any dead insect now that you mention it I be go to have to add that to my to do list Reports incredible as they seem be not the result of mass hysteria a wave of murder which be sweep the eastern third of the nation be be commit by creature who feast upon the flesh of their victim I think we have some late word just arrive this be the late disclosure in a report from national civil defense headquarters in washington it have be establish that person who have recently die have be return to life and commit act of murder widespread investigation of report from funeral home morgue and hospital have conclude that the unburied dead be come back to life and seek human victim hello Joe oh my god what be you do here I be sorry my name be not Joe it be Dale it be Dale Cosgrove do not you remember I save you from that creature who be try to get in here you fall down and you hit your head we put you on the couch so you could sleep it off but now you be up I could use your help I mean if you be feel up to it and that creature who attack you he be get a lot of friend pretty sure they be come back hey I know what I be talk about my family and I be on the interstate and we see a whole bunch of they I slow down it be dark I do not realize what they be at first and before I know what be happen one of they get my wife 's door open and he he pull she out of the truck and they all begin bite at her rip at her flesh with their tooth that be horrible so we find your house and hope you do not mind that we set up camp here it be fine with I it be not my house I do not know whose house it be daddy my daughter that be Abigail Mabel and Bella I be sorry I do not catch your name I be Allison I be Allison Dubois Daddy I know you tell we to stay in the basement but that man be get bad there be a man what man someone else be here we find he on the way we save he from a pack of those thing they be bite he and claw at he so we bring he with we girl go to the kitchen get he some water see if he will take a drink we get to board this place up wait it out until the police or the national guard can come get we I think if we can make it till morning we will be okay they be back daddy a whole bunch of they you can see they through the window Damn it we be go to need more wood and fast look for old furniture anything we can break into more board hey Come on what be you stare at we have work to do I be sorry I know he we kind of come from the same place oh my god he be not breathe hey come on down there we need some wood here here you take this I will look for more no no yeah Al what be it what be wrong oh my god Mr Dubois hi Doctor How be my wife she will be fine we dress her wound but I be not sure that be what we should call it what do you mean once we rinse all the blood away you know her skin be it be raw it be inflame there be clearly bruise and it certainly seem for all the world like she be be bite the only thing be there be no broken skin no tooth mark no actual trauma how be that possible well one possibility and the only possibility I can think of be there be a phenomenon know as psychosomatic bruising in very rare case a patient sometimes can injure themselves I do not think that be possible in this case 'cause the bite be on the back of her calf so I oh the wound would not have be cause by physical trauma the belief be they be generate by the patient 's mind the injury be a subconscious physiological response to extreme stress the theory be that your emotional state can cause your blood vessel to engorge and if it be bad enough you could actually bleed right through your pore now you know your wife do say that she be be have nightmare so I think maybe all she need be a couple night of uninterrupted sleep so here be a prescription for sleep pill and beyond that that do not make much sense she want I to get more sleep hey look I do not know you know she seem to think that you know a night of uninterrupted sleep be wait I do not think she get this I do not think I could survive a night of uninterrupted sleep I mean think about it even if she be right even if I be do this to myself I be still getting hurt I dream that I get hurt I wake up and I be hurt what if my next dream I dream that I break my leg or what if I die in my dream die you do not think that could happen do you Honey this be crazy how do you not sleep you have to sleep it be 6 15 the girl be go to be up in a minute I be hope we would get home before okay here be what we

people sick Barbara you poison they no you be wrong you know what I be glad I be the one who find you no where be I go the pentagon want we to keep a few of the specimen alive give their ravenous appetite I be worried the creature would not make it all the way to Washington I guess it be good we find they a snack no get that door no no please let I out please let I out hey you never wake I I fall asleep and it be horrible I guess I survive it though Scanlon and Devalos be there really any sign of the tin man or the scarecrow they keep call I Barbara and they say I be responsible for all of it and then they throw I in the back of this truck and you be there and the girl wait a second I think you say that we be all dead you all eat I all of you feast on I you do not look any bad for wear seriously be not this exactly the kind of dream that we be worried about I mean if we do actually you know eat you in this dream it be pretty safe to assume that you be dead if not when the meal start certainly by the time it end you be not dream now and you look pretty lively to I I guess you be right it be usually a series of four treatment session to reduce what be that I guess I do sustain an injury in that dream when I touch something hot it burn I oh god I guess if you dream about be eat alive by the reanimate corpse of your dead family and that be the only wound you get I guess you could consider yourself lucky I be sorry no one be in front so I just make my way around the back oh it be okay mrs Dubois what can I do for you I bring by your father 's personal effect I read in the paper that the viewing be tomorrow and I want to make sure that you have everything you need his watch his wedding band you be very thoughtful actually our embalmer Steven 's on his way over with daddy 's remain I be just get the room ready you all right oh I be sorry it be just Daddy always use to say death never take the wise man by surprise he be always ready to go or to let go I guess I be not feel terribly wise right now Shoot do you happen to have a pen if you would not mind sign this receipt that you receive your father 's personal effect could you just give I one moment to empty the autoclave I be just clean some instrument for Steven excuse I what be those those they be the embalm tank they hold the fluid the embalmer use to replace the blood in the dead body Ethanol methanol Formaldehyde Sorry burn myself Bobbi that would not happen to be short for Barbara would it as a matter of fact it be how do you know okay if you have something to tell I you be go to have to figure out a way to tell I Miss Scarlet I be serious oh egg thank you again for come in ms Catalano I realize how busy you must be during this difficult time so I will get right to the point there have be some recent development in the investigation into your father 's murder we now have reason to believe that he bite his attacker before he die really all right well forgive I mr Devalos but I do not see how that really qualify as a new development I do not want to hear all the gory detail about the fight between my father and that man that be the thing that man Edgar Kripke he do not have any bite mark anywhere on his person and as a result we be no long convince he be the one who murder your father I do not understand he have my father 's watch he have my father 's wallet they have argue several time Edgar Kripke be an unmedicated paranoid schizophrenic he argue with many people many time he never hurt anyone now as for your father 's possession if Kripke be the first person to find the body maybe he steal they or maybe they be plant plant really who would have want to do that and why we be not entirely sure but now that Kripke 's guilt be in question and because there be no other suspect we be go to reopen the investigation if that be what you need to do typically we begin with the last person who see the victim alive so we can rule they out as a suspect in this case that person be you so if you do not mind we would like you to submit yourself to a brief physical examination if the female officer do not find any bite mark on you then we can refocus our energy elsewhere you be joke I beg your pardon I love my father I would never hurt he if he know how you be treat a member of his family after everything that he have do for this department be you aware that your business have take out no less than five separate loan from the bank over the past few year do you read the paper mr Detective the economy be not what it use to be and yes people be still die but their survivor be not spend the money now what be your point I also call a few of your supplier if business be down maybe you could explain to I why over the past year or so you order three time more embalming fluid than in previous year be you aware that embalm fluid be a mixture of ethanol methanol and formaldehyde the ingredient in the drug wet I do not know that we 've be curious how our local drug dealer have be able to put so much out on the street you care to venture any theory I would not know where to begin your father figure out what you be do he confront you there be a struggle he bite you on your right calf I for one appreciate everything your father do to help the man and woman that serve this city that be why provide you enter a guilty plea and make a full confession I be prepared to discuss a deal with whoever you hire to represent you or if you insist on do it the hard way I will simply have detective Scanlon here arrest you and once your calf have be examine for a bite mark well then then your fate will lie in the hand of the jury he ask I to meet he at my mother 's grave and he tell I that he know everything he say my mama would have be

be the same man who strap it on to troy sanborn not only that I be tell you he manage to steal a little over 400 000 while he be at it that do not sense the bomb almost kill wilke no it do not after he trigger the detonate device and make no mistake he be the one who trigger it he have a few second to jump behind that desk and he know he would have those few second 'cause he be the one who rig that bomb I mean think about it how much sense do it make to strap a bomb onto somebody and ask they to rob a bank for you I mean how can you be sure that the police be not go to follow he back to where you be hide would not you be well off figure a way to get into the bank yourself so you could hide the money where no one would find it Patrick wilke know that he be go to be call in to defuse that bomb just like he know the police be go to cut the power to that bank while they be negotiate with troy sanborn he be count on it with all of the security camera down he would have plenty of time to to stash the money that he have force Sanborn to steal and after that the bomb take care of the rest the one witness that he have to the crime be dead and the money that he take would be presume lose in the explosion no one would even bother try to look for it Allison we find a bomb vest identical to the one that kill troy sanborn in jesse reeder 's home Jesse reeder 's the guy you tell we to go find remember so reeder build and test a bomb for wilke and wilke do not need reeder anymore boom I bet you wilke be count on the fact that find reeder 's body close the case I do not know what to

the elevator get I outside into the darkness and then I will tell you everything the day that a person have leave to live that be a pretty dramatic statement yeah but I be tell you I think I be right I mean at first when I put these sunglass on and I look at people I could see these five digit number float around on their forehead Devalos Scanlon later when we be at the morgue all the corpse they all have zero I know it sound crazy but I can not make sense of it but there it be you tell I that if you look at I through those glass you can tell I how long I have leave to live do not ask I to do that well be not you the person who be say my dead father 's raise all these question about my health yeah but but what yeah but I do not want to know that I mean not like that if you think about it

smack for Hector Becerra in fact you be his top earn corner boy be I right yeah that be right so now that we all know each other Juan I want you to tell I and my brother here all about Hector 's stash house the one on the east side come on man you know I can not do that Juan Juan I think you say you know who we be look I I know you guy be for real but if I tell you about they stash house my own people will kill I Ai not nobody get to know it be you Come on look my brother Randy he do not talk much and I be not go to tell nobody Juan Come on now you know you go to tell we everything we want to know right right come here muffled sob okay Juan we be go to see just how long you can hold out scream DEVALOS unfortunately what you see in your dream actually make a lot of sense a couple of Hector Becerra 's stash house be rob last week not to mention the coroner point out a fresh wound on Juan Espinal 's right bicep it certainly could have be inflict by a sander well I do not understand I read the Littletons ' file I think they operate by some kind of code where they would kidnap someone and if that person give they good information they would let they go if Juan Espinal talk if he tell they the location of the stash house why would they kill he maybe the Littletons be play by a new set of rule no witness in any case I be go to go canvas the city for abandon barbershop if that be where the brother torture and kill Juan Espinal maybe I can find some evidence to tie they to the crime keep we post you know yesterday you would not even put those thing on now it be like they be glue to you yeah yeah it look that way woman over P A Paging Dr Bender please well it be a little elevated but blood pressure vary day to day I do not think it be anything to be alarmed about I be okay hey base on my family history be there anything that I should be do to avoid heart trouble it be a lot about life choice Joe I mean the good news be you do not smoke you be at your ideal weight marry employ d say you be do great do you have any undue stress in your life you mention your wife have be ill yeah but she be do great now um I mean I just start a new job I guess that probably add some stress well I mean there be another thing that can make a major difference in stress and blood pressure level particularly for people with stressful job you ever try meditation what do you mean like chant no not necessarily anyway you set aside some chunk of time during the day Focus on your breathing clear your mind just try to stay totally present in the moment chuckle I know what you be think I be right there with you believe I I be no hippie but I give it a shot it really help phone ring hello Allison it be Manuel I be go to give you an address I need you to come right over here Mr District Attorney what be go on Lee find that barbershop you see in your dream he cross path with one of the Littleton brother Lee shoot he siren wail Allison thank for come I come as quick as I could have you see Lee yet no where be he he be out back I think file a statement with Internal Affairs I do not understand what be Littleton do here why be shot even fire apparently Lee pull up to take a look around just as Littleton here be in the process of leave Lee get out of his car identify himself and Randy go for his gun we 've already find weapon drug apparently they be use this place as a kind of base of operation be Lee all right not a mark on he any sign of the other Littleton brother no but with Randy dead I have a feeling that Malcolm might try to retaliate soon what do you mean retaliate SCANLON I hope you two do not come all the way down here on my account I be touch oh my God Lee it be okay Allison I be fine really there be not a scratch on I Gee two day to live huh I do not know what to tell you Allison if you could see your way clear to give I a week maybe I would cash in my 401 K take a trip to Maui but Lee give the scheduling crunch Lee I need you to listen to I I be serious I mean think about it Randy Littleton be dead and his brother be still out there he be go to want to get the man who do this he be go to want to get revenge do not do that do not just shrug think about Lynn think about the baby all right I be think about they now what be it you want I to do I be a cop every day I go out there I try to put away a bad guy know that I could be tick off another bad guy in the process that be just part of the job and besides all you be see be a number it be not like it be tell you something specific that I can prepare for or guard against and for all you know it could be that I slip in the shower tomorrow and crack my skull open I do not think so look the bottom line be if I want to avoid be murder by Malcolm Littleton than my good option be to work the case and try to make sure that we find he and put he away as soon as possible besides it be not like I be fly blind I find this on Randy Littleton now this guy and his brother they track every drug dealer in Phoenix at one time or another and it be all write down right here this book be go to be worth a lot to someone and I can use this to find Malcolm or I could just stay home from

determine there be no eyewitness and you believe that I would be surprised if anyone come forward Littleton rob dozen of drug dealer it be not a stretch to imagine that one of they finally catch up with he even if someone do see something I doubt that anyone would testify against drug dealer in an open court for the like of Malcolm Littleton door open I guess somebody catch up with Malcolm

informant I do not care what he say I see he sit there and watch while the Littleton brother murder Juan Espinal I believe you Allison but right now there be no physical evidence that connect he to any of this that make no sense if there be not enough evidence in that notebook to get he arrest then why do he want to kill you for it first of all we do not know that be what he be do at my place and second of all uh maybe Carver have no idea what the Littletons have write down in there maybe he just could not risk the possibility that there be something that implicate he the upside be Internal Affairs be go to keep an eye on he that be it for the moment yeah look uh I know you be upset Hell so be I but uh I also want to say thank if it be Carver who be go to kill I today you pretty

FEMA you be not go not go be not ask damn glad about it too I have somewhere to be at 11 45 man this picture be take in 1996 the subject live in a small village in the Democratic Republic of the Congo he succumb to a disease call viral hemorrhagic fever it be very rare the strain responsible for this man 's death be call FV 39 Ladies and gentleman FV 39 be of particular concern to we because the virus hold up well in transport and weaponization in fact there be a few of we who believe that it would be an ideal agent for a bioterrorist attack against the United States man cough FEMA have be try to create an antiserum a cure that can be deploy in the event of just such a bioterrorist attack in fact we 've be work very closely with a company right here in Phoenix that be at the forefront of that effort Dr Erik Westphal head up the bio pathology division of United Southfield I will let he take it from here Doctor um clear throat our lab be a biosafety level four lab that mean we be handle some of the deadly microbe on the planet uh naturally both our company and the federal government spend extraordinary amount of time and money monitor our inventory when the government inspector gather their datum and file their late report there appear to be trace amount of FV 39 culture miss from some of our sample murmur this be not the kind of thing that you would notice on a day to day basis but over time there be a measurable amount of this bug that we simply can not account for murmur MAN bad case scenario lady and gentleman be that someone either sell or give these culture to someone who intend to use they as a weapon of mass destruction we at FEMA need to move forward as though that be the case DINOVI so what do this mean be Homeland Security issue some kind of alert man quite the contrary there will be no alert there will be no notification there will be no public announcement of any kind as a matter of fact the only people who know anything about this be sit in this room right now and that be the way it be get to stay Dr Westphal do not happen to agree with that decision but the fact be at this moment lady and gentleman we do not have an effective antiserum in sufficient quantity to deal with this as a result the preventive measure that we can take be limit Dr Westphal if this virus this FV 39 be out there how bad could it get how many people would be affect it be hard to say it be not an airborne virus it be spread by people to people and it carry a mortality rate of about 85 which be what make it such an effective threat again depend on how long it be out there and how soon we be able to contain it hundred of dead thousand maybe it be just too hard to say for sure JOE you do the right thing cough there be nothing to be gain by tell a man who be contemplate proposing that it might not and I underline might not go exactly the way he hope yeah I know but you should have see his face he look so vulnerable I just I hate the idea of he

fine yeah I be sorry but we have no choice okay the man that you see kill himself yesterday be a biologist who work in my lab his name be Mitchell Lomis and he be apparently infect with a very very dangerous virus call FV 39 you think that I catch this virus whatever it be yeah you and all the other people who rush to help mitch this virus there be organization uh movement that would pay a fortune for even a minute amount of it Y you infect one person and then expose he to as many people as possible before he succumb and you can decimate a small city at our lab we be work on this virus work on a cure how Mitch became infect we still do not know but I can not believe that it be an accident there be just too many safeguard too many check and balance the fear be that he be attempt to steal some and sell it how well do you know this person uh do he strike you as the kind of person who could do something like that there be a time when I would have say absolutely not but he go through a pretty ugly divorce a couple of year ago he have some financial struggle emotional struggle just wrestle with depression I I just keep hope that whatever he take it be incinerate right when he be but what if it be not what if it be still out there yeah well let us just pray that that be not the case uh it be not that we do not have an antivirus by the way it be just that we do not have enough funding to produce it in meaningful quantity it be about two cent a person actually I mean if every U S citizen pay two cent we would have enough to inoculate the entire city of Phoenix or Philadelphia or San Antonio just astounding right NEWSCASTER with the new increase and the mystery virus nobody know very much about it a short time ago it be completely unknown how be you feel hey pretty amazing actually they hydrate I they give I some antibiotic Hell of a house call how about you I be fine it it be all go the achiness the dizziness he say it be all in my head I guess he be right do anyone explain this to you what they be do here no one have to it be all over the tv Representatives from FEMA and a Phoenix biotech firm begin show up on the doorstep of police and rescue worker before dawn this morning concerned that they may have contract a deadly virus so far none of the city worker have test positive and official remain tight lipped about whether or not the virus

Westphal give we access to his office computer and we obtain a warrant for his laptop as well we discover that Mr Lomis have be use an alia to log onto several anti american web site and that he have indeed contact a potential buyer for the virus now the good news be the e mail indicate that the sale be never complete our good guess be that Mr Lomis inadvertently infect himself as he be attempt to dispose of the virus as soon he realize that the sale be not go to happen we now believe that everything that he have be in that car we believe that everything that he have burn up with he and so I be pleased to inform you this morning that even as we be sit here the mayor 's office be announce to the general public that there be no long any threat from the FV 39 virus and just when you think that

be always a nightmare for any parent for we I think it be be especially difficult Arianna do not leave a note she never tell we why nothing at all she never communicate with either one of you Devalos Lily go out to get the newspaper and see that the flag be up on the mailbox and when she look inside she find this oh no this be terrible I be so sorry Devalos I certainly make my share of enemy over the year Put plenty of bad people in prison even receive death threat but never anything like this never anything involve my family would you please excuse I sob softly you know this be go to sound crazy I think I see the man who do this what be you talk about I see a man put something in your mailbox I mean I do not really see it and he be not really there but I do not realize that at the time I actually get a pretty good look at he he be young maybe 30 caucasian tall thin and he be wear these glass kind of Black vintage frame Ring any bell no I do not think so okay I will tell you what I be go to canvass the neighborhood see if anyone else see this guy I be also go to have someone at the station put together a file of all your case a mug book of everyone you 've try if the guy who leave this really be someone you put away then well hopefully allison will recognize he Young lady these book be very late you 've have they for more than a year now I know I uh guess I just kind of lose track of they I be sorry but they be really good Glad you think so now maybe some other child can enjoy they too I be afraid we 've already forward these to collection you owe the retail cost of the book which come out to 92 18 Ninety two dollar I be just a kid where be I suppose to get 92 uh you be not go to call the police be you be I go to get arrest what about ask your parent no I do not want to do that they be already really mad at I I might have an idea Ariel you be work at the library why be you so surprised I do not know it just seem odd that someone would depend on you to do anything hey I be dependable and besides they 've get book lay around all over the place in there so this be good I be help they with their problem and instead of pay I they be pay off the fine Joe it sound like a pretty good solution to I Honey do not eat any ice cream before dinner well when be we go to eat I be hungry I do not know that be a good question where be your mom she be be in her room for the past couple hour hey you hungry should I order some pizza no no we have some leftover in the fridge I be go to heat up I be sorry I got so catch up with these file still no luck I 've look through every single person that devalo ever put away and none of they look like the man I see leave that awful card well maybe it be time to pack it in for the night I guess so I just wish I could do something I wish I could help well wait a second be not you actually that psychic woman who uh give the police a description of the guy who do this very funny you know what I can not figure out the pythagorean theorem last night I have a dream about devalo and his daughter and in it I see he find a suicide note I even hear what the note say I mean most of it anyway but then when I go to his house this morning his wife say that arianna never leave anything behind now why would he do that why would he keep something like that from her sigh softly I have no idea hey you want to take the kid out I know it be a school night but you know it might be fun to take the kid out Devalos Ladies and gentleman of the jury no attorney relish the prospect of take on a case that involve the sexual assault of a young woman it force we to ask uncomfortable question about the personal behavior of both the allege assailant and the alleged victim in this case we will have to look closely at what happen on the night that deanna whalen by her own admission willingly accompany the defendant back to his home that they have sex not once not twice but three time over the course of the evening be not in dispute and yet miss whalen maintain that a crime have be commit that she give he her phone number the next day be also not in dispute but still she claim that she be not a willing participant in the previous evening 's event Miss whalen even concede that it take she three day before decide to call the police and now she cite her inability to recall the precise event of the evening as proof that mr Gerwin must have drug she and rape she sigh quite a story but that be all it be a story and the district attorney know it now the prosecution will attempt to portray the defendant as a man of low character but he be not they will paint my argument as an attack on miss whalen but it be not Truth be tell my client be guilty of nothing more than participate in consensual sex and the irony be his accuser be guilty of the same and yet she seek to use this court and you this jury as a kind of legal absolution as a way to wash away her sin so she need not take responsibility for they there be only one problem with that William gerwin be not a rapist William gerwin be an innocent man Yep that be definitely he that be definitely william gerwin back when I work as a defense attorney at mcclenahan everett Mr Gerwin be one of my client a rather important one actually he be the son of one of the partner he be 22 when he be accuse of drug and rape a young woman that he meet at a party her name be deanna whalen Gerwin 's father personally ask I to take his son 's case as a favor and sigh I be only too happy to oblige the case be very weak a classic he say she say rape kit be never administer no drug be find in the girl 's system she do not even file a report with the police until several day after the allege incident the ada who be handle gerwin 's prosecution know the odd be against he and he offer I a deal early on but I I turn it down that be how confident I be in the case I remember that case that kid wind up go to jail do not he someone send a collection of video to the district attorney 's office in the middle of the trial never find out who send they but it do not much matter they be video that william have make of himself have sex with unconscious and obviously drug woman include deanna whalen the deal I have be offer Evaporated William be give the maximum sentence and I leave mcclenaha n everett shortly after that I I be sorry sir if he receive a maximum sentence then how could he be the one to leave you that card turn out he be recently grant an early parole it seem that one of his cell mate take he into his confidence one night tell he the detail of an unsolved murder something to do with organize crime it be a federal case so gerwin go to the local fbi office and in exchange for his seal testimony Time be shave off his sentence as I understand it Gerwin never even have to appear in open court the man gerwin send to jail never even know who offer he up and you be absolutely certain that william gerwin be the man you see put this card in the box it be he sir I be sure of it I already reach out to his parole officer we be bring gerwin in for question in a few hour if he really be the one who leave that note in your mailbox well let us just say I intend to make damn sure he do not leave another 839 2 whoa Cool Miss aiken who be that guy oh nobody special just a fellow who come in every day to use the computer prince no I 've never see this card before I certainly do not leave it for mr Devalos sigh so be that it can I go now not just yet mr Gerwin okay so what else do you want to talk about how be the man man do anyway that be what my dad use to call he Manny do not like it very much but what can you do right well you seem to be have a pretty good time what would you say if I tell you that we have an anonymous tip from someone who say that they see you put that card in devalos 's mailbox well the first thing I would say be your tipster be mistaken but even if he or she be not what be with the hard ass routine I mean whoever leave this card do they do something illegal be there a law against mail people greet card there be law against harassment and do this card break that law Mr Gerwin you be on parole right if we want to we can make life very difficult for you so why do not you just admit what you do and we can get this thing clear up today because I do not do it I 've never be to his house I have not think about he in year you sure about that the man man be your lawyer you got convict you be not hold a grudge why would I hold a grudge I rape that girl I go to jail why would I be mad at my attorney Rich kid like you probably have a pretty rough go of it in prison I would not be surprised if you get a little taste of your own medicine once or twice chuckle dryly once or twice I spend year get a taste of my own medicine that what you want to hear that there be a ying for every yang that I get what I deserve well there it be now if this card upset your boss I do not know what to tell you but I the new I I be a firm believer that if you get a card like this you probably deserve it so maybe you should be sit your boss down ask he why he think he get this Allison he be so smug he be practically rub our nose in the fact that he do it well you 've get to hand it to he he figure out a way to get attention to work out his anger at your boss but he be on parole right he be essentially impotent if he do anything he go right back to jail so he he send that card he get a rise out of a bunch of people it be kind of like a child do not you think like a child he rape a teenage girl and when he could not get away with it he blame his lawyer there be nothing childlike about that uh dad can you come look at the computer stay Stew finish your beer finish my beer if you like I mean look at this suddenly I have 200 e mail that I do not have this morning I mean I do not want to earn six figure sell real estate in my spare time I do not care about get 5 000 from cash for clunker without

version of spam blocker no you tell I not to download anything so I do not okay Scoot over let I drive for a minute do someone say something about prince abantu yeah why I think I know he you do not know he he be not real I mean he be a scammer who claim to be a nigerian prince who need help recover frozen asset from some trust I mean it be like you give he 10 000 and he give you a million no you be wrong Prince abantu be a real guy he go to the library where I work you can come visit he if you want I mean he be there all the time and I would not delete that if I be you all we have to do be just send he some money and then we can move into a big house chuckle Bridgette he do not look like a scammer to I he look like a prince I mean he wear robe and he carry this big stick thing and I do not know who you see sweetie but I get to side with ariel on this one this be one of the old trick in the book I 've get 100 e mail like this People who send they be not connect to african royalty in any way shape or form they be just criminal okay but I think you be wrong okay they be on a shelf in the bedroom hide in plain sight obviously the cop never bother to actually look at the tape when

devalo the most honest ethical man I 've ever meet not the second most honest and ethical man you 've ever meet oh come on joe why would he do that I do not know maybe maybe 'cause he know the guy he be represent be guilty maybe he be sick of represent rich scum or maybe he just want to give lawyer everywhere a good name no I be sorry none of that explain it if he could not represent his client in good conscience then he should have just resign from the case what he do be a violation of attorney client privilege Hell what he do be illegal but do not you kind of admire he for it a bad man a

give he a message for I there be a reason why all those article wound up in jennifer ludlow 's apartment she be young pretty just my type I do not understand sometime soon if the district attorney do not come forward and admit what he do I be go to rape jennifer ludlow you should say something you really be insane you know the act of just make that threat be a violation of your parole you be go

so maybe it will be she maybe it will be someone else the important thing be be that devalo know about all this ahead of time that way if he do not step up the girl I find she will not just be my victim she will be his victim too pretty good right that will kill he will not it good man like devalos Respected man no way he will be able to live with himself if he let us that happen type

wrong with it I think it be pretty good well first of all I be not a cheerleader and second of all I do not have buckteeth and third of all I do not walk around say I be Ariel I be Ariel but other than that I think you uh you nail it it be a caricature it be not suppose to look exactly like you it be suppose to tell the truth about what you be like inside and you be right I think I nail it good morning all wow Bridge you do all those look like you 've be really busy Yep why the sudden interest in art please Bridgette ' not interested in art Bridgette be interested in Finn who be interested in art hey oh yeah who be this Finn Bridgette 's boyfriend he be not he be not he be just a friend that happen to be a boy and uh it be not the same thing okay all right if you say so do Mom know about this well I be go to mention it to she this morning but she get up and go to work before I get up so I do not get to thank you well I be here and I be all ear so tell I a little bit more about this friend who happen to be a boy he be really nice and he sit in front of I in math class he be into a lot of the same really cool stuff that I be he be really nice to I too he play with I and Bridgette on the playground Hmm okay I get it Finn be cool Finn be nice come on dish into the sink we be leave in five minute see you later okay see you later later pop later Morning Keelin Morning Keelin do you sleep well do you sleep well do you think maybe this morning do you think maybe this morning you could try to answer you could try to answer my question my question instead of repeat they instead of repeat they any idea how this girl be able to break out of this facility I mean I know the name be Mariposa Psychiatric Hospital but it be part of the prison system base on that tape that girl do not seem terribly aggressive to be honest I be a little flummoxed I think we both be well obviously we have a security presence here at Mariposa Psych but in the wing where Keelin reside it be fairly benign those patient be all approach the age of majority they be within a year of be release so as part of their treatment they be afford much more freedom than the other wing enjoy and the vast majority of our patient be minor so we see very few attempt escape I know that be not much help so uh who be we look for what can you tell we about her other than the fact that she repeat whatever anybody tell her well her full name be Keelin McKinney and three year ago right before her 15th birthday she have an affair with her history teacher and about five month into it the history teacher break it off a week later she follow he home tie he up in his bed and shoot he 12 time with her father 's pistol the police arrive she be just sit there unresponsive and she slip into a catatonic state and finally two month ago she come out of it so that parrot that you see on the video that be call echolalia we almost always encounter it when catatonic patient awaken but having say that I 've never see the phenomena present itself in quite the way it have with Keelin the depth of her recall be extraordinary sometimes she spend whole therapy session parrot the previous session or she do I do not understand all she could do be repeat back what people say to her and yet she be within a year of her release she be sentence as a minor she be about to turn 18 and strange as it seem the echolalia that be progress after three year of total silence it be Keelin 's way of come back into the world and you have no idea how she be able to get out maybe she sneak in the back of a delivery truck hitch a ride out maybe someone leave a wrong door open none of the orderly or the guard be willing to admit they know anything about what happen I think they be afraid for their job but I be hope they will be more cooperative when policeman be ask the question I would be happy to talk to they and take a look around Dr Woodel this girl Keelin what be your feeling do you think she be dangerous I would like to say no that I be confident that my work with she have cure she of those impulse but I obviously misjudge Keelin we all do so I can not answer that for sure so where do we start I think maybe you could check out the girl 's room while I walk the ground it be right upstairs room 306 maybe something will come to you you know Ã¢TÂª Ã¢TÂª he would not stop talk to I you here about Keelin I can make myself scarce if you need some time to look around no no no I be just leave I be Allison I be Allison Dubois I be with the District Attorney 's Office hi Summer Lowry you

Keelin they have not meet she I know what she do and all but that be a long time ago Keelin be the sweetest person in here she be my friend Crazy right how can you be friend with someone who hardly ever talk well the thought do cross my mind we actually talk all the time at least I talk to her and she like it I could tell believe it or not I think it be help she get well and she help I too do

how do I make it stop you like this guy and you can not turn that off so maybe you should try hang out with he see if maybe he feel the same way well what do you mean I be already hang out with he I know but now that you like he it be go to be different different how I can not explain but it be um it be go to be different so I have to keep do what I be already do except now it be different in some way that you can not explain to I yeah I be never go to get rid of this be I of course I remember Summer Lowry I handle the plea bargain that lead to her committal and I be present when she confess to the killing of her parent look you and I have far too much history together for I to just dismiss out of hand something you 've dream but there be precious little to suggest that anybody get anything wrong in this particular case at the time of her committal Summer Lowry be a deeply disturbed young woman and she have a very well document history of violent behavior and she confess to the crime her brother Chad on the other hand be anonor student he be grief stricken and no one who know he even for just a minute entertain the idea that he might have be involve well I know it sound like it be from left field but there be nothing vague about what I see it be completely unambiguous he commit the killing and she be nowhere in sight be that as it may unless you have some evidence that you have not show I yet something to prove that what you 've see be true there be nothing I can do Allison hello you want some good news or bad news Lee good or bad you got to call it all right good give I the good and you well not disappoint you know that girl who escape from Mariposa Psych Keelin McKinney I be hot on her trail turn out she pay a visit to her shrink last night you be right that be excellent news but what be the bad Dr Woodel leave the window in his house unlock we think that be how she get in the housekeeper find he around noon he be lie in bed his wrist tie to the headboard stab to death with a knife from his own kitchen the whole scene be litter with Keelin 's hair and fingerprint I just do not understand why would she kill her therapist well we be talk about an escape mental patient this girl be commit because she got obsess with her teacher before she kill he maybe she got obsess with this guy too anyway we know who do it now we just have to find her girl come on what be you do back there Dinner 's ready wow wow look at you you look so pretty what be this all about we be give my face a test run I be go over to Finn 's house on Saturday to watch a

and there be nothing reform about you no please why be you do this Doctor come on I think we both know damn well why I be do this no I do not you can just let I go untie I walk away please I will not tell anybody what I know I certainly will not tell they that you kill your parent of course you would say that now but you be not exactly reassuring when you come to see I a few week ago back then it be give I half of everything you 've get or I be go to the police you even get that tape with she talk about it all but I do not want any more money now Chad I will give you those tape no one will ever know well you be right about that much stop you can not just kill I think it through Chad they will catch you you do not have some poor sick girl to pin it on this time actually I do but this time her name be not Summer it be Keelin you be go to tell I where those tape be in which case Keelin 's go to kill you nice and quick or you be go to put up a fight which mean Keelin 's go to take her time now the brother do not just kill the parent he be kill this girl Keelin McKinney and he kill Keelin McKinney 's psychiatrist well think about it he have to Dr Woodel know that Chad be the real killer and he be in the process of blackmail Chad I be sorry okay all right let us assume that you be correct about all of this the blackmail everything that Summer confess the truth to her psychiatrist and he use it to blackmail the brother how in the hell do Chad Lowry come into possession of Keelin McKinney 's hand I know I know he saw it off her arm after he kill she there be an APB out on this girl every policeman in the city be look for her do you seriously think that Chad Lowry track she down before the police could what if he do not have to track she down what if she come to he I mean he visit his sister every week in the hospital they probably know each other what if she come to he for help I do not know what to tell you Allison the Lowry murder be a closed case the murderer confess and even she do not dispute what happen the killing of the psychiatrist seem pretty open and shut as well I would love to show you some support in all of this but if the guilty party insist they be guilty that be okay you know what I know what I have to do I have to go back to Mariposa Psych Summer Lowry know what happen the night her parent die she obviously tell her psychiatrist

always good to hear your voice but I want to hear what you have to say so I be just go to stop talk and just listen hear what come out hear what come out you know what I really like you Keelin you be such a good listener even comb your hair be nice it be like share a room with a doll a doll that breathe oh with everybody else I have to act I know a lot of people say that but with I it be true really true and I get so tired of it sometimes it take a lot out of yo u act all the time I have to do so much work to figure out how to pretend to be sick I have to pretend that I belong in a place like this and I do not think that people would believe I but everyone do my parent they use to cry and they would say Summer we do not understand what be wrong with you Keelin be this something Summer say to you Keelin be this something Summer say to you but they believe I everyone believe I I mean I have to go ahead with everything after that do not I I have the whole world fool they all think that I be crazy and now they think I be get well I be a really good actor Keelin when I get out of here I think I be go to go to California and I be go to do movie I bet you my parent love I enough to buy a house in Beverly Hills oh my God thank you I will knock if I need anything I be not suppose to have visitor yeah well they make a little a little exception for I I be sorry if I get you in trouble I have to do that to Chad I have to you certainly do so what kind of timetable be we talk about here I mean how long be you go to string everyone along till you start convince they that you be get well what be you talk about you know I do not know how you do it I mean if I be in here I would go crazy they tell I that you can not even have any book which be why I decide to pay you a little visit I be go to tell you a little story if that be all right just to you know relieve the boredom so once upon a time there be a little girl she be 13 year old and her parent have everything which mean the little girl pretty much have everything but for this little girl pretty much be not good enough she want it all but she do not want to have to wait to inherit it and she do not want to have to earn it herself she need a shortcut so she come up with a plan with her old brother she decide to pretend that she be crazy and she be so good at it that the whole world believe she so much so that when her brother actually murder their parent no one have any trouble believe it be the crazy sick little girl that her demon have get the good of her that she just have to get pack away and ship off to a hospital so she could get all well this story be stupid it do not make any sense why would anyone want to be here lock up in a place like this because people like you once they be feel well once they can handle the world well they get to go home it be just about to happen everything be go accord to the little girl 's plan but then she make one little mistake she talk to her roommate she tell she everything you know the little girl think that this be safe because the roommate she do not speak she could not speak Catatonic friend be great like that when Keelin start wake up when you realize that she be repeat everything you say you must have be scare lucky for you that doctor do not go straight to the police he just use everything he know to try to get rich but of course he underestimate how lucky and smart you be lucky because Keelin run away you be smart because once that happen you have your brother kill Dr Woodel so everyone would think she do it and just like that both of your problem be solve I be confuse you say this be a story but you keep use the name of real people be that to make it more entertaining yes hmm to make it entertaining and fun and now I be go to use my own name you remember when I show up start ask question about your brother about how he might be the real killer when do you decide to kill he that you actually have to kill someone yourself be you do I do not know how do you think it end she get away with it well yeah you might be right you know there be one part of the story that still bother I what really happen to your friend Keelin I mean how do she get out of here and how do your brother find she unless she never really escape and she be here the whole time and you kill she you do it do not you she be still here she be still here somewhere and I be guess it be in that little garden that you love so much it be a good place to bury a body do not you think this be the exciting part of the story soon we be go to find out if I be right 'cause I bring some police with I and they they bring some dog the kind of dog that can smell drug and corpse oh look the dog find something already you bitch now there you be there be the real Summer Lowry well welcome back you know this hospital here it be not bad all thing consider but I do not think you be go to be spend a lot of time here I think you be go to be go to prison and that

see he you be the identity thief Sir this man be not my husband hey stop he so this be the man whose face you 've be see everywhere the actual man ALLISON that be right well how can you be so sure of that if everyone look like this man to you it be well that be over now the only time I see his face now be when I see he the real he we check the guy out turn out his name 's Fred Rovick and he do have a record not long but colorful way back in the ' 80 he got arrest for hack his way behind an IRS firewall and erase his dad 's tax bill this be when he be a sophomore in high school turn out a felony conviction make it difficult ff to land a gig with the big software firm so Fred 's have a tough go of it spend the last couple year fix computer with the Brain Brigade you know those guy who come over to your place and fix your computer for 25 buck an hour yeah I 've hear of they my wife use they to help set up our wireless network at home well turn out Fred meet a lot of wife while he be out do his job his uh manager tell we over the past six month or so that Fred 's be go on a bunch of maintenance call for one client in particular a woman by the name of uh Mallory Kessinger Mallory Kessinger the woman I be prosecute he be not just work for she accord to his manager at the Brain Brigade he be be brag about the big game he bag up at the Kessinger estate they be lover I think he may be the the person who be attempt to pay off that juror to make sure that Mallory 's acquit okay wait a second do not you tell I that the juror be ask for 200 000 where do someone who work for the Brain Brigade get a hold of that kind of money oh from we every single computer that the city own have be act weird the last few day we check with the IT department they 've be investigate the possibility that it be not just some weird glitch they think they 've be hack that someone break into the city mainframe and use it to send out thousand of e mail tell everyone that their voting district have change oh yeah I get one of those I 've just be too busy with this trial to open it Delete it those e mail be full of spyware anyone who download the attachment with the map of the new district get uh software on their hard drive that give the hacker access to everything on their computer personal information password you name it you got to admit it be a pretty good plan official look e mail from the city no one be go to think twice about open it I do not I think that be why I 've be see this guy everywhere everyone who open this e mail everyone whose uh identity be steal they all look like Fred Rovick look sir the jury 's still deliberate we need to tell the judge that one of the juror have be tamper with maybe we can get she to to declare a mistrial base on what exactly look I be inclined to believe you both but even so there be no proof nothing I can present to the judge I can not even tell she which juror be compromise well I guess it be a moot point I be need back in court the jury in the Kessinger case just come back what the hell do you say to Jeb Mr Teefers Good you be here yeah I be here I be here every night at 9 00 that be when Jeb and I usually talk but tonight he just ignore I he keep mumble go away what give yeah sorry but I do not think Jeb 's go to be pay much attention to you anymore really I doubt that see you might have say something to he that will work in the short term but think about it you can not outlast I I be in this for eternity I can visit Jeb whenever and wherever I want and eventually he will start listen again see you be miss the point come with I there be something I want to show you what be that what the hell be that you can rent one at a costume shop cost all the money I earn this week but it be worth it to get you out of Jeb 's life get I out of Jeb 's life I do not know what you be talk about but I think I just figure out who I be go to mess with after I get tired of Jeb 's mom hope you be ready to get it on kid 'cause you just make my list of thing to do after I put Jeb to bed Mr Teefers pay he a visit that stupid voice you do it be easy to imitate I tell Jeb that I be go away that he would not be see Mr teefer anymore he be sad but I explain that he be ready to be on his own and that there be one thing that he have to look out for Mr teefer ' evil twin and I warn he that he would be show up and try to get he to do stuff but that Jeb should ignore he until he go away and he will go away you seriously think the kid 's go to buy that I be go to walk in there right now and tell he I be the real Mr teefer that one he see early tonight that be the evil twin you could give it a shot but I would not get my hope up see after our conversation I tell he that we have to seal our pact and I have Jeb tie a red ribbon around Mr Teefers ' wrist so that he would be able to tell whether he be talk to the real Mr Teefers Come on suck huh that the one thing that you can not change be the way that you look so I guess you will be move along now you play I I can not believe you play I what be you like 16 you be already bad than that bitch therapist Leave do something else or go to wherever it be you be suppose to be head because there be nothing for you here okay not anymore now I have spanish homework be I surprised that the jury declare itself to be hopelessly deadlocked yes and no Frankly I be expect the speedy acquittal that my client deserve but at the end of the day a mistrial work in our favor too Mallory Kessinger be walk home a free woman and that be clearly the most important thing do you expect the district attorney to refile charge against your client that would be a very foolhardy move indeed Mr Devalos have have his day in court I think it be time for everyone to move on reporter 2 Mallory do you have any comment um I love my husband I love Donald and I miss he so so badly I just hope everyone realize that now 200 grand to get access to a couple billion that will be

squad car roll up yeah want to come over here stop he he be get away stop he turn he around let I see his face they process she bring she down for question do we know anything yet well we know her name Jennifer Whitten we know that she be 17 year old we know she turn 18 tomorrow and we know she be homeless turn out she be a ward of the state or at least she be suppose to be she and her parent be in a tragic car accident two year ago she survive they do not since then she be cycle through three foster home before she run away take to the street think I already know that excuse I I dream about she the other night I could not figure out why I still can not well let us see what we can find out so you can not tell I why you be in that house tonight no that be not what I say I say I will not tell you why I be in that house tonight have you see those people before that be the Prescott family they be kill two night ago drain of their blood pose just like the family whose house we find

be go to what you hear I I may be poor I may be only 17 but I 've see enough television to be pretty aware of my right I want a public defender and I be not answer any more question until you get I one Thoughts young female destitute she do not exactly fit the profile of a serial killer do she no she do not and then there be all those pesky unanswered question like where be the murder weapon what do she do with all the blood where be the camera she use to take picture of her victim once she pose they she be lie by the way I see that when she be talk to you she be there stand inside the first victim ' house the Prescotts she lie when she say she have never see they before you sure about this well then I guess I send forensic back to the Prescotts with a fine tooth comb hopefully they can find something anything that connect Miss Whitten to that scene as well because even though we find she hiding in the Andersons ' home the truth be while we have a hell of a case against she for break and enter there be no evidence whatsoever that tie she to these murder I do not know about you but I need some sleep sorry sorry sorry Mr Burroughs I be just I be just try to get back to my
