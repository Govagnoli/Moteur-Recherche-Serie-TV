to respond now after the easy touchdown drive for Dillon Coy Awnee bring back the kickoff for Westerby and up the left side the near side he get away and get a beautiful run back to the Dillon 40 yard line and the first down 's call a little bit of misdirection as they always do and Campbell bounce it out and get away he be go to go all the way into the end zone Westerby score on its first play from scrimmage wow we hear about these counter and man be they fast what a great misdirection and it fool the Panthers we be already into the second quarter Westerby 's Chaps give we all we can handle

Horn over the middle he get and even the pass game 's out of sync K C nothing be work right now it be really a dangerous time Westerby blow out that offensive line that time 54 Bandit Jesus they be fast run your route have faith in your route you will catch the ball it will be there every time and we will take this down the field nobody expect Westerby to be give we this kinda trouble the Panthers be look completely outta sync Westerby right now clearly with the momentum Ed that be horse crud watch yourself Coach you let a team like Westerby stick around long enough they think they could beat ya and the give be to Campbell on the counter yet again and he get a long way all the way down towards the goal line he be down at the one yard line they just seem to have no answer for

open to the left hand off to Williams wait saracen keep on a bootleg oh and he gets drill as he let that ball go he be get Dolia at the 45 he make the catch to the 40 what an inspire call by Coach Taylor he could go all the way go he be to the 20 to the 15 I do not think they be go to catch he oh Dolia gets strip at the 10 yard line and the Rattlers come up with the ball what a gutsy call by

he be workin ' on his anger oh my God this have to end I if not for you then for I I love you More than anything I love you my bad fear be to become you and call I crazy but we do not change this tire right here right now by ourselves we be both doom give you one drink you be good to go cheap date I get to tell you I go over to uh Garrity 's house the other night to confront Mr Garrity on send Lyla on a date oh I will bet that go well it do because I go over there specifically to have he look I in the eye and tell I that he do not want I date his daughter anymore what happen he do he tell I uh he want his daughter to have a good life Quad quote Quad quote I get to hand it to he though he go at it direct honest and I start think about uh how selfish I 've be since the accident you know always think about I never really think about her and how little by little over time be with I 's go to define she what be you go to do I do not know I think it be a maybe time that I let she go just let she go you know I be not lyla Garrity 's big fan but uh if you be think of leave lyla 'cause of Buddy you listen to I Grasshopper there be go to be a million Buddy Garritys out there who will try and tell you that you be not worth anything and you just get to look he right in the eye and flip he the bird just like that I will work on it and the Buddy Garritys of this world they be a cancer to you and I this be another tight one folk no one can seem to get the ball in the end zone and there be only nine minute leave in this contest now if Dillon do not win they will not go to the playoff but the real headline tonight be Smash Williams be ridin ' the pine and nobody 's talkin ' it be a mystery wrap in an enigma hog tie and shut up tight and everybody want to know why saracen take the snap he hand off to Baxter off the left side nice little spin move he be get some room oh and he have drop way to go Jim go Matthew all right all right let us keep it go let us keep it go move your stick move your stick it be second and a long 6 for the first down look like the Panthers get a little momentum go here folk but let us see if they can finish without Smash Williams in the backfield oh it be another 9 level run he be go down close to the first down that be go to bring up 3rd and 1 for the Panthers make something happen Come on let us go Red eight Hut it be a draw to Riggins Riggins have nowhere to go and it be another big loss of 7 yard on the play there be a time out on the field now hold on hold on Coach Taylor be not go to send the punt unit out it be 4th and 8 from their own 42 yard line this will be a very very risky move if he decide to go for it we get the cross or we get the deep rout I be lookin ' at those play you draw up what be you think if we set the x receiver in motion the linebacker 's go to follow he that be go to leave a huge gap between the safety and the other receiver then 8 to 10 yard linebacker fill the coverage yeah exactly fill the gap yeah so what so then I can just fire pop in there and stuff 'cause there be like an ocean between the safety and the other receiver you know why they play those safety back so far 'cause they be the fast damn safety in Texas that be why they get 21 interception between they do you understand that they want you to throw there Matt it be a trap you sure you can hit they yeah you be sure you can hit he I will he he fast I will hit he right in his stride if you get pick you know what be go to happen we be go to be watch the playoff on our sofas in our damn house you understand that Coach I get this I can do it it be real risky let I throw it Risky take your shot take a shot and quarterback Matt Saracen be come back onto the field and Dillon be go for it Fourth and long in their own territory if they do not get this this could be a disaster shift 68 high to 11 99 Niner on one ready go let us go that be 4th and 8th the crowd on their foot and this be a roll of the dice for Coach Taylor if they do not make it the momentum shift heavily in favor of South Pine Go Matt Saracen be over the ball Red Omaha White nine White nine Hut he be get a man in motion Saracen fire it be a bullet Pow wow it be right on the number and Riggins be in the open field he could score he be break tackle Ho ho he will not be deny he be in Touchdown Touchdown Dillon Let us see if the panther can keep their season alive how about those Dillon Panthers Let us hear it yeah yeah have a good time thank you very much thank you Coach I really hey buddy I just want to say thank you for trust I

the white pl he say they do not have the physicality but he say they have more creative thinking which make they well suited to lead that be what he say it be a stupid thing to say I understand as a guidance counselor I get to say that that to I be a fireable offense what he say all right well let I talk to my wife let I talk to the person who care about I and care about the team and also have to

this be truly heartbreaking folk for these Dillon player these loyal fan these folk would follow this coach to the end of the Earth and I be afraid that be exactly where he be lead they it be unfortunate but I be afraid the controversy of Coach leave have just be too much for these player you can see it in their eye the look of defeat the loss of heart and it would seem that the hope of

coming of coach Taylor have begin the Panthers take it in their own end zone he be up for the twenty get some room in the outside pick up a block and he be out of bound on the boarding good start you two be sit on the bench Weston Brooks come here folk look here Brett Weston start at quarterback the tailback will be Calvin Brooks that mean that the hot duo in texas high school football last year Matt Saracen and Smash Williams be ride the bench and that be a coach 's decision from Taylor that nobody see come he be send a clear message to his team it be his way or the highway he be get a man open on the right he fire holy cow be that off Weston hand off to Brooks he be get a little lane pick up up the inside he be hit hard fumble and Westerby have get the second play of the game and

Weston open leave he be look down field he fire Interception Touchdown and the Panthers be shoot down at the half with Smash and Saracen bench you got to wonder be coach Taylor cut off his nose to spite his face out of all of you who be get something to say someone well have something to say Coach Saracen and Smash sit down saracen and smash do not play defense they do not play special team and last time I check Saracen and Smash be suppose to be suppose to be two member of an 11 man offense who be get something to say maybe the whole be great than the sum of its part Landry do not keep it shut Saracen what do you say I mean maybe speak up we be a lot strong together than we be ever go to be alone I realize that I be not anywhere close to one of the most talented player in this room and I know I 've never play one real down of football but I know that we can either win together or we can lose alone and I know it sound stupid but it be an honor just to stand in here with you all that be it clear eye full heart can not lose let us play some football then hand off to Ellis he be get a little gap and he be block down by two panther as they show new life here in the second half bring

Brooks pick up the loose ball he be to the 40 he be inside the 30 Touchdown dillon that be set up with a tremendous hit by Landry Clarke to jar that ball loose and the Panthers be back in this game who be go to want it more we get to do something we get to win this game I guess we could start cheer louder maybe start do this dance we get to show coach we put this all behind we and that we be

Coach Taylor be send in the big gun this ball have get to be go to Smash Williams folk fresh leg ready to play this should be something listen up we be go I right storm rider z streak Landry 's z that be the call yeah that be the call you good I be ready Come on let us get it on on one ready Break here we go this be the last chance for the Panthers Saracen drop back to pass he be get Landry open he fire the ball across the middle Landry gets hit the ball go down and that be it the Dillon Panthers have lose to the Westerby Chaps Coach Taylor 's first game back do not end very well hold on Pass interference on the defense the ball on the 2 yard line we get one on time down you can not end a game on a defensive penalty folk the Panthers be go to have one more crack at the end zone here be a hand off to Williams he be up and over he be in he be in Touchdown Smash Williams the Panthers have do it the Panthers have do it 20 to 19 Taylor ball be back lead by a fantastic effort from Landry

would 've actually catch the ball but I guess I will take what I can get okay yeah no I do not think we should be together anymore okay and why be that People be talk that do not mean look I be just try to protect you do not just jump to a conclusion we need to sit down and talk about this away from here do you think if that have not happen that there would be a chance in hell that we would have get together do you actually think that in a million year just take a look in a mirror I do not know what I be think this be this be over I be think maybe before the concert we can get a bit to eat grab some pizza or something yeah look I do not think that I can go to the concert Panthers baby yeah why can not you go to the concert because I be piss off at you you cheat on I with the Swede and you would not tell I until I push you and then when that do not seem to work out you come back to I as if that would just be okay and you never say you be sorry I be sorry that might 've work a couple

parent they be deport I be sorry but I be bear here so do they leave you then in the care of your uncle be he your legal guardian well I be not quite clear then why you put Garrity Motors as your

not offer athletic scholarship but we do offer academic one should you decide to enroll at Whitmore we would love to have you play football for we but regardless you will get a full year of education from one of the top school in the country guarantee so I could be on a team that be two and nine last season say brian okay look tell I this how many player be draft last year I think you know the answer to that yeah none look I know you will get other offer yeah you right about that I do understand the allure of a big football university I just hope you will give our college real consideration

girl sell raffle ticket and to what end Pantherama Multiloquous it just mean talkative right do not use a 10 word when a nickel one will do and I think three angry paragraph about rally girl be kind of off point but I think you say it be good it be it be it be good but good be the enemy of great you know the less a reporter say the more she hear so what do you work at a newspaper too I do you be just try to prove a point I be Columbia school of journalism and then a year at the city desk of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel it be a good article cut it down make it great okay so when Owen be be recruit it be crazy I be a slave be you stuck take message for Smash all the time no Owen play the recruiter against each other he would listen to what UCC say and then go back to Miami Southern and

and energy on something that be not go to get he anywhere he need to be focus on his future Jamarcus be a self center kid who think that the whole world revolve around he and he be be some old high school football star do nothing but confirm that misconception well Mr Hall I hope you understand I could not agree with you more but I will tell you what I do not allow prima donna on my football team because I believe that football be about community spirit sir and I believe that it give young man a chance to be part of something all this time I think it be just a dumb game that this whole whack out town be obsess with no sir I do not think I would be devote my life to just some dumb game well if I can interrupt you just for one second sorry go ahead I really do understand I have to say it take I long time to understand this fuss about football he be very convincing about it but I do not get it either but what I do wanna express to you all be I have see football do wonderful thing for kid and that be because of my husband he have a great ability to take a kid get he out on the football field and inspire they and empower they and then that transfer over into their life at school and in every way I think he could do that for Jamarcus but Mrs Taylor Jamarcus lie to we and he be be lie to we all year I understand and I be really concerned about that believe I Coach Taylor will make he regret the day that he ever do that come to a game Friday night just one time just to see he out there in his element shine and for he to know that you be there support he in that I feel like it might make a difference we will think it over I think that go well you be open the door for I thank you so sweet thank you I think it be cute Funny I do not really know who the guy be but hey Devin

you be not go to sign with Grant anymore Man I think that be cool if that be really what you wanna do if you 've really think about it if you really see the big picture here but I do not think you do what be you talk about I do not think you see the fact that this big agency you be just another athlete on paper to they you be just another paycheck to they they be go to collect as many of you as they can to get another BMW in their garage that be what you be to they you need someone who be young someone who be smart someone who be ambitious someone who be go to put all their attention on you all their passion into you and all their drive behind make you because make you be go to make they that be what you need and Grant be that person I think so you be go to be his present you be go to be his future you be go to be his kid ' college fund you will re go to be the reason he be able to put dinner on his family 's table every night and he be go to work hard for you because of that because of his family because when success be essential to keep your family together there be nothing a man will not do ok all I be say be give he a shot go and talk to he he can get the job do he be be try to get ahold of you and you 've be ignore he Jason what would you get out of this dude I want Grant to give I a job but I also want to see you succeed so on my way back home I figure I would come down here and tell you you be make a mistake I could 've just go back to Dillon and say I do not get a job in the city and Wendell 's make a mistake and I really hope he make it and just leave it at that I could 've do that but you know I I be not the type of guy who just leave thing at that there be no one else like you man I be count on that you could not even wait till my body get cold before you replace I with the playoff come up I get to have some help somehow I be not replace you Wade Aikmen he be Joe McCoy 's boy you know that everything be understand until you come back he be interim you
