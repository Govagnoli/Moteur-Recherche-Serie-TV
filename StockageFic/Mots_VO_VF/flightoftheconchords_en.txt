loosely base on I you make it to the top our story be the story of two guy who start at the bottom and with a lot of hard work continue along the bottom and finally end up at the bottom oh yeah that be an intriguing scenario yeah it be a rag to rag story yeah imagine it yeah do you see the one about the guy who start at the bottom stay at the bottom and at the end they be still at the bottom oh yes that be our life so inspirational who would go and see that L I think I would see that I would go see that it be more realistic you be think that you be at the end of your tether now but what if this be just the beginning of your story then it be a slow start be not it this be good stuff okay I be write this and at the same time I be read it I could not put it down take a look at the end what happen at the end at the end you end up stage yourself a big broadway musical and it be a great success yeah but that do not mean it be go to happen like that well everything so far have turn out Bret
