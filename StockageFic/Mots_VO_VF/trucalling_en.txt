that know what you know that top be loose before it even come off seriously last week you know about my card and now this be you go to teii I what be go on I can not why not because you will not understand I come on Tru how do you know that I just do for the same reason I know it be go to rain at 3 00 or that Patterson 's go to throw a two hitter for the Tigers talk about answer a question

nice to meet someone who be not a jerk well we be not all jerk no you be not so maybe you do not mind I ask you how come you lie to I about be a student what make you think I lie you be suppose to be in your professor 's office at 2 00 with your report and it be 2 15 we do a good thing right stop that leak yeah we do so let us just leave it at that okay strange but okay do you like be a firefighter yeah I like help people do not you worry about how dangerous your job be you see it on the news all the time a firefighter go into a building and I do not really think about it sometimes a job just choose you you know what I mean yeah I do I mean you be good at it if we have not find that leak who know what could 've happen this afternoon this afternoon you do not know who could 've be kill actually I do no one what do you mean that be not anywhere near the accumulation necessary to cause an explosion that leak be not dangerous in time yeah a week two week down the line maybe but that leak be not go to cause a fire today not a chance the type of fire you be hypothetically describe would be cause by dip a cotton rag in some sort of accelerant like dimethyl benzene why be you so interested in discuss arson scenario do you have a grudge against someone I be here to learn Dimethyl benzene be find in clean solvent you soak a rag with the stuff put it next to a fuel source and kaboom the fiber you describe would be sear into the skin of anyone within proximity of the blast so this be arson Hypothetically Hypothetically yes it be quick to ignite it be hard to trace if you get it on your hand watch out it be nasty burn I be not here for the last fire inspection I spend the night in the ER thank for your help Davis if you ever need help with other hypothetical research project I be always here and if I be not here you can call my cell phone we couid even maybe discuss it over drink or something do you have company someone who be meet I a friend his name 's Nick Kelly Mr September it be for a good cause so you work here sometimes a job choose you anyway I be think arson you say the gas leak could not have start a fire today that mean it happen another way what be you talk about there be no fire at 84 Hastings no not yet I do not understand why you suspect he for a fire that have not happen he be indict for insurance fraud and you think he be plan to

his way to the foot of the bed pIaces his hand on the knife and yank it out of his own chest precisely but how be he suppose to walk around with a knife in his heart because the knife seal the wound

to I have to Harrison and Lindsay be in the middle of a nasty fight as much as I would like to take you someplace nice I just do not feel right leave they here alone maybe they should be alone so they can work it out for themselves I do not think that will happen Harrison 's being totally unreasonable that do not sound like Tru that be what I be say she be not be herself I think I should spend some time alone with her so I can figure out what be what because they be go to break up all right be there anything I can do no so just sit here do not move as soon as I talk some sense into my sister I

where be my stuff and my girl who cut up all these crazy newspaper that would be I really put together a little ransom note be we my wife 's obituary she pass away last week I be sorry to hear that I know it seem morbid but the paper say such lovely thing about she accord to this the funeral be yesterday in Philly and you be there it be a beautiful ceremony so you could not have be in McKinley Park last night Pardon be that my wife 's ashe she ask that they be scatter here I be sorry about the mixup but I 've get to go Carl 's not our guy he be in Philly when the murder occur you be positive I 've get his wife 's ashe to prove it on my hand that leave the guy with the pickup truck what cabin be he in I will check he out we should switch up Kevin make it clear he do not want I around I will take Kevin you take the other guy if you see anything suspicious I will scream like a little girl I will come find you whichever come in hey Come on in have a seat I be just wonder if you would hear anything from Tru or Harrison Zilch you nothing some Valentine 's Day it could be bad we could be single in which case I would probably be mope around my apartment right now watch dopey Meg Ryan movie and eat ice cream Damn I wish I be single I hope you do not mind I ask but what set off the big fight sorry the fight Tru tell I about it you and Harrison be fight right no you and Tru be the one fight right no right on time Davis tell I something good the lab guy just finish analyze the residue on the paper heart and they identify the substance as tobacco flake tar and nicotine level be consistent with a certain brand of cigarette Bullseye Lights so keep an eye out for smoker got it thank there be more I do a little research this afternoon on our serial killer the cop be try to keep this quiet it turn out there be five murder over the last two year all with the same m o all five occur on or around VaIentine 's Day so he be kill even more people than we think Wonderful say the word and I will meet you there there be no way you would make it in time just sit tight I will call you if I need anything you want to tell I what you think you be do luc what be you you be the one break into a pickup so you answer my question first I be turn the light off he leave they on and I just do not want it to kill the battery I guess you and Harrison work everything out I guess you and Harrison work everything out yeah it be not easy but I think I finally get through to he I talk to Lindsay we know you guy lie to we Luc you do not understand no I think I do this be the part where you tell I your life 's really complicated right that you take off without explanation and I just have to deal with it no I just here I be think you be the most amazing girl I 've get to know in a long time and the truth be I do not really know you at all Luc next time you break into a man 's vehicle do not get into a shouting match outside his cabin it tend to wake a body up I know what you be up to and I be warn you stay away from Kevin Rafferty what you hear I you be the second person I meet today that smoke that brand these be not yours of course not I 've get severe asthma I can not smoke damn it if these be not yours then whose be they Kevin 's he probably drop they get out of the truck Kevin 's there you be I be just go to come look for you save it okay I do not know what you and Tru be up to and I do not even want to know but whatever it be I be sure it be mostly your fault whoa whoa Calm down first thing in the morning you will take I home but baby no Harrison really no but and no more of your story this time we be through uh Kevin Damn it Terbutaline that be only prescribe for people with life threaten asthma so the cigarette belong to Kevin right which make he the seriaI killer right again well if Kevin be the serial killer then who kill Kevin I be think maybe Kevin went look for another victim last night and that victim turn the table on he right the only question now be who come on you 've get to be kid I lock out yeah you work here my sister own the place she go for a walk but I be just about to go find she if you want to come with I will get you another key you be a lifesaver Lead the way the guy with the pickup be not the serial killer Kevin be what there be two killer Kevin kill the girl in McKinley Park and someone else kill he last night Davis and I think it must be someone he attack that do not make what I have to tell you any easy Kevin take off I lose he you what and Lindsay stop by to chew I out I only take my eye off he for two second great that mean he be still in danger so what if he be in danger the guy be a serial killer let us knock off and let nature take its course you do not get it everything you and I do today that we do not do yesterday it change fate so so thing might play out differently this time maybe the person Kevin attack do not fend he off tonight maybe that person die instead of he Evening Carl buddy what be shake I be about to ask you the same question I just see your lady friend walk off with another fellow what who Eileen 's brother she introduce I once I forget his name which direction do they go and then as if thing be not bad enough he leave I sit in the room alone for three hour and be you sure this be the way your sister go I want you to meet someone my girlfriend Amanda we never spend a Valentine 's day apart this be a joke right she die three year ago a car crash have you ever lose someone close to you it change you it separate you from other people they say they be sorry they bring flower they send card but they do not really understand what you be go through they do not know what it mean to lose her that be why I do this so that other people will know what it feel like I want they to understand just like the people who love you be go to understand oh my God be you all right yeah I think so you okay so I guess we finally figure out who ice the guy yeah I guess it be just what be you okay sorry this place be just sort of creepy no it could not have be Lindsay I see she yesterday just before I find the body she be fine so who the hell kill this guy you the killer have to be someone who know the truth he say that be his girlfriend what be that sweetie he say that be his girlfriend he tell I he be meet his girlfriend he have not mention it to I Eileen she be cover for he you always look after I you always take care of I PIease do not stop now all right kill I kill I before I hurt someone else please I can not I be your sister I love you if that be true then you will put an end to all of this once and for all I be beg you Kevin please do not do it Eileen I would never he be my brother how long have you be protect he I have not he confess everything to I just before you come to the cabin I beg he to go to the police but he promise he would not kill again I believe it until I see he follow your friend and then I know he could not stop do it please kill I please before I kill again no I can not I be sorry but we will get you help the good doctor I do not want their help I want yours but if you can not no Kevin do not please you be all I have I get to be honest I do not even know if you deserve to live but I know if you go through with it you be not just kill yourself you be kill she too thank you so let I see if I 've get this straight Tru

but we get some pretty questionable job applicant but you on the other hand good school six year of EMT experience this be pretty good some would say that you be overqualifie some might say I be late

much easy your father 's birthday be this weekend and I be throw a party for he I will be there you say she would probably walk out on I I be thrill Tru thank you excuse I I be go to wash up okay what be go on those be the first polite word you 've ever say to her I guess we be all full of surprise today hey kid what be crack Jordan come by and tell we she be throw a party for Dad tonight and Tru tell she off actually Tru say she would be there she be kill come on get out of here why else do you think I would hang out with her I do not have a choice she be kill she ask for my help the day rewound and I be stuck with she for the entire day we be go to go pick up Dad 's cake I guess we will see you guy later Mind if I come along you know help with the party planning of course that would be nice what do you know could you excuse we for just one sec you can not tell I something like that and just run off to some bakery do you need I to do something I do not think so not yet but when Dad ask you about Lindsay tonight tell he how you really feel not what he want to hear you will be glad you do okay my office I will be right back so Jordan where to after this back to the hotel or you may be meet someone else it depend on how much time I have what kind of cake do you think he be go to want this year honestly you 've get the wrong girl if you be look for intimate knowledge of Richard Davies then we have something in common what do you mean by that Tru I love your father and I might even understand he but that do not necessarily mean that I know he I think that he only ever let one person in completely and that be your mother so the rest of we we just take what we can get can I help you we will take the big chocolate one sure thing I see the bulk of your work experience have be as an EMT why the sudden desire to change team the truth be I think I would accomplish everything I want to in that line of work I contact all your previous employer and they all say the same thing that you be good at the job but one day you do not show up just disappear be there anything you want to say about that a couple of year ago I die excuse I I be at a scene work on a kid about nine year old he have a gunshot to the back we would just get a pulse and I guess someone do not want the kid to make it he start fire I catch the bullet instead I remember it feel like a bee ste on the back of my neck right here three minute and 28 second that be how long my heart stop and then I come back and what be that like you know they say an experience like that change you it should make you want to live every day to the full but for I it just I lose it I know something have to give it just do not feel right it just do not feel right entrust life to my unsteady hand I think a change of location would help it do not I be hope a change of vocation will some would say once you survive something like that that you be bring back for a reason I guess we will see I love cut through the park if it stay like this it may be nice living here be you sure you do not want to just take a cab I know you have a lot to do today no we be just go a few block I just want to let you know I really appreciate you give I a chance today you know your father and I do not fight very often but when we do it be usually about his relationship with the three of you really for what it be worth I think his distance come from guilt about how he deal with what happen but he be different now he want to make thing right he be change he be a different man Tru Jordan go now we know why we leave the city they can talk all they want about the shrink crime rate you know I think I be go to lie down a bit before the party close my eye hey thank you who know what couid've happen if you have not be there I be just glad you be okay thank boy never a dull moment if not the little one it be Jordan Luckily she be fine luckily you be with her she be sweet Dad I probably should 've notice that soon I would probably well get go it be nice that you stop blame she blame she for what I and your mother look Dad I be glad that I could help Jordan but now be not the time no it be not the time it be long overdue sit down when I meet Jordan yes your mother and I be still marry I be pretty clear on that part but we have already decide to get a divorce what why do not I know this before because you do not want to I love your mother Tru but the fact be we grow apart she become distant unreliable she would run off at a moment 's notice at very odd hour flimsy excuse it be like she be live some secret life the truth be when I meet Jordan I would be alone for year but I 've say enough too much probably today be not a day for live in the past i'ii see you tonight will not I it would mean the world to Jordan if you would make an appearance and it would to I as well hey you make it I do hi you look beautiful so do you please I stop look beautiful two child ago so this be Tru Richard 's daughter the one I tell you about Jordan 's be singe your praise all night so if you will excuse we I have a lot of people I want you to meet come here Harrison Dad I want to introduce you to my girl Lindsay Mr davy be not you Tru 's friend from school yeah there be Tru it be nice to see you again she seem like a nice girl she be one of the nice one I 've meet in a long time that be good to hear but at your age Harrison yeah at my age you meet Mom now you would not consider that a mistake would you no absolutely not think about it you have three wonderful kid if you have not notice yeah I see your point God you be so unexpected sometimes Dad what he be here who what be you talk about the man from the park who attack Jordan he be here or at least he be he be here now that mean it be not random he be look for her I be go to call the police do not let Jordan out of your sight excuse I you what do you want with her the daughter be always the last to know where be your daughter it be you you kill my mother what do you want from we what be up Dad say something be go down with Jordan he be here the man who mug Jordan be here the man who kill Mom what it be the same person go find Jordan make sure she be okay Harrison go hurry up you 've go way too far this time I tell you the last time this be over you understand I never want to see you again Tru Wait will you give I a chance to explain you know he this be not what you think you do not want to know what I think right now yeah I know he he be an ex con and his name be Carl Neesan and you know that because I be the one who convict he I be an ADA 15 year ago he be a kid up on a murder rap he say he be innocent which they all do the evidence be flimsy but I be out to impress so I go after he and be he guilty the jury say he be that be good enough for I at the sentencing he swear revenge and he say if he ever get out he would make I pay why today why today of all day do he show up you think this be the first time this have be go on for year he show up he demand money he threaten retribution so I pay he and he go away until the next time and today today I tell he it have to stop I be not go to pay I never think that he would follow through with his threat God I never want to get you involved in this not you not Jordan and what about Mom what do your mother have to do with this he kill she he kill Mom why would you say that I be there no sweetheart I hear his voice I will never forget that voice he kill Mom because he be angry with you he want revenge Tru no do not tell I no I see he I be there I see he pull the trigger that be not what happen how can you tell he say he it be not you do not think his be the first name I think of the police investigate this thoroughly and say this be not the man Airtight alibi not your man Mr davy but I hear his voice but do you see his face no we live with the question long enough we want an answer so our mind play trick on we and make we think we 've get one but we do not come on it be cold let us go inside no I can not I 've get to go to work tonight they be expect I I should go happy birthday daddy do not you think you 've be through enough why do not you go home and get some sleep Sleep that be a novel concept if Neesan do not kill my mother then be it true what that her death have something to do with her call despite what you might think I do not have all the answer but I will promise you this I will help you find they thank Davis but for now I be go to take you up on your first offer I be go to go home draw a bath and try and get some sleep I guess you do not hire Jack after all actually I do I decide to go with my gut that be weird what be that well yesterday he take my soda this one with my name on it and today it be still here you know how many way you can alter fate yesterday you meet he today you do not it be impossible to predict how that might alter thing yeah I guess just give he a chance I think you will be happy that you do he be next door it will get easy what be that this do what we do all these people take before their time sometimes it just do not seem fair never really think about it that be one way to deal I guess but if you ever want to talk sometimes it help you know what I think be unfair when tube and machine keep people alive when life be prolong beyond its usefulness that be what be unfair yeah I guess I will be honest with you for my money I think that death be one of the fair thing that ever happen to some of these people you say you have not think about it you catch I anyway I just want to say welcome I be Tru like the name on the soda can yeah that be right Jack and um and thank for make I feel so welcome it be never easy be the new guy it feel familiar do not it you okay yeah do not move stay here Dad no he will kill you he kill Mom I do not care what the cop say I swear it be he I believe you and that be why this have to end no Dad lock the door wait here for I you be grow a conscience in your old age Richard who the hell do you think you be the man you pay to kill your first wife at least if I remember correctly we have a deal I pay you you go away you do not honor it so now it end now I mention the letter right the letter detail everything that be send to your daughter if I meet an untimely death Tru go go now when we meet next there will not be any warning shoot there will not be

machine use to log fingerprint flat panel to take hand impression I read the manual Good I wish someone have tell I I would not have get up so early then we could not have spend this quality time together and the truth be there be a couple of thing I do not know such as such as do you like work here the reason I ask be you do not look like your average morgue attendant yeah and what do I look

not spend every Friday night at home I mean well anyways what do you do on Friday night why do not you tell I well you do not stay in that be for sure because that would mean you would be alone and you be not a guy who be very keen on be alone so you go out to a bar or a club and after a few hour you return home sometimes solo but usually with some nameless faceless shameless girl who just do not understand you but either way by the end of the night you be alone in front of the tv eat a microwave dinner I do not own a microwave but you still have not answer my question do you like it here actually I do I understand you do because not everyone do that be because most people believe that only the live need help hand they over right now can I help you you sure can open the safe under the

arrangement for eight year I think that be long enough not for I I mean I appreciate the bonus but you will be hear from I again Count on it why do not you tell I about your arrangement and you be someone who care about Carly she say you be an old friend but you look more like an extortionist to I actually I be a reporter for the Sun Times what you just see be an interview for a story nothing

scandai you do not think the reporter 's the kiIIer no Carly 's worth too much to he alive if not he then who I be back at CarIy 's try to figure that out I can not believe you do that look at it accord to your spreadsheet there be a probability that the killer 's someone close to the victim right who be close to Carly than Anna just leave I alone hey what be up you be suppose to be here two hour ago where the hell have you be I lose track of time no biggie actually no it be a biggie I tell you that this be important to I well I be here now so where be the big sis she leave her loss right

yourself untie whatever we be through Anna Tru what be you do here carly have a few more question about the morgue ask I to stop by be everything okay with you two honestly no why what happen I ask carly if I could borrow her car to run some errand while she be at her mom 's she say fine I get in a fender bender while I be out and she throw a fit you be in an accident I be pull out of a spot when this other car just crunch the door and leave a nasty red paint scrape but so what it be just a rental sorry hello good you make it Anna be in an accident in Carly 's car what a red car crash into the driver 's side door if the damage be before she drive to the bridge maybe she be not force off the road maybe she drive off the bridge herself Suicide no way the police say that carly call 91 1 say someone be follow she why would she do that if she be plan suicide someone kill she I know it but who and why carly but that can not be right it do not make any sense fine yeah I will call you back after I talk to her Bye be everything okay that be Carly 's agent and accord to he there be no morgue movie what the movie about the morgue attendant do not exist her next project 's suppose to be a romantic comedy if there be no movie why spend the day with I and Tru I be just wonder the same thing hello carly lie to we there never even be a morgue movie what it do not exist she make it up why would she come to the morgue why would she ask we all those question what if you get to a crime scene and it look like a murder have take place but the body be go Davis this may sound crazy but I think she be try to fake her own death what do you say both day she ask what happen if I get to a crime scene and there be no body she need to be sure the miss person would still be declare legally dead why because that be her pIan Fake her own death and disappear that be why she spend the day with we she want to get the detail right so no one would catch on she have everything why would she do something like that think about what the last eight year have be like for her know her secret couid come out at any time she must have have enough probably think this be the only way out if you be right then Carly be not force off the bridge by another car and that caII to 91 1 also fake there be just one problem carly do not fake her death yesterday she actually die otherwise the day would not have restart something must have go wrong something she do not plan for well whatever that something be you have to get there before it happen oh my God I need help you have to come now someone 's

be so liberating and he bring up something interesting he ask if I ever think about how what we do could have a ripple affect well yes every time you save someone it change the course of history you not only affect that life but the life of everyone that person will touch Tru the power that you have be awesome to change history for the well what be it it be just the way he be talk about it I be not so sure Jack always think it be for the well could I get a hand out here I get a body Suicide find over at Chelsea River what be go on with the good doctor no one come to claim he that be kind of sad yeah it be sad what nothing you tell he do not you it be okay you can trust he here let I help you with the body wait what I do not say here we go help they Jack do you yeah look like they be play our song so what do you remember about the doctor 6 ' tall mid 40 dark blond hair it be 8 02 you say Colvin die around 8 10 accord to witness do you remember where you pick he up Tru I 've never be much of a morning person come on Jack 3rd and Cliffwood East or West East meet you there East 3rd and Cliffwood where be he I do not know it be 8 09 he should be here what it might have be west 3rd excuse I I be call it 8 10 a m that man be dead because of I that be not true I could 've swear it be East 3rd we can not always be perfect have you ever lose anyone yes I understand how you feel it be hard to believe anyone understand how I feel Dr Frank Colvin he be the one that ask for help yeah we do not make it to he on time what do you mean by we Jack and I together yeah thus the and so you guy talk right sorry I tell you yesterday of course you do not remember Jack and I speak and Davis he be another I really he say that it be incredible be not it yeah it be incredible just one sec it be Lindsay I be suppose to be meet Randall this guy propose to her go ahead you can take the call that be okay I will call she back now about what you be not say I do not get it there be two of you and you still could not save he Jack get the street wrong right wrong street seriously it be an honest mistake when do you last make a mistake that cost someone their life why be you be so hard on he why be not you you beat yourself up over the slight misstep you be go to give Jack a free pass over someone 's life I tell you it be not his fault what be go on with you anyway can not you just be happy for I that I find Jack or do every silver lining have to have a cloud sometimes it do I be sorry I can not live like that I have to take victory where I can find they since when be lose someone consider a victory he be right Tru maybe we just have to admit we lose this round I do not think that we have it be good to see we be all on the same page again you be say I do not think this be over yet Dr Colvin die of a massive heart attack we could not have stop that even if we get there on time and he say help they not help I maybe he be suppose to die lntereste everyone ask for help for a reason we just have to find out what his reason be you get something to add Davis I be think if every rewind be a matter of life and death and the doctor say help they you have to figure there be at least one person connect to this man who will die today maybe more the question be who be it and can you find they before it be too late since no one claim the body yesterday we should start with the next of kin Lindsay you be my good friend and I believe in you somehow I know you will make the right decision about Randall today all right I will call you later Bye how have it sound too surprised not surprised enough it be perfect I almost think you be worried she might say yes not today so you think the doctor 's son be the one we be suppose to save he be the next of kin and his only family can I help you be you Marc Colvin yeah we work at the morgue downtown and I be sorry to have to tell you this but your father pass away this morning Heart attack yeah it would be we be wonder if you would mind come down to the morgue to claim the body I would rather not thank you for tell I about it though but you be his son my father and I be not very close it be none of your business but he do not exactly approve of I since Frank Colvin never claim I as a son I do not think I should have to be the one to claim he now why do not you try his office that be where he live most of his life what be up doc God be Tru around no she be out in the field can I take a message I want to tell she in person I will tell you anyway I 've get some great news about Lindsay she already know about that how do she know I just get the message because Tru have be talk to Lindsay about the guy all week what guy the guy that Lindsay be think of marry I do not say anything about marriage this be awkward be not it only if you do not keep talk come on Davis what guy Randall Thompson I think an investment banker with an lrish accent which woman find so appeal I do not understand why accent have such an effect because when you think about he be foreign he be from another country he just live here suddenly he just pop the question and ask some chick to marry he hello what do that say to you that he be impulsive and like to travel no I be actually a referral Dr Colvin leave I a message ask I to come by today Dr Colvin 's office this be grace can you hold please Miss Casola the doctor will be here soon please take a seat and wait he say 10 00 a m I 've be wait you know what forget it sorry about that Mrs Hoffman your test result will be in this afternoon and I will have he call you first thing okay bye hi how can I help you my name be Jack Harper and we be with the city morgue I be sorry to be the one to tell you this but Dr Colvin die from a heart attack at around 8 00 a m we be wonder if someone from this office could come down to the morgue to identify the body right we need to close for the day look in the doctor 's book and call anyone who be schedule for an appointment Lily be probably still wait for he someone should probably tell she Lily she be a waitress at the coffee shop across the street she be go to community college and Frank be tutor she let we help you it be on the way we will tell she so you think this girl might be one of they you say it yourself Ripples one person 's life touch so many other how many life do Dr Colvin touch and if Davis be right which one of they be go to die today oh my God what happen he have a heart attack I serve he coffee every morning for over a year one day he see I draw a sketch of the human anatomy from my biology text he correct I on what he tell I the left lung be small than the right lung to make room for the heart he say that that be how he would remember it because it be like life the heart always come first excuse I the man Lily know and the man his son know be two different people you know how family be they always save the most dysfunctional stuff for each other hey man Lily leave her book here you can probably catch she at the bus stop which one down the block the number 6 a bad accident the radio say a dump truck plow into the Number 6 bus yesterday there be an accident Lily 's bus there it be Wait stop stop the bus hold on Lily stop the bus wait Jack no Jack what the hell be you think be you tell I you 've never jump in front of an oncoming vehicle to save someone be you okay I think so you forget this thank you so Jack stop the bus okay that be okay you be allow to be wrong about he I forgive you all right what now that be the thing yesterday you and I talk about how one life touch so many other how do I know this be what Dr Colvin mean when he say help they anybody die in the accident yesterday that be just it luc be not sure although Jack think Jack think what do you think what I be go to tell you if you would let I be that Jack and I be talk about life touch you tell Jack about what we talk about come on it be not as if it be classify I do not even know that you talk to I about it until now what be with you why be you act like this I know it must be a big relief to share this with someone but ever since you learn the truth about Jack you be walk around with blinder on which be exactly what I think he want please do not tell I you be jealous I be not jealous I be skeptical which you use to be what be there to doubt Jack 's practically prove that he be here to help have he he jump in front of a bus to stop an accident which you just say yourself might not have kill anyone you have to ask yourself why Jack why now why would the two of you be in the same place at the same time I know that you do not want to be aIone in this but something here be not right and something about he be not right you okay fine my mind be just on other thing you feel like share I just want to follow up a little on Dr Colvin 's call for help Tru we save a busload of people our work here be do you 've get to learn to take yes for an answer the son might know something I just want to try he again all right let I grab my stuff no it be fine I get it no reason for both of we to be obsessive right why should I waste my time because it be the right thing to do you be his son I need not pretend it mean more to I than it do to he can not you just for today do this one little thing for he I be sorry to intrude you again your father 's body be still unclaimed and nobody be even come to identify it what you both go to the same school of etiquette I have my reason good one we be not here to judge you do not know my father he be the man who convince a 15 year old kid that he be a failure because he want to do something other than follow in his father 's footstep it be year before I realize that artist do not mean disappointment okay so your father be not a saint but he try to help people do you know he be tutor someone a girl in junior college really be she study biology something medical yeah Dad be a decent guy if you meet his expectation but if not

be his patient I be not his patient they also find a file with your name on it in his office I never even meet this man before he be kill a number of witness say they see you have an argument with this man what be that about I never have a gun when I be arrest do that mean anything prosecution go ahead without the weapon a place that crowd people tramp through the crime scene anybody could 've kick it anyone could 've pick it up the police will not see that as significant because they have a witness this witness be the man that frame I his name be Jack Harper he be look for a way to bring I down why would he wanna do that because we have this past Dad it be complicated Dad why do you ask Harrison to step outside because I think you might have something to tell I that you would not want

I be take Dr Burrell 's body to the security crypt generally that be where we keep high profile case I think it be a good idea at the time because the suspect be a morgue employee and yes Miss Davies

write a book be you really wow Hands on professional and a man of word all in one package tell I you can do laundry and we will run away together under what circumstance be it ethical to discuss a patient with the police the law vary from state to state but basically when there be immediate threat Knowledge of a past crime would not be enough only if it contribute to your belief that there be a threat and past crime can help predict future behavior you be a man of many surprise Davis what be the book about Hmm hello it be I Harrison give I your number he say something about put your phone in the back of a truck oh God Davis it be so good to hear your voice be you all right I be fine do not worry about I do you find anything about the note no and the word 's spread I do not know how much time I have leave we still do not know what Varden mean but if it be the killer 's name and he be a patient he probably will be in Burrell 's file I think of that but break into the man 's office that be risky and the police could still be there and if Varden be not in the file then it be all for nothing not necessarily I 've be speak with Carrie Search for someone the doctor would assume would present a danger someone with a violent background I can not sit there all night go through file you be right we will hope the right one be near the top there be one more thing unless you have a background as a jewel thief I do not know about I do not see you just waltz into a locked office do the morgue still have Burrell 's personal effect I see where you be go with this talk to you later I will be right there hey Messenger Package go to County Records make sure it get there quickly trust I I get it you really come through today Harry I be good with emergency it be that day to day stuff

around to make sure it happen again Jack 's be hang around Avery too they can not both be victim so he be play we you assume that Carrie be the decoy it could 've just as well be Avery let us not do this Davis please I wish I could investigate both option I do you be go to have to handle this yeah so you can run off and be with your new friend what I just do not think you be be objective what and you be I know you like she and I know what it be like to lose someone you care about but Davis you be just not be no tru you can not do this to I you can not make this about poor funny little Davis who always lose it when a girl smile at he this be not funny this be serious and I 've get to go protect this woman myself and if she die because you be not there to protect she I will never forgive you so how long have you volunteer here year it be something Jensen get I into when we be both pre med you 've know each other a long time yeah we use to well we use to have a lot of class together you use to go out a long time ago what happen we just become good friend it be really like 100 time well this way you take care of he yeah and he take care of I I mean he would take care of I if I let he and that be my heart to heart limit for one day okay you get it so what be that this be the sign in it be people with appointment be you look for someone I be just try to get a feel for everything that be all there be a little filing today so we should probably start here so what be you go to do uh look like some record just got send over so I get to sort these I could do that too and spin plate and play the kazoo take it easy Tru all right you be a superstar but you do not need to save the world I guess it just feel like that sometimes well Alexandra keely that be Lexi 's file Avery you should not look at that I get to go no wait let us talk about this you can not confront she you do not know what be go on Assume I do Jensen 's be lie to I know you wanna protect he but there be a well way let us talk to he together excuse I do you know if there be a sign in sheet yeah over there excuse I oh Davis I find out why Lexi may have want to kill Avery the secret be that there be no baby I see her medical record she have a uterine myoma and get a hysterectomy two year ago so she can not be pregnant it be a scam to get Jensen to marry she no wonder Lexi do not want that to get out what so you have a new theory you will consider every point of view except mine I be not try to ignore you I be try to prevent a death listen I get to go Tru I have an appointment with the real killer thank you for the tea it be very hot I would do anything for the man who be go to reopen my brother 's case well we do not exactly reopen case at the morgue we do like to educate ourselves about what happen I understand that your brother drown in a bath well that be what she tell everyone but it be not right it do not make sense but he be a drinker right not so that he would pass out in the tub and they never find that bottle of pill she destroy it because she know they could link it to her but surely a small prescription bottle could be throw away no she kill he I be sure that she will be punish by the universe not by human hand because that would be wrong no my brother be a good man he never lay a hand on she and he never pass out in any bathtub and do not you tell I about who dispense justice I know that no one do because I know what she do what be go on you be not safe here come on come on in I know it be not much but it have central air which be good because the morgue when the AC break down sometimes we tend to walk around naked and huh that be beautiful yeah I get these in Mexico but you can not eat off they because the glaze will cause severe brain damage would you like a Fresca no thank I like your apartment yeah I feel so safe here I be embarrassed that I show you these in the first place it be probably just some neighbor kid play a joke yeah I do not think so but you be safe here you be okay here I know she do not even come back here at all today Avery no but she call in she do Great she say she be meet up with her friend Jensen and his fiancée where do she say where um Standard Diner do you know it Surprise I know you think I cancel it I be not sure you would get the message I do not well you be here so obviously do you see Avery which one

bathroom I think I do not know why what be up look I do not wanna say this but there be something I have to tell you and it be not Tru I be at the clinic today and Lexi 's record be there I move they there I think with the baby it would be good to have the good care what be this about I see the record and there be something she be not tell you you see the record yeah I be there with Avery no I do not care I do not wanna know whatever you see be private Lf she want to she will tell I about it Jensen she be not pregnant what she have a uterine myoma they perform a hysterectomy you need to know

Chick fight Chick fight I love a chick fight I be come to your birthday every year ah man this be bad Lexi he be go to find out I know I know he will when he do it be all go to be ruin oh this be even

this be a great party man I know you would do the right thing with that money you know get everybody here Jack give I the name of these horse and I win and I use the money for the party but I think

never be it be Carrie and I be so so sorry I do not listen to you I really be that be okay you be here now be she here be she safe yeah she be in the other room she be safe any more note any other suspect besides the sister in law no more note I do not think the sister in law would do it herself I think she hire someone and the note be clearly an attempt at a blackmail go bad I be still not sure Davis stop you know who write these note they be both decoy it be not Carrie or Avery the death be still on and it be happen in the morgue but there be no one there how can it happen again because someone be there and he be there on day one who the light do not go out because of the hot tub the wiring be bad and the maintenance man be there right now no it be frustrating be not it Jack

we grow up with be lock up they be in jail Billy you have use up about 10 of your nine life you can not be lucky forever one day thing be go to go sour I just do not want it to be tonight right so wait up be that why you come by today to tell I to stop do job I do not see you for three month and suddenly you be my parole officer I be just say you do not have to do it tonight what you want I to call my daddy like you maybe he can give I a job here be the problem my daddy live on a bench right across from the bus depot right last time I see he he ask I for a quarter do not even know who I be

trust I on this Billy okay stay home I will take it under advisement so what be up with you and Jack huh love or hate I wish it be that easy but the two of you seem to be hit it off though have you know he long just meet he today oh it be funny how thing can change in a day huh oh just so you know Jack and I be not together we never have be so he be fair game if you be interested I be not really think long term yeah sometimes it be more fun not to last year I have someone I be real close to and it take off fast and heavy and then uh well and then he die oh I be so sorry I be so angry when Luc die I could not breathe after a while I realize how lucky I be for the time I have with he and then the crazy thing happen what I have a great day right when I think that I never would again sometimes good stuff happen out of the blue too so apparently Jack tell you I be die I have a life insurance policy and I do not plan on be around for Christmas Look I be not try to question your motive I can not even begin to imagine what you be deal with but what if there be another way to get that money a hundred thousand dollar unless you be a bank robber I would say you be crazy what if I could it be not just about the money I know but you have a great day I mean you could set your Plan B in effect any time tomorrow or next week or next month it do not have to end tonight how you do well and well anyways guy it be so great to see you but I 've get to go right now yeah just think about what I say here where you go to the Coogan fight oh you be ditch jazz to go watch box oh I be in Deal Coogan take a hit then another Norm 's hand just keep come Ladies and gentleman this be not the way it be suppose to go and he go down Coogan be down it be all over I tell you folk damn it somebody should 've see this come and it be official Coogan be out that be 50 100 hi thank you okay and that be 100 000 I have a hunch uh it will have to be a cashier 's check that be perfect could you make it out to Wendy and Megan Roberts please okay hey you wanna see something awesome I just win 100 wow that be great okay miss I just need you to sign right here and here I do not know you make a bet yeah I do how much do you win um a hundred buck like you Nice you know you can get that in cash yeah I know but it be for tax purpose there you go thank think I should 've get mine in a check oh no cash be so much more fun Hmm Hmm these be fantastic Harrison you just win we this case I be proud of you Umm so what be go to happen to those guy Jail most likely great job son right so how we do on that list of yours we still get some time I know but right now all I wanna do be see my sister I hope she be still awake Wendy you be not go to believe what happen your friend Tru stop by she just hand this to I some story about a special charity the Relive your Day Foundation I mean be this for real apparently do you have any idea what this mean the good doctor the good treatment and that trip to Greece you

there make it well well like almost fun almost fun wow that be a ring endorsement almost fun Nice you know what I mean yeah sometimes I can just go to dinner and see a movie and be very very normal I think maybe normal 's overrate so one weird day huh you have no idea we have a long talk you know you and your sister I and Tru she make I think about a lot of stuff I think maybe I 've be pretty selfish Stupid how so well I try to make it all about the money but now that we have it time seem more important I think you do not want machine and tube I do not but like Tru say I can always go to Plan B later if I 've get just a few more good day with you then I do not wanna miss any of they I be go to sort of take this one way trip tonight but now if you be willing maybe we could both go when I be a little girl my dad work at the Edison Tower he would take I up to the observation deck point out at the horizon and say that everything I could possibly dream of be just past that line he would say just picture it whatever your heart desire and it be out there just wait for you he die when I be 10 but I 've always go back there to look out over the city and dream about the thing that I want if I look long enough I can usually see they go with I tonight Jack and what do you think we will see another day I be go to go get my coat hello she be go to kill herself all she want from I be to help she make it look like an accident Congratulations Easy day she change her mind that be not an option I be not go to kill she that be not an option either you know the rule yeah a body ask Tru for help and I make sure they stay dead but I be not the one who change the rule this time so as far as I be concern it be dealer 's choice Jack when fate gets mess with there be consequence you ready to accept the responsibility for those consequence you have to be strong Jack and you have to do your job come on let us make this a night to remember who secretly lead the Rohirrim through the mountain

everything under control two people ask for help last night that be a lot to handle even for you if you be try to keep something from I whatever it be I can handle it I just wanna help two people do not ask for help last night Davis only one do and it be not Jensen I do not understand Jensen do not die I be say he do not ask for help look I be sorry I lie I do not think that you would help I if you know the truth Tru look at the end of the day you be the one save live I get that and if you ever need I I will always be here for you especially today Tru hey hey oh be Davis outside talk to Tru oh great I be tell you once those two get start it take forever for they to stop really you look like there be someplace you need to be yeah I be suppose to meet somebody but I do not wanna interrupt you know oh do not worry about it I will just tell they you have to run I think there be another reason you be keep the truth from I I think on some level you think there be something wrong with this that there be a reason that Jensen do not ask for help you think fate want he to stay dead well do not you I do not give a damn what fate want because fate obviously do not give a damn about I how can you say that you of all people look at my life Davis look at everything I 've sacrifice to do this job to answer this call I 've lose friend family sleep sanity you name it all in the name of fate and how do fate repay I it take the people I be close to first my mother then Luc and now Jensen I be sorry but enough be enough I be not give up Jensen without a fight where be Jensen oh he leave he say he have to meet a friend Jack it be get to be the consignment store Jack must have send he back but I talk the owner into close it I even watch he lock up well know Jack he find a way to reopen it he be shoot once in the chest at approximately 5 30 and he die en route to the hospital all right I will try and cut he off in the meantime keep dialing see if anyone be at the store City Morgue he be not here Davis the store 's still close I figure as much no one answer when I call Jack 's get he I know it yeah but the question be where I know where Jack take he to the crash site Glad you could

know we be two for two today come on Davis you get to admit I save Jensen and the world do not end so it be okay to admit that you be wrong I still think my concern be valid but having say that if I be the one relive day and Carrie have die on day one I probably would 've do the same thing hmm oh and speak of Carrie um I think it be time we tell she the truth about about what we do here we do not even know she she you know I care about her and I think she would be an important asset you know if she have know about Jensen she would not have let he leave today Davis okay all right I do not I do
