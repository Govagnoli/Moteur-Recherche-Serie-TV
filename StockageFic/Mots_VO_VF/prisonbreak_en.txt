his friend the night his domain he acknowledge that whatever neurosis drive the criminal to commit the original crime be compound magnify by flight by the sound of dog at his heel Fear become paranoia paranoia ultimately psychosis I bring this up because in 140 year the fundamental mind of the escape man have not change the escaped man be still human he be still afraid and he will stop at nothing in his attempt at flight fortunately for we while our quarry have shadow and night as his ally we have something far great television I would encourage everyone who be watch everyone in this country

six hour from when they make the video they be go after the president a tape report to be make by escape convict Lincoln Burrows and Michael Scofield be immediately dismiss by the Justice Department

White House to cancel the President 's speech no if they change her itinerary they will know something be up and they be go to go right back into hiding we 've find they before we can find they again these be not pet Agent Wheeler yeah thank I be pretty clear on that but if you be go to use the Commander in Chief as bait it be certainly not go to you have a problem with the way that I do thing yeah and I be not the only one be that right Internal Affairs have ask I to run all your move through they from here on out then get a pen and make sure you get this word for word the President 's day do not change the only lead we have be that we know where these man be head so we be go to keep quiet about this and let them come now get out of my office they be two of the most recognizable face in America how do they think they be go to get anywhere near the President because it be not just the two of they anymore I be go to go take a close look at that video if I may sir the President be you certain we should keep she in the dark on this because there be a scenario where she could be useful it be her ass on the line sir and I think we be all pretty clear she be be know to get her hand dirty when that line get too close we should let she know just how close it be finish they do a good job mask the room no reflection no flare Audio marker church bell construction traffic anything the room tone tell we they be in a large space about 100 000 cubic foot so the kid with the camera his story match up we clock the quality of light with the time of day and it pretty much fit his where s and when s all right Content the usual tell eye hand foot burrow we be able to baseline he off the footage from his trial so we get even more clarity there I escape from Fox River Penitentiary because I be sentence to death for a crime I do not commit I do not murder Terrence Steadman okay there the eye see it yes slight shift to the left then up yeah blink rate be up here versus the pattern he commit suicide last night in the Cutback Motel 30 mile outside from this home in Blackfoot Montana he be lie seem so okay here burrow arm fold he be protect himself they will do whatever it take not a lot of confidence in his word like they happen in the line of duty okay that mean something other than what he be say like our father Aldo Burrows Posture shoulder in for emphasis really want your attention here our attorney Veronica Donovan I be on the phone there shoot she like an animal Adam 's apple Zoom in zoom in see he be swallow Throat 's dry that be a lie yeah his behavior be textbook if there be anything in here about what they plan on do in Denver they be go to tell we if you say it that way it play too earnest ' course it will it be the truth okay but the truth send they home to the wife and kid Lies will keep they busy I be not tell a lie to the whole country it be our one chance to say it out yeah say whatever the hell you want tell they you be the Green Lantern but I know how they break down these tape I 've do it every detail matter Bin Laden cross his leg right over leave tell we something completely different than leave over right it be not the same message to they

another innocent person President 's motorcade be roll in so far no sign of the brother right there what be Scofield do with his hand we 've be throw they a bunch of fast ball what do you say we mix

belief that Christ rise from the dead this be Scofield 's final step a new life could be something there you keep track of this on the board where 's Wheeler here we go the Harmonists first settler of New Harmony Indiana use a golden rose as their symbol for Christ that be a reach there be a flower call the Christmas Rose be not Christ Rose a german code name for uh the counterattack by the Nazis that lead to the Battle of the Bulge where be that Ardennes Forest on the Belgium Germany border not a bad place to hide if they can find it you go to look into that yeah all right what else Christ actually rise from the dead on Easter Easter Sunday who be get Scofield 's file um here we go Christ in a rose yeah what about it Scofield 's mother 's name Christina Rose Scofield but I think she be dead well so do I so do I the very first thing that Scofield do when they break out of Fox River be he pick up a bunch of supply that he have stash in a grave I want you to find out where Scofield 's mother 's bury and what and see if she be bury yes sir what about Panama what about Panama his hard drive be full of information about Central America Panama in particular which he know you have the guy be get all kind of hubris but he be smart enough to stay out of a country where he know you will be wait for he unless there be something there that he need or someone I want a map of Panama and find out if Scofield 's mom Christina Rose have any family in Central America any property anything the last time I be on a bus like this I be head to Fox River this country 's amazing it be beautiful what be that smell man Bananas and sugar cane that be Panama 's big export Come on you 've be talk about Panama and bumpy bus ride ever since we break out and now that we be do it she should have be here with we we get all the time in the world for that one day you and Sara can we just get there please Sure Oye Tipo Espera so far no hit on any connection between Scofield 's mother and Panama but

if it be an address p o box got it if anybody pop call the Embassy have they send an officer to pick up the woman for question um I do not think we can just arrest a foreign citizen without any Patriot Act Agent Lang I could arrest your grandmother for anything if I want to if anybody be help Scofield dead or alive I want to know who they be that her yeah Hola Mrs Vasquez you be late it be much later than the date you say well we run into a little bit of trouble who be this it be a business associate Christina Rose I remember you will find she here Buena suerte Gracias I will meet you outside I forgot to ask something all right do you have a phone I could use I need an international operator please United States it be 312 346 what the hell be you do make a phone call you can not we

alpha first letter of the greek alphabet first step of his plan Epsilon fifth letter of the greek alphabet fifth step in his plan here be theta and kappa how about that Tau at the border right get

see okay who be get what Christ as a rose be a pretty common theme that run through the Bible Martin Luther adopt it as his coat of arm and there be the belief that Christ rise from the dead this be Scofield 's final step a new life could be something there you keep track of this on the board where 's Wheeler here we go the Harmonists first settler of New Harmony Indiana use a golden rose as their symbol for Christ that be a reach there be a flower call the Christmas Rose be not Christ Rose a german code name for uh the counterattack by the Nazis that lead to the Battle of the Bulge where be that Ardennes Forest on the Belgium Germany border not a bad place to hide if they can find it you go to look into that yeah all right what else Christ actually rise from the dead on Easter Easter Sunday who be get Scofield 's file um here we go Christ in a rose yeah what about it Scofield 's mother 's name Christina Rose Scofield but I think she be dead well so do I so do I the very first thing that Scofield do when they break out of Fox River be he pick up a bunch of supply that he have stash in a grave I want you to find out where Scofield 's mother 's bury and what and see if she be bury yes sir what about Panama what about Panama his hard drive be full of information about Central America Panama in particular which he know you have the guy be get all kind of hubris but he be smart enough to stay out of a country where he know you will be wait for he unless there be something there that he need or someone I want a map of Panama and find out if Scofield 's mom Christina Rose have any family in Central America any property anything the last time I be on a bus like this I be head to Fox River this country 's amazing it be beautiful what be that smell man Bananas and

incident while attempt to leave the country through the desert of New Mexico quite a long way from Illinois 's Fox River State Penitentiary where they escape from less than ten day ago the Fox River Eight as the group of convict be once know be now down to four as only Benjamin Miles Franklin Fernando Sucre Charles Patoshik and Theodore Bagwell remain at large official say that Sir he just hear and he would like to see you know be now down to four as only Benjamin Miles Franklin Fernando Sucre Charles Patoshik and Theodore Bagwell remain at large Godspeed gentleman ' scuse I sarge I be

schedule to be put to death he be already be grant one day do you anticipate any further Lincoln Burrows be a convict murder his escape have endanger the life of civilian across this country he be not a celebrity he be not a martyr I can assure you that whatever leniency be afford he and the other prisoner under the old regime at Fox River will no long be tolerate the only thing that Mr burrow can expect be what a jury of his peer demand a speedy execution and Michael Scofield with his escape the aid and abetting charge the felony he be rack up along the way on top of his original sentence I

Seattle Portland Salt Lake Denver Denver yes what the president be speak there this afternoon 3 00 six hour from when they make the video they be go after the president a tape report to be make by escape convict Lincoln Burrows and Michael Scofield be immediately dismiss by the Justice Department as entirely baseless which bring we back to the story we will be continue to follow throughout the day the terror threat have be raise to Orange as a storage unit rent by several Arab Americans be suddenly seize they bury it dump it off the front page and bury it it be what they do they can spin it all they want it be out there now give it time the tape be go to work this be a Hail Mary man if we do not get to her get to she be the easy part it be what we do after that be the problem which be why this have to happen quickly once anyone know we have her the curtain come down I will tell the White House to cancel the President 's speech no if they change her itinerary they will know something be up and they be go to go right back into hiding we 've find they before we can find they again these be not pet Agent Wheeler yeah thank I be pretty clear on that but if you be go to use the Commander in Chief as bait it be certainly not go to you have a problem with the way that I do thing yeah and I be not the only one be that right Internal Affairs have ask I to run all your move through they from here on out then get a pen and make sure you get this word for word the President 's day do not change the only lead we have be that we know where these man be head so we be go to keep quiet about this and let them come now get out of my office they be two of the most recognizable face in America how do they think they be go to get anywhere near the President because it be not just the two of they anymore I be go to go take a close look at that video if I may sir the President be you certain we should keep she in the dark on this because there be a scenario where she could be useful it be her ass on the line sir and I think we be all pretty clear she be be know to get her hand dirty when that line get too close we should let she know just how close it be finish they do a good job mask the room no reflection no flare Audio marker church bell construction traffic anything the room tone tell we they be in a large space about 100 000 cubic foot so the kid with the camera his story match up we clock the quality of light with the time of day and it pretty much fit his where s and when s all right Content the usual tell eye hand foot burrow we be able to baseline he off the footage from his trial so we get even more clarity there I escape from Fox River Penitentiary because I be sentence to death for a crime I do not commit I do not murder Terrence Steadman okay there the eye see it yes slight shift to the left then up yeah blink rate be up here versus the pattern he commit suicide last night in the Cutback Motel 30 mile outside from this home in Blackfoot Montana he be lie seem so okay here burrow arm fold he be protect himself they will do whatever it take not a lot of confidence in his word like they happen in the line of duty okay that mean something other than what he be say like our father Aldo Burrows Posture shoulder in for emphasis really want your attention here our attorney Veronica Donovan I be on the phone there shoot she like an animal Adam 's apple Zoom in zoom in see he be swallow Throat 's dry that be a lie yeah his behavior be textbook if there be anything in here about what they plan on do in Denver they be go to tell we if you say it that way it play too earnest ' course it will it be the truth okay but the truth send they home to the wife and kid Lies will keep they busy I be not tell a lie to the whole country it be our one chance to say it out yeah say whatever the hell you want tell they you be the Green Lantern but I know how they break down these tape I 've do it every detail matter Bin Laden cross his leg right over leave tell we something completely different than leave over right it be not the same message to they it be if you want this plan to work whatever you say with your mouth you need to be say something different with your body and your eye slightly up and to the left yes much blame have be place on another innocent person President 's motorcade be roll in so far no sign of the brother right there what be Scofield do with his hand we 've be throw they a bunch of fast ball what do you say we mix it up a little like what we think it be Morse code for what right now we 've get a phrase the water be warm any idea what that might mean what the hell do that mean nothing it will take the Feds a while to figure that out we have team check the surround county for the water temp it might be a message to an accomplice the Platte river run through the city they may be try it do not mean anything he be travel with an ex Secret Service guy I guess they be spoon feed we every lead they want we to follow so all this be just a distraction while they go after the President they have to know the tape would be discredit they have to know that we would talk to the cameraman there be something else go on here on another innocent person Dr Sara Tancredi Sara if you be listen I know I can not ask you for another chance I only hope by now you 've find your safe haven I take

see okay who be get what Christ as a rose be a pretty common theme that run through the Bible Martin Luther adopt it as his coat of arm and there be the belief that Christ rise from the dead this be Scofield 's final step a new life could be something there you keep track of this on the board where 's Wheeler here we go the Harmonists first settler of New Harmony Indiana use a golden rose as their symbol for Christ that be a reach there be a flower call the Christmas Rose be not Christ Rose a german code name for uh the counterattack by the Nazis that lead to the Battle of the Bulge where be that Ardennes Forest on the Belgium Germany border not a bad place to hide if they can find it you go to look into that yeah all right what else Christ actually rise from the dead on Easter Easter Sunday who be get Scofield 's file um here we go Christ in a rose yeah what about it Scofield 's mother 's name Christina Rose Scofield but I think she be dead well so do I so do I the very first thing that Scofield do when they break out of Fox River be he pick up a bunch of supply that he have stash in a grave I want you to find out where Scofield 's mother 's bury and what and see if she be bury yes sir what about Panama what about Panama his hard drive be full of information about Central America Panama in particular which he know you have the guy be get all kind of hubris but he be smart enough to stay out of a country where he know you will be wait for he unless there be something there that he need or someone I want a map of Panama and find out if Scofield 's mom Christina Rose have any family in Central America any property anything the last time I be on a bus like this I be head to Fox River this country 's amazing it be beautiful what be that smell man Bananas and sugar cane that be Panama 's big export Come on you 've be talk about Panama and bumpy bus ride ever since we break out and now that we be do it she should have be here with we we get all the time in the world for that one day you and Sara can we just get there please Sure Oye Tipo Espera so far no hit on any connection between Scofield 's mother and Panama but there be 38 listing of Christina Rose in various combination of first name middle name and last name all right cross reference the name with the number 6 1 7 from the tattoo maybe it be not a date see if it be an address p o box got it if anybody pop call the Embassy have they send an officer to pick up the woman for question um I do not think we can just arrest a foreign citizen without any Patriot Act Agent Lang I could arrest your grandmother for anything if I want to if anybody be help Scofield dead or alive I want to know who they be that her yeah Hola Mrs Vasquez you be late it be much later than the date you say well we run into a little bit of trouble who be this it be a business associate Christina Rose I remember you will find she here Buena suerte Gracias I will meet you outside I forgot to ask something all

I go to say you go to do this or not you can tell she the answer be yes but once we be out I consider you collateral nothing more for forom com previously on Prison Break how do a simple fishman know

a passport who be Gary Miller I 've be work on a way for we to be together James how how can I believe you hocan I believe anything anymore we get a way out of this we need some kind of support brace for thtunnel or what or the whole thing collapse and we be bury alive no more excuse Papa 's dead because of this yankee I will kill he myself if I have to all right he survive the box so what the

about if he can pull it off about if he should but he be go to go through with it right what be you look for where the power line connect to sona 's exterior light if cut the power out there be an option why do not we do that in the first place one the power out there be not control from in here and two there be that every prison have a backup generator even if we cut the light they will just

you think he have anything to do with why they people want scofield down here in the first place it be really none of my business what exactly be your business alex something on your mind I be just say if we need a bargaining chip do you think a sharp stick in that dull limey would help we out there be no we you and I be a lot more alike than you think alex we both know how it feel to lose a great love how it feel to kill a man and we both end up in here because of michael scofield would not it be poetic justice if we could just return the favor Justice huh if there be an ounce of it leave in this world you would be lie face down in the same unmarked grave as the rest of your inbreed family the only difference between I and you alex be a badge and the last time I check you do not even have that so you can just keep on hope for your happy ending alex you just keep on plow ahead with they blinder on you know but the thing about they blinder be it make it really hard to watch

so 15 second that be all we have to buy ourselves listen I be not sure how close we be go to get to this house let alone inside of it but let us say that we do the alarm they got instal in this house be trigger 1 2 second after break contact in any door or window BELLICK which would immediately send the private security guard with their 47 gun rush into the property SARA and after 30 second the alarm company will dispatch vehicle to the property three to four depend on availability after confirmation of a break in they will dispatch additional vehicle to seal off any and all exit from the property SUCRE I do not know about this Michael it be get pretty clear why they hire a bunch of con to do this job it be not because they want it off the book it be because we be expendable who be go to care if a bunch of crook wind up dead it be suicide SARA I be go to keep look and see what I can find that quote from the Odyssey what about it I can not shake that line all that avail be flight what if flight be our only option Linc what if our father after everything he discover about the Company what what if that be what he finally realize you know uh the one thing I remember most about Dad be the back of his head always walk out the front door always run from something Mom we himself but the one thing he never run away from be his belief that the Company need to be take down and we get an opportunity to do that then this be our fight not theirs Man this this be not Fox River these guy choose to be here remember that they get a choice Ready go let us go let us go go go come on

ending in the fingertip even a little pinprick can result in quite a painful hot flash so a five inch needle be drive up the length of the finger can make your inside feel like they be on fire another fact of physiology the human body when in extreme duress begin to shut down brain activity decrease and your heart rate slow until you just can not feel the pain anymore and that be where the heart monitor and the battery come in 'cause when your heart rate dip below 50 that battery will give you a wake up call prevent your body from shut down and then you will feel every ounce of the pain and that be when you be go to beg I to make the phone call what can I do you for I I find some more inconsistency in your sale report listen up here from that little computer of yours can you access into

that be must be what linc be talk about it say manual override only all conventional attempt to dismantle the jz33 will activate the scylla alarm this be not just a land mine this be uh this be an alarm we can not sit here all night okay you ready hey it be linc you know what to do what be you do Linc Sucre stop stop do not move do not move do not move you can not dismantle the land mine without set off the alarm so I either set off the alarm or blow up and die no there be a manual override it will cut the power long enough for you to step off without remove the pin how do you know for sure I find david baker Sucre Step off you can do it you only have 20 second come on I can not yes you can yes you can Michael and I figure it out step off right now no no you guy all go I will we

great job today I be sorry to hear about your friend but that be um admirable work volunteer with a bunch of criminal like that we be all the same really here be the application you request for the desk girl you have a good night cole you too thank hello hello okay we will thank you as we 've all learn the hard way there be an electronic alarm barrier around the perimeter of the foundation unfortunately that be scylla 's most primitive line of defense the wall itself be fortified with steel fiber the good news be on the inside here there be no camera the company do not want any visual evidence that scylla exist the bad news be that there be both Weight and microphonic sensor here and here that will alert company security to the presence of any breathing human being that weigh more than two pound as far as I can tell the first challenge be get around that wall and then we can worry about cross the floor without touch it in silence it be complicated but uh I be already work on something Brad do not die in vain we can make this work that be the neurologist you have a hypothalamus hamaratoma it be really rare you be probably bear with it um thing have change it be be grow which be why you 've be experience your symptom and the doctor feel that you need surgery two day that be uh that be what I need no tomorrow otherwise you could die and there be no alternative previously on Prison Break Company 's move Scylla when tomorrow I mess up what do you mean I mention Whistler hello hello so you be Feng Susan that be right the wall itself be fortify with steel fiber the bad news be that there be both weight and microphonic sensor that will alert Company security to the presence of any breathing human being that weigh more than two pound Mike you have a hypothalamus hamartoma and the doctor feel that you need surgery two day no tomorrow otherwise you could die and there be no alternative just a little bit more go slow no there be no way he deserve any of this sing it sister after what he put I through I can hardly believe it myself look what we must do be make sure that cosmic justice rain down upon he for once we obtain the good general 's card there be not hardly nothing stand in between we and Mr Feng 's 125 million I be bear on a mountainside just keep both hand on the camera let us go that be great okay thank you so much Dr Malden yeah he can see you today at 3 00 no we be go we need to finish what we start we can do this I need one more day Michael Dr Malden can see you today he be give we his word he will not alert the authority if you put this off and you you collapse you be go to be treat by another doctor do you want to roll the dice that they be not go to call the cop there be still so much to do all right three o'clock last time I drill a hole in the wall it be with an eggbeater back in Fox River with Michael I just can not believe it be all come to an end and he be not here he will be all right how do you know I do not I be just try to keep we focus hey he be sick but I guarantee you one thing that will make he bad go back to jail if we do not get in there that be where we be all go he be go to be okay I be scared too but a hospital 's the good place for he right now he will not go without a plan to complete the job well Alex and Fernando should be back soon with the video right should be yeah so then all we need be the sixth card Gretchen 's work on that you really think we can trust she to get the card absolutely anything else Nope eight guard will accompany Scylla from the basement bunker up to the garage where an armored truck will be wait one truck be not go to be enough security that be why I have a full Secret Service escort to March Air Force Base there it will be bring aboard a C 130 we need air support all the way to River Rock Colonel Rififi be lend we three of his F 18 it may be hard for you to believe but I do have this under control there be nothing for you to worry about when the plane land the same precaution will be take armored truck to guard to final location that be fine be you go somewhere I have an appointment today you tell I there be nothing to worry about just tell I it be not Gretchen this be ridiculous it be a personal matter I be not go to discuss it I do not trust she that be nothing new I will be back in an hour what have you find out you will be awake the whole time the only anesthetic you be go to need be four minor injection of local two in your forehead and two in the back of your head and that be for the brace the frame yeah and attach that be go to be the most uncomfortable part they be go to have to secure four pin into your skull and they be go to need a small drill to do it do we have to listen to this I want to hear this Linc and then what uh another CT scan the doctor will use the three dimensional imagery to pinpoint the exact location of the growth and once you have that then it be the Gamma Knife unit they will fit you with a helmet they will calibrate it so that each of the 201 hole be aim directly for the tumor and at that point I 've get two more box in the car that you guy get to bring in yourself all right you okay because the last time I see you yeah I be fine I be just a little dehydrated all right good this be the stuff you request you sure this be go to get you in let we worry about get in you worry about how we be get out I get someone keep an eye on Gretchen and Bagwell if they try anything they be getting take out nothing be go to get between we and Scylla you sure you be all right yeah it be just uh you know we be break into Company headquarters and uh you will understand why we be all a little on edge Understood you know I be think when your father approach I about do this I feel like I be uh chase a ghost or something but because of the work you guy have do taste the day when to take these bastard down you get it get it we get four hour how come I be go in for treatment here we go Scylla obviously we 've get a lot to figure out we have to break through two wall one concrete one glass and do it without make a sound hypersensitive parabolic microphone point in all direction the floor sensor can detect an add surface load of just two pound so we have to traverse the distance between the two wall without touch the floor and do all that without generate any kind of body heat whatsoever these be the late in heat sense technology we make one wrong move the camera go on and General Krantz will know we be inside it be amazing all this security and only one man have access to video surveillance the Company do not want any record of what be go on down there can we access that elevator no it be right in the middle of the Company building there be ten layer of security we have to go where they be not expect we start with the concrete wall Sucre you be drill there right yes it be fortify with steel fiber just like you say all right in order to get through that we have to generate an electromagnetic field we have to generate an electromagnetic field to have uh an electromagnetic field with the force that we want we be go to need at least a couple of car battery can you get that yeah yeah we can do this uh what time be we expect Gretchen to get that sixth card what take you so long you know how I get when I be hungry it be not easy get away from the office I could have come to you like old time I almost wish there be a mahogany desk in here oh you be tense take off this jacket let I get in there I do not bring it with I my card that be what you be look for right what be you talk about your card you forget I be the one that teach you how to lie I never think that at the age of 63 I could still have my heart break why do you feel you need to steal my card do not you know that if you have wait just a little bit long you would have have one of your own I be sorry I be who be you sell it to that be that be not why who I be the mother of your child please for Emily 's sake please Jonathan please I love you if I ever see you again I will shoot you on sight be everything all right Cole I get something important you need to know we be go to be rich so here be the question how much be it go to cost I to get that jacket off of you excuse I last day I be ever go to see you oh you be all cover up I can not abide 100 you want to pay I to take my clothe off not all of they just the jacket Mm 200 I be not go to strip for you Pity on an old man you be disgusting and lecherous and vile and soon to be wealthy beyond belief one thousand dollar why

group you make this company 35 000 and I would like to return the favor it be our annual cruise seven day and six night of non stop pitch I personally clear 50 000 on most trip but for everything you 've do it be all yours the least I could do it leave today go home and pack I will see you in a week unfortunately I have some business I need to take care of right here okay so this be how it work as soon as the sensor pick up any kind of a heat source 90 degree or more system go into standby a yellow light come on after five second in standby if the heat source be not go we have an alarm so we get six second to make it across the hallway and through the glass wall Basically if we get our hand on some liquid nitrogen we could regulate the temperature yeah kill two bird with one stone see if you can get some of that hey hey I be not go to ask how you be feel good about four year after I join the bureau my first special agent in charge he be diagnose with liver cancer but for he the hard part be not the treatment the hard part be leave the office because we have this we have this big RICO case that be about to go to trial and we be talk thousand of man hour five year of research and the guy be go to be in chemo and he be scared he be scared that we be go to lose the case and that a lot of bad man be go to walk he have a ragtag band of criminal ready to pick up the slack it be something like that we be not go to let you down Michael what happen to your boss oh he be there to see we win you be sure she be a Fed would not take off her jacket for a thousand dollar she be get a gun under there it be a complication well that be a nice way to put it sort of like you not get the sixth card what be we call that now a setback relax you have any idea what I be give up here I be guarantee 50 grand you be cry over 50 000 be you serious I have a job I make money I get mail People call I sir 12 hour day and eat leftover lo mein something tell I Theodore Bagwell would not last long in this situation yeah maybe but Cole Pfeiffer would you want to pout you do it tomorrow we have work to do be it really worth 125 million it be worth twice as much what if they refuse to hand it over either we pay for Scylla or we kill for it Susan Feng we need to talk hey give I a second here guy just a second we can not make any noise above ten decibel you get two of those absolutely this be go to work right it should no not just that the whole thing I mean do we even have a chance just make sure the hole be in the right place so where be we Gretchen do not get we the sixth card we need that sixth card Don I know if we do not get the sixth card we be never go to crack Scylla I know it well we know they be move Scylla today we know we can not just waltz into the General 's office and steal that last card so where do that leave we then there be get to be a way there have to be a way not without lose another man believe I I spend the last week try to figure out how to get that sixth card and every scenario end with a gun to someone 's head and that be not acceptable you know Gretchen do pass on this one piece of information for you this could be helpful hello the buyer just show up all right well find out what they be up to Mr Feng so glad you could come and see we I be expect the next time the three of we would be in the same room together that you would have something for I that be our expectation as well but we 've hit a few bump in the road now to ensure the item 's safe recovery we need your help it be time to go all that avail be flight maybe my father be onto something if they all die because we try to take down the Company and I survive because because I call in sick how be I go to live with myself you be go to get through this I be not go to the hospital what Linc just get in the car I be go with you if I still have a medical license I would lose it over this this be usually give to epileptic it will suppress the rapid firing of neuron for the next

wall this morning once we get over there if we make too much noise the sound wave will travel through the wall and get pick up by the sensor on the other side so from this point on we need absolute silence Alex good luck you too ready we have to break through two wall one concrete one glass and do it without make a sound in order to get through that we have to generate an electromagnetic field to have an electromagnetic field with the force that we want we be go to need at least a couple of car battery start with the concrete wall Sucre you be drill there right it be fortify with steel fiber just like you say you sure this be it 1917 Piermont Avenue okay when be the last time you sweep a room the academy all right just follow my lead okay because Gretchen and Bagwell have no respect

item please no no no you be not go to see the item until I see the money okay you will have to forgive I if I do not trust a shiny case with some button I need to confirm that the datum be intact without it the item you possess be nothing more than a fancy box speak of give this man the item no I be not give anyone this be a businessman make a business transaction one with the long you take the more danger you put we all in can you read what be on there you well hope so they be not just go to give we Scylla you know what that mean right okay let us split up I be sure you understand no one can know where Scylla 's go to it be your lucky day sugar not yours drop it cover her where be he I do not know where be he I do not know GRETCHEN go Stolen by who by who if I die you will never know you look beautiful you be a liar how have it go they be still run some test but they feel pretty confident they get it all and what be this place you need to know something about your surgery it be perform by company doctor and the General make all the arrangement why I do not know Lincoln 's handle it he say he have a plan I will be honest right now you be alive and that be all I care about you be go to laugh but I have a dream about Scylla the only thing we really know about it be what Self tell we you need to rest I be serious what if it be not just the company 's little black book what if it be not everything be as it seem something more like what something good why go to so much trouble to protect information about the past information the Company could just delete any time they want to the General say GENERAL as long as we have Scylla we have power I do not think he be talk about power like control or influence I think he be talk about energy Boron Argon Gallium Indium Bargain there be a theory that if you can find a way to combine these element into the design of a solar cell you can harness 100 of the sun 's energy with that kind of power possibility be limitless it would certainly explain all the security around Scylla they be not protect the past they be protect the future wow Wonder what else be on it I mean the equipment you be treat with and the drug they give you none of it exist on the open market which would explain why some people be willing to pay hundred of million to get their hand on Scylla it be not about take down the Company it be about become the company it be about know what they know control what they know what do we do now so what be the next move I be go to check on Michael no I mean after that I mean Scylla 's out there somewhere be we really go to keep chase it I do not know we will figure it out later no I will not be here Linc I can not do it anymore Sara say Mike be okay and that be all I need to know but now I get to go live my life and that be a life where I can go a day without see a dead body or or almost become one I be not run away papi I be I be just I be just move on this be never about you

you because I be your mother that be something you can not change it be something you can not take away it be nice to meet you Sara in some way Michael 's do very well for himself in other way I be not so sure Lincoln have lead you down a dark path I make my own decision you break Lincoln out of prison and he go to work for general Krantz and he have his reason but if you be look for some kind of common ground between we maybe that be it I do not want to see Lincoln work for the company either at least you 've stop make excuse for he I stop make judgment something I could not afford but that be a long time ago and that be not why we be here no you be right none of we want to see Scylla go back to the company so if we can put the past behind we maybe we can work something out like what like a deal a deal all right you tell I where Scylla be and we will work out the detail later we will go 50 50 a mother son operation maybe but first Scylla please Michael I know well we be very similar I know what it be like to look at the big picture see all the little move part how much easy it be to think after the surgery I know you that be why you will never be able to manipulate I like you do the rest of the world you be run out of time all right there be no one back here well they be here but of course there be nobody here now 'cause that be what happen you know this whole thing it be just it be just crap we be always one move behind every step of the way yeah and it be just go to get bad now that Bagwell be breathe down our back how do you make that kind of mistake huh and let that inbreed get anywhere near we no no no the first mistake be work for Krantz okay that be the first mistake what do you think 's go to happen now that he be in town and he have his goon call the shot what be go to happen now yeah I should 've know well than to get anywhere near this all right you know what we should go let us go no we can not go because you see the photo you see the photo so

be purely scientific her interest be financial she come to I about a year ago with an idea rather than build our organization with Scylla as the permanent cornerstone she want to use the technology to make a quick profit if certain event occur various nation might feel the need for a more modern defense system and they would come to we for the answer Solar weaponry Water desalination now what do you know about all this I tell you all I know well I think it be a crazy idea Plan of an amateur but I figure she would be angry she be not allow to hold a card now what be that I think it be more

to play it I make you boy a promise you would find Scylla and I would see to it you get some cash and have the slate wipe clean I intend to keep that promise however if I keep one promise I have to keep they all now I wonder who the big winner will be do not do this do not do what when I send you those envelope I be not just play game I make it very clear that you have one day to accomplish your job or there would be consequence what be that the consequence call our man in Queens Queens what be you call New York for put it on speaker please MAN on phone yes move on subject four I be a block

I would have a few too many bourbon get behind the wheel and turn a beautiful young woman into a piece of broccoli do not do anything I assume that be why you try to run away with Scylla to screw a government that be give you benefit that would only pay for a county facility overlook the Belt Parkway and to sell it so that you and she could disappear and be hide forever C'est la vie I have the subject in sight she be in a wheelchair under a tree in the hospital courtyard do I have a go please do not do this okay please you can kill I okay you can kill I right now please kill I you do not need to do this we will get Scylla that be what I want to hear well that be what we be try to do we be get it but you have to know what await you and your love one if you do not we understand okay execute the order please do not do it oh my God oh my God get help hel line disconnect I believe you make a request GENERAL Bagwell make sure he be dead do everyone understand now be we all on the same page Good let us get down to business three quarter of a billion dollar in a numerical account in Luxembourg if you be still worried about humanitarian effort write a check to UNICEF all the datum will be deliver within 24 hour that be what I expect you play it perfectly reach out to our contact in China I have a feeling they may be interested in what we be sell as well Christina I do not advise play both side of this coin pig get fat and hog get slaughter reach out to China GENERAL no keep our people at every private airfield in Florida and in Georgia we can not have Christina leave the state she play on India 's emotion which probably mean she would want to meet with one of their emissary today while they be still run hot she could still be in Miami maybe at the embassy no she be not at the embassy any deal she make with India will be strictly off the radar right now she be concerned with two thing one be close the deal on Scylla which I be assume she be already do and the second be getting pay no sign of Self how much can she get for Scylla half a billion from India the same from China Overseas account foreign wire transfer I doubt she be take any food stamp she be go to want confirmation that that money be safely overseas before she leave the U S we find the money we find my mother normally it take three business day for an international wire transfer to clear unless the bank be a Federal Reserve signatory in which case the transfer be immediate you think she will head to the bank all she have to do be withdraw a few grand from the million that that buyer have probably transfer overseas already she will know it be all there so let us find a Federal Reserve signatory bank in Miami we will have a shot at find she and Scylla there Michael you see that be why I do not put your name in the bowl you be the only one here that be irreplaceable agent informant muscle they be nice to have but finally they be replaceable there be a branch about 20 minute away that mind of yours it be one in a million nice to see it finally work for I I do not work for you not yet it be legitimate I assure you oh okay I just want to withdraw the 10 000 so I can be sure the Luxembourg account be properly set up well be she in there yeah I see she through the window she be talk to a tall dark haired guy they be the same guy who set we up at the hotel we wait until she come out just jump MAHONE so what do we do about her security I mean we jump she we get to jump the guy she be with and God know how many other agent be go to come crawl out of the woodwork like ant look um I hate to bring up the obvious but last time I check you two still disagree as to what to do with Scylla if we actually get it yeah that be what I think well let us skip the damn thing I mean who be go to stop we a 17 year old security guard no probably the guy with the gun he will open fire as soon as he see our face then uh maybe they should not see our face so then the pizza guy show up and Wayne jump out of the bush and try to grab the pizza but the but the guy my God be you okay mister weakly yeah go call 911 go go no no do not call anyone okay do not call anybody do not call anyone you know once baby brother 's get his little hand on that magic box of yours I do not think it be go to be too hard for he to trick Magilla Gorilla if you know what I be say no I do not and you really think that Scofield 's go to risk his nephew 's life he will figure out something before he hand first prize over to the bad guy Scofield think pure like a little Cub Scout burrow he just think like a cub he be right I do not feel comfortable have Scofield out there with something I want while I be stick here with nothing he want I need leverage you see the way Mahone pull Scofield over when they first get here bet you a wooden nickel they be talk about little Dr Underpants and her whereabout too bad we do not know where that be wrong again Curly while everyone be up here flap their gum I take the liberty of toddle down to Mahone 's car check out the last address he put in his GPS there be a gambler 's chance we might find the leverage you be look for right here I be on it no you want to get in on the action here be your chance okay I will just count this out for you that will not be necessary all righty a print record of your transaction and I think a balance that high be you sure you do not want to talk to one of our investment specialist no thank you everybody down on the ground now nobody move nobody gets hurt you down what be the odd do not the case I will take that hi Mom Scofield and burrow leave the bank now take Scylla and go we get to stay together I say go come on I think he be out move in Move in after today 's event how much egg do the U S court system have on its face for exonerate Lincoln Burrow in the first place an omelet 's worth Paula if you remember I be never in favor of the exoneration Lincoln Burrows be a thug for hire and his little brother be no well I be amazed that the court system just gloss over the warning sign Shh shh shh shh shh shh Easy now Doc easy it be just your friendly neighborhood t Bag now I be go to need your cooperation get

save they both how I will figure it out your brother 's bleeding to death I wonder if we can get they to bring Linc and Sara to the same place right now your only advantage be that neither party know that there be another player that have leverage on you you bring they both together you lose your tactical edge I be not abandon Sara I do not say to do that what I be say be that Sara have the advantage of not have a bullet in her chest one at a time big surprise the dumb one got catch the smart one get away I be begin to see a pattern here he be never go to give it to you hmm I disagree he truly care for you no matter how many time you 've show you do not deserve it you know you two be truly a classic study of nature versus nurture same environment same parent you be completely different why do you think that be Lincoln because Mom be a psychotic bitch hello Michael all right you win I will give you Scylla just give Linc whatever help he need not until I get what I need Edison Shipping Yard B Dock 45 minute and bring my brother 45 minute cut it close he do not look so good just be there be be worth it Sara do you ever go back to that night and wonder how thing would have go if you have just leave that infirmary door lock all the people who be life would have be save hell your father would still be alive you ever think about that mm hmm and now that Michael 's return Scylla to I it be all for nothing assume he do return it if the situation be reverse if Michael be here and you be hold Scylla what would you do you would bring it back for the same reason you leave that door unlock because you could not let an innocent man die your heart betray your well judgment so do Scofield 's you know you be probably right because if Michael have use his well judgment the night he steal Scylla out from under your nose he would have kill you get she out of my sight take it either take my pocket or I take yours Understand the authority be blanket the street look for the primary suspect Lincoln Burrows and Michael Scofield the brother famous for one of the most daring prison break in recent history be consider armed and extremely dangerous Homemade explosive you get a well idea maybe the good way to save Linc to save everyone be give Christina what she want I be just try to find a way where the people that we love do not end up on an autopsy table and I be not well get your story straight Alex this whole time you 've be say we should give Scylla back to the General what you do not hear what he do to Self 's wife Self make his own bed  yeah and we be sleep in it Let us say good case scenario okay that maybe somehow we be able to get to Linc and Sara okay what then General 's still get somebody watch my wife what be the plan to keep her safe what about LJ what be the plan to keep he safe I can not think about that right now maybe we go to your mother and try to make a deal I mean there be no love lose between she and the General with her contact if we give she Scylla maybe she can find out where the agent we be not give up and we be not give it back we be go to save everyone what the hell be you do here what be I do here you be in Recovery Mr Self apparently you have quite a fall luckily someone find you and call 911 they do what the doctor will be in shortly to go over your history no no no no tell the doctor to go see the next guy I be go actually I can not there be some man here wait to talk to you what kind of man the kind with badge Mr Self my name be Agent Chris Franco this be Agent Wilson Wright we be with the Bureau we would like to ask you a few question about what let us start with where we can find Lincoln Burrows and Michael Scofield be ready to pick we up well not get too close to that thing when it go off and you well not get too far all right if Michael try anything take out both knee I do not want he dead I just want he immobilized and eager to talk and what do you want to do with burrow once I get Scylla dump he off the dock yeah one of they guy from the news I think I just see he interesting choice I would have think you have pick something a little more public for your own protection something a little more public be not safe for I right now thank to you do you come alone do you come on we can have at least one honest conversation can not we actually I would like that in spite of what you think I never want to see you get hurt what do you want understand forgiveness but when I make my choice I know I would never have any of those thing but you will have power will not you yes and you will have Lincoln quite honestly I think you be get the short end of the stick speak of which I need to get he to a hospital so where be he where be Scylla I need to know he be alive satisfied follow I now you would not have some little trick up your sleeve would you son I be do playing game with you good then bring Scylla out to I if I bring Scylla out in the open your man will shoot I well then I guess we have a standoff the only thing be what I want be not gasp for air and lose a pint of blood every ten minute give it to I Michael you know I can not do that give it to I Michael you be run out of option son I say no this be give it to I Michael Christina we get to go come and get it go get it Son of a Come on come on Michael Michael we get to go now now so the government help you out after all we 've be through you know how crazy that sound huh well the proof be there every morning I wake up my little girl and she be healthy again man where be you live actually uh that be why I come down here to talk to you you know uh we be in protective custody while I be wait to testify against Mahone but his case fall through anyway they want to not only renege on my deal they want to put my ass back in Fox River so what be you do here in Chicago follow I I be wonder if you uh have any idea of where Michael and Linc be Wait wait whoa whoa where you go look you in a bind with the feds and now you want to know about Mike and Linc Come on come on what you go to bust I too no I be try to help you man and they okay man do not you watch the news Sucre they be in a lot of trouble big time and the only way they can get out of it be if you help I find they we be just try to find the two man behind this assassination well obviously your clearance level be not high enough for you to fully grasp the operation that I 've be involve with all right then how about we tell you what we 've grasp so far the dead body of your partner Agent Miriam Holtz autopsy show the bullet she be shoot with be fire from an agency issue firearm right the disappearance of your direct supervisor at Homeland a Mr Herb Stanton okay we also get a number of DHS transportation officer with interesting information concern a warehouse back in Los Angeles that you be conduct some kind of secret operation out of so when an international political figure be assassinate on american soil by two man take

you be aware I be sure that anyone who impede an investigation into an act of terrorism have virtually no protection under the law okay okay okay now where be Michael Scofield and Lincoln Burrows I do not know where they be okay but I could find out well Michael clearly care more about win then he do about save your life look like you be not go to live long enough to be an uncle what what Sara have not tell anybody Christina Banerjee 's on the phone he want to know why he have not receive the technology if Michael do not call in the next ten minute you be go to wish he would let you fry back at Fox River hello I think we have an understanding I think I make the stake crystal clear you do and I be try and I be try not to kill Sara but that would be a lot easy if I have something in this hand besides a gun look every cop and feed in this city be look for I the last thing I want to do be jeopardize her life by getting arrest and have the very thing you want lock up as evidence well I appreciate you take care of my interest Michael I do and believe I for that reason I will take care of your interest but if I do not see Scylla in one hour I be unleash Bagwell to play doctor with the doctor be I clear I need more time one hour do not Michael understand he be play chicken with other people 's life here my life 's beenhreane I be not talk about yours that boy have mess up every chance I 've ever have at freedom this be my last shot you really think when this be over you be go to be free well than free I be go to be employ the General 's get I an honest to goodness job with an office and a desk what kind of a job be he go to get you huh what be he go to trust you with the General hire professional killer not amateur not uneducated criminal who rape and kill you mind your tongue little lady the only thing you be get when this be over be a slit throat and an unmarked grave actually your only chance at a life be to get out of here and if you take I with you whatever be happen between you and Michael if you get I back to he the slate could be wipe clean with Michael and I that slate be never go to be clean and if he do not give the General what he want it be go to get a hell of a lot dirty what be you do I need to make sure Linc 's okay I suppose that little explosion be mean for I let us pretend that be for the cop please Michael stop you be embarrass yourself you should know by now that you can not outthink I I will always be one step ahead of you because I be your mother be Linc okay hm I remember the first time I catch you in a lie I could see it in your eye just like I could see it today put he on the phone you be not in a position to be make demand son actually if Linc be dead I have no reason to give you Scylla which put I in exactly the position you describe yeah hey it be nice to know you be still breathe how much time do I have not much the General have Sara he be give I an hour to exchange she for Scylla I need to know where you be so if you can give I any kind of signal do not know look if I be go to save you both I need something Banerjee again there be just not enough time Michael I can do this Linc I can do this there be something you need to know Sara 's p Sara 's pregnant it be it be okay you be go to be a dad no I understand now if you just give we a little more time go to her Michael I will find a way Linc there be not

you more I warn Aldo I tell he I be not cut out for it it be not in my nature he use to call I his Lady Macbeth I know there be a reason I hate Shakespeare you hate it because you could not understand it you could not understand it because your real mother be as dumb as a day old doughnut you ask I how I could just sit and watch my son go into the chair the answer 's simple really you be not my son Michael already know that must be why it be so easy for he to play with your life I guess we have that in common now go find my son your information lead to an arrest we will make sure the court can not touch you right well you put that in writing and then we be in business no no the only thing you get to demand in writing be what we put on your tombstone last thing you be go to want to find out

I out okay he know everything about this whole thing well be he government 'cause if he be government I do not want I do not trust he at first either okay but it be something about be in the pen where you start to decipher who be a player and who be a punk and this guy be a player just like Scofield so the only thing that we have to do be tell he where the brother be help he get this device thing back and and so he can put it into the right hand and then what hmm this brother have juice he can erase our entire record now I be not talk about cash and all that flashy stuff I be just talk about
