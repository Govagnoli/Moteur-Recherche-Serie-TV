damage like his body have already heal inside how have you know where to find the gun Peter I just Figured there be not many place for he to stash it and what make you think he stash it you have to go and be the detective do not you Matt how do how do you I come from the future to stop Nathan from tellin ' the world about we I have to it be where it all begin the future now that you know you can not be here Petrelli 's miraculous recovery have this hospital staff completely baffle his condition have be upgrade to stable and he be rest comfortably the shocking footage that have be play over and over on news outlet and youtube have create a that be he that be he I be dead and he give I another chance but now I know the reason I be here to do great thing to do his bidding Mr Petrelli early today you be about to make a statement you have a message to deliver be you ready to do that now God be the only one with a message it be a message of hope and urgency because he be not go to wait much long his message be a simple one we be all connect our hope and our dream our child 's future reflect back in each other 's eye we fight our own personal battle but we know we be not alone because only together can we make our short time on this planet mean something only together can we be the steward of our own destiny and we hold in our collective heart one noble goal to save ourselves save the world I 've separate the tyrosine and combine that with the dopamine produce by your adrenal and what now we wait a few second and see if the enzyme Attach to the cortisol you be very brave to have find I the way you do there be no other choice I imagine that it must be very unsettling to have these ability but I have also imagine many time the exhilaration one must feel to know such power to feel so special it work what have you do what my father never could I 've isolate the genetic building block of these ability I 've find its source I have to get to the loft to my lab there be a centrifuge there I have to verify and duplicate these result this be incredible I do not understand what have you find the content of this single syringe could give power to anyone give power and with the add component of adrenaline the effect would be instantaneous I know you be scared I would be too all alone in this house with someone like I a man you barely know it be not exactly a fair fight I admit but I do not want to fight you Claire I just want what you have you see I lose everything that make I special lose but now find there be a whole shopping list of ability right here but I be go to start with the good and once I have yours no what be you do to I I be look for answer before I bleed to death Funny I be look for answer too why do not I feel anything no nerve ending an amazing bit of machinery this and how much of it do we actually use 10 maybe 20 imagine the answer we would have with 100 why be there evil how many angel can dance on the head of a pin how do we make love stay all these answer they be all they be all right here be you go to eat it eat your brain Claire that be disgusting there it be wait what about I be not you go to kill I poor girl there be so much about yourself you do not even understand your brain be not like the other Claire you be not like the other you be different you be special and I could not kill you even if I want to you can never die and now I guess neither can I I run two sample in the centrifuge the enzyme hold both time you need to destroy that dr Suresh what what be you talk about it be like you say it be against the law of nature no Maya this be a discovery of world change proportion the possibility for the advancement of science for our entire specie ordinary people will have my ability no no each individual 's blood chemistry be unique like fingerprint these ability could manifest in an infinite number of way but they can still end up terrible like mine or they could be wonderful flight telepathy super strength of course it would have to be perfect there will be research and development clinical trial but in the wrong hand it be in the wrong hand now Maya an entire clandestine company dedicate to hide it from the rest of the world yes because of people like I People like Sylar exactly Sylar kill my father if I have have a legitimate chance to inject myself with this to give myself the power then perhaps I could 've stop that that be my point you would actually inject yourself with that there be quantum leap in science that one dream of be a part of this be one of they I do not see why you do not understand that I do not see why anyone would want these ability it be a curse can what be in that syringe cure I or not then it be evil and you should destroy it for the sake of all of we be I still here yeah touch by god that be what you say in the chapel I think I dream that it be true nate he save I he come for I he bring I back we 've see what people like we can

themselves to something great while other know only self interest isolate themselves in a world of their own making some seek only love even if unrequited while other be drive by fear and betrayal there be those who see their choice as dark proof of god 's absence while other follow a path of noble destiny but in the end good evil right or wrong what we choose be never what we really need for that be the ultimate cosmic joke the real gift that god have leave behind oh peter Ya do it I try it be sylar Sylar huh there be no other way for this to end nathan and that formula have to be destroy

ability be I right guess the apple do not fall too far from the tree I be not your apple you do not know anything about I I have some idea you and I we can not be all that different from where I stand we have exactly nothing in common yeah well we pick easy target like that rabbit weak helpless not fair really be you really draw a moral line Morality do not figure into it fish get to swim bird get to fly you have to kill it be who you be but you do choose your prey and yours never have a chance not against you not really easy pickin 's small game they have something I want it be not my fault if they be not strong enough to fight back and those agent that have be comin ' after we recently I handle they no you run away from them just like I do I could wipe they out with a thought but you have

and neither do he for that matter we both know Nathan Petrelli be hide something you know what question you should be ask yourself who would want to save Peter his mother Angela you wanna know what be miss from the file who can fly she would never betray her own son a long time ago I give up try to figure out what Angela Petrelli would or would not do go ahead we 've get a problem Nathan 's make a power play against Danko he be stir up a hornet 's nest it be nice to know a mother still have some influence over her son thing will be well for we with Danko go of course they will but Nathan 's on
