paranoia you do not know the corporate world very well do you doctor no suppose I do not it be not go to work I build I S T I have a game plan I be not about to see it derail you believe strongly in maintain your objective that be what it be all about you chart a course and then you stick to it no self doubt as a leader first thing you learn Inconsistency invite disrespect respect that be important to you respect honor loyalty old fashioned value all in painfully short supply these day I be afraid how would you describe your value the fundamental God the family Constitution do what be right what be right it be not a dirty word Doctor no no if we ent a little more time protect the fundamental we would not be as vulnerable to our enemy sound like a man ripe for politic do not laugh I 've think about throw my hat in the ring State legislature of course there be a little empire build to take care of first you be an ambitious man be that fair to say I only want what be due I I think we both want that I be sorry let us just drop the charade Mr Havelmann it be really get old you make it sound as if we 've meet before imagine that look whatever this be about we 've get ten minute to conclude it I be due at my daughter 's school at 11 00 she be in a play and I promise dorothy I would not miss it promise like that they mean a lot to you if you have child you would understand if I have child I have two child Mr Havelmann a boy and a girl just like you only I do not have they anymore because somebody kill they you kill they you kill my baby we run Havelmann through the synaptical scanner that be digne to detect brain abnormality be I right for the most part yes but I have they adapt the program in a way I believe amount to a very sophisticated lie detector and let I guess this prove that he be lie no not definitively but it do prove that there be but what what Deanna you 've be bang your head against the same wall for a year do not you see what he be do he be hide he be cocoon himself into a dream world I do not know what be crazy he take refuge inside his head or you think that this matter but there be moment it be almost like he be reach out as if he sense a whole different reality oh come on you just have to talk to he he be lose his mind it be not as if he have not already pay the price he have to be hold accountable he can not just get off scot free you have until the end of the week then we put this thing to rest it be wednesday that be only 2 more day Warren if I push he too hard we might never get he back Deanna we have to move on we can not afford to endlessly tie up ouresource on Havelmann you know the difference between we you 've give up I have not I have not my uh my colleague think they have a possible diagnosis of your condition my condition I be not aware I have a condition they think you exhibit symptom remarkably similar to Korsakoff 's syndrome you ever hear of that before no doubt there be an Oprah devote to it Korsakoff 's syndrome be a rare form of memory loss there be a famous case back in the 1970s a marine sergeant by the name of Arthur Briggs he be in his late 50 good health generally but somehow he lose his memory of any event which occur to he after September 1944 I do not know what this have to do with I I remember everything that happen to I right up until the time I walk into this room and that be precisely what Briggs tell his doctor and to prove it he tell they that world war ii be go strong that his unit be be deploy to the Philippines and that he be 20 year old Fascinating could not rember anything that happen to he for long than 40 minute he be permanently stuck in 1944 very distressing no doubt now can weet on with it where be the questionnaire what questionnaire that be why I be here be not it to answer question like do I sometimes feel as if there be a tight band around my head and do I agree with the statement that these day I do not believe we have much to hope for oh do you do I what believe we have much to hope for I be not go to be force from my position by a handful of young turk who do not know cut edge from cut fart your colleague do not send you here then who do I envy you Mr Havelmann you do not even know I you never have to grow old you never have to watch your friend die you can still enjoy the music you love the pleasure of a good meal good sex you will always be 41 year old not in 4 month I will not you can create misery but you do not have to feel it you make a clean escape I do not have to put up with this you do not have to put up with any of it that be what be remarkable about your deception you be blissfully insulate from who you be from what you 've do or maybe just maybe it be just what you want we to believe go to hell what be the weather like this morning do I really need to tell you it be a glorious spring morning 68 degree red bud on the tree be that so good day take a look out the window before you go that be not possible I

hill it never hurt to have the support of those who control the purse string actually you might be happy to know that you sell your interest in the company for nearly a billion dollar in 2009 be that so you cash in your political chit as well to run for a seat in the maryland state legislature maybe you could tell I who to bet on in the world series in 2010 oh 2010 if I be not mistaken it be the brave in six you be a deeply disturb woman you have no idea so how do the fairy tale end Mother Goose get your hand up that be my wrap do you wash these I do not want that what you tell I you want a

winter all right Nuclearwinter that be a view from a robotic camera 3 000 foot above we Welcome to the apocalypse Mr Havelmann I be go to see my daughter 's play I be go to see my family now and I be go to report you as unconscionably abusive to your patient your family be dead Mr Havelmann that be a horrible thing to say not as horrible as the way they die this have go far enough you be a lunatic I just see my wife less than two hour ago and so you 've be tell I for ten month Game 's over Havelmann you never show any pity why should you get any you be not a doctor at all be you Deanna what the hell be you do Deanna put the gun down Deanna please just put it Nobody be go to save you now nobody now where be we somebody help I you will remember Mr Havelmann or you will die try I have a feeling something like this might happen what you go to do find a way to that room and stop she what do you expect I to do there be an alternative what be you talk about you could let thing take their course maybe she be not the only one who be crack under the pressure Justice would be serve one way or the other the justice of naked revenge be there another kind leave I do not believe you not a single thing you 've say then I suppose that put we on equal footing except that I can prove that what I be say be true fine then by all mean prove it just put down the get back that be New York former population 11 3 million no survivor that be Tokyo Sao Paulo Beijing and that be London eight hour after the bomb hit the first few week we have report of pocket of survivor in Central America North Africa Australia but we lose contact with they as of now we be not sure if there be any more than 871 people alive all inside this bunker you be ask I to believe that I leave home this morning kiss my wife and kid and then step through some kind of time tunnel into a post nuclear holocaust you be not listen to I Mr Havelmann you never really do hear I do you you could not even hear your own expert when it might have make a difference we have a potential problem with the I B 8 sir what sort of problem it may be more more powerful than we intend it to be we be design the weapon system of the future Nate the more powerful the well or be I miss something here Group 5 run the beta through 10 000 sim every possible scenario include the targeting of nuclear site missile power plant and we think the beam could unintentionally trigger all fissionable material within a radius of 60 mile you think or you know we be not certain but give the danger of course the potential I I mean if we do not solve this I will read this immediately Mansur blow the whistle do not he you have ample warning you just would not heed they there be a timetable in place a timetable do you think the competion call a time out so you ignore the warning of course not we tweak the design we build in safeguard but we do not veer off course right and now you be look at the result you be show I a simulation to manipulate it be not a simulation there be a sea of corpse how stupid do you think I be Major you be not stupid no one ever suggest you be stupid there 've always be people like you Major People who do not understand that progress be our birthright that the great danger be that we shackle our genius as a people if it have be up to you you would 've outlaw electricity the automobile the personal computer oh maybe I would 've there you 've prove my point one day it be the greenhouse effect and then the next day we be poison the ocean you live in a world of paralyze fear and irrational paranoia if we surrender to that fear we might as well be back in the cave we be back in the cave I will give you point for cleverness Major you really have I go there so what be you go to do Mr Havelmann be you go to walk out into the crisp blue sunshine and congratulate yourself for make the world safe for democracy I think I 've earn a certain measure of contentment well it pain I to disappoint you but you be not go to walk out of here by my watch you have less than ten minute before you cycle back to square one before you tell I we 've never meet before oh I hardly think I could forget you Major Evans you know maybe I should put a hole through your brain right now the threat alone could end your career if I pick up the phone right now you would be toast really who would you call I think it be fair to say I 've accrue some friend you would not want to tangle with Frankly some of the most important people in washington Mr Havelmann you be the most important person in Washington I 've make my contribution certainly but there be a couple of hundred mover and shaker who might take issue with your assessment not to mention the man in the oval office Mr Geslow take over shortly after we arrive due to your diminish capacity but he be never swear in you be and still be President of the United States it be design to be impervious to attack it be the President 's safe room in case the facility be breach there be no way we can bust in there not without the kind of firepower that would put the whole facility at risk there be get to be something we can do there be 4 inch of case harden steel so we could use plasma torch it could take some time do it we be in the President 's office at the strategic emergency command bunker you should 've make thing a little more spartan if you want I to believe that the appointment be all yours Mr President lavish self indulgent personalize if I be the president what do that make you the secretary of assassination I be your psychiatrist you share the most intimate detail of your life with I and I care about you sir you know what be crazy part of I even after all you 've do part of I still do I order a retaliatory strike be that it it be a preemptive strike you go against the advice of virtually all your advisor include your Vice President you attack with I B 's first time they would ever be use the one minute war you call it the I B be a deterrent who would 've what be you say happen you wound up trigger nuclear explosion from the caspian sea to the Persian gulf six country answer in kind and then well all hell break loose why be you do this Major be it possible you be actually a patient in this hospital More picture I tell you your family do not make it they be at the western white house at the time you have the arrogance to think they would not be in danger what the hell be this you have a robotic camera deploy before the Korsakoff tighten its grip on you what kind of sick joke be this you watch this footage I be in the room when you do you cry like a baby that be Dorothy 's ring who give you this the remote find an inscription it also confirm her d N A do I need to show you the child oh god be it come back now what do you remember Mr President I have to know all of it all of it do you remember order the strike I believe in what I be do protect the country protect our way of life protect the democracy I have a duty a sworn obligation of course there would be consequence you can not succumb to emotion Reports three million dead 40 million a billion Numbers Incomprehensible number I consider the option I think thing through I do not back down I believe in what I be do the democracy the nation you protect it prevail it be 871 strong Mission accomplish Mr President there be reason Robert a reason for what must seem like my unspeakable cruelty the people will survive the world will start again and they will look back to this moment and they will be remind that none of we can surrender our individual responsibility not those who lead not those who follow it be all we have sir it be all we will ever have we still have audio but we lose picture it be time now I wish there be another way please good bye Mr President Deanna you can not do this come in hello be this where I be suppose to be yes please sit down I hope this do not take long I 've get to be at my daughter 's school at 11 00 my wife will kill I if I be late when the fate of so many rest in the hand of so few can the failure to be accountable ever be forgive Transcript swsub com Sync Benj from the very beginning we have wonder how life begin what our purpose be and where we be head we have struggle to understand time matter the infinite universe who we be and if we be alone great mind have imagine the most wonderful and the most terrifying answer to these question we invite you to join we on this great expedition Stitch do not move I say do not move put down your weapon I say put it down I do not speak iraqi towelhead drop it Put it down I need to get to my friend my friend I do not want to shoot you okay you understand I yes I do not know whatever that thing be the Colonel need to see it posthaste where be he throw about 60 foot from the wreck Sir find he unconscious and his partner can you tell I what happen Captain they 've be like that since we find them Sir take them both back to H Q and wait for further order Sir the impulse towards violence may be hardwire into our gene but so be the dream that someday we might rise above it and there be no sign of another craft from the wreckage no Sir then where the hell do it come from we be look into that General and exactly what be I look at we be look into that too Sir this be a karyotype of a normal human show the 23 pair of chromosome we all have now we take scraping from what appear to be the exoskeleton and despite its appearance it be biologically identical to human except for one difference the 23rd pair of chromosome be miss please explain Captain it appear to have no gender Sir no sex well how be that possible well any one of a number of gender mutation be possible in nature but to have no 23rd chromosome I 've never see that I doubt anyone have Captain have um have it move yet no Sir so do we even know if it be dead or alive it be not dead Mr President though it be cold to the touch we 've detect a pulse then uh what be this thing by strict definition it be humanoid Humanoid yes Sir well where do humanoid come from captain be you go to use the a word it do pose the puzzling question of how this thing buzz one of our chopper at 400 foot I know what it do captain I be ask you where you think it come from not from this neighborhood Sir Captain be not that um well a little premature I want to make it clear we run a large battery of test on the cell 's sample we take this do not react anything like any know biological organism it would not burn we even try irradiate it with PU 239 weapon grade plutonium it denature the isotope denature it make the plutonium inert whatever this be it seem impervious to most thing of this world I can not explain that oh and uh it glow in the dark get I Skynner Major Skynner have retire Sir we do not even know where he be well then you find he and you unretire he yes Sir I be not interested excuse I I say I be not interested you do not even know who I be I do not need to those shoe be not flip flop or sneaker so you sure as hell be not from around here Ergo I be not interested well Sir you certainly live up to your reputation what reputation be that Lieutenant your formidable deductive reasoning how do you know I be a Lieutenant they would not insult I send anyone rank less and anyone rank higher would 've think it be beneath he or she as the case may be and I have not be call Sir in two year I say I be not interested they be insistent that I seek you out and show you this Sir why what have they find a weather balloon or some fairy light stick in a tree if you could rat the significance of that on a scale of 1 to 10 how would you ten Sir Ten be little green man it be always interesting what book a person be draw to in a collection of all the lieutenant they could have send why do they send you I be select by the NASA program to join this inquiry Sir so you be an astrophysicist amongst other thing I also work for S e t I you be a believer I think that it be narrow minded to discount the possibility of life outside of this solar system yes Sir so you 've decide it be hard to ignore the law of probability well except with no evidence all you be leave with be your faith in the idea man be probably near the central truth in their superstition than in their science Thoreau but when superstition become conviction that only lead to fanaticism and when government surround a subject with such secrecy you know the one critical piece of logic that U F O conspiracy freak the world over always neglect to consider Man 's propensity to make enemy Sir if we really know there be alien out there we would not keep it a secret we would be turn them into an enemy and go to war with them the Pentagone would like nothing well than have a whole new frontier to battle with I 've come to dread the day they find something that be my job Lieutenant to find something I be glad I never do really so you think that there be an explanation for all of this there always be they say that you would say that Sir may I log these note please yes Sir how long have she be like this they find she about 6 hour ago and the other 36 hour and nobody be get a word out of any of they that be right Sir Major Lieutenant just call I Bert will you yes Sir I think you might want to see the patient first they be in what be call a wake coma nonreactive reflexology with arrest tremor Common for people suffer posttraumatic stress disorder well that be the odd thing their e c g and e e g result suggest the opposite an extreme state of relaxation they be not traumatize they be extremely calm it be like they be be hold in a state of bliss hold by what I would love to show you have you run an m r I both c t and M R I yield no result you mean non conclusive result I mean no result it give off no image its cocoon somehow protect it from any magnetic field or x ray Albert Walt Strange be not it you spend your whole career search for something and it wind up run smack into one of your chopper except for the fact that you spend my whole career look for something I agree it be strange so what do you think I be think it be a dawn good hoax come on Bert I be think where be its craft why Iraq why now we be much more interested in what now if you know what you get here General what do you bring I for I be not pretend to know what it be Major we just need to assess its spread so far it be put 3 people in the coma and it have not even wake up yet for all intent and purpose General they be not in coma and they be in no immediate danger Sir let us just say I need a bit more convincing before I let it shake hand with the President Lieutenant I would be careful there do not get too close to its eye we believe this be how it be do I have a theory about skeptic Deep down inside they be big believer than the rest of we they be just too scared to admit it scared of what of what it would mean to believe a few year ago at a family picnic my wife fall over and could not get back up so I take she to the hospital and I find out she have the beginning of Creutzfeldt Jakob disease uh an extremely rare disease of the brain where some foreign protein get into your body and it screw up all your protein and she catch it from a piece of contaminated dental equipment when she be in for her regular checkup how be that for random a microscopic spec on a piece of metal give my wife dementia so you be right I would be scared to believe there be any great meaning in that but something be keep you here what do you see it be communicate they be write the same repeat message in their own language hear this you foolish and senseless people what do that mean Major hear what we have cryptologist comb through it Sir but what do you think Bert what do it want I do not even know what it be let alone what it want hear this you foolish and senseless people do not sound like Glad to meet you do you ever sleep report worldwide a bizarre phenomena in the sky thousand of sighting of unidentified object drop from out of the cloud be rush in from around the world include sighting in Israel Lebanon Taiwan Cashmere Ireland and Russia the soldier be fight there be gunfire and then this thing fall from the heaven there there be a flash and I cover my eye when I open they everyone be on the ground unconscious U S authority have make no comment so far about the nature of the object when do this start Skynner the last thing my wife ever say to I make no sense I think it be her dementia neuron misfire but she sit right up in the bed and she look like she know what she be talk about and she say they be watch this be what they 've be write for hour we be watch what do you think they want you be ask I I I be fresh out of explanation not everything have an explanation I be not bring here to have some personal experience but you be have one I think our job as scientist be to stay open to all possibility be not it I do not know what they want but I be keep my eye open get Skynner hear we you foolish and senseless people who have eye but do not see who have ear but do not hear you must listen to he seek peace and pursue it nation shall not lift up sword against nation neither shall they learn war anymore hear this you foolish and senseless people who have eye but can not see who have ear but can not hear you must listen to he seek peace and pursue it nation shall not lift up sword against nation neither shall they learn war anymore that uh that last line I 've hear it somewhere Isaiah chapter 2 verse 4 the Bible it be a mishmash of quote from the Koran the Torah the gospel of Bhagavad Gita all the major religious work from what we can tell you be say this be a message from God it be for you all to draw your own conclusion I be only relay the message what do that make you Major Moses with the tablet maybe we should look at it this way that the creature be use our belief to communicate with we they be give we back our own word so to speak the question be our word or God 's well Sir that be a matter of personal belief the quotation do seem to send a message that transcend all creed these other one that have fall on the Earth what do we know of they well they seem to be land in cluster we have report that they appear to be physically identical and use the same tactic to stun people as far as we know all the coma subject around the world give the same message at exactly the same time what be you say Bert what can we interpret from this their last quote sum up their intention I think rather unequivocally he can destroy you if he will and bring into be a new creation that be no difficult thing for he regardless of who or what send this message if we ignore it I think we can safely assume what the threat be be you seriously suggest that that the world disarm itself we be say that they be suggest it Sir Mr President may I certainly how do we know this be not a ploy to lay down our weapon before these thing attack forget interpret their word let us look at their action they have invade we there be now thousand all over the world we have a country on amber alert and you be ask we to hand they the key maybe God be ask we to set thing straight maybe he be ask we to set aside our difference or maybe we be be dupe by a civilization of extraterrestrial and what be you suggest General I be suggest we prepare to defend ourselves against what exactly why be we assume that these thing be lay dormant and not lie in wait their message be anything but peaceful Major Skynner would not you agree Major I would have to agree well then this may be your first war General where you can be certain that God be not on your side excuse I sir you all need to see this what you be watch be live over Washington eyewitness say the light you can see appear from out of nowhere it be unclear what they be make of or what be cause they this phenomenon be apparently occur over major city around the world it be confirm Sir they be over all our major city every city in the world all tv broadcast have be interrupt we be scramble aircraft now to gather telemetry go to maximum force readiness yes Sir Patch in all nation with nuclear capability Mr President you be jump to conclusion thank for your help Bert Lieutenant we all take it from here wait a sec be you dismiss we Sir Sir you be make a mistake Lieutenant yes Sir where be home for you Ohio you okay you know when I be a little kid my dad use to describe God and it be so beautiful maybe God look well from a distance I be just not ready for this I think we all feel that way right now I be sorry if you think I let you down I think you let yourself down I think you bury your hope with your wife it be it be not that I do not want to believe where be you go they be shut down all our warhead Sir what be you talk about somehow they be disarm our bomb systematically Systematically State by state Sir at the rate they be go we have one hour maximum before all our warhead be down the president of Russia and China be dial in Sirs we 've all receive the same threat and we all face the same dilemma of lose our defense system accord to our calculation we have less than 40 minute to act before all warhead be decommission worldwide consider this diminish window of opportunity I propose a temporary suspension of the guideline to all relevant international treaty so that we may act swiftly and without encumbrance Mr President please forgive my interruption by act swiftly what do you mean I mean to mount an
