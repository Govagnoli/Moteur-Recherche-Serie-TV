outside the home of Kim Doherty repute to be the girlfriend of Drexler bombing suspect Jay Burchell Doherty move to Manhattan six month ago where she and the suspect be often see together needless to say the question on everyone 's mind be whether or not Kim Doherty know of yesterday 's event before they happen Michelle have authority mention any idea whether Ms Doherty be a suspect in the case no jack police will not confirm anything neighbor however do say she have be question by the FBI she be not answer you want I to have our man keep the paparazzi off her Ms Doherty should get use to her celebrity status Sir Walk with I we interview the staff go over the room we think Burchell and Fog leave a little less than an hour ago the county 's fully mobilize but it be not much and the body at the airfield he work for a firm in Washington D C he be hire by Carlton Fog Sir we find their old clothe in a dumpster out back so they change their clothe and their look our suspect be start to adapt I want every cop in the county watch the canadian border get I mock up of Burchell and Fog 's potential new look and get I as much press here as possible you want press sir if Burchell and Fog be make a run for Canada I be go to make sure everybody know about it if we steal a car it be good to pick one that will not be miss for a while wait you 've steal a car yeah it be kind of a rite of passage where I grow up yeah I be impressed Jay do not be I go to Yale to get away from stuff like this it be another one head north you be right on that call all right this one look good what be you do we smash the window 9 time out of 10 the owner leave the key in the glove compartment wait nine time out of ten car like these be leave unlocked it be easy to get blue book value from the insurance

Ellington I be still get report from the Drexler but right now we can assume that everything in the museum have be take care of the entire collection yes sir thank you thank you sir know that Burchell and Fog have alter their appearance our forensic artist have create these mock up of possible new look I think boss like talk to they more than we ' course he do with we he do not get to see himself on tv later we find their print at the crime scene so until we rule out their involvement Burchell and Fog should be consider armed and dangerous thank you Carlton Fog be be bring into New York I be go there now to question he I want you 2 to head north and help oversee the border operation actually sir yes agent Marlow I would like permission to pursue another course of action you have a well idea just a different one we be work off a nascent profile but if they be run for the border why drive south from the airport they could have turn around then why take the time to color and cut their hair we all know that every second count for a fugitive they would have be well off go straight for Canada interesting theory if they head south where be they go I think they be run scared and if they do not flee the country they be go to be look for shelter with friend family whoever they can trust maybe back to New York another Fog house we have unit cover those so I would like permission to go to New Haven you think they would be crazy enough to go back there even if I be wrong at least we will get more interview and help build a profile what be your feeling do not know sir but I think we be more effective on the move than sit at a border crossing you 've get 24 hour event such as those of the past 36 hour remind we that it be become increasingly difficult to offer protection and solace to those that we hold dear I be be call into the fbi today because I be contact by my son in the hour follow the bombing of the Drexler museum Tyler sound distraught that be my dad he profess his innocence and I do what I believe any father would do I ask he to come home my hope be that I could persuade they to turn themselves in to the authority you still believe he now he be say that because he have to he can not admit that he try to help we and although a man end up dead I will say this I still believe that my son be innocent of this crime just as I be sure he be innocent of the bombing of the Drexler museum if you can hear I if you be there I want you to know that I be here to help you and I will do everything in my power to make sure that you get a fair trial and that you be what the hell he be say that to protect himself look I be only go to say this once but you would not have live in that house with we if your father have not cut you off do you call that loyalty I

chemistry work clothing thing we can take to the feds why do not I know about this because we leave them at Nell 's this just get well and well whatever happen between you and Nell it be way less

auction President Shears have sell this country to the high bidder it be unbelievable look like the perfect way for Burchell and Fog to promote their hatred of the President and his administration the right to do whatever they want this generation need to stand up for what be right take a stand it be time to have a revolution we need to wake up and take this country back it be time for blood in the street blood in the street it do not make any sense I know that look why take the risk what go back to New Haven go back to destroy evidence that be already on the internet destroy the original cover

show look if you want to make suggestion make good one she mention city hall that be where police be base in small town like this what if she recognize I then we would be sit in the back of a cop car not at this table you be not always right you can see the level of Tyler Fog 's animosity towards president Shears President Shears have sell this country to the high bidder it be time for blood in the street blood in the street what I have to say be this the action that the United States take this guy be a liar the man be never fully answer a question in his whole life would not know the truth if it walk up and bit he on the ass well I be shock shocked to learn that politician lie any thought on where this country 's head Mr Fog turn that off I want to watch this America need to hear from you the future of this country be guy like we not blowhard like Shears yeah he be right besides this guy be get more hot air than the Hindenburg I would call this a work vacation Peter and just because I be leave Washington do not mean that Washington be leave I oh God that be crap Jay hey listen up President Shears have sell this country to the high bidder I think it be time for blood in the street blood in the street Will 's video be on the news the one he be be shoot the past two year every place we go his video blog yeah blood in the street you remember that that be a joke not anymore the video be part of the frame job Son of a bitch think do you ever see his blog other than on his computer okay so what do you want to do honestly I want to go to New York find Kim and disappear but since that be not an option I guess we keep look for Daniel Taft Good 'cause I find a listing for Daniel Taft but it be not a house Fog 's video we have the originate I p address World wide Web Video 's everywhere trace it back to the first computer that upload it will not be easy or quick what be go on Q D come back with result of Burchell 's manifesto the handwriting analysis be inconclusive apparently the Ps do not match up we need a hand write exemplar to make a match so I be go to the source Mom hi Christmas card 2002 Jay 's last communication with I Happy Holidays Jay thank you this will help to convict my son or exonerate he to understand he so why do not you two talk do it have to do with Jay 's father Jay think I betray he that I leave his father in his time of need but I do not I be protect my son protect he from what Jay 's father be a soldier Ambitious loyal but when he be court martiale thing change it be not safe for we to stay so how old be Jay when his father die 15 his death must have be tough for both of you you think that be why Jay would do this do not you to avenge his father that be what the press be say what do you say there be time when I question the goodness in my husband never Jay Number 32 be you sure this be it this be the place then where be Taft 's boat the girl at the store be name Maya Come on the press be have a field day since you take out that photographer this be the second time you 've give I a ride home this week you 've be get in a lot of trouble lately your man already go through everything sorry old habit you have family in the area do not you Queens my mom and dad maybe you should visit they take a break from all this I will be fine you ever hear of Occam 's Razor give two choice the simple theory be usually correct you learn that in FBI school the way I see it there be two possibility either a massive conspiracy have create the persona of Will Traveler and manipulate event for the past two year to frame your boyfriend or Jay Burchell and Tyler Fog two man with a bone to pick with President Shears join force with a third individual to commit an act of terrorism I tell you Jay be not involve then why be he still run he be scared of this vast conspiracy yes or maybe he be still on the run because he be now link to a murder and the disappearance of a deputy in upstate New York I have a daughter Kim Senior in college I pretty much let she run her own life and she pretty much do a good job of it but when she be about to get hurt I step in Something 's tell I you be go to get hurt in this thank for the concern take a break from this before you get into more trouble I may not be there next time to bail you out I think miss Doherty be go to help our case look at this somebody plan on be away a long time and if will be Daniel Taft this boat be his out what kind of person would keep stuff like this around a soldier you know if will be plan a trip then maybe he make a record maybe he chart a course or something somebody 's come who the hell be you two look we be really sorry we do not mean to intrude we be look for a friend be you Daniel Taft Yep and this be my boat so this mean what exactly the chemical residue in the box find in New Haven match the taggant find at the Drexler bombing Aluminum naphthalene palmitate Napalm so these guy be our doer it be not my job to speculate but it be mine so spit it out your suspect be student right Yale grad one with military training this be an exotic mixture even for the military Camp Pendleton and Fort Hood both have small quantie but we check those out and they be not miss any so this be homemade one of our suspect be study chemistry right but you do not learn this kind of thing in chem 101 I do not care where you go to school but it be not impossible no if you could put your hand on the right ingredient Most time nut job like this it be 40 pound of fertilizer a few blast cap and boom you be on the 11 00 news I be not say your guy be not the doer I be just say this be not the work of amateur lab say the chemical taggant at the Drexler be a close match with the New Haven box Evidence aside what do you think Fog and Burchell be develop a profile like I 've never see before there be variable to the evidence I be not sure what to think and the manifesto much more typical of this kind of perp political aggrieve
