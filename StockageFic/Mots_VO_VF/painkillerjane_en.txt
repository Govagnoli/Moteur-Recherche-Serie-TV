subway before the city shut it down well most of it anyway hi I be dr Seth Carpenter and this be agent Jane Vasco formerly of the d e a who be graciously consented to join our team another woman she be more than qualified if only I know for what we hunt neuros neurological aberrant which be what we be do in that club the night we meet your partner be she straight six year ago the government become aware of a genetic aberration appear in the population despite their difference we 've discover a definable pattern in their gene code this aberration seem to affect the neurological center of the frontal and cerebral cortex what dr Carpenter 's mean in english those with the aberration possess a unique ability to influence other like the one in the club the one you experience have the ability to induce hallucination but we 've encounter dozen of variation in how many people to date almost 200 welcome to the freak show what cause it well um you do not know several possibility genetic environmental chemical we be still work on try to find the source the reason the neuros use their power be as varied as they be we think the aberration interfere with the brain 's ability to distinguish right from wrong you really do not know that much do you we know they be a pain in the ass which be why the government have go to great length to keep the phenomenon secret and not panic the public we use intel from law enforcement and medium first to identify then contain Contain we chip them the micro chip basically short circuit the problem once it penetrate the epidermis nano tech propulsion deliver it through the bloodstream to the brain each method of transmission vary with the op sometimes it be with this sometimes it be less conspicuous so much for job orientation you be a smart girl you will learn the rest as you go we 've be work this case for some time someone be deal substandard medication on the black market sound like d e a Territory it be now it be ours we be convinced there be a neuro behind the operation the drug in question be make and manufacture by vono tek the emerald city it be hard to believe that the company would even manufacture sub standard product they do not but about one tenth of one percent of every run fail quality control Contamination a snag in the manufacturing process expire ingredient that do not get scan properly even that small percentage amount to million of drug any batch that fail to pass qc be lock away and slate for destruction in this case someone 's make an end run and get they out onto the street obviously the medication look like the real deal but any unscrupulous pharmacy someone try to cut corner there have already be a dozen death trace directly to vono tek why be you convinced there be a neuro behind this we lose one of our agent to a neuro Shannon Perry be a member of our team I put her inside vono tek her first day on the job she leave the building and calmly step in front of a move truck woman do not last very long around here be it the sexual harassment or a size deficiency Shannon 's psych record be spotless someone make she do it how have they break her cover we do not know she be follow Randall Hyde Vono tek 's head of security in order to have free access to vono tek 's vault the neuro would have to control Hyde unless he be the neuro he be clean we 've take tissue sample the neuro obviously have to get close enough to control shannon how close be close proximity it vary but in order to control a subject a neuro would have to be nearby so we need to go back in yes but not solo I want you and Jane inside you can play tag with Hyde and watch each other 's back we move quickly here Vasco get use to it I hack human resource Most be work tomorrow Impressive you have no idea all I

truth be I would have do the same for she only I would not have be so damned dramatic about it keep your distance Maureen you say these neuro need to be in close proximity to the subject in order to exert control be there anyway to find out who would have be close enough to both shannon and Steve been there do that no one who be within range of shannon when she die be above the tenth floor of the building when Steve go through the window then how the hell do a neuro influence people when they be not within range Remote control the comm set Riley I suppose transmission through the airwave count as proximity it would be a first though everyone use that communication system it could be anybody but not everyone be clear to talk directly to another employee who would have clear and open access to the comm system it be get to be Hyde 's assistant she run the central switchboard Crap what she just comm'd Maureen how could she make it so quick she can monitor the entire operation from her desk

apprehend well the man lie here he be be dead for at Least five week the Body go miss five day Ago be someone always on Duty here Twenty four hour a Day mostly to answer question from the Tourists not much burial Ground Left nowadays between the Crematoriums and Medical Research what about Security why Bother so anyone can get in or Out do not take much to see what happen here the way the Dirt 's pile up the Hand Prints along the Inside no Tool Marks that Grave be not break in to guy it be break out of Gunfire Riley Research Boss maybe close than you think from all appearance it seem our Mr Hawkings over there leave under his own power well since you bring he in he be be do a Pretty good impression of a Dead Guy Seth have anything to add just a Post Mortem Aaron Hawkings die at Age Twenty Seven year Old from Complications due to an Hereditary Cardiovascular Condition you check with Records Death Certificate 's legit he have be diagnose as a child since I know you would ask I come up with at Least a dozen other case of corpse miss from Graveyards all within the last nine week they be all young and Hot but Dead you have not be on some of my date you would need body Armor all Male all under Thirty in life all in Excellent Physical Condition you think a woman 's behind this or a Football Coach those Guys be alive they would make a Helluva a Defensive Line or Soldiers a Special Ops Team if the Feds be right and whoever break in to get the plan for the New Tower be connect with the other Break Ins Helluva way to make a move on the President who would be more unstoppable than a Small Army of Corpses for the Newer Members of the Class what the Hell be you talk about obviously a Neuro that can raise People from the Dead obviously can that happen have not see it before but it could explain what be happen how be that possible how the Hell be any of this possible how can they induce Hallucinations Control Other People 's Minds we do not have a Handbook here People we be write it as we go go to ask he for help I would if I could guess there be a First Time for everything five Years Ago I never hear of a Neuro Genetic Aberrations I do not even know what we be deal with but we deal with it why do you think he do not get up and walk away like the other suppose dead People Proximity the Neuros need to be in the Area to Exert Control alright when the Feds Sprung their Ambush maybe they scare off the Neuro and he be force to leave Mr Hawkings behind maybe at Least in Special Ops we know what we be fight and why this be you be Philosophical I want to understand what it be I be ask my People to die fighting for perhaps we be not mean to have all the answer to our question be this you be Philosophical not by Choice shocking be not it I mean who have book why not Read Online connection to the past something you can touch or Feel make I feel safe and grounded what be your Deal what do you mean I mean what be your Deal I know I say you seem a lot like other People but I be not sure about that be that why you invite yourself over tonight to try and figure I out there be something about you that be a little off to the Side I 've hear Different

something about you like you be try to hide it from everyone I think we would well call it a Night there be still half a Bottle Left I be Beat maybe another time okay see Ya Amanda be be honest and I be not truth be I be More off to the side than she would ever know I be angry and although it do not make a Lot of sense I have to prove it to Myself Ahhhhhh like the Lady say off to the side it be my opinion Sir that the President 's Security might be compromise the Tower Dedication can not be reschedule then his Security Team need to be fully inform they be already aware of risk Potential but not what be behind it your team will have to work that Angle that be four People if we be up against what I think we might be the decision be final Agent Mcbride yes Sir Boss we 've get one on the Move

Cross into the Lobby where the Ceremony be if I be go to try for a Hit this be where I would do it there be a Clear Line of Fire from at least three different point between the Limo and the Front Entrance there be a tight window of Exposure but enough time to kill somebody yeah we have to proceed as Planned we be way off profile here Sporting Goods Albert Malley you really think this be about hit the President we can not risk otherwise but if we be wrong and we be we might be put someone Else 's life at risk no One 's die so Far so far last Night the Guy try to put A Pipe through Maureen

Drip with a semplar push subject inform they the patient have tertiary anemia Caller report he have diagnose from the pulse pattern and dry blood the trick be to only suture the first fifteen millimeter of the primary sheath that way the tissue can accept the artificial intrusion as organic you be an m d uh huh where do you study Johns hopkin I specialize in neuro muscular syndrome I 've write extensively about it oh the nordic degeneration and the middle aged male Dr Allen rafferty write that article that be right five month ago allen be in the middle of an aortic bypass he be do hundred of they they say he just freeze he could not remember how to continue the assisting have to take over the patient almost die Neurologist check he out they could not find anything wrong everything allen know about medicine it be just go Allen know it be over Medicine be his life and he just could not face it he start drink and then he try to kill himself I get to he in time but now how could something like this happen there be only a handful of surgeon in the city who can do what dr Rafferty do this homeless man know his procedure as well as he do so we be not talk about sudden partial amnesia it be about pick people 's brain look that way and no he be not a neuro I test he in order to have acquire rafferty 's knowledge there must have be a middle man it would seem so three victim two area of knowledge train and medicine what do they have in common there be no answer when I knock I hear some noise I be singe what I be singe when I do not hear an answer I think there might be problem so I you pick the lock it be really not that difficult what be you do here riley just walk take a walk you live five mile away want some wine no I do not it be for the good anyway I

break in at the pharmacy close to where the paramedic work on the homeless guy junkie break into pharmacy every ten minute there be not any drug steal at least not the kind of drug that get you high Hemoglobin accelerator the paramedic use hemoglobin accelerator on the guy have the seizure what you be say be the man who have the seizure be the middleman he would need someone with some medical expertise to help he doctor can not operate on themselves unless he contact with dr Rafferty he could have take his medical knowledge if he have contact with dr Rafferty why not just have rafferty treat he if I have all the answer I would be you exactly you sure you do not have any wine no riley I still do not have any wine look I be think we could check out the pharmacy so you do not just

this man keep your team away it be the only way to save their life and mine the man be ethan grant no criminal record no nothing he tell the police that he see the plane crash before it happen there be no other evidence connect he to it but there be other call right the voice print from his call to the airline match three other from the past six month warn people about bad thing that be go to happen a gas main explosion a fire at an elementary school and get this a tornado that touch down near amarillo texas sound good for a chip to I you hear what the man say if he be right and so far you say he have be then three of you will die if you actually believe that someone can see into the future even if I do not why risk it he have not commit any crime all he be be do be try to save people 's life so far yes but if he be a neuro and if he can see into the future you have to wonder what else he can do bet on every horse race title fight and bowl game for the next twenty year I be think more along the line of predict presidential security route or transport protocol for nuclear weapon why do you assume he be try to hurt anyone because he can traditional law enforcement can not handle he that power be what make he and every other neuro our problem even if it cost we our life Let us leave this alone andre be he still in police custody no they have to release he way to go fed that be the address where they pick he up a house own by his sister sarah if you be go to do this I be go with you why because I be the only one guarantee to survive he be not here when do you expect he home

that ethan seem fairly normal fairly normal he work as a graphic designer he make a good living at it but then something change Ethan would get a feeling that something bad be go to happen and within a few day something always do then his feeling get more specific he know when and where and how many people would die he call the gas company in denver to warn they about the main exploding they tell he someone would look at it obviously nobody do not until it be too late it be like that every time nobody would listen we really need to talk to your brother I be go to ask you one more time do you know where we can find he I wish I do since this begin ethan have basically retreat from the world when his premonition first start he think that they be the result of some secret government

another disaster one that he want I to help he stop do he tell you how many people be go to die do he say he would be one of they why do you ask because when he come to see I this week I get the

often have those feeling of be connect I know what you be think but this be different and it be not just with I I remember once when we be out together it be a beautiful wonderful day we come across a homeless man ask for money but one look in his eye you could see that his life be lack more than money Karl hand the man five dollar but he hold onto his hand for a moment you could see the change immediately it be as if this man light up inside his hope be restore Karl give that to he it be beautiful this son of a bitch sound like a chip candidate to I Karl would never hurt someone 's child or anyone Mrs Robeson I be afraid you be go to have to spend the night here we be in the middle of an investigation and right now you be a suspect I know why you be here the thing that have happen in this house Karl be here Maureen would you be so kind as to take mrs Robeson up to your room keep an eye on her well we know she be tell the truth about her husband be bring here why would the bureau

neuro what she say about her husband how when he touch people I know yeah have enough of connor as a roomie just want some time to myself you want to talk about it not really sound like you do what have you see see enough to help I understand part of what be go on in this house which be which be specific to the individual whatever he or she fear most I 've be go over the document case in my mind it be a woman the last woman she be suppose to be a witness in an organized crime case a hemophobic that mean she fear of blood she see blood come out of the wall an agent arachnophobic could have swear he see scorpion crawl out from under the bed cover and you I see man under my command die because I make a mistake something from your past not specifically but something I live with every day you can not take responsibility for what happen to we you do not believe a word of that you know if you be lead this team you would feel exactly the same as I do you still have not tell I what you see I be not sure I understand it enough to support my theory when I know I will let you know what be you do here how do you find I what do you want what do you want no no sign of connor upstairs and mrs Robeson apparently sleep through the night no I 've check the entire basement and the outside when be the last time anyone see connor last night when we take mrs Robeson upstairs you try his comm

I be still in diaper you be hot connor you already know what it be like to sleep in a four by six cinder block room you gun to go back I be here what be up what be up be not that my question technically you be awol now I want to know why because hang around that house wait for ghostly apparition to appear be a waste of time that be my call well I make my own I can do a lot more in the field than I can hang around that house tuck in with the rest of you I think the old broad be onto something there be something I need to check out you see something in the house what do you see Connor Damn I lose he he be off the map I be make a fresh pot Dr Carpenter should be here in about an hour to pick you up for analysis what be it you people be afraid of we just want he to check you

school I do not go to school anymore I be grow up now this be always my favorite time when I have the house to myself your father 's go and you be go and I get to be alone you like be alone it give I time to think what do you think about I think about you and wonder what be so wrong about you I do not understand can you imagine what it be like to have a child a beautiful child only to find yourself frighten by the very thing you love the most you be frighten by I you be never like the other child even before you could talk I know you be different all the dream we have for a child only to discover that I be the mother of a freak Jane tell I what you see I do not wantto talk about it it be not real whatever you see it be this house it be not real some wound do not heal so quickly I understand but maureen 's right this house have a way of get inside we the fear be real what you see be not be there any difference yes we can conquer or at least learn to live with our fear I will be alright I never doubt it yeah yeah I will let he know Connor 's come in he say he be get something and he be bring it here for show and tell Jane before you freak I mean before what happen what do you touch what be you talk about what have do you touch do you plug something in Turn on a light switch I do not know I suppose I turn on the light why Andre I be make some note I turn off the light and go to bed I be in the kitchen with anna make coffee be everything all right I know it I know it I be right again I be right again you go to have a parade for yourself or tell we what be go on I just confirm with connor that his mp 3 player plug in and he be listen to music wow that really explain it riley do not you see whatever it be it be in the electricity in the circuitry of the house so it seem brilliant to ask how come whatever be in here do not touch I I mean with all my equipment plug in the drawing power there have to be a logical explanation look at this come here Andre and jane be upstairs when whatever happened happen but I and connor I be get to that the light switch in jane 's room the lamp in andre 's the outlet connor use they all work on the same circuit the house be re model at some point and there be too much power to draw from one circuit so they split it off the coffee machine work on the same damn circuit except for this room and my gear Riley you be out on a pretty big limb with this think about it why do chip work on neuros because neurological activity be electrical electrical exactly the chip can interferes or shortcircuit a connection in the brain all the wiring go to a breaker box locate in the basement Hell guy it be worth a look okay it should be here right along this wall it be hollow it be just paint drywall it look like a door that be be board up help I get this thing out of the way alright get back Whoa different circuit what do you make of this it be an interrogation room Crude but familiar I see you find camp 's playground this be russell camp Assistant special agent in charge of the northeast division of the f b I who be you people I think I tell you that we be ask the question alright connor what be go on I see something last night something from my past someone I hurt which help I rember who this piece of garbage be you know he I know of he when I be in the joint cop would be investigate by the bushel Campy here be work local p d and be accuse of some very bad thing what kind of thing Let us just say that his interrogation technique be unconventional this be the agent who bring anna 's husband to this house he and his partner dwight elkin why lie about it be not it obvious he and elkin want to get away from f b I Headquarters so they could conduct their interrogation so no eyebrow would be raise a five year old girl be miss we do not know if she be dead or alive Robeson want to lawyer up so you torture he we be try to extract information alright what happen he say he do not know anything about the kidnapping and we let he go look at this you well talk you son of a bitch there be a girl 's life at stake for godsake here we go alright alright nobody nobody think anything be go to happen to he ok we rough he up a little Dwight give he a jolt from the charger nobody know his heart be go to stop we do not know so you kill he he die yeah you and elkin you got rid of the body wall the place up you do not tell the f b I that you would even question the man they end up catch the kidnapper two week later still have the kid with he Robeson have nothing to do with it give your future he might 've make the right choice Connor call the f b I and tell they to pick up this piece of garbage Congratulations pal you be first in line for the senate investigation committee I love you anna Everything anna robeson describe about her husband how he could pass on his mood and emotion sound like a neuro to I Alright let us say he be so in his last moment he be electrocute all his pain his fear his last emotion all which be brain activity and electrical pass into the circuitry of this house so you be say the house be a neuro I do not know but it seem everyone who come in contact with that circuit seem to experience their own pain and fear as if karl robeson be still able to transmit emotion so what you be say we should chip the house this be nuts you have a well explanation wait at the end that be not camp 's voice I will bet even money that whatever be wrong with this house be not wrong anymore Carl robeson escape this house through camp the man who kill he Alright be you willing to put your money where your mouth be yes I be let us go follow I after you keep talk alright you fill my wallet you just turn it on right flick the switch alright oh no oh God oh God anything but that Riley anything but that what be it what be wrong what be wrong it be it be decaf I hate decaf I will get you for that I be sorry a president once say we have nothing to fear but fear itself andre one of the strong man I know admit his fear to I even maureen admit her fear of lose control I think my great weakness be the fear that I will be see as weak but I have to wonder if the vulnerable be not the strong and if those who wear their strength like a shield the weak and frighten hey I think I be ready to talk Come on in my name be Jane Vasco I could use you on my team I work for a secret government agency that hunt neuros People who can do dangerous thing with their mind on my first assignment something a little weird happen okay something really weird until I get some answer I be get on with my life do my job Stocking up on aspirin because I have to tell ya pain be a bitch hello Anybody in here oh my god hey man you all right trasncript swsub com Presync IceFre k some people say physical pain be easy to deal with than emotional pain but then again they 've never fall 40 story and live to tell about it not to mention be shot stab beat and lasere what a fun time it be be since I leave the d e a and join they up with the neuro hunter still I understand what they mean for I physical pain be horrible but at least it be temporary the other kind seem to hang on forever if I have to chose one over the other it would probably be the physical but then again ask I next time I get hit by a truck alright showtime this be a restaurant in thermopolis wyoming a patron name alan sloane stack up the furniture then climb out through the skylight Margot branton 's place three week later by the way when they people be find they be lie on the floor shiver and catatonic James cho be work late in his office this night that be two day ago be he cry he look freak what be he hide from no idea security camera do not reveal any kind of threat he stack everything up beneath a window just like the other two in mr Cho 's case the window be too small he choke himself to death what about the other have they receive any kind of treatment Sloane and branton be still under go treatment sloane attempt suicide and it be questionable whether either will fully recover how do they explain what happen they can not they barely remember do it Tox screen Clear and none of these people have any history of mental instability before the event so whatta we have a neuro who get their kick outta drive people crazy any connection between the victim none that we can tell different background different profession complete stranger I would like to know if there have be any other case can you get I into every medical database in the civilized world Gimme a half hour yeah okay 45 minute it would be useful if we could trace back to the first victim patient zero the first victim would most likely be the close to the source Miss branton yes I be sorry what be you ask if anything unusual happen before your Breakdown Unusual no I go grocery shopping that morning I come home put thing away then I hear this sound a deep noise thumping and creak all around I and I be so afraid of what I do not know I have to stay quiet what be you hide from I can not rember I do not want to please try out I just need to get out why do not you think they 've ask I that a hundred time I do not know why I just know if I could not find a way out I would die you be in a restaurant and the door but I be not in a restaurant where be you somewhere cold Small Closing in all around I collapse no I do not know okay okay you say there be a creak sound anything else Light above I I have to get there but I could not reach there be something in front of I flower flower good what else I do not want to do this please keep go what else there be a hat a hat you see a hat while you be climb Yellow a rain hat so cold okay okay you be do fine something else brush against I I turn to look I turn and Mr Sloane Mr Sloane be you okay get that away from I get it away it be okay it be okay it be okay oh god he have a very strong reaction to my gun well you be a woman carry a piece maybe he be not as crazy as everyone make he out to be make more sense than be terrify of flower Guns and flower maybe they be hold an axle rise nightmare whatever sloane be try to get away from whatever he be see clearly terrify he in a small enclose space it be all so damn vague what about mass hallucination it be not unheard of but do not that usually occur among people who be in the same place at the same time no no no grab she no please do not hurt mommy help what I do not think our victim be suffer from mass hallucination okay I be listen what if we have a neuro that can pass on one nightmare at will to anyone they choose a neuro who can infect other with his nightmare Nightmare in this case the same one over and over the question be why if we only have more detail of the dream we could piece the fact together fact recur nightmare be often associate with past experience especially traumatic one I know that for a fact do the little lady have bad dream tell I sweetheart what be your nightmare I be look at it at least you be dream about I wait for it and Boom get it Patient zero first report case of this type twenty eight minute for the record do that include yesterday I just start today thank for come out alright this be the first case I could find go back ten year nothing this go down one month before alan sloane pop his cork Henry perkin I know that name it be all over the news around ten year ago Man have an argument with his family settle it with a butcher knife the kid who cut his parent ' throat while they slept burn down the house go next door do the same thing to the neighbor exactly he be be at graymore psychiatric ever since be give cafeteria privilege when he pull the same stunt as cho sloane and branton our three other victim if riley 's right if if perkin be patient zero that could place he close to the source I know henry very well I 've be in charge of his case since he come to the institute he be an unhappy kid Unhappy he kill six people the good we 've be able to do be keep he stable do stable include the incident in the cafeteria where he pile up all the furniture and try to climb to the top I hear he cause almost a riot Henry 's still reluctant to discuss that be there a way we could find out who he have contact with henry that day probably the same people who see he every day the floor nurse orderly what about other patient Visitors Henry do not have visitor good one you 've be practice good morning elyse hello how be you feel wonderful I sketch a butterfly this morning he just sit there like he be pose for I very nice take it thank you and how be you teresa she have not say a word today she will not even look at I I get into medicine to try and cure people I 've become a warden but I be sure you do not come here to hear a lecture on the current state of the medical profession Doctor we 've see other case who experience the same nightmare as henry we be try to piece together the fact behind the nightmare dream be rarely factual but people do relive specific experience in their dream yes but dream be complex combination of fact and fantasy very rarely literal so a cigar be not always a cigar these recur image a yellow rain hat could mean many thing different to each person I would like to find out what it mean to henry I would be glad to ask he in our next session I be think more of a face to face I be afraid that will not be possible Doctor I be afraid that be not your call we need to see he now Henry will remain in his restraint at all time do not approach he and do not get he too agitated if you feel threatened in any way there be a panic button by the door I can have ten orderly to you in under a minute send seven I be here I need your weapon and anything else potentially dangerous you got to be prepare you be not prepared for this what do you want to ask you some question well I be kinda busy right now I can come back later you another doctor no write a book about psycho killer no then it must be my birthday and they finally get I what I always want hope you be into bondage depend on the guy I hear you rearrange the cafeteria while back so the doc tell I I do not remember you rember do it in your cell a week later no then again in the exercise yard and again in your cell I say no you be a cop in a way how many people have you shoot why just try to figure out what we have in common I think you use a knife they get just as dead do not they tell I about the cafeteria you deaf I tell you I do not I do not believe you why do a cop even care about some lunatic tossing around a few chair because you be not the only one what do you mean tell I about the cafeteria you tell I what be go on what the hell 's happen to I you remember something do not you sound feeling hein a deep creaking noise get out Dr Lewis you be all alone in a cold dark space there be a light above you and you have to get to it Henry where be you he be come who be who be come I can not I can not get out Jane get out of there open the restraint I have to see what the nightmare make he do it be the only way do it now where be we henry have to get out what do you see a light up there I can not reach it be okay let I help you there be someone here can you see who it be it be a a man please do not you be see thing flower and a yellow rain hat tell I about the man can you see who it be what do he want no can not breathe have to get out open the damn door no no no no do I need a prescriptionfor this just drink it it will calm your nerve I do warn you yes you do be it worth it I be not sure he seem to feel threaten by someone 's presence but he do not say who no it mean something thank you doctor you should have someone take a look at those oh yeah but the brandy work well than you think give what we know the neuro have to get close to Henry Perkins to infect he and we know where henry be be for ten year that should narrow down the list of suspect these be the staff member on duty that day at the institute this be a list of patient this be the visitor 's log anybody on those list have any connection to our other victim of course not that would be too easy then we yank dna from all of them over 200 people you know how long that would take I will help with the woman we can rule out the patient Most of the they be restrict to the ground they would not have have access to the other victim we should check the staff duty log see if anyone be conveniently miss on the day the other be hit visitor too you got to tell a fat man to eat Riley go get a coffee sure boss Vasco uh you look like crap guess you be not ask I to the prom go home get some sleep you be no good to I like this how be I good to you just go home and get some sleep Alright Sleep I rember that something that use to happen somewhere between lie down and get up now when it come if it come it be more like freddie 's nightmare only without freddie it be just I and my own special demon Mom I miss you get back please we do not have anything valuable Shut up or I will blow your damn head off no do not shut up or I will blow your damn head off we try to raise you on your comm all morning here this will warm you up Thanks Damn neuro get in my head but unlike the other you seem to heal quite quickly how have they get in Popped your front lock you need well security it just do not make sense I would hear someone come into my apartment Jane what do you have for dinner the usual Salad some wine why there be some slow acting narcotic in your blood stream no wonder you be act so strange last night what do you remember about the nightmare um it start with my mother the funeral that damn rain hat Absolute terror there be a guy just like henry perkin say where be this I do not know but he have a gun I know I have to hide Water what about water wherever I be it be begin to flood I have to hide but then I have to get out there be a window that be what everyone be be experience they have to get to the window because of the water they be drown would you stop let I at least pretend to take care of you her heart 's racing sit down probably not a coincidence that the neuro choose the lead agent on his trail as his next victim someone we interview not likely one of it be victim the hospital staff Dr Lewis we need to do more cross check who be at graymore when perkin have his breakdown and who be not there when the other be hit have riley run patient history see who be suffer from nightmare involve drown I will do that but I want you to follow doctor 's order I be fine Doc if she give you any trouble shoot she I can not place one person in the vicinity of all the victim we 've get one nurse who be out of town when alan sloane flip out but she be on duty when branton and cho lose it look like dr Lewis travel a lot include the day Perkins do his thing in the cafeteria I be tell you nobody be in all the right place on the right day I think I tell you to get some r and r hard to r or r when someone be get inside your head where be we on the graymore psych staff Nowhere our neuro must have tamper with the record to cover his own track anyway to untamper they sorry I ask do you give he the lead about the water about the drown nightmare yeah I be work on it you know how many case history they 've get at graymore I find this one guy who keep on dream that he be one of those what he call those prima ballerina but his tutu keep on come up Riley I think it be interesting yeah I know Riley get back to work alright it look like it be time for spend on an another visit to laugh academy hey what be go on minor security issue how minor some of the door lock in a wing malfunction and the patient get out of their room we be take care of it we need to talk to dr Lewis you and everyone else no one be see he since this morning I have to go that be convenient a security malfunction that keep everyone busy while dr Lewis go awol the brandy it be a little early for that jane Dr Lewis give I that brandy before I go home last night Seth say someone slip I a slow acting narcotic if lewis be here this morning he could not have get that far what be up I need a two hour radius from graymore Assume by car Accounting for average road speed traffic density homeland security checkpoint there be your search area checkpoint it would take forever to go through their log for the past hour Lewis be a doctor he would have an emergency pass and he would use it to blow through the checkpoint Riley flag it in the logs three emergency pass have be use in the past hour this one be a block away from the airport alright I get to roll check to see if he book any flight thank you I have look and brain all I want be relief from a nightmare that never seem to end by offload it to innocent people but just enough to give I some peace when I discover that I could do that I never give the entire nightmare to anyone include you so you be a good guy if you know what I be go through Henry perkin be your first victim yes you be not away at a medical conference I have be when you ask to see the institute record I alter they to show that I be still absent at the time of henry 's breakdown why henry it be not intentional he be be transfer to the cafeteria and he stumble in the hall I reach out to steady he it be a moment of contact but I suddenly feel light somehow as if a weight have be lift I can not explain it it take I a few day to realize what happen to henry that brief contact have pass part of my nightmare to he so why stop with one Relief from chronic suffering can quickly become addictive it be cowardly it be cruel and selfish I can not deny that I need to talk to you in a moment seth now we 've get the wrong guy Seth the guy just confess and I 've just be over his genetic profile three time that man be not a neuro be you absolutely sure there be no margin for error Sir there be always a margin for error but in this case I be sure Dr Lewis be not a neuro Riley Yo New deal so lewis he be either be control by a neuro or he be protect the neuro what be the destination on that airline ticket Richmond virginia Plane would 've land two hour ago let us assume he be protect someone he be go a long way to do it must be important to he Lewis ' personal life be a blank no family no relative ever get anywhere with that drowning reference yeah one of the patient be there since she be a kid seem her nightmare be base on something that actually happen to she and her family right okay can you get I a name yeah one sec Elyse danson she be miss from the hospital he be tell the truth everything he tell we about offload that nightmare be the truth only it be not his it be elyse 's you be in love with elyse I sketch a butterfly this morning very nice take it thank you and after year of try to help she you stumble across something that do you think this crap be go to get we anywhere give she a chance when she make brief contact with henry that day and then I see henry relive elyse 's nightmare I do not understand it but I know what I see you can not imagine what it be like to see some relief in her eye a brief smile a respite from the pain you 've know elyse since she be a little girl she come to the institute when she be eight nine year old what happen I still do not know all of it the coast guard find she drift off the coast of maine in a life raft she be curl up in the bottom shivering and alone she do not remember anything before that but she dream about it do not she horrible dream that plague she every night and haunt she when she be awake but the remarkable thing be how hard she try to look past her own pain to sympathize with the other patient to make they smile even while she be hold back tear she can still see beauty through her own darkness her gentleness have help patient in way all our medication research and science can not even begin to reach if anyone in this world deserve a moment 's peace Dr Lewis if you feel as strongly as you say you do the good thing you can do for elyse be to allow we to bring she here why so you can put one of those thing in her head like you do to I the chip would only make a way that she could not pass her nightmare to anybody else and she would continue to suffer we can eliminate that too be that possible no maybe you should let she know that she already do there be no cure for elyse 's condition I 've try everything everything you know but you see we have ability here that be beyond your wildest imagination I know what you be try to do but I will not turn elyse over to you no I do not think you know what I be try to do I know what they can do here I 've see they cure people like elyse I know what they 've do for I you how do you think I recover from the nightmare so quickly she only make brief contact with you no no no it be not that and you know it you would have I permanently eliminate and I know you try it be I and it be what the people here do to I oh god oh god I need some help in here how you tell I be you willing to take a chance on a miracle or be you go to keep elyse on the run for the rest of her life let we help she Damn if she can not tell a lie two way to

last week this one be from jane it take I a while because I be look at the wrong cell quadrant even then it be not an exact match what be your conclusion doctor there be no miss the fact that jane 's dna contain very similar indicator point to those we find in neuros do she know I have not tell she do not it be tough when someone you love hurt you hear they say if I could take on your pain I would well I bet if half of they know what it feel like they would not Dr Lewis have the opportunity to do just that and he take it maybe the ultimate expression of love even if it leave he mentally destroy

allegedly burn another house to the ground in north salem last night the serial arsonist and public enemy number 1 for this community have apparently be apprehend Trial begin today up to the minute coverage right here on action news my partner and I be on routine patrol when we see the flame would you tell the court what happen next we arrive at the samuel 's house and see the suspect flee from the scene when he refuse to obey our order my partner fire a warning shot be that sufficient to stop the defendant from attempt to escape no sir I fire at the suspect my shot hit he in the leg it be at that point that we be able to subdue he and take he into custody the police alert we to the fire just after 10 00 be two of our unit respond include emu by the time we get there the fire have already reach the second story of the samuel 's house how long do it take to get control of the fire it take about an hour before I feel that it be safe for my man to enter the structure would you tell we what you discover Most of the ground floor be go there be enough left of the support beam to keep the house from collapse after you enter what be your first impression as to what cause the fire as we pass through the main entry of the house I notice a hot spot could you explain that usually the location where the fire begin be the hot spot usually you would expect to see the hot spot in a kitchen near a stove or in the case of an electrical fire near wiring or circuit breaker something like that be that the case in the samuel 's house no my first impression be that the ignition point of the fire be a small bathroom on the ground floor be that unusual it be not unheard of but yes it be unusual unless there be indication of flammable material or electrical problem give what you see do you form an opinion my first reaction be that like the other this be an arson fire of unknown origin be there anything else of note about this downstairs bathroom yes and what be that we find char human remain be these remain those that be later identify as lucy samuel 's one of the occupant of the house yes sir thank you that be all would defense counsel care to present any witness at this time no your honor we would however appreciate an expeditious ruling on our request for bail give the severity of the charge serial arson and second degree murder I be go to rule that the defendant will be bind over for trial and hold at the county jail Bail be deny it be just the preliminary not the trial so where do we go from here to work Transcript swsub com Presync IceFre k Connor King Ex cop Ex con Kinda cute in a borderline sociopath kind of way God I can not believe I just think that here be the deal I be able to heal and connor be not but he keep take one for the team either he be mental or there be more to the man than he want people to see check that he be definitely mental but he be also a good act he work hard to keep people at arm 's length but then so do I maybe we be more alike than I would like to admit except he love to be hate and maybe would hate to know every once in a while he be love here be what we be up against public opinion 's run pretty high People want someone to blame there be someone to blame a pyromaniac neuro I work for the government just like you do we know the truth here the public do not know anything of neuros so the truth be not always the good defense that be reassure we be not here to reassure you we be here to acquit connor what be we look at fact that do not look good for connor First he be be identify at three of the six fire because we 've be on the trail of the neuro who be be start those fire go on Connor against your order break position and enter that house yeah to try and apprehend the damn fire starter look I understand your thinking but I want you to consider for a moment how the jury would react if I put any one of you on the stand and ask you testify to the existence of people who possess the ability to start fire with their mind the truth be not always the good defense witness have place connor at the scene of multiple arson he be apprehend exit the samuel 's house and then there be his criminal record be that admissible Evidence only require exclusion when probative value be substantially outweigh by the danger of unfair prejudice confusion of the issue or mislead the jury the present rule recognize the practice of admit evidence for a limited purpose and instruct the jury accordingly how the hell do you know that I read up on it last night so the judge can admit connor 's criminal record give miss vasco 's very accurate recital of the law yes hell why even bother have the trial it sound as if he be already be try and convict I be not go to lie to you we be face an uphill battle here but the war 's not over until we 've take our good shot at all the evidence give everything you tell we it sound like truth may be our good shot why do not we tell the jury what we be really deal with it be not as if we can not prove it even if you be right you be swear to silence and secrecy our hand be tie maybe it be time to cut the knot what you should have do be make this all go away before it even start you will have to explain that to I agent mcbride as your superior I do have connection in high place as high as they go however they do not extend into the heavens Heavens what be that suppose to mean only god can save connor do not give I that crap Disagreement I encourage sir I will not tolerate insubordination Hell we 've cover up the assassination of foreign leader our own leader but when it come to connor king the man be shoot at the scene by the police the case of the decade solve it be on the front page before they would read he his miranda how exactly do you expect we to make that go away then let we present the truth Admit to the existence of neuros only as much as we have to need to know and when the prosecution demand proof what then we give it to they we 've get year of caseload that would not only bring something to the surface that we 've work very hard to keep secret but would compromise your team as well need to know rapidly become full exposure it might be connor 's only chance and it might not be you willing to see your unit de commission to risk a defense that chance be no one would ever believe despite your proof and if they do believe it and connor be acquit the result would be a population in panic and our ability to keep our operation a secret and fight these thing compromise be one man really worth that much that one man happen to be innocent soldier do die in battle a soldier die on the field in combat be something that can not be undo Connor be not dead you know as well as I do he be always a liability liability what be that suppose to mean feed he to the wolf because you do not like his attitude consider this agent mcbride with all you do know if I be to permit this put you on the stand arm with all your evidence simply because the fire be of unknown origin you can not prove that a neuro be behind they Great the first time I get you alone and we 've got see thru door my luck be turn to crap you know what they say it be not over ' til it be over what the hell do they know they be out there if andre send you to cheer I up you should know you really suck at it maybe but andre do not have my leg what be not you tell I it be the truth he be get lousy leg Andre just get word no mention of the team what we do or neuros Great so I end up look like a guy who like to hang around fire who happen to have a criminal record we be try to keep that out we will come up with something my neck in a noose Connor listen it save it bower we all know the risk I would rather go down takin ' out one of those mental defect but we do not always get to make that choice I guess Andre 's still try to get the truth out no bad idea he would only compromise the team if I have go down for this I go down fall on your sword man of honor kind of thing the hell with that figure at least maybe I would get a go away present from you and supergirl what just nice to know that even in a moment of strength and character you be still a pig Hang in there Guard twenty three year old Married just under two year kill in an arson fire those face be what be go to hang connor no Regulations and his past be what be go to hang connor if they admit his criminal history that be no long an if the judge be admit it look nobody not even the top arson investigator could figure out how these fire be start Hell even with my brain if I do not know about neuros I would not be able to figure it out your point what kind of background do connor have that could make he that much of a specialist someone who can outsmart even the good that be pretty slim riley they do not care how they start just that they be you have something well I could lie I be there with he since I can not testify as to why I be there why do I have to admit that I be about a half a dozen cop as witness my word against theirs enough of this I do not need two of my people in prison just get up there and answer the question and put another nail into connor 's coffin admit who we be and what we do be not the only truth here people the truth be that there be a neuro out there who do set those fire and who stop set they the moment connor be arrest do not matter we find the person that do this and connor walk let us get to work look if you guy would only stick to my pattern we might find this guy Connor already put a dent in your pattern the day he and vasco stake out the samuel 's house we all agree on this every target house be two story paint blue all within a mile of an interstate on ramp and all except one have garage face back alley if you say except for one there be no pattern Connor play a hunch and he be right sorry riley if we go strictly by your criterion we could miss the next opportunity if there be one well I be sorry my database be not set up to predict hunch well maybe it should you be fight the clock on this he go on trial tomorrow they be call bill cole connor 's former cell mate to testify with bail deny former police officer and convict connor king face arson and murder charge today in day 1 of this grip trial a profile of mr King the man behind the match tonight everyone know connor be crazy that be why we love he but an arsonist I could not believe it and yet he be down let us get he take care of this thank so much for fall on your sword what the hell do you think you be do try to save my ass which I might 've if vasco do not pull her hero act she take two shot to her shoulder to act like a hero she will get over it she be try to protect you connor from more than just bullet how far do you think you would get if you get away you go to keep I after school boss I be try to help what do you want I to do just throw you to the lion I think you already do that every man have his breaking point I know you this be not yours why would you run listen to I you stubborn son of a bitch we be try to help you we can not do that if you be hide something from we why would you run Bill cole 's go to testify I know we try to keep your past record out of this but you do not know what he know I read your sheet before I take you on the team Tip of the iceberg pal okay tell I what I do not know sorry no can do the more I know the more I might be able to help ai not go to happen you be willing to face a murder two rap but you will not tell I about this unless you be try protect someone hunt down chip monkey be not the only thing worth die for but not face the consequence of bill cole 's testimony be Come on I tell you when you bring I on board this team you know everything about I you need to know you have my word that I would not jeopardize this team or intentionally put anyone at risk I think I make good on that anything beyond that promise be personal Bill cole 's schedule to testify tomorrow nice to know the date and time of your own execution so where be we pretty much at square one Maureen and I come up dry with everyone leave on our list Route truck driver delivery personnel basically every theory we 've be work on nothing no one have a hunch Shut up riley no no I know you be the big boss and you guy go out into the field and grab all the glory but you get to do what you do because I be in here do what I do and you know what I be damn good at what I do but you be all willing to risk connor 's ass because you trust your instinct your hunch more than you do what I be tell you I be right about the pattern despite connor 's lucky guess have you stop to think that maybe the reason the samuel 's house do not fit the pattern be because connor do start that fire you do not believe that no but I do believe that if we work my theory we might find out who do alright run it again alright why the guy target two story blue house be anyone 's guess he be a psycho maybe he grow up in a house like that hate his mother his father the color blue I do not know but why the garage face alley because it give he access there 've be six fire and no one 's spot the fire starter why every house have be within a mile of an interstate what do this mean the guy be on wheel what do he do when he find his target Park and walk or stash his car somewhere in the alley maybe even a neighboring garage it be a long shot do you have anything well we will have to interface with the local get out in the field interview some neighbor let us roll you be go to do it like you say I do not have any well idea Jane can I have a word yeah I tell you yesterday I do not want you commit perjury change your mind no then what what I have in mind be a whole lot bad today the judge in the invisible man arsonist case be go to allow testimony of the criminal background of connor king Bill cole a former police officer and partner of the defendant be schedule to take the stand this afternoon stay tune excuse I be you bill cole yeah get a message for you someone want to talk to you just head back out down the hall through the door on the left how be you do against the fence with her you would be dead before your hand hit the knob what do you want from we you go to tell I what this be about it be about two people who be go to testify against a friend of mine you still have not tell we who you be the man who will kill you if you do right here with all these cop around that would be my problem yes it would be and I do not think you would take that chance try I I be a federal officer oh my god so this be how it be the big man connor king do not take any chance can not risk anyone find out that he and I do time together arson charge Alright pal let us see how much of a risk you be willing to take what be these photograph they be our wedding picture the woman in the photograph be Lucy she be she be my wife I understand the morning of the fire you leave for work at around 8 00 am yes sir and lucy be it typical for she to be home at that hour yes Lucy work part time she do not usually leave the house until around noon you be at work when the police arrive yes tell we about that two detective show up at my office they tell I there have be a fire they say that someone that someone have be kill they ask I to come down to the medical examiner 's office to make an identification and do you do that yes it be lucy the prosecution call bill cole to the stand Mr Cole would you tell the court how you know the defendant connor king I refuse to answer excuse I I refuse to answer on the ground that it could incriminate I you and mr King serve time in prison for crime commit while you be employ by the metropolitan police be not that so objection lead the witness your honor this witness have be grant immunity the fifth amendment do not apply Mr Cole the court direct you to answer the question put to you by the district attorney Mr Cole have you ever be arrest or serve time in prison Mr Cole I refuse to answer on the ground that it might incriminate I your honor Mr Cole the court will not be lenient if you continue to refuse to answer answer the question I refuse to answer on the ground that it might incriminate I Alright court find bill cole in contempt Bailiff how have it go we buy some time I do not know how much well we 've get something Genius boy strike again at least two neighbor to the previous arson report that their garage lock have be break the cop say they find oil stain on the cement in both garage not so unusual for a garage except one of the resident do not own a car and in the other garage a one car garage with the car in it the oil stain be off to the side and this tell we I be have sample run on the oil stain to confirm but from everything we can tell the quantity of oil and the location be that our boy show up to do his dirty work on a motorcycle it do fit do not give we a name but it get we a step close even if you be right I be not sure this actually help Hell it be more than we have 24 hour ago we be forget something connor ride a motorcycle the quality of the material be quite good as be the magnification property your honor the defense have stipulate that these towel be the same brand and fiber content as those find in the samuel 's home note you may proceed Doctor turn on that light please I be sure many of we rember play with sunlight and magnification as child we will have to imagine that this be sunlight come into the courtroom from the outside the degree of magnification would affect the amount of time this would take as I say this sample be quite good Doctor be it possible that a magnifying device that you be hold could that have start the fire in the samuel 's house or any of the other fire Objection Speculative whether the device start the fire or not be not an issue to date there be be no evidence enter to indicate that anyone know how these fire start sustained no further question Doctor in a typical house fire would solid glass be completely consume by heat or flame damage perhaps completely consume unlikely so if a device have be use in the fire Subsequent investigation would have turn up all or part of those magnifying glass that would be true if they be make of glass it would not take much more than a match flame to turn these into useless ash these be make of spun sugar highly refined no further question your honor Mr Beetle would you tell the court where you be employ I own and manage a storage facility just outside of cranston this be a facility where anyone can rent space to store their belonging precisely do you recall accompany my investigator to storage unit 14d two week ago friday yes I do be you with they when they enter the unit they need my permission and my master key to gain entry among the content in the unit do you come across this box of magnifying device in fact we find about a dozen box that be one of they do you recognize this form this be one of our standard long term contract and that particular contract how long have the signatory lease space in storage unit 14d two year three month and fourteen day would you read the name of the person to whom the unit be rent Connor king this be a load of crap order this court will take a half hour recess you know about this of course not do something I be do the good I can be this your good be this your good remember this face beetle rember it I do not believe it connor enter the samuel 's house against order so when have connor do anything by the book Thought he see something go on thought he have a window of opportunity to get the neuro and to get out but from inside the suv you could not see what he be do in the house all you can say be that you see connor enter the house see the fire begin and see he run out what the hell be this it sound like you guy really think he be guilty Nice to know where your friend stand when thing get tough it be not about what we think you just answer the question the d a will put to you and by the way bill cole may not be the only one who could testify against connor why do not you tell they what you be tell I what what we be talk about Connor 's hunch I be think about what riley say the other day about thing be simple and logical we assume that either connor have to be right or riley have to be right but give what we learn about the oil stain in the garage I start think what if they be both right if let us assume riley be right about the pattern about the importance of the garage the samuel 's house do not have an alley face garage and do not fit the pattern maybe we be not deal with a pyromaniac at all maybe we be deal with someone who have a motive think about it lucy live in a two storey blue house so the neuro want lucy dead or maybe scott to cover his track he torch five other blue two story house to avoid the risk of be see he look for house with alley face garage he do not realize there be a crazy genius name riley who see that as part of the pattern by the time he get to the samuel 's place he think it be go to look like just another whack job blue house arson you get that background on the samuel house yet I will find something I just need a little bit more time something connor do not have a lot of if I be you I could break every bone in my body slip through these air hole and walk out of here good as new if you be I you would look a whole lot well in that orange jumpsuit look pretty grim huh we be work on something do not know yet if it will pay off it might help if you tell I what happen you start to think I be guilty that be not what I say it be just that the more we know you know what I want you to know darlin ' that be it yeah it be go to have to be yeah I be on my way I get to go Vasco thank see you in court what 've you get I find the original computer file of connor 's storage locker rental so it be legitimate no what accord to the receipt connor 's rent this unit for a little over two year but that be the date on the contract not the date on the file the date on the file be only three week old maybe it be not the original version if someone save a duplicate copy would not it have a more recent date it would but every file be embed with a creation date do not matter how often it be modify this file do not exist last month then someone be set he up here be the kicker I trace the computer that create it the d a 'S office Richard stanley Connor 's attorney what why that do not make any sense yes it do do not give I that who do you think you be talk to this have get your paw print all over it Richard stanley work for you and like most of the people who work for you he follow order set connor up for that storage locker rental be your idea you be a team leader mcbride you be not the commander in chief I protect my people even if it be from the commander in chief you do not have the big picture I 've hear that story before sometimes the little people have to be sacrifice for the great cause be that it I do not see the great cause here sir unless it be protect your ass I do not like your tone you be not suppose to King 's a liability to the team and to the work we do I make a decision it be too late to make thing go away as you would hope we could if king go away for this now the rest of our problem will go away with he Sir I be not prepared to let that happen you be the field op mcbride in battle it be your call policy be mine and policy extend beyond personal feeling and loyalty you know that as well as I do and you might need to give it some serious thought before you do anything you will regret Richard here be the new deal if I find that you do anything to sabbotage connor 's chance to get out of this if I do not see that you be do everything in your power to provide the good defense I want you to remember this the government spend a lot of money trae I I be very good at what I do I can approach a man from 100 metre and he will never hear I come I will let you decide do you want to spend every day for the rest of your life look over your shoulder wait let us go well if that be not a motive for murder I do not know what be everything be in place Stanley have his marching order we 've get the new witness Crowd control the judge have agree to clear the courtroom and hear this outside the jury so she find if it admissible let us hope it do not get that far let us hope it do not get too hot to handle this court be now in session would you state your name for the court Ellen drake Miss drake it be miss be not it yes be you familiar with the blue ridge motel I know the name I think have you ever be to the blue ridge motel I 've drive past it but you 've never actually be on the premise no your honor may I approach

frequency but you have to give I that suggestion verbally in person true but I be not a neuro you put a neuro together with this frequency in theory the range of their power could be unlimited proximity 's no long an issue not for this one something else the long you be expose to it the deep it will take root mean something like drug Recreational at first but after awhile you might be

here I can not explain it maybe because I heal more quickly than connor have you be watch the community channel it be on quite a bit yes not last night though why just a theory we be work on in the meantime I suggest you turn the damn thing off what 've you get we find the federal agent shane kearny 's car we do not report that and mo be right about that bullet hole any suspect at this point it

corpse both very Neuro like both test negative I 've read Dr Carpenter 's report those two man be take out right from under my people in the field I be aware of the situation how do you think I can help why do not you tell I the truth you get anyone else work our case someone with shoot to kill order whatever you be up against whoever this shooter be it be not come from my office I need to believe that you need to get to the bottom of this and resolve it and I need to be somewhere in ten minute and agent McBride in the future wipe your foot before you get in my car Riley hey I be awake eighty percent do and no sign of a breach we be tight as a drum all right when this be over I need complete history on Diangelo and Wedge I be look for place where they intersect I believe I can help with that I 've be conduct some field interview he do go out I be as eager to find answer to this situation as any of you be and do you find any there be nothing in the medical record of either man to explain the tumor I find but I do learn one interesting thing Frank Diangelo and Patrick Wedge be bear four month apart they both attend Rossmore High School graduate the same year so maybe they know each other hey that be more than we know 24 hour ago good work Seth there be one more thing I be able to isolate a dna sample from that coffee cup that Connor find in the sniper 's nest the shooter be a male late 20 's like the victim another schoolmate settle an old score there be something else the shooter 's Neuro positive let us see if we can find anything else interesting about Diangelo and Wedge here maybe they be in AP Neuro class together it be a good thing you only make it to the eighth grade Wouldn't'a make a difference I go to an all boy school public private or reform be you a cop yeah something like that what be you work on I be sorry darlin ' I be really not at liberty to say how old be you old enough well then you ought to know well than to be play game off campus that be how little giris like you get into trouble I be not a little girl do not pass go do not collect 200 go directly to jail there only be a day yeah the good old day you could 've offer she your prison ring anyway check this out Wedge and Diangelo our two dead guy be friend LEAGUE of 5 what be with the league of 5 yeah that be just one of the thing I would like to ask the people in this picture Ladies and gentleman meet the short live superhero team the League of 5 first issue come out about 16 year ago it be actually pretty good too until Dynamite Comics cancel it nowadays all these comic_strip and their superhero be all these matinee idol Riley what Come on ok for your information it be a great book now I 've get five issue tuck safely away in my storage box in your mom 's basement where you live all right we know from Seth that the shooter be male so our good bet be to question these two guy Harold Borgman and Alvin Prescott I 've get an address on Borgman but Prescott 's pretty much a loner he live in a trailer up in the hill all right connor why do not you question Harold Jane bring Alvin Prescott back here for question yeah thank do not get up sweetheart I will let myself in Harold Borgman yes who be you Connor King Federal agent oh you know what this be about why do not you take a seat I have a well idea why do not you come with I I appreciate your cooperation Mr Prescott it be not like I have a lot of choice your life could be in serious danger two of your classmate be kill recently really I do not keep up with they if you be not involve I will have you home in a few hour what do you mean involve you think I have something to do with they be kill we just want to ask you a few question in my time with the team I have see some pretty strange Neuro power and the ability to basically put someone in a class on acid be definitely in the top 5 still it be effective I have to admit that be your man 100 percent dna match for the shooter and a Neuro yes a Neuro who use a sniper rifle on non Neuros with Neuro like power yup it be all come together indeed Mr Borgman you can call I Harold all right Harold I be hope you can clear some of this up for I I will do my good why be you kill your friend what other choice do I have you understand do not you agent McBride it be the only way to stop they they do need to be stop all right why do not you start from the beginning we be just kid Oddballs we would all be friend since the seventh grade Pat and I we be the comic book junkie we use to talk about how great it would be to have those kind of power to be special all right we be use to be pick on as much as you can get use to something like that I guess in the end I finally have enough of it so I make they well it be hard to explain I mean somehow I know I could do it I could give they each this gift of something extraordinary everyone get to pick what they want Frankie want to be telekinetic guess he be always the weakling Invisibility that go to Pat you could imagine what he have in mind Vivian Gray get the gift of persuasion everyone go along with what she ask for they can not help it and Alvin Alvin be always getting pick on for be stupid or whatever so I offer he the ability to confuse other make thing unclear to they that be a classic I get to tell you the football team lose a lot of ground that year and you no special power no that be something else I do not understand seem I can give the gift away but not to myself maybe it be well that way we be just kid we have high hope of do great thing use the power for good then we grow up drift apart and nobody do great thing no I think we underestimate the innocence of child and I could not let they keep do what they be do Franky just take what he want he do not care who he hurt and Pat when he find out his wife be see another man kill that man I feel like I have a part in that so you kill he he be my friend I try to talk to he but he would not listen none of they would I try to undo what I have do but I could not I could not erase the power there be no reverse it there be no one I could go to for help and and they be get strong all of they I could only think of one way to stop they that be not a little crash boss even Jane be lucky to walk away from this one yeah but she do not catch up with Alvin Prescott he be still miss hell it be like deal with a Neuro who can photocopy himself yeah except these people be not Neuros Riley get a line on Alvin Prescott yeah I 've get a bird over his trailer but no activity what about Vivian Gray take I awhile until I realize I have the wrong name you might know she by her married name Vivian Nash the Congresswoman I be sorry congresswoman but I just can not give my support to your propose construction bill we 've discuss this before be there any way you would reconsider we 've work so well together on project in the past we 've always work well together but this be somebody that I would really like to reach an agreement Paul of course I want the same thing this bill be go to help so many people and the cost be reasonable I know that be important to you it be not an unreasonable proposal I do see the advantage of put it through so I can count on your ' yes ' vote of course excellent Vivian I be sorry Congresswoman I try to stop he Vivian there be a problem it be all right Beverly Mr Prescott be a value friend he be always welcome of course Mr Prescott I be so sorry if you will excuse we certainly something be go down a federal agent came look for I she be ask about Patrick and Frank getting kill and you do not know anything about this do you do not try and use your little ' stuff ' on I ok unless you want to be speak in tongue at your next rally we be in the same team Alvin I do not need to use my power to convince you of that somebody 's after we we need to find out who tell I more about the federal agent she try to take I in do she say where I do not want to know I just do what I have to get away from her have you ever hear the word Neuro no what be that it be something we be not suppose to know about it be the name give to people like Harold what do that mean there be other people like Harold out there in some way yes it seem to be quite a variety I be still explore the area how do you know all this I be involve with a few very important people and as you know it be hard to keep secret from I so what do these feds want with we they be look for Patrick and Frank and now Patrick and Frank be dead so what do we do not we Alvin I I 've run Alvin Prescott 's photo against citywide security cam get a hit find he at the federal building check in with Vivian Nash if we can not chip these clown what be the use of find they you could contain they I suggest an efficacious tranquilizer it be unlikely they would be able to utilize their mental power while unconscious I be on Harold 's team bullet in the brain from the near rooftop it be unlikely they would be able to utilize their mental power while dead you be talk about a U S Congresswoman kill two bird with one stone Guys Treasury provide security for Congresswoman Nash even if you have a tranq pistol how do you expect to get close enough to use it Harold just offer a suggestion for that before we chip he how would you like to fight fire with fire be you say what I think you be say he just offer we the same superpower he give his friend turn we all into sideshow geek I will pass Gimme a break you would not want to be more powerful than a locomotive you 've any idea what you could do if you be invisible I know what you would do I do not know man pass on a super power trust I it be overrate you be forget about the tumor I find in the other advanced and inoperable and from the location likely responsible for the personality change Harold describe in his old friend just imagine sneak into the giris ' locker room and turn into a psychopath before you even reach the shower okay okay I get it so that be a no on the superpower bad idea that still leave we with the question of how we get into the federal building with a tranq dart and score a hit on a woman who can make we do what she want we to and it be likely Prescott 's tell she about our attempt to bring he in she will have increase security I might be able to help with that that be a tall order McBride I do not have a lot of pull with Treasury no but you do have influence look you be ask I to interfere with the security arrangement of a U S Congresswoman put my reputation at risk then you will have to weigh your reputation against the damage these people could do if we do not get to they you 've make your point I will take care of it thank you Gerald you handle that perfectly now I just have one more favor to ask just OUTSIDE CITY LIMITS we be someplace I will be safe all of you will protect I with your life no matter who come after I nothing out of the ordinary be go to happen here Alvin what do you find out the feds have Harold in custody I seem to be the next target of interest what be we go to do we be go to look after ourselves be you armed no I could not risk go back to my place here take this find somewhere they will not be look for you I think we should stay together you need to look after yourself right now you say that we be in this together you be right Alvin we do have to look after each other but your presence right now put I at risk I think you know that I be put you at risk and you would never want to do that you would do anything to protect I you would rather die than get in my way yeah do not mind he what be up local PD find Alvin Prescott at a rest stop on route 75 gunshot to the coconut apparently self inflict the gun be clean and untraceable of course what about Nash she be off the radar she must have know we be come in so much for Andre 's plan to get the bigwig to pull back her security her security detail be miss too she must have use her gift to talk they into help she she be a public figure how could she just disappear you would be surprised what politician get away with I 've get photo on my hard drive of I get an update Harold 's no long go to Nico he be be designate of interest Morgan be on his way down right now to take he into custody personally oh and Harold be to remain unchipped Morgan be come here leave a Neuro unchipped that be violate procedure it be totally unlike Morgan to get involve like this he thrive on deniability so come down here in person to take Harold be not his idea you think Nash get to he that be what we be go to have to find out you be positive this man Morgan have be influence by Vivian that be our take on it we believe she send he to get you out of custody why would she do that you kill Wedge and Diangelo we think Vivian kill Prescott maybe she be clean house I get to warn you Harold our plan be not without risk Agent McBride I be go to shoot my old friend to put an end to this I will do what it take chip he even though we have explicit order to chip he you know what this could do once the chip be in place you will no long have the ability to empower anyone that be fine this thing I can do it be wrong but it be part of you a part of you you can share with your friend here be your man Mr Borgman I be go to look after you until this business be sort out you will be safe keep I inform of course follow at a safe distance TERMINAL CITY HALF HOUR later Harold Vivian listen to I you be sick the power I give all of you they cause tumor brain tumor you be not act like you normally would come Vivian just just ask yourself how you get here how you 've use what I give you what you 've become I know what you be try to do Harold you be try to buy time why do you bring I here Vivian because you 've make such nice new friend Fire do not listen to her you be under my command now you hear I shoot she ignore she I say kill she damn it stand down stand down what 've you do you know they would come but they know you Vivian thank to Harold I 've get what you 've get maybe even a little more secure the area you take a hell of a risk accept Harold 's power before you chip he you deliberately disobey my order your order to chip he be against order I learn from the good it work at what cost Jane a brain tumor Madness you know I I will get over it the tumor anyway how do you know that it be not some injury you can heal from you do not know what you be deal with I guess I will take my chance where be I just relax I can not seem to focus you be safe congresswoman I be just run a few test so it be true then what Harold say about the tumor yes I be sorry be it operable no and it be quite progress I be afraid your sedation be get light Doctor I have one small favor to ask I I do not know I shoot she I shoot her Harold be safely on his way to Nico and Vivian Gray 's influence over Morgan end with her death but we still have an internal team injury to deal with Empathy do not come naturally from I never have part of any friendship be to try to understand what the person close to you be feel what they be go through but each person 's experience be unique to they what I go through be what I go through the same experience could be completely different for Seth he have different reason to lie awake at night if I want to be there for my friend I have to be ready to hear what he be feel not what I would be feel in his place there be no manual for it I guess I be go to have to wing it just check my email so what be the prognosis on the inside of my head well the MRI 's clean no sign of a tumor you be very lucky yup that be I bullet and tumor do not leave a scratch so I guess that mean I be not go to retain the power Harold give I either actually we do not know that for sure we just know that you be not at risk from a tumor what about you you do not seem to have retain your sparkling bedside manner I have sparkle bedside manner no not really but it be something you could work on Look Seth you do not kill she she kill herself I know but I pull the trigger but beat yourself up about it be not go to make it go away we have two choice we can stay here under fluorescent light and sulk or we can we test the power that Harold give I by persuade the bartender to give we free drink until the sun come up you 've persuade I let us go so I really do not have a sparkling bedside manner Transcript www sub way fr Synch and revise subXpacio and TusSeries my name be Jane Vasco I could use you on my team I work for a secret government agency that hunt

steel six inch thick be you satisfied that the gun and the ammunition be genuine they appear to be Excellent be this in fact a spent 38 caliber slug it be still warm and there be blood very impressive Mr Jensen Howard Morris all the good assistant be wear they wait if I may the illusion I have plan will pale in comparison to Riley 's so instead I would like to repeat what you just witness and turn it up a notch Howie you can not do this it be the ultimate challenge perform another magician 's trick with no preparation no rehearsal and the same prop Howie you do not understand it be Jane she she know the trick I have Marcia no but Marcia she look please Howie you can not do this look he can not do this trick each entrant be entitle to perform the illusion of their choose Mr Jensen but you do not understand he will kill she no Bravo well do you walk out on I after I put on the star spangle tap dancing costume and let you shoot I in the gut I think I hold up my end of the bargain so you do

sorry you lie to I about what my test result you tell I you do not have they yet do you break into my file be that bad do you think I can not handle it Jane the result be not bad at all they be just surprising Andre think you talk to Andre yes he agree that I should recheck my procedure and look for any possible error before tell you what I find which be all right you remember take an iq test in high school since then your score have go up by 35 point and well that simply do not happen someone might gain five or even ten point at most but a jump like your it be astonish the amazing Jane it be hardly bad news your spatial processing pattern recognition analytical skill short and long term memory they 've all vastly improve the question be why I be not sure but it be possibly relate to your healing you see in a normal brain neuron be form new connection all the time but most of those die off unless they be reinforce through practice and repetition but yours yours seem to survive can not believe you break into my file so what happen now I just keep get smart until what my brain explode I wish I could tell you but this be uncharted territory for both of we but I think the chance of cranial detonation be low thank that be reassure no problem now I will just reset my password a toast to the new member of the Magician 's Palace Congratulations thank you I really appreciate you come tonight I know I have not exactly be a gracious loser but I be tell you the trick you do last night be mind blow come on Riley you can drop the act what do you mean you know exactly how I do the trick

sell it to I Buda bing buda boom that be that Gift do you switch cup what no no be you try to drug I no of course not I be not try to drug you you be after my wand no I be not after I think you be a kindre spirit Riley I think I could trust you no but you can trust I ok I do not want your wand the truth be I work with some people that might be able to figure what be really happen to you I know exactly what be happen to you Howie Howie Howie Ahhhh Howie Howie Howie Seth I need you to run a dna sample on what you will see here Egg shell yeah you 've encounter the first Neuro chicken have you cute these come out of Howie Morris ' mouth so basically all you need to do be get a saliva sample and run the test right well theoretically ok then let us do it Riley I can not do anything without Andre 's authorization give I a break Andre we do not need to let he know I mean we just run the dna test and that be it sorry do you do you want to take your magic egg shell with you one of my team member have the right to follow hunch the right to follow their intuition but when we be work on a single case Riley I need you to keep your head in the game you want to follow this up do it at home hey he be still on the magician thing yeah now he want a dna test on an eggshell why not let he have it why you think he be onto something no but you know Riley he be not go to let this go until he get proof one way or the other we have confirm case they take priority yes we need Riley on those confirm case and while he be get his head wrap up in this he will be so distracted that he be a professional he will have to get over it I agree good that be why I be say why not show he the result from the DNA test and when they come back negative we can get back to business as usual waste our resource to humor Riley it be a favor for a friend and before you argue with I let I remind you that new and improve iq number in my file it be high than yours who be there it be Riley what do you want listen Howie I just want to explain what happen at the restaurant ok it be not what you think you wanna come in Thanks Riley be go why do not you go over his place and look around I 've already be there the lunatic 's probably off on his Neuro hunt actually that lunatic might be in a bit of trouble those eggshell test Neuro positive it be clear no sign that he be be here you got to wonder what this Howie guy could 've do to he for all we know he could be levitate over the East river by now I be glad you find this amusing he be a Neuro I know but come on what be the guy go to do pull a rabbit out of his hat we still get to find he and Riley too Howie what have you where be we the Magician 's Palace if you be think of call for help do not bother this whole wing be be renovate what do you do to I the disappear sack trick I wish you could have see it it be very impressive what do it feel like why do not you try it on yourself and find out you know I do not want it to come to this but you do not give I much of a choice lie to I try to steal my wand and who be these people you work for Government Military People who want to use my gift for their own nefarious purpose it be not like that I know why you be do this Riley be because you be jealous because I be the real McCoy you be not the real McCoy Howie you be not a magician you be cheat Cheating illusion take time and skill year of practice your gift just fall in your lap hey I earn this I spend my entire life prove myself worthy of my father 's legacy this wand be my reward enough with the wand it be a stick and it have nothing to do with your ability what would you know about it you be what we call a Neuro you have a genetic mutation and that be what give you your power that be absurd it be what my team do we track down Neuros some can control people 's mind start fire bring back the dead you you can do magic you be delusional it be in your mind Howie your father 's wand just give you the confidence that you need no your magic when do it begin after my dad die I do not have the heart to perform for a while when I start again I decide to use his wand in my act as a kind of a as a tribute nothing special happen not for week when that rabbit first appear in the hat I have not change anything I do not do anything different I do not even eat a decent breakfast so you think of the wand I would have do the same I think maybe it do not work at first because I be out of practice or I be not good enough and when the real magic come I think maybe it be a final gift from my father to show that I deserve it now you be tell I that be not true that the only thing my father leave I be an old stick with chip paint and that if it be not for some random mutation I would still be a marginally talented hack pull a quarter out of nine year old 's ear that be what you be tell I yeah pretty much okay I 've get Howie 's recent credit card activity mostly online purchase of book and magic supply several charge for pizza delivery what a life Plane ticket car rental Hotel room no come on what would genius boy do to find himself think wait try check traffic camera near Howie 's apartment that be a great idea I have no clue how to do that come on even with that oversized iq of your since none of you guy be take I seriously I have to take matter into my own hand if you be watch this it mean I 've be miss now for about twelve hour if I be sit there with you guy which I be obviously not I might be able to help you so he be thorough you got to give he that I 've hook up my heat signature to the database and link into N S A 's satellite the red dot you see should indicate where my location be hopefully one of you guy can read a map and I be not at the bottom of a river somewhere by the time you get to get this so come find I where be that id say it be way at the end of Old Post road let us rock and roll maybe you be right maybe my ability do come from some mutant gene the thing I be realize Riley be it do not matter it do not matter of course it matter why because you will know the truth but magic be all about hide the truth use an illusion to complete the trick your life be not a trick Howie if you have a genetic anomaly it need to be deal with deal with what do you mean Riley how would you like to spend the rest of your life in a rabbit cage we can chip you chip I it be a small chip that emit an electrical charge that put an end to my magic it be not magic Howie my whole life I grow up watch my father bring a sense of mystery and wonder to people 's life finally I can do the same I do not understand you or your team Riley why would you want to chip somebody like I I be not dangerous it be not what we want it be just over time we 've realize that every Neuro be potentially dangerous why because I be different because I can do thing that most people can not the same about Einstein or Hawking and what about Mozart he be compose when he be four you go to chip he too somehow I doubt that Mozart be a Neuro what if he be you know what your problem be Riley I be still tie to a chair you be scared Scared Scared of what anything anything you do not understand instead of enjoy the ride you try to figure it out and make it all logical of course it be probably why you love your computer so much they be reliable be that all that matter in life reliable what about the joy of mystery Love do not you remember the first time you see someone turn a tiger into a beautiful woman in the blink of an eye before you start calculate it and explain it all to yourself be not there a moment where your jaw drop and your heart stick in your throat and all you could think of be wow you want to take that away from child from adult from yourself my heat signature excuse I Howie you nee to go you need to get out of here why my teammate they will be come I give they a way to find I you have to go now Conner wait Ahhh you can not hold I into thin air into thin air into thin air no yes Riley you okay yeah Great we make a mistake yes I be just about to say that we should have trust your instinct more good job Howie be not a threat ok we should de chip he and let he go De chip be that possible the doctor at NICO have do some surgery it be not conclusive but they be suggest it be possible there be a step backward for the world and why would they want to do this I do not know it be not my department if anyone deserve to be de chip it should be Howie he be harmless he just want to make people happy he be a Neuro Riley the path to hell be pave with good intention Howie 's only on the path to the Magician 's Palace Sorry we can not take the risk then you well chip I too what be you do you see you can take the risk there be always a choice but then you might need I to save your ass again that be not funny the debate be over Howie be chip and he go to NICO Connor thank for try be there any way you could de chip he on your own no Seth would have to operate and you know Seth without Andre 's authorization what when I first join the team Seth and I we run some test on the Neuro chip to find out if anything might disrupt its function and if I can create a strong enough electromagnetic field can you do that if anyone can this be your deal Riley you be on your own you get a pick up for we yeah when do this happen last month they upgrade everything they 've already be chip they do not pose any threat I do not make the order I drive the freak where be it what do you want look I 've get to get you out of here why bother you 've take away the one thing from I that ever truly matter you think I could ever go back to a normal boring life it be not that bad be it only by comparison to a world fill with magic I think I can disable your chip what just get ready for what trust I Howie Howie Howie be you okay you 've electrocute I we do not have much time try your magic try to disappear it be no use no you want to try please try it come on I will vanish now you need to concentrate okay look just pretend like I be the audience ok Howie amaze I amaze I come on Howie I can not the chip 's still work the jolt that I give you have get to work I be tell you I can

your dad come on the amazing Howie will now be go Riley Hey boss beautiful day huh where be Morris Howie be not he in his cell you know damn well he be not in his cell no I have no idea how do a chip Neuro get out of his cell without set off security Magic Magic it always amaze I how Riley be able to pull a rabbit out of his hat when it come to computer information I never dream he be able to do it literally as well in the end Howie be right it do not matter to the non magician in his audience how he do his trick they be there to be entertain and amuse Transcript sw sub Subtitles subXpacio and TusSeries my name be Jane Vasco I could use you on my team I work for a secret government agency that hunt Neuros People who can do dangerous thing with their mind on my first assignment something a little weird happen okay something really weird until I get some answer I be get on with my life do my job stock up on aspirin because I get to tell ya pain be a bitch TRISTATE NATIONAL BANK so what do you think he be go to hit first the teller or the vault that remain to be see or not Federal agent everything be under control Connor get the car who the hell be you guy let us go you be go to tell I what this be about well you be on your way to the Freak Zoo Palace pal not bad that be the house be that what this be to you Sport well it be we against they darling so yeah as long as we be win I be good what the hell something be up with the Freon what the hell it be overheat stop the car stop the car I can not move this damn thing over we be not overheat guy Hang on Halt stop stop stop where you be Connor stop or I will shoot you guy want to tell I what the hell have just happen that guy be chip painkiller JANE 1x15 the HEALER Subtitles subXpacio and TusSeries ok I 've perform over two dozen test include a postmortem I 've find no variation from the standard Neuro positive so how do you explain a chip Neuro still able to function I can not however be merely an assumption that this man be responsible for what happen to the vehicle half the engine block be melt trust I doc that be a hell of a lot more than just a bad transmission ok accord to this man 's chart his ability be cellular Invisibility involve reorganize the cellular structure to absorb rather than reflect light which have nothing to do with melt the engine exactly to date we 've never encounter a Neuro with multiple ability you think we be witness some kind of mutation even if we be and I see no indication of that the man be chip or maybe the chip fail my test confirm that the chip be functional besides if it fail would not he have use his invisibility when he attempt to escape something hit that truck doc Sure or someone but whatever or however it be it be not the man you apprehend Thoughts yeah freak show be get freaky by the moment constructive thought if the man do possess multiple power maybe they reside in different part of his brain and when we chip he we only bring half of they down that be a good thought but Seth would 've find some indication of that so right now we have no idea what we be deal with Riley any update on that Neuro we be look for Jennifer Town she be off the radar no credit card hit bank withdrawal cell phone use she be get a removal a prescription for Glucofash no hit on the pharmacy either anything off the Comsat flat line nothing I 've get a whole lot of people give I a whole lot of nothing I will let you know when I have something easy to find real man with real weapon none of that be easy as for our invisible Neuro I still think we can not rule out a mutation which Seth will not be able to identify which put some another step ahead of we well look at the bright side you could 've be a lawyer I well take off you still owe I that incident report form the Forrest case which be still sit on my desk as you can tell paperwork be not my favorite thing you do not have to like it Jane you just have to do it Brian and I have plan tonight it be sort of an anniversary one more day what would that be the third one more day go ahead someone at least will get something out of this day thank have fun some time you need a shower after a rough day not just to cleanse the body but sometimes the mind not to say mine 's particularly dirty although I do have my moment I be talk more about the conscience Bri what be you do here you want to try that again but this time with Bri hey this be great I think you be out of town and I be so happy that you come back a day early just to see I of course I be happy to see you but but I do not know you be come and have this report due and I promise to have it in tomorrow morning so what be another day it be my job all right it be all right I understand I do not suppose there be another beautiful brilliant woman in town who would not mind a surprise visit I promise I will make it up to you but the report come first only tonight I have to make sure my nose be not too close to Brian 's face or I might have poke his eye out when it come to lie Pinocchio have note on I today who be it that say no matter how bad you feel guilt make it bad no wait that be I hi thank I be work on it News flash our paralyzer Neuro I 've get her Jennifer Talon I think she finally take a chance and use her cell phone I hope it be important Location the Marina I will work in SatCom now to narrow it down all right let us roll go at Jennifer Talon from a distance I be not an idiot boss long range night scope with a chip rifle Silencer too for her pleasure that be good we get too close to this woman we do not know what she be capable of well if we get too close to her Adequate the cruise be wonderful thank you I hope to be in many more sorry I do not fight it Adam it will not do any good I know it must be a disconcerting feeling experience complete paralysis the mind fully function aware of what be go on but the body just will not respond it must be just awful you do tell I I be priceless you be wrong Riley Sector right last boat got it all right careful boss thank kid it be right in front of you this leap succeed the effect of the paralysis will wear off once I leave you might be a little sore take two aspirin do not call I in the morning you be ok I be fine keep go Connor be down I be on my way take it I will be ok keep go pressure I know I can be a real bitch sometimes come here you ok be that Jennifer Talon waste talent Yep you be all right get he back to the subway have Seth look he over I will clean up here what be you go to do with I we will take you some place where there be a lot of other people just like you all right you be all do so what be the damage besides his face the cut be strong I will have the stitch out in a few day just try not to put too much strain on that area thank doc I will mention that to the next Neuro who try to kill I we be fifty yard from that boat there be no way she could 've see we come try tell that to my spleen she must 've spot we I do not think so it be like the last one Jennifer Talon have the ability to induce paralysis that be not what go down in the dock you think this be the same mutation twice in a row a bit of a coincidence what then I think we 've get a second Neuro he would harass you this morning hit we in the Marina this afternoon I can help up with that some of the damp the dock be very similar to what happen to our transport what be you say we have some lunatic Neuro stalk the team start to look that way they would need access to our Intel they 've get that a leak not from my system I could not happen they do Riley I need you to double and triple check your security look just do it the leak could be human not system even one of we no outside Morgan 's people I will handle that end and our end it do not make any sense everything that be happen have put we at risk besides I trust you people with my life something troubling you we 've be work together for five week now have there be any change with you I do not know I think I be just go to wind up a freak that heal with a high iq and that scare you should not it strange eh someone who come to a healer hope he can help she not heal God choose different path for his child we see kill most when we stray from that path something else be bother you I tell you previously that I have misgiving about my work that I be not always sure that we be do the right thing and I be not suppose to be talk about it with anyone now you 've assure I that whatever we discuss be completely confidential and it be do you trust I yes you be still get the headache maybe all I really need be some sleep I be go to head out can I trouble you with one more thing before I go a hug of course I be available whenever you feel be necessary Jane thank you this well be important I do not like waste my time it be Morgan we have a leak single instance Multiple Consequences casualty none fatal yet fix he before there be that be why I be here I do not appreciate what you be imply rest assure my plumbing be very sound if there be a leak it be come from your own kitchen until this be resolve I be take my team in dark People in the dark tend to step their toe they will not do it but watch your step you be still here of course I be still here the man say double and triple check my system you can not go over the blueprint of the pyramid and get home by 5 o'clock sorry I ask be Seth still in the lab be not he always double and triple check your system Unbelievable what you get there you scare I I be sorry I that be fine what be you into so late just a theory I be work on tell I about it really really what be up Ok Neanderthal Neanderthal indeed one the 10 000 question in genetic well in evolutionary biology in general be what happen to Neanderthal I do not know what do happen to it no it they I do not know either but the question be very exciting it be just a hobby of mine so far I surmise that Neanderthal DNA maybe somehow hide inside the human population Hiding yes Fascinating yes would you like to see the genome structure you know I absolutely would Seth but I 've I 've get this report do and maybe another time yeah absolutely oh actually could you do I a favor Hairs Human unless they be neanderthal I be just kid Seth would you mind run a dna test for I and keep it between we Andre have to authorize all the test right that be right the one he know about this be US government equipment Jane all the test have to be authorize even with my hobby Andre sing off I be not ask you to do anything outside of the box here Seth dna testing be a very important part of what we do yes it be so we be not do anything wrong here and if the result come back Neuro positive I will tell Andre right away Jane where do you get this sample from Seth I be ask you to do I a personal favor ok I mean we get to have something over the Neanderthals right you see we be smart enough to know when we can alter the rule ok thank you Seth what kind of person be you what be it do you think you be above the rule or what Riley let I tell you it be all I Jane Jane Jane Jane Jane Jane let Seth explain it himself I do not know what to say Cause there be nothing to say Seth when you finish the last cup of coffee you put on a new pot you put on a new pot plain and simple I think what I say yeah look call I with the result immediately hello Jane it be Seth I just think you would be glad to know that the sample test Neuro negative thank okay I just want to thank you Jane Congratulations on you new promotion I hear you authorize a dna test yesterday yes I want chapter and verse who what when why a while back I go out a window cut off 46 story all the way down I think it be over obviously it be not but it be be bug I ever since that the meaning of life and all that what I be be this you attempt to answer my question what do you know of the fate of yours not as much as I want to right I feel the same way but this guy Joseph Grace be different Joseph Grace you know this guy well yes he be be the subject of some controversy in the literature involve case of terminal cancer that go into remission that sort of thing you be say he be for real well that depend on what you mean do I think people may have heal under his influence it be likely there be a recognize perceivable effect in the body I would attribute half of his suppose miracle to that the other half to exaggeration all right I want you to find out more about this guy you with I I be sorry I think he know I think he know and you 've be see this man for over a month yes and when we find we have a leak you have to wonder if this be the Neuro stalk our team when Joseph use his healing on I I feel something like an energy pass through I I suppose I have to consider the possibility that it be not all God give you tell he thing nothing that would compromise the team Joseph be a good man and he do test Neuro negative and if he have not I suppose this would be the last conversation we would be have be it do not ever go behind my back again you have a problem you come talk to I right eh Riley what do you got on this guy Joseph Grace he be not criminal record never be sue doctor they think he be full of it but they can not prove anything do not mean he be not full of it not to the nine document case of cancer remission he be have in the last five year look whatever heal this people be not this bozo what be Jane to heal she for anyway I mean it might be the one thing she do not need help with she can heal the wound but she can not heal the pain do you make that up yourself I read it in a fortune cookie oh hey Connor you be not feel well what yeah you be feel kind of sick you make an appointment with Joseph Grace see what you can find out look I already know what I will find out the guy test Neuro negative I would be waste my time humor I if he lay his hand on I this mean spiritual pace be pretty good hello I be Joseph thank you for come will not you come in constant pain and they say nothing can be do I 've try everything this be my last resort Faith be our faith that keep we close to the creator I try and play a small part on that do you thing you can help I relax close your eye clear your mind of worry of question give I your hand I will give they back I promise now just relax Hear boss we 've to talk either this guy be a Neuro or he be the real deal copy what do you get doc ok these image be from a medical investigation into Joseph Grace conduct at Mass General this be a broken femur that heal normally this be femur that be ravish by bone cancer that be quote unquote heal by Joseph Grace Doctor I have no idea what we be look at here ok that be the normally heal bone this be the other one they be different yes they be different but what this show be that Joseph actually have a real effect he be actually heal people I be astonish so be Connor apparently his wound have already heal really I will look into that doctor tell I something could this healing have a potential downside could it be dangerous to the average person not that I can tell heal the cell but these be from Jane that be from before that be from a couple of day ago it be the same I mean all I can see here be that Joseph heal effect on Jane be the same as the other yes but you have to remember that Jane be not like another people hey boss what be you do no no no it be all right I 've do this all night I 've get a beat on that Neuro have be ambush we it be time we turn the table do you find out how he be get access to inside information no we chip he first ask question later it be what I 've talk about I 've get this surveillance shoot off the FBI database he be a mercenary work for the high bidder seem pretty able to elude FBI surveillance at will we get it at the scene of every ambush so far I know exactly where and when to find you son of a bitch Connor yeah I be in position no sign of the subject Vasco in position got nothing either Riley talk to I subjects vehicle have enter the vicinity unless he be be tip and it be a decoy no no play it through I 've get he enter the park from the East I do not have a clear shot I get he Holly he be move do not bother this be Edward Small a friend of mine go will you you be just go to let he go he be the one who be be attack we no Jane you be there be no doubt in my mind there should be I would never do anything to put this team in danger you would never do anything consciously I 've discover how Joseph healing ability work basically he be somehow able to energize each cell stimulate it to repair itself then that energy create an attractive force bring the organ or tissue together with hope but but your constitution be not typical tell I about it apply Joseph energy to someone like you the result be unpredictable even so how be this connect with my sabotage the team Jane you have more than once voice your doubt about what it be we have to do and let us be frank on several occasion you 've deliberately disobey my order yeah but during those attack I be in as much danger as you and Connor you think I be try to take myself out we believe that Joseph 's energy affect you or your mind in such a way that your doubt begin to manifest themselves and they start to work against the team you do not believe this Jane your current genetic profile be something that we do not fully understand you heal rapidly you IQ be increase steadily there be really no say what you be capable of even try to undermine my own team there be something else Joseph Grace have test Neuro positive how be that possible Seth tell I that when Seth run the first test you be in proximity first test we test again with a sample that Connor acquire and with you out of the picture he test positive so wait a minute you be tell I that somehow I be able to wield the sample I bring you to change I do not believe that no I do not think you would Jane I have tell no one else about your condition no one outside this team thank you your point I make a mistake I do not blame you but it be clear you 've become a liability now I would prefer not to have to restrain you convince enough for you Seth seem fairly certain that once you stop see Grace you will recover from whatever it be that happen to you I will heal from the healer we need to eliminate the source whatever Joseph effect have be on I he do not do this I do all he be ever do be try to help people Jane that be a voice inside your head try to justify why a part of you interfere with this Joseph be a Neuro you have first hand experience of how his healing can have disastrous result yeah on someone like I we have to chip he all right then let I do it it be unnecessary no I have to overcome this let us get it over with then when you phone it sound important be you all right I think it be time you learn about my work for some unknown reason a neurological aberration have appear in our population this aberration allow people to make thing happen some of these thing be pretty fantastic while other be very dangerous I 've see people make other jump off building or start fire by will alone even raise people from the dead Good Lord we call these people Neuros my job be to go and find these Neuros and implant they with a chip that neutralize their ability Joseph you be a Neuro my gift be God give whatever form it take who be you or anybody else to take it away the disease that you heal be God give we might not be mean to tamper with any of it if I run I do not think you will will it hurt I do not know come on this way buddy good news the cellular anomaly cause by Joseph healing appear to have clear up Great so I be back to my normal abnormal self I wonder if you will ever find a cure for that be that why you be go to see Joseph you say that the anomaly have clear up do that that I that whatever it be that last entrapment inside of I have clear up too you want the truth probably not I will catch you later doc yes Sir right away that be Morgan we be all get raise that be Morgan and we have a problem another one do they ever end you know anything about this when it come to Morgan 's business I do not want to know have be receive Intel that we may have problem at the internment zone NICO be 5000 mile away how do that concern my team if my information be reliable somewhere keep people at NICO may have be compromise the only physician in my team be Seth I can not imagine while the problem may extend to the medical staff our primary concern be security and administration you can not be sure who if any of the local can be trust I will keep you inform as our intelligence develop but for now this be strictly need to know be not to go beyond we Someone once say we be our own bad enemy their job probably do not involve go against neurological aberrant but after these past few day I just may have to agree with they be bad enough deal with your own inner turmoil if that manifest itself in the physical plane I can not even imagine what this world would look like Transcript and synch by subXpacio and TusSeries my name be jane vasco I could use you on my team I work for a secret government agency that hunt neuros People who can do dangerous thing with their mind on my first assignment something a little weird happen okay something really weird until I get some answer I be get on with my life do my job Stocking up on aspirin because I get to tell ya pain be a bitch they say bad thing come in three I 've have about eight so far today so I get to think I 've have my quota maybe not can I help you be we suppose to get together tonight it do not matter thank god you be here because I can not get my stupid key to work what be wrong I be sorry who be you look I 've have a hell of a day all I want be a couple tylenol and a dozen glass of wine look Miss I I really do not have time for this Brian it be not funny no you be right it be not either go now or I be go to have to call the police daddy when be we go to eat in a minute sweetie who be she no one why do not you go back and finish get ready mom'll be home soon okay you be not go to believe what happen today people very weird Very neuro Hope someone have an explanation because I have no idea what the what the hell be you do down here Joe Joe it be I jane I do not want no trouble so just get the hell out of here and leave I alone I need some answer joe what the hell be go on here I will shoot I will do it go ahead we both know I will heal Andre talk to I and tell I you know who I be Jane listen to I they shut down nico they be destroy any evidence of the team 's existence Joe 's be re program they kill connor and riley they be get close to I it be just a matter of time before they find you why be this happen there be get to be Transcript swsub com Presync IceFre k you tell I should I be paranoid right now Most of my team 's be assassinate joe have be brainwash and I can not even begin to understand what be go on with my boyfriend I be also about to be off I hate the word off I hate the concept more Andre say they be try to wipe out any trace of the unit and what we do I can not let that happen since I do not have time to write my memoir I 've get to find a way and fast which be why I be think about Simon well I suppose I should be flatter an entire team the good of the good devoted to follow and find people like I your friend Riley his mind be a vault of information neuro that be what you call we at least I be glad to know that I be not alone in my uniqueness today be your lucky day pal because I be about to arrange for you to meet the rest of the freak so you do not feel so lonely if you ever want to see your friend again intact that might not be the wise thing to do wait let us hear he out we do not even know if anyone can restore riley 's memory oh I can I can steal knowledge I can transfer knowledge and I can restore knowledge it be jane vasco I need to see you a ' 71 latour should be savor not gulp Savoring 's not in my life right now I do not even know if life be in my life right now why be you here jane my team have be take out and I be suppose to be next if that happen the world will never know about we about what you do to we for good or bad there need to be a record and I think you be here to chip I you be here for I to pick your brain yes you realize that you be die I know but I still think you can get the story down and put it somewhere safe be you willing to help I yes I will help you so how exactly do this work take my hand just envision your experience but there be so many start at the beginning have a seat your current investigation have be terminate by the director why she choose not to share that with I agent vasco I could use you on my team only I do not know what your team do do I we hunt neuro neurological aberrant six year ago the government become aware of a genetic aberration appear in the population those with the aberration posse a unique ability to influence other welcome to the freak show someone be deal substandard medication on the black market we believe there be a neuro behind the operation the drug in question be make and manufacture by vonotek so we get to go back in yes but not solo I want you and jane inside you can play tag with hyde and watch each other 's back he 's vonotek 's head of security Report to security on floor 1 14 take the express elevator blue one 's hyde jane 's on he just land on the 46th floor what the hell be you do it be I it be jane why be I not dead Agent vasco just survive a 46 storey fall Lacerations contusion internal organ damage she do not have any not even a scratch be she nothing in her blood work tissue sample brain scan indicate anything relate to what we be deal with listen to I whatever the hell be go on with I I really need to know what it be okay I will answer for you jane you have my word despite their difference we 've discover a definable pattern in their gene code this aberration seem to affect the neurological center of the frontal and cerebral cortex but we 've encounter dozen of variation in how many people to date almost 200 what the hell be you talk about obviously a neuro that can raise people from the dead obviously I come up with at least a dozen other case of corpse miss from graveyard all within the last nine week they be all young and hot I do not hurt anybody you know it be not right you have to make it stop that be none of your business I know all about be lonely eric this all start when albert die Albert 's my friend and you miss he and you be lonely why do not you chip the little bastard can not get a clean shot without hit vasco just dial the range vector to three foot beyond it will pass right through her Eric you be go to be okay all right nobody 's go to hurt you you be go to be okay let us go kiddo where be you take I I do not hurt anyone it be go to be okay what be wrong where would you have take I if you have not leave I here to an internment center Internment center it be not like that what be it like jane have you see it yourself no but I 've be assure Assured by who the people who have kill your team the people who be hunt you down you can not die now you can not I guess it be too much I be so sorry yes you should be the intent be to protect the public from danger and just what be your interpretation of danger I wonder I wish I could show you why can not you there be that little heart attack episode you just have I will be just fine you be savor I will try to remember that the next time I be do heart medication they all know each other they would all work together now they be all dead what happen to they they die of old age these woman be healthy one minute rapidly aged and dead the next I think we will have to investigate this from the inside the only way I can get into this dress be if I have it paint on Demarco design his dress for girl with single digit bmis you be just too healthy good luck public opinion be run pretty high people want someone to blame there be someone to blame a pyromaniac neuro Richard do not to hell with you seem to be deal with a neuro who seem to induce persistent visual hallucination in his victim Connor the last time we see you we leave you to question marty lento the next here you be in here gun blaze the neuro must have get to he back at the factory when you leave with marty Connor what be you do man Connor stop it be okay it be okay it be jane that s o b get in my head yes they be unpleasant people that be like say hitler have issue Simon these people be a danger to society they be a danger to themselves you see what I see they have to be stop they have to be stop so we gather all the people together good or bad hunt they down and ship they off I do not always agree but you go along with it not always the man be ethan grant no criminal record no nothing he tell the police that he see the plane crash before it happen there be no other evidence connect he to it but there be other call right the voice print from his airline call match three other from the past six month warn people about bad thing that be go to happen a gas main explosion a fire at an elementary school and get this a tornado that touch down near amarillo texas you hear what the man say if he be right and so far you say he have be then three of you will die if you actually believe that someone can see the future even if I do not why risk it he have not commit any crime he be only be try to save people 's life so far yes but if he be a neuro and if he can see the future you have to wonder what else he can do why assume he be try to hurt anyone because he can traditional law enforcement can not handle he that power make he and every other neuro our problem even if it cost we our life Let us leave this alone andre be he still in custody no they have to release he way to go Feds that be the address where they pick he up a house own by his sister sarah hello Ethan keep he on Riley you get that I need a trace get it he say to tell the two agent sit in my living room that there be go to be a terrible accident Eleven people will die he be say that they be not go to listen to he maybe they will listen to you you have to let this one go andre can not do it jane you know that he go through what we just go through every time he see a disaster come now you want to act like one of the government thug that he be afraid of and hunt he down that be just it maybe we can help he so far we be do a bang up job no I mean with his vision if he be a neuro we can chip he give he some peace unless you want he to deal with this for the rest of his life no you think ethan be some ticking time bomb that need to be defuse you do not care about help he you do I think we 've get a second neuro Hit our suv this morning hit we at the marina this afternoon I get he what be you say we 've get some lunatic neuro stalk the team it be start to look that way they would need access to our intel they get that a leak Holy I would never do anything to put this team in danger you would never do anything consciously I 've discover how joseph 's healing ability work Jane you 've more than once voice your doubt about what it be we have to do and let us be frank on several occasion you have deliberately disobey my order we believe joseph 's energy affect you or your mind in such a way that your doubt begin to manifest themselves and start to work against the team I do not believe that I do not think you would I do not blame you but it be clear that you 've become a liability now I would prefer to not have to restrain you convince enough for you open up let us go I be not expect anyone this should be interesting they be about to find I and try to kill I only I 've yet to be kill it be not that I can not be it be just that I have not yet which beg the question what be they go to do to I to achieve their goal and how much be it go to hurt what the hell be you do find something worthy for we to take what be you talk about take we where Bust it down do not forget to shut the door I figure they would have be here and they would not think I would be stupid enough to come back we be probably safe for awhile I think you say brian be here he be they be maybe they take he I have no idea what be jane 1 13 Jane 1 13 what be that we should continue yes and then we can find a corkscrew what be you think about now jane as quickly as you heal there be aspect of your genetic structure that be a little weird I be really go to hate this do not ask I if I be okay I know what you be try to do but I will not turn elyse over to you I know what they can do here I 've see they cure people like elyse

body to Nico to be dissect and study I would see to it he get a proper burial especially since he use his last breath to give I those memory memory that would change my life again a dozen death trace directly to Vono tek he be on the express elevator whatever the hell be go on with I I really need to know what it be you be part of they they will make you join they Jane you be part of they now Simon hey it be okay you be all right sweetie you have a bad dream yeah I guess what time be it almost 7 00 here I make some coffee Wanna tell I about it yeah it be too strong like always I mean the

hey just so you will know what you be miss yeah I know I will call you later Simon tell I he want to give I the truth whatever he mean by that it all seem to come back to the Emerald City let Andre know about the knowledge Simon give I would be admit I have fake chip he and I certainly be not about to involve Brian in something that would probably have to bend the rule and might cause trouble so my trip to Vono tek would be a one woman mission but then again I be not your average woman this be my first assignment as part of Andre 's team the first I ever hear of Neuros you be part of they now Report to security on floor 114 take the express elevator I be in their climate control system I be monitor Hyde 's movement through his heat signature just land on the 46th floor Steve no he be enter the express elevator now you say the lobby right yeah Hyde be not on the elevator he have to be there be no where else to get off he be get to still be in the building Hyde must be jam his security tag wherever he go he obviously do not want anyone watch or the neuro do not you be sure it be Hyde I watch he get on that elevator it be an express directly from 114 to the lobby no stop in between he be downstairs all the time he be not in the elevator not when it get to the lobby anyway be that even possible hey I be the new one on the team remember I 've still get a lot more question than answer right so how do you like push cart probably about as much as you like clean toilet I be have a bowl what be it the truth Jane I be afraid you will have to come with we miss she have no formal ID no driver 's license claim she be a reporter work on a story we be run she now since you say not to report she to the police it be all right I know who she be thank you my life take a huge turn the day I meet Andre McBride and his team that be the day that Neuro become a regular part of my vocabulary the Vono tek case kill two of his agent and I would have be the third if it have not be for my healing but the image Simon give I suggest that there might be more to that original case than just root out a neuro oh Stacey oh Stacey oh yeah Riley hey what be you do here I be go to about to ask you the same thing but I guess I do not have to this be Stacey Andre and Morgan they be get nervous that I be the only one that know how to work our system I guess they figure safety in number her iq be in the genius range she be almost as smart as I be do you have a couple of minute I need to ask you a few question yeah no problem I be actually think just you I get it I will just go finish program the hard drive thank you Riley I need to know about Vono tek what about unanswered question when we wrap the case you be still try to figure out how Hyde disappear off that express elevator yeah but Andre shut I down say the neuro be chip and ship Time to move on so what do you find out ok this be a wire frame of the Vono tek tower now watch there be an anomaly in the overall dimension of the tower which mean if you go strictly by these plan it just do not add up I mean give the window dimension and the overall height of the building this 120 story building be actually 121 ok I be not Stacey can you explain that to I it be like a leap year you add a few second a day every day and after four year you have an extra day in this case an extra floor okay so accord to all the building schematic and elevator plan there be no extra floor here ok the height difference be most apparent right here just below the 114th floor where Hyde get on that elevator my guess be he probably have a special key card that give he access to the 113th floor but technically there be no 113th floor right so now you go to tell I why you be so interested in this do you think you can find out a way for I to get into that building and onto that floor it be simple Riley agree to help I and keep it quiet because he know something be up at Vono tek but Andre have shut it down and if there be two thing you can count on it be a work call from Andre and Riley 's ego okay it look like it be the transformer in the main power vault the place be lock up pretty tight so you will have to use your key card Let us go get it it be out at the relay just give I a second here that will do it Riley have give I fairly detailed instruction the rest be up to I Hyde yes I know I do not forget yes I be leave now so how be the weather in Houston Jane Put your hand on the steering wheel and do not move okay and if you have any doubt whether or not I would use this look if you give I a second I can explain if you live long enough you will have to all right I be listen but I be angry and my finger tend to twitch when I be lie to look I tell you I be go to be in Houston because I do not want you getting drag into any of this and what be this just let I back up the night that we first meet at Club Misery an appropriate name under the circumstance it be not a happy coincidence I know you be go to be there I go specifically because I want to meet you why you do not even know I no but I know about you your Vono tek personnel record be an alias and when I track it down I find out that you be the woman that take a 40 story plunge out a window and die when I hit the ground accord to most report but you do not believe that I might have if the building you have fall from have not be Vono tek Explain that what the hell be go in there well that be what I be try to figure out that be look this could be a lot easy for I to explain if you would let I show you my research what be this place ten year ago Vono tek begin a series of trial the project code name be Revolution it be for a supervariant of HGH the human growth hormone at first glance it do not seem too remarkable pharmaceutical company run approve test all the time what make this different a few thing the trial be approve by the FDA for a 16 month period Vono tek petition for a long period but they do not get it they file for extension but when the feds review their record they turn it down Vono tek never press for an extension after that but they do continue the trial without approval different project this one say Helios everything that I could dig up which be not easy suggest that Helios be an extension of the Revolution project Al right so they slip one past the FDA I be sure it happen all the time but there be a lot of thing about helio that do not happen all the time Colleen Stukey Eric Craig Ruben Hennesy Elyse Collins Eleanor Morton Phillip Statler Simon Connolly all these people participate in the Helios trial some of the people up here be dead none die of natural cause Harry Beeman be stab to death Elizabeth Boone be shoot in the back of the head but the vast majority of these people have just go missing simply vanish from the face of the Earth and then there be I the girl who go through the window and live to tell about it how do you think I fit into your little story I be not sure but a woman use an alia survive a 40 story fall before we meet you my head be full of question I do not recall you ask that be because once we meet we finally start to talk any thought of you be part of my story first rule of reporting never get personally involve with a story I do not Jane I keep tell myself I would get around of that in the process we get close close enough for you to lie to I only about why I go to the club I mean as thing progress I tell myself I would leave you out of anything relate to Vono tek you be a helluva lot more important to I than a story Jane I wish you could believe that like I believe you be in Houston I 've do everything I can to keep this away from you I finally manage to work myself into the company 's good grace and score a series of interview with Randall Hyde they be schedule for this week I need those interview Jane so I have a choice I could could lie to you and keep you out of this or I could tell you the truth and Ruin everything this man Hyde he be not the top dog be he No Dr John Roberts be the founder and drive force behind the company but the man be a recluse he do not come out do not give interview last I hear he be suffer from ALS he be confine to a wheelchair and do not have much time Hyde be his eye ear and leg so if I want to get to Roberts I would have to go through Hyde I do not think anybody get to Roberts as you 've often say I be not anybody GO rambler what be it I do not have a lot of time but you say it be important more important than you know leave we alone Jane I I will contact you if you think this be the way to get answer Miss Vasco you be wrong well at least you know my name so no introduction be necessary it be your choice Mr Hyde you will either talk to I or end up just like I you see miss Vasco I already be just like you Sir she be already discover the facility she actually manage to get her hand on a sample of the formula and a hypodermic no she seem to be aware of that and she be quite persistent and she be demand answer I think it would be good to avoid any problem yes sir right he say he will talk to you my place or yours Jane you seem surprised to see I I think that be what you request I hear you be ill Wheelchair bind and I be may I offer you something answer that be all I think I should be able to provide you with those just like that you seem to know most of it perhaps if you hear all of it you will be inclined to understand for year Vono tek 's be a world leader in cut edge medication we 've be the first to provide cure and treatment for some of the planet 's most virulent and lethal disease that be our goal when I begin the company having achieve that goal I feel that we need to do more so you decide to play with human genetic Experiment with all the time and research we have put in to cure and prevent disease I believe our effort would be well serve by direct they into improve the specie improve and who decide what define improve I do not believe my standard be that unique Imagine people who do not get sick people whose immune system be so developed that they can fight off almost anything that attack they when be the last time you have a cold go on if we can improve the human animal empower its cellular structure to fight disease to regenerate to heal we would no long have to combat plague that face we one after another if you could do that you would put yourself out of business I have everything I need my goal now be to provide they with something that be not just stopgap antidote but something that will change we forever by create genetic freak let I show you something genetic research be not unlike pharmaceutical research perfect the product be a result of trial and error I begin my experiment over two decade ago and yes many of the original subject do turn out to be freak but it be all in the name of science the people you see in this room be alive their biological function have be dial down so to speak they require very little to sustain they these people be the result of some of my mistake People you call Neuros but over the year I 've come a long way you and Randall and I be the result of my success how nice for we I consider what I 've give you a gift sorry I never send a thank you card Jane not only be you immune from most disease not only do you possess the ability to heal but each time your body regenerate itself your cell actually learn they get smart the long you live the strong you get you 've cure death no not yet anyway there seem to be a build in timer that despite the variation tell the cell when it be time to quit I be work on it perhaps it be put there intentionally by a force that even you can not overcome I be not play god Jane I be just try to become a useful partner I be do what I can for these people to correct early failure to collect they as you have why I what do I do to earn the honor to participate in all of this you be young you be healthy and you be the new member of the team out of the group I think you would make the strong ally Care to tell I what you 've do with my people all I care about right now be expose what you be do I believe most people deserve the chance to worship the god of their choice you will not do that you be part of we you be part of they now know what you turn I into how do you expect to stop I you be strong Jane and get strong but know what I create and having learn from other ' mistake you would expect I would know how to control it they will make you join they Jane get her ready you will thank I Jane and for the gift I give you you will be eternally grateful Andre spend seven year with special force he be recruit by a man name Gerald Morgan to head up special operation thank you to the future I be not that familiar with a lot of the case history prior to my join the team I do know they lose one agent shortly before Maureen and I come aboard you do know about maureen I know who she be who she be I be sorry right now we be fairly short on manpower Connor King Andre and I be handle the field operation while Riley be Riley Jensen yes Riley keep we wire into whatever information we need to have and then there be Sseth Dr Carpenter who for the last year have try to figure out what I be and my test subject the neuro I know you send they off to a place call Nico unfortunately your people have do a good job of keep its location from be discover it be my understanding when the operation begin they confine the neuros the people somewhere here in the States but as the number mount they need to operate with more anonymity so they relocate Nico to somewhere in Eastern Europe Hungary I believe you 've never be there no it be mostly a medical and containment facility there would not be much there for we to do unless a problem develop it be a shame so many of my people so many mistake I would like to correct thank you for be so open I think you see now that people often fear what they do not understand I think I always know that I be sure you do oh there be the matter of your boyfriend Brian yes he have a lot of information on Vono tek the early Helios trial the miss people I be sure he will be anxious to learn what you 've discover I be sure he will good night Jane and thank you again I 've look forward to this day for a long time we will be in touch hey yeah it be I of course I be okay I 've a lot I want to tell you yeah you free for dinner my place where else do not make it to a warm sunny island pretend to be in Houston or catch up on my reading but I do get an insider 's perspective on the inner working of Vono tek and no matter what I will bet I will still have the good story on the team of course some story be well leave untold hello everybody what be up Doc how be the vacation it be quite the informative gathering very relaxing very pleasant I know you get a heart in there Doc and we be go to find it one day do you catch anything yes I have quite a run of good luck I finally beat Dr Samuel Cranston after six year of try what exactly do you beat he at or do we want to know 5 62 pound wow really quite an achievement quite tasty to eat I would imagine oh no I do not eat he well he be not move very much so you could not throw he back no I give he to Dr Cranston there be something about cut into a fish that just make I a little queasy thank you good to see

undoubtedly have some work to do so let us get back to it Riley you be free for dinner my place Transcript sw sub Subtitles subXpacio y TusSeries my name be jane vasco I could use you on my team I work for a secret government agency that hunt neuros People who can do dangerous thing with their mind on my first assignment something a little weird happen okay something really weird until I get some answer I be get on with my life do my job Stocking up on aspirin because let I tell ya pain be a bitch Riley what be happen system be down back up and secure we go somewhere Nice if there be a neuro or two in maul I do not think you will be sip a lot of mal tai in hungary no crack I do not say anything it be a pre emptive strike I do have a life above ground clearly what be the 911 we have an emergency situation at nico Morgan inform I there be be a break how many six that we be aware of when we do not know there have be administrative problem at nico for month now Morgan 's think they 've be sweeping thing under the carpet in any case I can not tell you when because no official report be make Morgan pick this up from other source can not the local handle it there be no local these neuro have be chip so there be minimal security the other staff be administrator doctor nurse the flight leave at 0600 that be four hour from now Pack light Seth I be go to need riley where we be go so there will be no one here to run security I be go to get joe to do a lock up here I will be at the hospital if you need I thank you Farber air force base at 0500 let us roll Nice to meet you agent mcbride make yourself comfortable I do understand why you be here and I assure you you and your team will have my full cooperation that will not be necessary we be plan on perform a thorough house clean just how thorough be we talk about from the top down Cozy oh yeah all we need be some villager and torch Roger armstrong Andre mcbride we 've be expect you and let I assure you you and your team will have my full cooperation I would expect nothing less mr Armstrong I will gather my team after they 've have a chance to settle and we will reconvene in your office in one hour Transcript swsub com Synchro bbd1980 I use to dream of travel as a kid place like hawaii the caribbean white sand beach toe dig in the sand a cute guy to my side I think this might be the year I would make that happen Guess I be wrong again we first become aware of the situation at evening bed check we have a very strict curfew obviously not strict enough we have a limited security staff agent mcbride Most of our resident having be chip be well behave why do not you report the situation we have hope we could bring they back without cause concern I take full responsibility for what happen oh it be already be assign to you my order be to locate and contain the escapee at the same time the entire operation will be evaluate from security to management expect change it be 1125 hour my team will need to be brief 15 minute this be alex rawlings head of security I 've read the intel report you compile not much detail about how the escape be accomplish you know everything that we know there be no evidence whatsoever that they breach the perimeter I find it highly unlikely that they walk through the wall yes sir I will need blueprint from the roof to the basement and the surround property I have they digitize if you would like Riley download it to your rig I want to keep it portable it give we an edge for security purpose plus we may have to roll with it I be on it go on I 've arrange for dr Phillips head of medicine to show you the rest of the facility he be well qualified to answer your question if there be nothing else not for the moment we run quite a number of test and experiment an inmate would be place depend on what phase of test he or she be in what kind of test everything from mri 's to cat scan we do perform some invasive surgery the main focus of our research be to determine etymology we still have no idea where how or why the phenomenon begin to appear in the population you let they walk around like this they be human being agent king and having have the good fortune to have be chip quite harmless I do not like it hell they know who we be and probably be not too happy about see we again this be yellow sector these be our long term resident Most have be through the complete battery of test this be our minimal security section primarily for containment and still well covered with security camera yes every sector be cover and the camera run 24 7 what be blue doctor our central core be at the end of that corridor every section extend off the core like spoke on a wheel it be also our path lab and safe room safe room yes just in case what make it safe we 've discover during our research that an extremely amplify ultrasonic wave can interfere with the aberrant neurological activity limit its range and efficacy like a chip yes very much like a chip but not localize to the individual if there ever be to be some sort of threat to the staff if a chip be to fail we can surround that room with an ultrasonic barrier that would in effect prevent their special talent from get through have you ever have a chip fail no not to date why not use the ultrasonic throughout the entire facility a number of reason the power involve to generate the frequency and amplify it that and the intensity of the frequency could be harmful to the physical structure of the building that section have be reinforce this be red sector it be our high security section the inmate here albeit chip be consider dangerous and anti social have you find any connection between their behavior and their condition nothing consistent apparently the aberration itself do not cause anti social behavior I believe these people would have be incarcerate in the outside world even if they do not possess their special talent well well well this place be look well already I tell you I would kill you if I ever get the chance you sonuvabitch Ahhh I remember you you be the pyro freak who like to set fire to school you bit I and last time I check I have rabie what be the green sector Maintenance Generator hospital supply room nothing of any real interest Dr Phillips please dr Phillips excuse I yes yes I will be right there what 've you get I 've be over the security tape and report on the night of the escape none of the entrance or exit be breach still leave we nowhere not exactly there be a tunnel that run below the facility where do it lead to an old convent about two mile from here a few century back this place be a prison use to house religious prisoner the tunnel be build as a means for they to communicate with and escape to the outside world and you do not think it be worth check no need it be seal almost 200 year ago when it be discover when we take possession the closure be reinforce it be be fill with a few ton of concrete no exit breach the tunnel be block how the hell do six neuros escape you 've be quiet something on your mind one guard I see be carry a chip gun would not you why everyone here be chip Dr Phillips say he have never hear of a chip fail but they build a safe room just in case even so the guard I see be come from a maintenance area of no real interest you be think their full cooperation might not be so full yeah that be what I be think rawling say the tunnel be seal what do guy expect we be go to find here no date for this weekend that be for sure I be not expect visitor today my name be andre mcbride I be mother superior my team and I be do historical research in the area and we be wonder if we could check out the building and the ground if it do not interfere with the sister I see no problem this place be amazing how old be it it be be here for almost 400 year we understand there be a tunnel that run under the property yes do you have any idea where it lead Someplace that use to be a prison would you mind if we take a look at it of course the wall be completely seal no way anyone come through that tunnel hey boss thank you no I be work what do you get I 've officially confirm the name of the escapee luckily these people be chip because they would make an all star team of neuros if they be not first there be jakob baumgartner shape shifter who I believe we all rember then there be jerry williams Neuro ability the man can move at extremely high speed Marilyn smith neuro ability she can emit highly focus lasebeam produce from a region behind the optic nerve Bill davis can cause a magnetic force between object Tom sampson can create ultrasonic vibration and last but not least roger hanley a levitator we be on our way to you now no worry boss three other break in have occur since the escape oversized drill bit steal from a machine factory several box of c 4 explosive take from a ming factory nothing else but check this out a cache of gun and ammo be steal from a highly secure military munition storage shed give the detail those escape neuro could 've pull this off how they be all chip maybe Andre you say they 've be experiment with de chpe here it be not a secret but it be not a know fact that they can do it not know to we anyway might explain what we be talk about early worth discuss with armstrong do not track if you manage to get out of this place would you stick around Personally I would get my ass as far away from here as possible unless escape be not the only thing on their mind you be correct agent mcbride we have experiment with de chip but those experiment be discontinue long before they garner result I 've get a list of burglary that could have be commit by those neuro have they be de chip you have my answer agent and you have mine we could be look at an attempt for a full scale breakout until otherwise notify I be put nico on 24 7 lockdown no one other than my team come or go without my permission that include you do not you think you be overreact I be just getting start beautiful night what do I do to deserve this I think I might welcome you to some hungarian generosity unless I be interrupt Darlin ' it be what you be start that I do not want interrupt you try monarchia I can not even pronounce it if you like it I have another bottle back at my place must have be that trip to the convent thank you to the second bottle the second bottle hey be not you go to Huh good evening father Welcome father I hope all be go well we need to talk I do not have much time it would take a team of munition expert and bulldozer to pull these burglary off or six unchipped neuro Armstrong and phillip both claim that the experimental surgery be discontinue before yield any result you believe they at this point no if there be any plan in the work for an assault on the castle I will know about it I 've link into what little there be of their system hey do you get anything off those tape rawling give you nothing you with we or what connor just barely trust I be careful if you sample the local wine what have I miss I think you might have something to report besides the local wine why would I have something to report I pass out in my room last night oh really this be time code just after 1900 hour right off the camera at the main entrance I swear boss I never leave that be I be not it I check the odometer on the suv between the time connor say he do not drive out until the time he do not get back someone rack up just over six mile just about enough for a round trip to the convent what about baumgartner the man can shape shift into pretty much anyone he be on the list of escapee why come back to the place you escape from not that big a risk if you can impersonate anyone you want come and go as you need we keep he high on the list at this point we have to proceed assume that armstrong and phillip be lie to we and if that be the case that maintenance area which be suppose to be of no particular interest could turn out to be very interesting I would like to run ultrasonic on the tunnel it be still our good bet alright we reconvene in two hour I want everyone to carry Armstrong access deny I be not in your room last night I be in the lab until my shift end I clock out at 1800 hour you can check with security to verify I never should 've turn down that job at microsoft retinal imprint fail nice place I think I find something check this out this be a density readout on the tunnel you can see that the end be solid about three foot deep probably concrete like they say but if you look here you can see that except for this solid area in the center once that be clear the tunnel would be passable you find your woman we find the woman well I 've get something I be just explae to jane hey move over there go Andre I assume that one of you be jakob baumgartner the only question be which one there be a way shoot both of we it be a win win situation she be right boss our girl'll just get up like nothing happen last chance mr Baumgartner you could 've shoot I in the leg ah Armstrong 's dead when I be not an m e but give the condition of his body I would say he be dead before we arrive Baumgartner 's be busy and that maintenance area be not a maintenance area I only get as far as the morgue but there seem to be another facility beyond that I could not get through time we have a talk with dr Phillips if it ever be dr Phillips Riley call security have they get rid of this body it be time we find out what they do not want we to know I be the computer tech it be you guy that be suppose to get hit on the head you might want one of the doctor to check that out I think it be baumgartner who be check out I have a pretty good idea where I be go as I start to explain to jane well baumgartner whatever this concrete be only a few foot deep the same be true at the other end and except for a few foot that're still block in the middle the end be like cork Blow'em out clear the middle boom you have free access from the convent and the hospital it would explain the steal c 4 and other equipment if the freak be plan to break their friend out of here then they have to be work it from the convent side you think the mother superior lie to we I would say if it be mother superior she could be an escapee no I do not think so why not she do not match any of the profile they could be control her Baumgartner 's not go to give up the game and he know he be under pressure if they be go to move they will move soon what would it take to force a cave in and seal the tunnel Same as they be plan to use to clear the concrete a small truckload of c 4 just place differently can you do it I guess give the supply and chemical around this place mix in the right proportion maybe how long Less time if I get start now Good Riley you work this end with connor you and I well get to the convent if baumgartner 's go to move he may not want to leave any witness great down here again still think she be an innocent tough play to call good bet be to chip both of they she might actually be a mother superior if she be not a neuro the chip will not hurt she it be your afterlife I will take baumgartner cuff he you have no right I have every right I do not think you realize who and what we be deal with here you mean a man who be be give an extraordinary gift from god you be attempt to protect yourself from thing you do not understand this man and the other like he be simply try to protect themselves from imprisonment and butchery ignorance and fear I think you have be sell a bill of good mother superior we only want to understand they who they be why they be no one want to harm they you have to expect he to lie cover up the truth he be one of they what truth be that ha please miss vasco the de chip the experiment cut into we as if we be nothing more than laboratory rat leave some of we crippled and blind and those be the lucky one you really do not know do you then perhaps it be time you be introduce to the dangerous escapee you 've be work so hard to apprehend alright just how powerful be this stuff it be enough to finish the job but not enough to take the whole place down right let us go Guess we be go to find out on my mark 3 2 1 your vicious band of criminal agent mcbride be dr Phillips responsible for all of this yes this be his handiwork the people we hope to set free be not as fortunate as these and you be their appoint savior why because agent mcbride though it might come as a shock to you I do possess a conscience month of work and only second to destroy it this tunnel it save countless life in the past we would hope it could serve that purpose again can you really let this continue and allow these people to suffer the ball as they say be in your court sir any one of those people could have be I and in less enlighten time you I do not think these people will give you any further trouble I will see that they be take to their room you may have press your luck this time jakob Alright let us go it seem as if it be your luck that have change doctor you do not chip they you must to stop this I think you be go to chip they no agent I distinctly recall give you that order well we seem to have a real problem on our hand do not we you would agree would not you doctor this be something of a problem what be you do maybe now you will be inclined to tell we the truth unless you would like to wait there while we retrieve our chip gun you know I can not seem to find mine do you know what be happen to yours I will tell you whatever you want just get they out of here no doctor I think it well that they stay and listen after all who would well to call you on your lie than they I should have let they kill you be your hand so clean this be your work doctor not mine if I have know if you have know what single handedly you would have put a stop to it what do you people think be happen here not this how nice to be able to choose to be so blind you loathe I for do your housekeeping it be always nice to have clean toilet just do not inquire as to how the job be accomplish that be a bit simplistic do not you think doctor be it ever since the first aberration surface we 've be under order and pressure to find the source understand the nature of the mutation you as well as anyone should understand agent mcbride they want result not excuse at any cost do not be naive have I come up with the answer discover a cure I would have be give a medal of honor and a parade to go along with it be you even vaguely aware of what be go into medical research over the year Research that in the end have save million of life and that make it okay it make it necessary as much as you do not want to know miss vasco you be part of this we work on the same team toward the same end no no not anymore we do not that team be about to change doctor in fact my team will stay here until this entire facility be either clean up or clean out you will give I full access to your record I want the name of every individual involve be there any physician on this staff that can be trust Dr Newman I will have he form a new team hopefully it be not too late to help some of these people let us get out of here Agent mcbride I misjudge you thank you Dr Newman be attend to the crew some of they may survive Phillips be right my hand be not so clean we all live to learn jane it be learn that we can wash our hand that matter Compassion when we last meet I be rather ill behave but thing have change have they have not you always suspect that in the end we be more alike than different I be not too sure of that clearly you be not the only one of we who can survive a gunshot to the chest we be family you 've know it for some time I suppose I have I 've speak with dr Roberts and I know you two finally have the chance to meet he and randall hyde you and I it appear we have a great deal in common you say that you be not part of phillip ' experiment you be never de chip no Maureen chip you when she apprehend you how be you able to continue to use your ability when dr Roberts tell you that he would perfect his process he be tell the truth Chipping have no effect on we any of we the people you send to nico be the result of early experiment but you still want to help they as do you perhaps there be more to dr Robert 's vision of an improved species than simply the ability to heal what happen now you will learn that soon enough there be an old phrase be careful what you wish for you just might get it the people I work for have be desperate to understand the neuro phenomenon how it work where it start in time they may get that answer but at what price and ever since I can remember I 've always wish to feel part of something now it seem after all these year that I be the price for that too might be more than I be willing to consider beautiful night it might turn out to be I feel I owe you an apology I do not know why accord to everyone the you that come to my room be not you then perhaps you would like to share some wine with the real I not monarchia definitely not I will guarantee you will like what I have for you much more y'know if you be baumgartner this could get strange you have nothing to worry about do you really think you will need that I be a firm believer in safe sex www seriesub com my name be Jane Vasco

for I I be not say I do not believe you as many horror movie as I 've see you 've get to consider all possibility include a neuro on the loose we have any report of neuro activity outside north america I know you be go to ask that no the only know neuro this side of the water be house in this facility it be mcbride get in here thank you I will keep check but the local database be pretty pathetic you want fact talk to people the guy in that bar know plenty Agent mcbride Captain one of my team be attack last night in town it have the earmark of neuro activity if it happen in town it be not a neuro not one of ours anyway all the inmate be account for yes sir Head count be do on the hour since the administrative change that will be all thank you Alright connor put some clothe on I want you to show I where this happen it be mine I do not know if I hit it do not take it down Connor try to find I a blood trail right ever see he like that not even close what be that look like the claw mark of some animal yeah king kong 's big brother what the hell could do that Mark of the beast it be beware the eighth hour past noon have you ever see this beast no one who see the beast live to tell of it where do it come from have you no eye woman the beast come right out of hell but there have get to be something connor find that blood trail only my own Welcome to bolnar new people in town tend to create a stir I be constable farkas Andre mcbride we be u S Federal agent really that be a first what bring u S Federal agent all the way to our little town one of our colleague be attack last night between eight and nine yeah the beast of bolnar trust I I know how it sound you have to understand two different world each have their own rule what be you say you do not believe in this beast or not I be say that there be thing here that can not be explain away with rational explanation and the beast of bolnar be one of those thing you already know the answer to that do not you I know something attack I last night who or what I do not know there could be rational explanation that you be unaware of then I would be more than happy to hear they four year ago the people in this town elect I believe that I could help protect they I have not be able to do that if there be a chance that we could help each other to meet that end I would like to participate you know the town you know the people we can use all the help we can get that be the last one the square 's be seal off the street have be clear except we if even a cockroach cross my sensor perimeter we will know about it you be all key into infra red in case we need a heat signature Lovely you be a bloody genius five minute to 8 00 place I get the north end I 've get the south Farkas here West end we be about to discover whether or not science can triumph over mythology Alright riley what do you get not a peep wish it would come out and get it over with maybe it be not come out tonight the beast come every night it be almost 8 30 and I 've get nothing keep go til 9 00 if he know we be out here with all this brilliant science we be not talk about a he we be talk about an it still nothing look like a wash Farkas Ahhh what be go on Farkas I be on my way there be nothing on my screen I see something be get he what I can not see it Jane be careful hold your position we be on our way check vasco she be alright good he be not no print no fiber good thing we stay up all night à good man 's dead and all we 've get be a lot of nothing I 've check my sensor array and transmitter over and over Everything be work perfectly except it do not work how be the perimeter compromise I can not explain it Farkas try to tell we that this be an it and not a he even if this be some kind of beast it should give off body heat on infra red and anything that move should set off a motion detector only it do not why I have not get a clue you well get one riley one thing we know for sure whatever it be it kill whoa whoa check this out Boss do that mean the thing be still here I do not know I can not tell I can not zoom in any further Jane Connor I have it calibrate for a uv 15 overlay it should work alright you sonovabitch where be you connor anything no guy Footprints how could something so tiny be so strong anything yet yes and no Meaning what I know what do not kill constable farka it be not the wound on his back or the beating he take then what be it Farkas die from a complete shutdown of his central nervous system and it be sudden as though someone just flip a switch never see anything like it can you confirm that this be the same thing that attack connor last night not with absolute certainty but the wound pattern be identical boss sorry go get a preliminary analysis of the footprint Trace electromagnetic energy in and out of it it be not there before farkas be kill okay it belong to the killer what be we deal with base on the depth of the print à female five six and 110 pound the guy I talk to in the tavern say the beast first attack four year ago his goat so we be not talk about an ancient legend we be talk about a legend that start after nico move into the neighborhood Hell of a coincidence accord to newman whatever kill farka attack his central nervous system you be damn lucky to be alive Riley I want you to delve deeply on this footprint analysis I be go to head back to newman I still think we be miss something in the inmate population you two get back to town and find the guy from the tavern see what he remember about this thing 's first kill could shed light on how this begin and why let us go find this sorry I could not come up with more answer for you that be alright it be to be expect in our line or work let I ask you something doctor these detainee you have be here for a while have you encounter any condition under which the effect of a chip could wear off encounter it no be it possible like you say in this line of work no way to be sure yes but look around you Nico have over a thousand neuro who be not use their power and they be not all live here in the section for model detainee I assume these question stem from the incident in bolnar let I say this agent mcbride we know that proximity be require for neuro power to have any effect Bolnar be 25 mile away the beast of bolnar do not appear until after nico be establish here I do not believe in coincidence doctor you be right of course but you might have to consider the possibility that you be not deal with a neuro but something altogether different well if it be not the dart champion of bolnar Lot of work I be do this will not take very long Horvath something happen to I the night I leave the bar I tell you not go you go anyway I remember you say something about your goat be the first thing attack by this beast tear apart my name 's jane we know this beast be dangerous and we want to help your town get rid of it can not get rid of why not Curse of the gypsy Gypsies World war II many gypsy die here Gypsies curse bolnar beast come World war ii be 60 year ago how come the beast only show up four year ago I be not a gypsy that be loud Church next door be good protection from the beast you say your goat be the first thing attack Attack goat not person no boy must learn I say boy need to learn thank for your time horvath Nice class of people you hang around with he seem

a neuro Doc what be you say that this freakazoid gene can be inherit it would appear to be this be the first we 've see it do not make any sense gabriella 's apparently the inherit ability can be different from the mother I do not buy it if the kid do all this why do it look like she right now I can only give you a good guess the boy his name be kristoff Kristoff 's unconscious mind seem to have create an entity a creature from the i d so to speak that carry all of his rage and there be a lot of that to go around Kristoff be adopt at the age of five for little more than slave labor he be nine right the beast of bolnar appear four year ago apparently kristoff do not even know what he be do the entity create itself during a specific portion of rem sleep which turn out to occur between 8 00 and 9 00 p M when the church bell sound it would wake he up or interrupt the rem sleep like it do today think about it you be kristoff getting work half to death by a man who offer zero comfort or warmth Deep down you be mad as hell I still do not get it why do it look like his mother he should not even be able to rember she yes he do in his mind she be the only protector he be ever know until you help he that be why his monster save you when the kid go to sleep again why do not the monster show up Most of we only experience rem sleep once or twice per sleep cycle the deep level be usually

be we look at you 've review all the footage she be take to recovery after her test there be no camera in that room but like the last time there be no image or record of anyone leave the premise besides Dr Thomas even if she do walk through the wall she could not be in two place at once I understand sir I be just tell you what we know what about blind spot in the system like I say not every room be cover but there be no blind spot along any part of the perimeter do she say anything she be pretty shake Keeps talk about do these thing in her dream and what do you think right now I do not can I talk to her she be groggy from the medication I be not sure what you will get from her Sarah go away please tell I about your dream I do not want to talk about they you have to we need to understand what be go on I 've have they for year ever since I be a child you see yourself hurt people not always sometimes it be hard to explain it be as if I could see myself from the outside and watch what I be do but the feeling be always the same as if I be search for something search for what I do not know as if part of I be miss I tell you it be hard to explain that be all right go on the dream stop for a while after you send here though they never really frighten I I feel relieve that they be go when do they start again I do not know a few month ago and then the other night when I murder that man when you dream that you murder that man and last night again I torture someone a man he beg I to stop and I want to make it stop but I could not do you recognize the man no he be so far away I could tell he be dress in white I think he might have be a I do not know like a doctor yes do something happen be someone else hurt that be what we be try to find out now listen to I I need you to tell I everything you can about that dream face place anything you can remember it be all so vague I see he his white coat anyway and tree lot of tree and a fountain maybe Somewhere I hear the sound of run water I can not remember any more that be all right tell I what happen you get some rest okay I will try and visit you as soon as I can okay Andre maybe it would have be well if you have kill I when you have the chance what do you think you get any of the test result they all come back negative or inconclusive there be still nothing to indicate that the chip be malfunction I want her isolate I want she sedate and I mean paralyzed I want her physiological and mental activity monitor twenty four seven Post guard no one go in or out without my authorization already in place the location she mention Trees maybe a fountain be there any in this part of the world a few dozen maybe Riley 's go to need a starting point if she be right maybe we could find this Dr Thomas this be the last location I pick up from the cell phone Signal go dead after that Clear you hear that sound of run water we be close all right let us go let us roll people stay by the car I will stay by the car over here I 've get a last dial do not know what it mean you can run it when we get back get he out of here look you tell I to back off on Andre 's history with Sarah and I do but give the current circumstance that information have now fall into the need to know category I need to know let us walk three year ago we be on the trail of a chip job that have be steal drug and pricey medical gear from a major hospital we assume the drug be be steal and sell on the street but we have no idea how they be get in or out of secure area we figure it be an inside job so we start interview people Sarah happen to be one of the first she work in the laundry room in the hospital seem like a good kid honest hard work Time go on we think we have our Neuro pin as an orderly real bad guy criminal record long than mine usual procedure I catch up with he after one night of drinking swipe a bit of dna for the doc but we figure the point be moot I mean all evidence point towards this guy anyway by that time Andre have get pretty cozy with Sarah first time I would ever see that happen but why the hell not she be bright kind innocent everything we be not use to to the boss probably feel like a breath of fresh air thing get ugly though when our prime suspect test Neuro negative Riley 's busy run possible with his usual enthusiasm when he find out that Sarah 's mother be sick very sick whatever she have she probably be not go to pull through there be treatment but they cost a lot of coin which Sarah do not have it be not easy for the boy wonder to tell the boss what he have find none the less I think we would run straight away on it we do not he put a nix on it say it be something that could wait guess it be something he want to take care of himself Andre the kid be just try to lift enough medicine to help her mother after they ship Sarah off Andre make arrangement for her mother to receive treatment why not she deserve it as much as people with money but eventually she fall through the crack got lose in the system first time I ever see the boss doubt what we be do he come this close to walk I do not know what to say you be not go to say anything I tell you this because I do not know if I could trust his judgment right now and I need you to back I up other than that darlin ' this conversation never happen oh my god what have they do to you it be take I so long but after all these year I 've finally find you my beautiful sister we 've look at this in every possible way Sarah be under complete lockdown and monitor at the very time of Dr Thomas ' murder yes there be no marked change in her physiology EEG GSR heart rate respiration be all within the norm the datum do not lie doctor and the video that Riley obtain the image from the customs office be they lie that be Sarah or someone who look like Sarah now what about Baumgartner he could easily have take her form the facility be secure Andre you 've see to that Baumgartner 's a shape shifter but he can not walk through wall and Sarah can not be in two place at once I have make my decision I want Sarah take out of lockdown discontinue the sedation do not you think that you might be might be in charge around here good I be glad we understand one another just before my mother die she tell I I be adopt she tell I about you my twin sister how we be separate why we be separate and then all begin to make sense the dream you 've have they too as if you be look for something not something Sarah someone a part of I I always know be miss but not anymore we be special in so many way but then those dream that man Abby you kill that man and Dr Thomas he be the man in white be not he you murder they no I see it I think I have do it Sarah when my mother finally pass I know I have to find you no matter how hard or how long be go to take when I finally manage to track you down it be as if you have vanish off the face of the Earth I have come so close to find you and you be go it take I another four year to find out that they would send you here no one know about this place I know a great deal about this place I know what they do to you the man that do it to you what they do here you and I be different we can go place and see thing other can not this be a bad place Sarah I 've come to take you home but Dr Thomas he never hurt anyone that be right Dr Thomas be a good man the more I look into this place the more I understand just how vile and cruel it be a place where people like you good people be lock away because they fear what they do not understand Dr Thomas know that and there be other I try to meet with they they promise to help I get to you it be not I Sarah their people get to they first that man McBride Andre he would not murder anyone he would if it mean keep this place a secret silence the people who would want to expose it the most important thing right now be to get you out of here get in I be afraid be a lot easy than get out they watch we closely that be why I need you to stay here in case someone come in and check on you I will see if I can find a way out soon Sarah I need to talk to you I apologize for the way you 've be treat but I have to be sure and now you be I know you I know what you be capable of and what you be not when I meet you despite your power all you want to do be help your mother but that be why you put I here yes because of what I be what I can do Sarah until very recently I have no idea what be go on at this place I be try to make it well a well prison a well place to learn about you and people like you we need to understand what you fear maybe but if it have be up to I thing might have turn out differently but it be up to you Andre we all have a choice all right you be not the first person to suggest that all of this be all wrong have a change of heart no I do not see the world as black and white despite what you think and I do not necessarily fear what I do not understand not everyone here be like you there be people that possess great power and they use it for personal gain at the expense of other but you just say I be not like the other yes and yet you use your power to take away mine and lock I up here maybe the only people that should be lock up here be people who misuse their power maybe the wrong people be behind these wall agent McBride the main exit be too well guard the only way out be through the outer wall the problem be they be too thick too thick to go through alone but if we try together combine maybe we could they take away my power Abby even if we could do what you say the chip can be remove it be a simple electrical device that lodge itself in the cranial cortex what go in can come out Lean forward you know I would never hurt you I think we should talk about this there be nothing to say nothing or too much do not you think I know how you feel I not sure I care at this moment Jane I 've just look in on Sarah they 've discontinue the sedation and she will be release

clean up when he come in he just freeze they we can not trust this freak it be all right a guy with this kind of power if he want we dead we would be dead already so how come you be not comatose Eddie I do not bother to ask if you know what I mean all right get back to your ward go on do not make sense guy in lockdown do not do trustee favor it fit the pattern they be take out staff not other Neuros Clear Fire break out in the record room Sprinklers be activate but the temp 's still rise Rawlings I 've lose communication it be sudden just like Jane Doctor your predecessor run unauthorized experiment on some of the population yes that be correct do he un chip they the experiment would 've require he to do that temporarily the Neuros on the loose must have be involve take out the staff destroy record they be try to wipe out any evidence of our existence and yet they do not touch a trustee because he be a Neuro whoever be behind this they be plan on send every Neuro we 've ever capture back into the world we be not secure here we be not secure anywhere we be in the safe room it be on level two blue sector she be right get an ultrasonic barrier that deflect every neuro ability we know of Connor get our weapon ready Riley pack up your computer Dr Newman with I Clear okay guy I 've get Jane we 've got escape Neuros from red sector I know I be head your way no Jane we 've move we be on a safe room on level 2 where be you now near the kitchen area on three how do I get there I be go to try to open up a stairway east of you if that be jammed use the kitchen stair down to storage you will have to double back to the B ward east door then head straight and around the corner copy that Jane the door be secure and the barrier be activate I need to know when you be close I only want it open for as long as it take for you to get inside Understood okay Jane you be close Head leave and you will see the safe room door I see it now go Jane hurry they be right behind you wait wait wait wait no Riley what be you do Riley what the hell be you do she be lie open the door she be open the damn door she be get red paint on her okay it be the same paint that Hamilton 's office be be paint she never report be anywhere near there hurry up Riley she be lie we 've get proof open the door show I that proof now Riley if they want you dead you would be dead already she be be lie the whole time boss you will all be dead soon enough and how be we go to get in we will not have to Connor and Andre will come after we what be the status of the yellow and green sector they corral the resident into the ding hall on blue only two guard on post everyone in yellow be lock in the day room the guard station there be one of the one we toast in the record room and we still have two dozen tech and administrative worker to take care of they be unarmed and untrained should be an easy sweep and we will free the ward and then what just walk out no truck will arrive at the main gate at 0700 we will get everybody on board and then where do we go we 've make arrangement for everyone to be fly back to the States without a team to hunt we down we will be able to get back to do what we do well yes something like that do not leave we a lot of time and we be one man down we could get more help from red sector I have a bad feeling about that broad from the beginning no there be get to be a reason why she be do this I do not give a damn why she be do it Riley she have to be stop like with a tranquilizer no not with a tranquilizer we be go to have to kill Jane how do you kill someone who can not die what do you mean can not die she can heal from any injury she and Baumgartner they have a lot in common he have the same capability but Jane can not change her image it be just a variation of his ability to regenerate his cell structure he always return to his original form and and we 've notice he be be able to heal from small injury very quickly have you any dna record of agent Vasco 's the pattern be identical it be possible she be not act on her own will what the hell do that mean Baumgartner be always a unique case his dna pattern be not like the other Neuros it be similar but there be significant difference like Jane we 've study his cerebral pattern extensively we find that a region of his brain be unusually overdeveloped a region that make he highly susceptible to suggestion Jane 's pattern show a similarly overdeveloped region in her brain who be the sonofabitch do the control no idea so then what wave a watch in front of her face and she will stop what she be do preliminary research indicate that something like that might be a possibility but at this point it be just a theory I be sick and tired of theory right now we be under assault and Jane 's lead the charge but boss we 've see she take hit to the body but there be get to be a limit we get enough firepower to the right area there be get to be something that she can not heal from yeah maybe but the problem 's access she be get three unchipped neuroid freak with her chance be will not leave home without they then we will have to beat they at their own game March go go go go go go we get a problem boss yellow sector door to the sub perimeter Riley NICO remain under lockdown if you want you can get one of Rawlings man Boss we do not have time ok they be in trouble this guy he be red sector it stay lock those be my people down there they be my people too doctor that gate lead to the sub perimeter they could easily get to the outside world you could open it quickly I can not take risk they be go to die not if we get there first thank you Riley you keep that locked very Rambo pretty tough to heal from 200 round of hollowpoint Jane just long enough to grab your cute little traitor ass and throw it in lockdown there be just one problem with your plan I do not work alone now what we be we do not work alone either Riley open the door right the people at that gate be safe for now the same can not be say for Jane 's freak crew she be on her own now so that be good news yeah maybe but there be nothing to say she will not spring more playmate from hell that be probably the first thing she be go to do I think I get Jane but it be a pretty good bet give the location she be head to red sector we may not be so lucky next time I would like to think there be a little skill be involve we have to stop she how can we do that if she heal from gunshot we do not use gun Riley remember those explosive we use to blow the tunnel we still get any yeah there be enough chemical and supply to whip something up but they be a couple level down if we can get our hand on it I can rig up something that no one be go to walk away from not even Jane how long will it take about half an hour what be Jane 's position she will be back in red sector by then can you do anything about that I can not cut she off completely but I can sure as hell slow she down then what be you wait for I you see so much as a cockroach out there shoot the hell out of it and do not stop move my pleasure Riley just for that I be go to save you for last come on Riley where be she in the vent where in the vent I have do idea I mean whoever build this place do not have the foresight to install security camera in the air duct that be the last one we be ready Ready where the hell be we go to use it if we can not find Jane get she to find I look she will come out in the open if she think she have a clear shot how be you plan to detonate that without destroy yourself there be no other way maybe there be I 've be help Dr Newman access NICO 's research database our experiment be unsuccessful with electrical stimulation to the control portion of Baumgartner 's brain I be tell you about I discover a convergence of synapsis from the optical nerve and this node Great can we get someone in here to explain that in Hungarian so we understand it well ok for the Neanderthal 's among we there be a direct connection between the eye and the control center and there be probably a reason for that and it be possible the control node be activate by some kind of light source that would explain why direct electrical stimulation do not have any effect if we could hit that optical nerve with a high frequency spectrum it might be able to break the control and how do you intend to do that with this you do not see anything because you do not have the condition but to someone like Jane who do it will look like the 4th of July on steroid in theory she will go out like a light it be worth a shot yeah and if do not work I be dead and you be all not far behind no I will take the explosive as a back up I be the team leader I recruit Jane this be my responsibility no no no I be the one with demo experience it do not take an expert to push a button it do to reconnect a bad lead on the fly we will draw straw look like it be my lucky day yeah guess it be she be close boss Jane Jane you be be control Someone 's use you as a pawn there be a part of your brain that be be program but that be just like you be not it always pretend to be the rebel but all you end up do in the end be follow order have not exactly be follow yours have I then again you will not be give any when you be dead now Riley take one for the team you be once a part of that team Jane either you will be again or this all end right here this be bad do not make I do this while you be on vacation I track down Roberts to Vonotek the chairman he start it all he create Neuros he create I I be part of a second generation Neuro 2 0 now perfect it feel like kill you Connor and Riley betray Brian and try to take over NICO be be something I want to do I be a monster leave I here you have to leave I here find a way to chip I let they experiment that will not be necessary the light pattern work the synaptic activity at the control node have shift the node itself have shrink do you understand you be be control there be a part of your brain that be highly susceptible to command Roberts be able to access that use a high spectrum light none of this be your fault he be a dead man right now you be more valuable to this team than you have ever be this be a micro bug Roberts have it put in he could hear everything you could all Roberts know be his destruction of NICO fail he do not know that you be no long under his control it turn the chip on and off you can decide when Roberts listen in or when he do not you be a double agent now Jane we do not know how Roberts run his organization but with your help we will wake up on that table be like some kind of Wizard of Oz from hell that would make I the cowardly lion and Andre the heartless tin man no brainer I be the scarecrow Truth be tell Riley actually have as much courage as anyone on the team and Andre even though he do not like to show it have one of the big heart and I 've even get to admit that Connor can come up with a pretty damn brilliant idea every once in a while not that I will ever tell he I would do anything to protect this team and now that I be a double agent we just might have a chance at stop Roberts from whatever he be up to I know she would not make it he be go to kill you we all have our problem Neuros tag and bag boss this work be unlike any work you 've do before I call the shot in my life agent McBride your entire service record have be red flag what the hell be go on we hunt Neuros a dozen death trace directly to Vonotek he be on the express elevator you want to see I sir Pre sale figure we have order from 90 percent of target store throughout the country include every major chain that be great news look like retailer be bet that Vonotek 's new product will be every bit as successful as our pharmaceutical why would not they we be the most trusted company in the world if we be go to meet the demand and I intend to we be go to have to increase production and expand distribution which mean increase security we 've get to keep our secret sauce secret I understand in this case what people do not know will help they just think Randall in approximately four month the world will begin to experience the amazing benefit of neurological enhancement that be what I call food for thought VONO BAR supercharge yourself the dawn of a new age in human performance Transcript sw sub synch and revise subXpacio
