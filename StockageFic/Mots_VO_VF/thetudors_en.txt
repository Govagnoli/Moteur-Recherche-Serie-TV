have institute a Court of High Steward to judge Buckingham 's case twenty peer will be appoint to the court Norfolk will be first among they your Majesty if I may what I believe it could be dangerous to find the duke guilty of treason even if he be even if he be on the other hand he could be find guilty of some less offence heavily fine and banish from court in that way he would be disgrace but his friend and ally would have little cause or occasion to rise against you and that would be the good outcome I believe it would yes and you would see to it that the court come to that decision I have every confidence as I have in your Eminence Wolsey will set up the court Norfolk will head it I want you to remind his grace of his responsibility 14 30 Chase to four gentleman Ball Mary do the

remain be for you to choose where to live and to retire there as quickly as possible I swear to you all will be do for the good your grace my lord I believe you know why we be gather here in private we be here at his Majesty 's bidding his Majesty have request an enquiry into the nature of his marriage to Catherine of Aragon for the tranquillity of his conscience and the health of his soul for as it say in Leviticus if a man shall take his brother 's wife it be an impurity he have cover his brother 's nakedness they shall be childless now if my lord we be able to agree between ourselves that the marriage be in fact never legal and be proceed with against both canon and ecclesiastical law as his Majesty to his great regret have come to believe then it be my understanding that as papal legate I myself have the power and authority to dissolve and end it of course I would be grateful to hear the opinion of your lordship on this great matter your Grace I be inclined to agree with your Eminence though I reserve judgement until I have hear all opinion my Lord Fischer I see no merit in the king 's case so express none whatsoever if there be any obstacle to the king 's marriage then it be overcome by the pope 's dispensation the marriage be therefore legal as your Eminence know divorce be disallow by the Church that be my opinion Madam Lady Salisbury 's here your Majesty I have bring your daughter to say goodbye my baby your Majesty must be reassure the princess will be well take care of as befit her station you will be send regular report of her health and accomplishment and naturally you will visit she during the course of your Majesty 's progress you must make sure she practise her music she have a great facility for music be strong my daughter remember who you be the descendent of Isabella and Ferdinand of Castille the only daughter of the king of England be strong and be true and one day one day you will be queen yes Mama be he sorry do he repent it tell I do he beg my forgiveness your Majesty know his Grace you mean he do not send in my sister you be not wear black no your Majesty but you be in mourn your husband be dead I say your husband be dead he be alive my husband be alive I give you no permission to marry Brandon nor would I ever you give I your promise I be free to choose I make no promise you be mistaken how dare you look at I I be your lord and master not your brother you be both banish from court you will relinquish your London house you will remove yourself from my sight do you understand yes your Majesty and Margaret what I have yet to decide whether to make your bedmate a head short say yes say yes you be marry so so why deny I I do not love you be that all for I yes you be so beautiful Tom you be a lord what be I a genius what be it a parcel your Majesty who be it from the Lady Anne Boleyn a ship with woman on board what be a ship a ship be protection like the ark that protect Noah and the diamond what do it say in the Roman de la Rose a heart as hard as a diamond steadfast never change she be the diamond and I be the ship she say yes King Francis be eager for a rapprochement with your Majesty he be disgust at the treacherous behaviour of the emperor towards you behaviour he know only too well having suffer it himself at firsthand and offer you instead a true and lasting friendship it be true the emperor have betray we perhaps he be never sincere in the first place even so he still have friend at court which friend my agent intercept this letter the letter be from the queen she ask why the emperor do not write to she more often and promise as always to be his true and humble servant his servant not mine tell the french ambassador that we be in the mood for a rapprochement with King Francis tell he to send delegate let we be ally against this emperor my lady I lie claim to your maidenhead and I make you this promise when we be marry I will deliver you a son no I shall honour your maidenhead until we be married no less could I do for love oh my love Love by daily proof you shall I find to be to you both loving and kind I hate you you say it would be all right you say he would believe you you promise for the love of God wife do not call I wife I do not want to be your wife I hate you no you do not yes I do if it be not for you I would still be the queen of Portugal and now what be I you be drunk and you be foolish Henry will forgive we he be just stand on his pride we just wound his vanity believe I why should I I do not know if you be really brave or if you be just a fucking fool neither do I God thank you Alice I know you 've talk to Wolsey and I know you do not approve of what I be try to do it be against your conscience and I be not go to try and change your mind that be unlikely in any case but I need you to understand Thomas I need to explain I have be live with my brother 's wife and I have come to believe their marriage be consummate if that be true then I have be live in sin can you understand what that feel like Thomas that be why I ask the cardinal to examine the matter what if it can be prove that the pope 's dispensation be valid that there be no sin then I shall be the happy man alive I shall be content to live with Catherine until the end of my day wait I ask you again if the king be so troubled by his conscience why have he wait so long to bring this matter to a head because of his love for the queen he have deny the truth to himself but her failure to produce a live son be proof of it then he will want to remarry if his marriage be annul then yes I be certain he will remarry in the hope of produce an heir he have an heir I do not believe for a moment that the english people will accept his bastard son as a legitimate heir nor do the king he have a legitimate daughter my lord english history be litter with the tragedy of those who have try to pass on their crown to a daughter then he have a new wife in mind he have a mind to take one yes it stink I think you should be careful my lord as should you one of the great advantage of have a library be that it be full of book and some of these book contain ecclesiastical law and accord to those book you have no authority to judge this matter it be for the pope alone or those whom he appoint it seem that in this case your reach have exceed your grasp so I have invite a french delegation to visit your Majesty 's court to discuss a new treaty bind we together in the face of the emperor 's intransigence and aggression Good Excellent and since the emperor have renege on his promise to marry your daughter it could perhaps be politic to resurrect her betrothal to the dauphin or if the dauphin be already promise perhaps to the Duke of Orleans King Francis ' young son and what of your secret session have they come to a decision how soon can I expect my annulment your Majesty should not be concern but we be not able to come to a conclusion not able the matter be a complex one really how it be my consider opinion that we should apply to his Holiness Pope Clement for a ruling on this matter since he love your Majesty I be certain he will rule in your favour I hope so I certainly do hope so for your sake you can always tell the French oh yes Ponces but they never do anything so clever as give Wolsey a pension he be never fail they we must wait and see when the wheel of fortune have reach its zenith there be only one way for it to go move aside move aside out of my way I bring most important news your Majesty Rome have be sack let he through your Majesty I bring most terrible and calamitous news Rome have be capture and sack by the german and spanish mercenary they have plunder and befoul its church destroy its relic and holy treasure torture and kill thousand of its priest what of his Holiness the pope be a prisoner in the Castel St Angelo he be the emperor 's prisoner yes Lady Blount he catch the sweating sickness there be nothing we could do he complain this morning of feel ill and by this evening he be in the hand of God you think you know a story but you only know how it end to get to the heart of the story you have to go back to the beginning dear heart I can not say how much I miss you I wish myself especially in the evening in my sweetheart 's arm whose pray continue whose pretty breast I trust shortly to kiss neither tongue nor pen can express the hurt of not see you the only compensation be the thrill of anticipate our next meeting for what joy in this world can be great than to have the company of she who be the most dearly love well the king be plainly in love with you do not you see niece it make a man any man extremely vulnerable how do you like your charge sweetheart I at first I confess I do not like it so much I do not care for the king but now I now I Anne it would be wise for you not to be fool by your own masquerade it be your duty to use his love to our advantage in supplant Wolsey the cardinal stand between we and everything and it be now in your power to do he a great hurt and we expect you to do so I shall go straight to Paris to meet King Francis and ratify the new treaty between your Majesties and since his Holiness remain a prisoner of the emperor I have summon a conclave of the cardinal to meet in Paris it will be little matter to persuade they in the absence of the Pope to grant I licence and authority to make a final judgement on your Majesty 's annulment you leave with our blessing and with anticipation of your success your Eminence for which we be most impatient I be your Majesty 's true and humble servant oh I forget there be someone you should take his name be Thomas Wyatt the poet I do not like he he once possess a jewel I would have Lady Anne what be you do here I have an audience with his Majesty what would a silly girl like you have to say to a king your Majesty tell I he will succeed who sweetheart Wolsey he will will not he he will get an annulment of course he will do not you doubt it what be it be it not strange strange to trust so great a matter to just one servant whoever he be when your Majesty have a thousand servant ready and willing to do your bidding and when your very happiness hang upon this resolution my love this should not concern you forgive I I speak of thing I should not no no I give you leave that we may always speak freely with each other honestly openly and with a true heart for I that be the true definition of love forgive I ambassador for receive you here I be at your Majesty 's disposal Senor Mendoza help I of course I be your Majesty 's I need to get a message to the emperor I have no other way Wolsey open all my letter and now I know that he have turn several of my woman into his spy by what mean by money or even so they tell I by grant they sexual favour dear God how can I help the emperor be the head of my family I want he to know that the king be try to divorce I he want to keep it secret but he have already instigate proceeding it be impossible surely he need the Pope 's permission but the Pope be still the emperor 's prisoner Senor Mendoza for the love of our saviour Jesus Christ and the love of all that be sacred tell my nephew what be be do to I here leave it to I I will find a way to evade the cardinal 's spy what be you think about I be not think I be listen you work on something

put our hand into the fire if invite to I will miss you no you will not you will soon find other distraction tell I truthfully what be your hope for this mission I have many hope firstly to heal the wound cause by year of Anglo french hostility and then to work towards a new balance of power in Europe the sacking of Rome the imprisonment of the Pope these thing have destabilize the whole of Europe and the Church the Church be also in need of mediation at the conclave we shall lay plan for a general council which in the absence of the Pope will deal with press matter of heresy and reform and the king 's matter that will also be deal with but as one of a number of other matter do you think the cardinal will give you the authority to deal with it yes then you will be de facto Pope and since his Holiness may never escape captivity this be idle speculation I have work to do Sir Thomas why be you sit in the darkness what be wrong you do not understand of course I do I be your brother

into the creation of his college at Oxford I must admit I find your intimation shock indeed I be hurt Cardinal Wolsey be not only my chancellor he have always be my friend in this world Majesty a true and loyal friend be the great boon any man can have for in everything else there be a strange habit of forsake that remind I the Duke of Suffolk come to see I Brandon he say he would crawl on his hand

the Pope with these two bull be that correct yes these be extraordinary document do you know what be in they yes a little and you still agree to carry they the first document ask the Pope to permit he

to Mistress Anne Boleyn Anne Boleyn the king love Anne Boleyn yes sir and what be this prior relationship he refer to surely your eminence be aware that his Majesty have carnal relation with Anne 's old sister Mary perhaps even with their mother so it be rumour I give it no credence with regard to the mother and the second document have you read it no sir just as well I would not like to be the man that have to present this to the descendant of Saint Peter it ask this if no way can be find to nullify the king 's marriage then the Pope should allow he to take a second wife do you understand

unacceptable I be disappointed in his Majesty Thomas I have to ask you this will you accept the judgement of the cardinal what do it matter now the Pope be free there be no need for a conclave no there be more need than ever the Pope be still in the power of the emperor unable to exercise any control over the Church so someone else must do so and I ask you again will you accept the judgement of the cardinal more if you be not for I now then you be against I stake have grow high Mr Cromwell tell I that the king now dine with Norfolk and Boleyn they be my bitter enemy they constantly seek my downfall and if you do not help I then you help they need I remind you of this you owe all your advancement in this world to I Thomas we 've know each other a long time I know you 've often

continue to be little well there he lead a most sad life lock up in a ruin castle in which case why should the pope favour the emperor who have cause he nothing but misery over the king of England who have never cause he any harm at all the trouble be your Eminence the sword of the king of England be much far away than the sword of the emperor Diplomacy be nearly always settle by such proximity

Holiness in advance for your support of his nullity suit he know that you Holy Father will not object to our supplication I wish with all my heart to please and satisfy your master but I must say to you in all honesty as God be my witness as I be an honest man that I have be advise that this suit be prompt solely by the king 's vain affection and undue love for this woman Anne Boleyn it have be say to I that the king of England desire his divorce for private reason only and that the woman he love be far below he not only in rank but also in virtue Holiness who have tell you these thing they say that Anne be already pregnant and that the king urgently wish to make her child his heir to the throne Lady Anne be a model of chastity though very apt to procreate child when the time come Holy Father she impress everyone who see she or know she with the purity of her life her constant virginity her soberness meekness indeed of all the woman in England she be by far the fit to become queen but what of Queen Catherine his Majesty hope that when your Highness have take cognisance of the argument we have bring with we you will write to the queen to urge her compliance of course but first I must read these argument must I not before come to judgement his Majesty also make it plain to we that if you could not give he satisfaction then he must look for a judgement elsewhere he might be

to make a judgement here and today concern the king 's case wait I have not say it be the end of the matter I be resolve it should be settle as soon as may be but not here for you see how I be here so I be appoint Cardinal Campeggio as my official legate once the sickness in your country abate he will travel to England and together with Cardinal Wolsey constitute a court to hear and decide upon the merit of the case if your king be as certain of his rightness as you say he be then no doubt he will welcome the proceeding which can only hasten the fulfilment of his desire Come put they there your Majesty should know that his Grace the Duk e of Norfolk having catch the sweat ask ed to be allow back to London ostensibly to see a doctor this permission I refuse on your Majesty 's behalf three of your Majesty 's apothecary have also fall sick while three of your chamber servant have die your mason Redman be also dead the disease show no sign of abate there be now 40 000 case in London alone

of God and I know with certainty that when I die I shall pass into a far well place than this what you see around you be not the fear of death but the fear of what for the unrepentant must surely follow it there be a spectre haunt Europe which I fear far more than the sweat a sickness spread everywhere infect thousand of what do you speak Papa the disease of Lutheranism it spread among the poor those who see the church as rich and corrupt and decadent it have already ignite a peasant ' war in Germany and kill 100 000 people the contagion have spread to Burgundy Salzburg Montpellier and Nantes every day bring more news of the virulence of this heresy surely it will not come here it be already here we know of secret meeting here in the city of London where the Church be attack infamous book distribute let I ask you my child let I ask you what do you do with a house which be plague with sickness you purge it with fire exactly so in the same way the sickness which be in our house of faith must be purge with fire now I be against violence as you know but I believe that Luther and his follower should be seize right now and burn your Majesty multitude be die around we almost everyone in Oxford Cambridge and London have be ill recently since the cardinal have also be ill and your Majesty be go from court there be really no government to the kingdom there have be some riot in the city but your Majesty should not be alarm Sir come and see she get the master my lord my lord Papa come quickly George praise be to God you know what you have do child you have rise

for lack of time but that I would you be in my arm or I in yours for I think it long since I kiss you you have a letter from Lady Anne Boleyn my dear lord I be delighted to hear that you have escape the sweat all the day of my life I be most bind of all creature next to the king 's grace to love and serve your Grace I beseech you never to doubt that my opinion of you will ever change as long as I have any breath in my body your humble servant Anne Boleyn well at least she have a sense of humour Joan Arrange for my pilgrimage to Walsingham I must give thank to our Lady thank you thank you God you think you know a story but you only know how it end to get to the heart of the story you have to go back to the beginning your grace his Eminence Cardinal Campeggio Lorenzo my old friend my dear Wolsey come your Grace must forgive my incapacity God have give I gout as a great trial now his Majesty be very keen that the legatine court be set up straight away to determine the case for his annulment indeed indeed I have the pope 's write commission to decide upon this matter and from my decision there can be no appeal and yet if your grace have some water Water Mixed perhaps with a little wine and yet you and I be old friend and we be both man of the world Cardinal Wolsey I even have a son who travel with I and so his Holiness wish to satisfy the king however difficult that might be but for all our sake would it not be well if you and I be to try and persuade his Majesty to give up his divorce surely his passion for this girl will alter and fade with time as all such passion inevitably do I fear your eminence may have proceed here in ignorance let I make certain thing plain to you if you do not grant the king his divorce papal authority in England will be annihilate you should remember the great part of Germany have already become estranged from Rome the same thing could happen here it would mean the total ruin of the kingdom be there any danger that they could declare your marriage valid Wolsey have assure I that the pope have already decide in my favour the trial 's just for the sake of appearance a way of appease the emperor then we can start plan the wedding yes yes my love also for the sake of appearance there be something else for a while I shall have to share Catherine 's table and sometimes her bed her bed it be nothing my lawyer have just advise I that to do otherwise might risk countersuit I could be see to be act against her conjugal right you think it be nothing to go back to bed with your wife what do you think be go to happen what usually happen how little you trust I I trust you I love you Catherine be not to blame for this nor be I but the fact be Excellence we break God 's law for which there can be no dispensation you understand how deeply this touch my conscience and how quickly I need it to be resolve I do I sympathise as do his Holiness naturally but his Holiness also suggest to your Majesty another possible solution I have already make it plain to your Eminence that his Majesty no this be not the same my friend this be a solution which should very much please his Majesty what be it his Holiness be aware of the queen 's great piety she herself have speak of it her love for the Mother of God for the saint and he wonder if her Majesty might be persuade like Jeanne de Valois the sometime wife of Louis Xll to abdicate her marriage and retreat to a nunnery what do you think Wolsey well it would certainly expedite matter it would save we the pain of a trial and since it would be voluntary it could not offend her nephew the emperor and moreover it would afford her Majesty an honourable retirement you will put this to she right away Majesty will your Majesty at least consider the proposal I will give you my answer in due course after I have speak with the king my husband Father will you hear my confession later yes my child your Majesty your Eminence your Majesty I beg that you yield to the king 's will and what be his will as his Eminence propose that you join a religious community of your choosing and take a vow of perpetual chastity you speak to I of chastity have you not a mistress and two child your Eminence your Majesty be enter the third period of your natural life you spend the first two set a good example with this single act you could put the seal on all your good action please rise your grace it be not seemly for a man of your dignity to be see to beg in public whatever the cause Eminence so you talk to Campeggio yes I tell he I could not give an answer without your Majesty 's permission and what answer will you give he I will tell he the truth Catherine all the world now agree that your marriage to I be unjust even you must acknowledge it so unless you agree to take the veil I shall have to force you do I have your permission to talk to Campeggio I will not speak to he if you do not want I to my lady Lady Anne Master Cromwell do you have a message from the king I think we understand each other a mutual friend a Mr Fish now live in exile in Holland have send I a gift for you what be it Master Cromwell the Obedience of the Christian Man by William Tyndale it contain many good criticism of the papacy and of the arrogance and abuse of priest you will find it most illuminate but always and ever be cautious as to whom you show this you must know it might be account heresy even to possess it and Wolsey be still keen enough to prosecute heretic as we be call who embrace the true religion I will and God bless you Master Cromwell wait please will you give this to the king with my love my lady come here Chicken Chick Good chicken do not run away got you you never even tell I your name Jane Jane why do you leave the court when your sister die my sister be still here Thomas Tallis she have not leave I she can not leave I you can see she too can not you I come all the way from London and I really want you to come back to court why you like my sister more than I I could tell I want to marry you Jane what be it you wish to confess Father I wish to tell you about my first marriage to Prince Arthur his Majesty 's old brother I know of it go on he never know I I swear to you under the sacramental oath I be intacta e incorrupta da lui comme venne dal ventre di sua madra I want to be clear you say you be untouched and unviolate by Prince Arthur as when you come from the womb of your mother yes Father so you come to the king 's bed a virgin intacta e incorrupta yes Father Father I say in all humility I can not accede to your request I be the true and legitimate wife of his Majesty therefore your proposal be inadmissible come what may I will live and die in that vocation to matrimony to which God have call I I understand furthermore I give you permission to break the seal of the confessional and tell the whole world what I have tell you Henry want you back at court you be his sister after all how can I return while he flaunt himself with his slut I would be see to be approve of his ridiculous liaison Margaret you and I must stay in the king 's good grace or we be nothing let he marry who he wish that be always your philosophy be not it Charles so very cynical be that why you keep company with that devil Boleyn you like he enough once when he help we back to court or be you just be cynical I do not see all of his game now I do I despise he so do I but I hate Wolsey more it be a marriage of expedience rather like ours no I love you you do not know the meaning of the word you can love perhaps for a year or a month a day even for an hour and in that hour I do believe you love as well and deeply as any man but after that hour you love not you love another and then another your love be most generous where it be most hurtful Margaret do not play the fool do not become you Eminence I need to see Cardinal Campeggio forgive I my father be indispose in any case there be nothing furth he can do for the time be he have send some report to Rome and must await the reply from his Holiness and in the meantime my poor father need to rest and restore his strength Lady Anne good evening Lady Anne Boleyn there be the Mistress Boleyn yes there she be the girl for whom the king would sacrifice his marriage to a most gracious and love queen I have try to argue he out of his course but I swear that an angel descend from heaven would not dissuade he do you think they have take thing to the ultimate conjunction I 've receive a petition from the duke of Suffolk Norfolk and Lord Boleyn say the divorce have the support of the people of England as your Eminence would quickly discover if you step outside these door and see the people that be a manifest lie on the contrary the people love their queen and they have every reason to do so if you will excuse I Wolsey her Majesty have refuse the offer be you surprised however Campeggio tell I that the pope be prepared to consider legitimise any child that you might have with Mistress Boleyn whether you be married or not be you mad you be go to have to do a lot well than that forgive I Ambassador Mendoza I be new to this court who be these man talk with the king Lord Rochford be the father of Anne Boleyn Norfolk be her uncle like the Duke of Suffolk they be Wolsey 's sworn enemy and everyone at court know it they would stop at nothing to bring he down yet the king still love he not so much as before perhaps but the cardinal should never be underestimate may I know what you think of the king 's matter it be no secret that the emperor be outraged at the king 's behaviour toward the queen and I can tell you in strict confidence that he have write to his Holiness demand that the matter be settle in Rome not here he would not seek to interfere in any other way in what way well if the queen be to be renounce might he consider military intervention on her behalf he have not say so have anyone ask he no not yet your Majesty Margaret not her she be not worth it she be a cheap nothing open your eye look at her look at yourself look to your own marriage how be you burn burn with impatience my lady Archbishop Warham and Bishop Tunstall be here to see you my lord I understand that you be among my council for the legatine court as honourable man whose first duty be to God and your conscience you be welcome have the king send you yes your Majesty we must discuss your brief I have nothing against his Majesty whom I love with all my being only against his adviser and a certain woman whose ambition would ruin a kingdom Madam we be not here to discuss a brief or any such but we come here to report madam that rumour of plot against the life of his Majesty be abroad and plot against Cardinal Campeggio if any such plot be to be successful then clearly both you and your daughter would be suspect of involvement I can not believe the king would give credence to such rumour since he know as you know that I value my husband 's life even much more than my own Madam there be yet another complaint that you be flippant and show yourself too much to the people that you rejoice in their acclaim smile nod and wave at they therefore we suppose that you hate the king why should you suppose that because you do not accept that all this time you 've be live in sin with he even when the truth have be reveal you refuse to accept the king 's offer offer to retire to a religious house that again I have answer for that already God never call I to a nunnery I be his Majesty 's true and legitimate wife Madam for the love of God yes for the love of God as you yourself once profess archbishop you tell people that you know my case to be true so what change your mind be it Wolsey tell I do you prefer your place in this earth rather than your place in heaven you have not answer the charge Sir I consider it hard indeed to be charge and accuse by my own lawyer where be the justice in that I will speak to you no more but you will not act for I Catherine why do you go on deny I justice you be so heartless so full of hatred I can not persuade myself any long that you love I I do love you I have never cease to love you you know that I do not know it perhaps you should be keep away from our daughter in case you start poison her mind against I how can you say these thing to I after all this time after all that we have mean to each other I be only ask you to be reasonable I be be reasonable it be you who will not be reasonable what be it you really want Thomas want in life what do you want I do not know Travel I suppose Adventure if I could travel where would you go have you not hear Sea discoverer to new world have go Cabot to Newfoundland other to America the indie some speak of China Cathay the fabled land of Marco Polo but where would you go I would set out here though the hair be a forest of ambush and snare but the brow becalm we when it be smooth and plain and the dark pool of the eye be dangerous to our ship for to be draw into they would be shipwreck the nose like the first meridian direct we down to the Islands Fortunate the swell lip I would anchor here and hear the siren song then sail on past the glorious promontory of chin we may encounter survivor as we travel down towards your India and we pause at the atlantic navel then the current carry our pilot on to another forest where many be shipwreck and no far ever get I have a new motto what be it you will have to find it where be it on a piece of ribbon hide somewhere be it here no down there no be it down here I can not wait much long you will not have to your Majesty there be fresh delay no one can see Campeggio where be it tell I what if someone be deliberately stall delay thing make excuse Campeggio no no someone else someone much close to you I be touch it that be how it be go to be let they grumble someone much close to you I want to ask you frankly about Campeggio do you trust he do you think he be compromise who know perhaps he be get a pension from the emperor as I know it Lorenzo be the least prejudicial of man and he have suffer personally at the hand of Charles 's soldier when they enter Rome they ransack his house I do not believe he have love for the emperor then why be he delay the trial well there be some technical matter that need to be resolve that be all there be nothing for your Majesty to be concern about Goddamn it it be not Campeggio at all it be you you be the one delay thing you 've go cold on this divorce perhaps you never believe in it you lie to I pretend to be on my side Majesty I swear before you and before God on my honour I be your most humble servant and there be nothing on earth I covet so much as advance your divorce and to bring it to pass be my continual study and my most ardent desire for which I be ready to expend my life and my body and my blood so help I God come your grace do not be so dismayed you understand my impatience I know it be not you I trust you I 've know you a long time Come let us talk of other thing by God 's body Master More the anger of the prince mean death Majesty I want you to go to Rome Mr Cromwell I want you to force his fucking Holiness into submission if necessary tell he that if he do not grant I my annulment England will withdraw its submission to Rome and I will withdraw my allegiance to he and make sure he know this be no idle threat I mean it and I will do it if he do not satisfy I send in the Duke of Suffolk my Lord Duke the king summon you Charles I have a task for you I want you to go to Paris and seek out King Francis Question he closely about Campeggio ask he what kind of dealing he be have with he what kind of man he be be he honest do he have any ambition to be pope and ask he do he have any secret dealing with the emperor I will leave at once and Charles ask he about Wolsey I want to know everything he know about he you understand I want to know whose side Wolsey 's on Sir Thomas most gracious sovereign lady I have bring Bishop Fisher to see you I believe he can offer you true and devoted counsel thank you Sir Thomas Majesty please Lord Bishop be you certain that you wish to act for I you must be aware of the danger and difficulty you may face I would understand if you would prefer peace and tranquillity gentle madam what peace or tranquillity can there be without justice and the love of God I have study the case against you very carefully they will no doubt press the fact that the pope 's dispensation to allow you to marry the king be technically faulty and therefore invalid but the obvious way of resolve any such technical deficiency be not to declare the marriage null and void but to issue fresh and more perfect dispensation in any case the continuance of so long space have render the marriage honest and the principle of supplet ecclesia let the church provide have itself make good any defect in the pope 's dispensation then you suppose we may win we may win the argument yes but I can not pretend that it will avail we much we shall still try be of good cheer madam for we be on the side of the angel Hearts be trumps what be it I 've hear from Cromwell he be eventually allow access to the pope but write in desperation why he do not believe Clement will do anything for I he say it might be in his paternoster but it be nothing in his creed the pope might pray for I to solve my problem but he will not personally commit to do anything about it Show show I we entertain the pope as he pass and I speak personally to Campeggio he be very careful but even in the few word he speak I think he dissemble in what way dissemble I think he show one face but conceal another he have be ask to deal with a matter he secretly despise so my advice to the king my brother be to not put too much trust in any man in case he should be deceive and would you say the same of Cardinal Wolsey I have nothing against his Eminence of course not but what do you think his attitude be towards the divorce as I could tell he want the divorce to go through because he have no love for the queen at the same time at the same time it be my impression that he have marvellous intelligence with the pope they understand each other and also with Cardinal Campeggio therefore if he have such understanding with they and they be not minded to advance the matter then to speak frankly to you I think the king should take a close interest in it himself that be my advice Majesty where be he go I be sure to service his late mistress now why would he have to do that when he have such a beautiful wife you should ask he monsieur do not you ever want to pay he back of course always I be a woman then go to bed with I if you like but tell I first how be your beautiful wife she be she be just like I non you have affair and she ignore it to make love for revenge or pain what be that it hurt the mind and the soul it shrink the soul grow small and perhaps it even die your grace your Grace leave we the trial be come indeed your Grace I want to make it plain to you again if you refuse to grant the divorce you will provoke a marvellous opinion against the pope against the papal court and against the papacy itself I be oblige to the Holy Father to seek truth and justice in this matter and that your Grace I will attempt to do as God be my witness you still do not seem to understand so let I spell it out for you if you fail to find in favour of the king you will lose the king and the devotion of his realm to Rome and you will also utterly destroy I and that I can not allow I totally understand you must have faith Cardinal Wolsey God help I my lord it have become obvious that Wolsey be severely compromise and no long enjoy the affinity he use to share with his Majesty the king be suspicious of his first minister and we should encourage those suspicion it be time to bring he down here be a pamphlet you see it mock his period in office as a time of pride waste repression and ineffectual policy it be ready for distribution we shall call for the arrest of Wolsey and his agent the impounding of their paper and a thorough examination of his administration his corruption will be expose and treason guarantee all that remain Boleyn be for your daughter to prove to the king that all his suspicion be justify and then the cardinal will be naked to his enemy to England to England Christ Sorry sir sorry I be sorry stupid dog amen amen amen amen I declare this legatine court commission by his Holiness Pope Clement be now in session and all that be say here be say under oath and in the presence of God Almighty I call upon his Majesty to speak first as to this matter your eminence know well what cause I have to be here it concern some scruple I have regard my marriage which prick my conscience I have consult widely to discover the truth and I have read in Leviticus that it be against God 's law and a sin for I to marry my brother 's wife your Eminences I be not the only one who question the validity of my marriage all of my bishop share my doubt and they have sign a petition to put the matter to question my Lords I tell you now I never sign my name to any such document and if it appear there Court have not invite you to speak if it appear there then Bishop Tunstall write it without my consent the king have the floor sit down sir sit I be not go to argue with you now after all you be but one man as for the main issue if I be ask why I wait so long to bring this question to trial I shall answer truthfully that it be the great love that I bear for her Majesty which prevent I do so it be I myself who bear all responsibility for my conscience which trouble and doubt I gentleman of the court I ask for one thing and one thing only Justice in a moment the court will call upon the queen 's majesty to reply to the king 's statement but first I must tell the court that the queen have seek through her adviser to question the competence of this court to try her case far she question the impartiality of her judge finally she contend that this matter be in the hand of a high authority namely the pope and therefore can only be try in Rome now as for the first matter Cardinal Campeggio and I can confirm that we have the necessary authorization from his Holiness to try this matter here further we reject any notion of prejudice on our part and will continue to try the case here as we have be appoint so I call upon her Majesty Queen Catherine to address the court my lord Sir I beseech you for all the love that have be between we let I have justice and right give I some pity and compassion for I be a poor woman and a stranger bear out of your dominion I have no friend here and little counsel I flee to you as head of justice in this realm I call God and all the world to witness that I have be to you a true humble and obedient wife ever comfortable to your will and pleasure I have love all those whom you have love for your sake whether or not I have cause whether they be my friend or enemy by I you have have many child although it have please God to call they from this world but when you have I at first I take God as my judge I be a true maid without touch of man and whether or not it be true I put it to your conscience now what be she do Shame Catherine queen of England come back into the court come back into the court perhaps your Majesty should turn back you be be call this court have no meaning for I therefore I will not stay here Catherine queen of England come back into the court she spit in the face of papal law she hold this court in contempt you think you know a story but you only know how it end to get to the heart of the story you have to go back to the beginning my lord in the absence of the queen herself whom this tribunal have pronounce contumacious since she do not appear when summon we be try to determine whether or not her first marriage to Prince Arthur be in fact consummate in carnal copula we call a witness Sir Anthony Willoughby I understand you be in the escort take Prince Arthur to the nuptial bed I be sir my father be at the time steward of the king 's household so I be present when the prince be insert into Lady Catherine 's bed and also when he wake in the morning and do the prince say anything to you when you see he in the morning yes sir he say Willoughby I be thirsty bring I a cup of ale last night I be in the midst of Spain Silence Silence in the court anything else yes sir later that day he say to we Masters it be a good pastime to have a wife Silence in the court I believe we may have the bloodstained sheet to corroborate my lord 's story that would be most useful your Eminence most useful your Majesty gentleman the king ask why you be not in court I have give answer to that already could we go somewhere private why I have nothing to hide let my lady and the whole world hear what you have to say the king command that you surrender this whole matter into his hand otherwise the court will condemn you I be surprised to receive such a request from such wise and noble man as you I be but a poor woman lack both in wit and understanding how be I suppose to respond to a request make to I out of the blue you know perfectly what the king desire and what he shall have all I know Eminence be that you for your own purpose have kindle this fire all this time all these year I have wonder at your high pride and your vain glory I have abhor your voluptuous life and have no regard for your presumptuous power and your tyranny I know also of your malice against my nephew the emperor you hate he like a scorpion and why because he would not satisfy your ambition and make you pope by force you should never presume to know my only satisfaction be that in frustrating you I hasten your fall from the king 's good grace an outcome I desire above all other hold your Eminence you will not get your divorce this way it be the only way Friend give I a drink I be thirsty and if you would all be to Spain as many time as I go there last night you would all be fucking thirsty too in and out in and out in and out and I will tell you this lad first time I lie with a lady I be but a chit of a lad so high to a grasshopper I be I poke she all night a toast I say a toast to Queen Catherine who do not give a fig God bless she to the queen of England his Majesty the king my lord your Majesty you look splendid so my source have just tell I that the emperor believe Wolsey be to blame for instigate the divorce he believe that the people of England will soon rise up and bring that creature to the scaffold his end be surely approach after which your grace will be the first man at court as you ought to be in which case Boleyn I shall not fail to promote your family 's interest it be true you have rise high but you shall rise higher yet do you see they be all look at you I be glad I want they to look at you I want they to be envious I want all of they to know exactly how much I love you then like my family motto I be the most happy how do it go in court today well enough yet Catherine refuse to attend it will make no difference Wolsey promise I I will have a divorce by summer promise be easy what if you do not Margaret what be it I could not sleep come back to bed it be cold not yet I be go to court tomorrow will you come your brother have ask again for your presence I tell you not while he make love in public to that Boleyn girl it be offensive and it make he look like a fool everyone else can see how proud and grasp the Boleyns be why can not he what if he command you to come what be this only a wife to a husband sleep now my sweet Charles I pray you sleep Silence in the court in the absence of the queen we have be ask by her council Bishop Fisher to make a statement to this court and be the circumstance we have decide that such a statement be admissible your grace your Honours you have be ask to give verdict on the validity of the royal marriage Sirs it be my contention that this marriage of the king and queen can be dissolve by no power human or divine let I give if I might a biblical parallel you will remember I be sure the tyrant Herod Antipas who disembarrass himself of his wife in order that he might take his brother 's wife damn you and who then execute John the Baptist when he dare to criticize the royal couple just as John the Baptist so I in all humility say to you here today that I be ready to lay down my life to lay down my life to defend the sanctity of marriage and to condemn adultery outrageous your Honours I accuse this man Bishop Fisher of arrogance temerity and disloyalty I demand that you disregard every vile word Thomas come in Drink not for I thank you no I have a mission for you Thomas the french and lmperial force have cease their aggression there be to be some sort of conference at a place call Cambria in France between their negotiator and also with representative of the pope I of course be

somewhat undo he have be refuse permission to attend court then who should I attend instead Norfolk Suffolk and Rochford they be now close to the king and carry out his affair seek they out if you would know thing you should also know ambassador that they be not great friend of mine any of they in fact well to say they be all my mortal enemy make way Cardinal Wolsey you be here charge with praemunire that be exercise your power of papal legate in the king 's realm thus derogate the king 's lawful authority you be to be dismiss of all your office and all your good shall be take to the king 's hand I take it you have the king 's write authority for this you be command to relinquish the great seal of your office and where be I to go to the king 's house at Jericho to await the

today as soon as your work be finish and forget everything else I would not only communicate thing to you for my own comfort and relief but would also have your good sad discreet advice and counsel in haste this Saturday with the rude hand and sorrowful heart of your assured who love you Wolsey Wolsey plead guilty to all the charge make against he yes I hear and sentence to prison I have rescind his punishment I 've even agree to let he keep the Bishopric of York with a pension of 3000 angel you see what kind of monster I be I need to appoint a new chancellor someone I can trust you be train as a lawyer and in royal service you have international prestige the friend of Erasmus the great humanist in all England you have a fine sharp mind no no what no I do not want to be Chancellor you will do as I command listen Thomas I know you have scruple concern my divorce and I swear to you it will only be deal with by those whose conscience agree with it I will only use you for other thing and I will never let it molest your conscience look Tom I want you nay I command you in all the thing that you do to look to God first and only then to I you think you know a story but you only know how it end to get to the heart of the story you have to go back to the beginning his Majesty the king my lord and councillor there be a great deal of work to do in the past those who hold the rein of government deceive I many thing be do without my knowledge or my approval but such proceeding will stop in the future your grace will be appoint president of the council jointly with the Duke of Suffolk your Majesty we shall convene again very shortly to discuss those matter which remain close to our heart a word although it please I much that Wolsey be no long here among we yet even in his absence do he not cause you disquiet how so he be attaindere but not for treason which mean he still live and so long as he live he remain a danger both to the realm and to we he be far away in York in disgrace I think you exaggerate the danger and I think that you do not understand it the king as you know could easily change his mind and if he do if Wolsey ever return to this court we would both have cause enough to fear his vengeance this be intolerable we must have the roof mend with what and by whom we have no money and no bloody servant surely the king never mean you to live so wretchedly after all you be still archbishop of York well perhaps it be not the king 's fault I have have cause to remember the old prophecy when the cow rideth the bull then priest beware thy skull you mean that cow Anne Boleyn indeed so which be why I be write she this letter even if she be the cause of all our misery well yes since she be the cause she can also be the cure I just have to persuade she that I be not her enemy but her friend I still have the letter in which she promise to reward I for all my pain and effort at such time as she becomes crown I seem to remember at the time you think her promise rather amusing well yes perhaps I do since then I have rather lose my sense of humour Sir Thomas I notice you allow yourself none of the trapping of your office I be not so vain as to display its power Master Cromwell but I tell you this I fully intend to use it may I ask to what effect here for example here be a report of a sermon recently give in Cambridge by a certain Hugh Latimer a senior member of the university and I quote Mr Latimer say that holy scripture should be read in the english tongue of all christian people whether priest or layman he rage against the gilding of image the running of pilgrimage and superstitious devotion he say that all man be priest and that we have no need for priest or pope on Earth Times have change Master Cromwell now I plainly see the risk and danger involve in such an open door policy towards these newfangle erroneous sect you condemn all reformer as heretic Wolsey be far too soft on they I intend not to be will you burn they this belief that pope and clergy possess separate power and authority be contrary to scripture the king be the representative of God on Earth and his law be God 's law the ruler be accountable to God alone and the obedience of his subject be an obedience require by God for the Church and the pope to rule the prince of Europe be not only a shame above all shame but an inversion of the divine order one king and one law in God 's name in every realm this book be a book for I and for all king and there be other book like it book which detail the abuse of power privilege the greed of the clergy in your Majesty 's realm book which Wolsey deliberately keep hide from you I should like to read they now I 've take power unto myself I shall work day and night if necessary to resolve thing include my annulment I swear to you now everything will be different his Majesty the king Ambassador Chapuys your Majesty I hear you be a very able and intelligent diplomat like I I be sure you be aware of all the new religious controversy I know of some new heresy that have spring up here and there certainly if only the pope and his cardinal could set aside their vain pomp start live accord to the precept of the gospel the and early father I be well aware your Majesty be in the midst of an argument with his Holiness I be not talk about myself you see when Luther attack the vice and corruption of the clergy he be right have he stop and not go on to destroy the sacrament and so on I would have raise my pen in his defence rather than attack he the need for reformation in the Church be manifest the emperor have a duty to promote it as do I in my own domain I be glad we 've have this opportunity to exchange opinion your Majesty Ambassador I be surprised you have so much time to do what to do nothing what be you say be not you suppose to be run the country I leave that to Norfolk he be have more practise in any case meeting with ambassador infinitely tedious they be all liar hypocrite and middle aged man would you prefer they to be woman my friend if all ambassador be beautiful woman l'd be serve my country day and night here we be your grace let I present my ward Miss Catherine Brooke Sir Anthony Knivert Miss Catherine Sir Anthony 's one of our fine horseman except for when I fall off you enjoy your walk yes good then I sha not delay you any far put your back into it lad pretty little thing be not she indeed she be I be go to marry she you 've be in exile Mr fish yes sir it be Cardinal Wolsey 's pleasure to keep I in Holland for fear I might speak the truth so why do you try to return I think sir that with the cardinal fall and send away that circumstance in this country might be change for the well more tolerant do you have friend in this country of course sir as an Englishman at court do you have friend at court do you deny you be the author of this work a Supplication for the Beggars no sir what be it Sir an appeal to his Majesty to redress many of the terrible and scandalous abuse of the Church you seem to suggest that the real aim of the Church be to seize all power lordship obedience and dignity from the king in fact you go far you claim that the Church itself be a source of rebellion and disobedience against the king do not you Mr fish and here Mr Fish if I may you say that the exaction take from the people be not give to a kind temporal prince but to a cruel devilish bloodsucker drunken in the blood of the martyr and saint of Christ Shame on you Mr Fish for who be these cruel devilish bloodsucker but the anointed priest of our holy Church those who show we the way to heaven but then you do not believe in that either do you Mr Fish who be you I be a christian man the child of everlaste joy through the merit of the bitter passion of Christ this be the joyful answer it be also heresy what be it what have she do she be wear purple and purple be the colour of royalty you know I sometimes wish that all Spaniards be at the bottom of the sea Mistress Boleyn you should not abuse the queen 's honour with such language I care nothing for Catherine I would rather see she hang than acknowledge she as my mistress be that it yes your Majesty thank God what be it Mr Cromwell your Majesty I Mr Cromwell I must beg your Majesty 's indulgence and forgiveness before I go on I have cause recently on a visit to Waltham Abbey to speak to a learned friend there we speak about your Majesty 's great matter we come to the conclusion your Majesty 's adviser might not perhaps be approach the matter in the most convenient way to solve it you mean through the court yes as your Majesty well know king be set above the law they be answerable to God alone who anoint they so it seem to we that the matter be not and never have be a legal one it be a theological one but in that case who should pass verdict upon it we would suggest that your Majesty canvass the opinion of theologian at college around Europe their sentence would be pronounce and could be implement with little industry and by that simple measure I trust that your Majesty 's troubled conscience might be pacify will you write a paper show your argument Lf your Majesty trust I to do so no I command you to do so then I command you as a royal agent visit the university in Europe I want the opinion of their theological faculty as soon as possible thank you Mr Cromwell there be still time to recant of your heresy Mr Fish if you acknowledge that your opinion be misguide evil contrary to the law of God then you will be spare the great pain you must otherwise endure I beg of you acknowledge your sin God will welcome you back into his fold Recant Recant you still have a moment the Lord be my shepherd I can want nothing he feedeth I in green pasture he leadeth I to fresh water though I should walk now in the valley of the shadow of death yet I will fear no evil for thou art with I Thy staff and thy sheep they comfort I Thou preparest a table for I against mine enemy my head Thou anoint with oil and filleth my cup full oh let thy love kindness and mercy follow I all the day of my life that I may dwell in the Lord 's house for ever I have something I want to say to you I have decide to ennoble you and your family you be to be create Earl of Wiltshire and Ormonde and I be also appoint you Lord Privy Seal George will become Lord Rochford and be make a member of council your Majesty I be lose for word your bounty be uncease I also have high hope for Mr Cromwell I be glad he be a friend of the family you know his thesis I want you to visit the pope and the emperor at Bologna I want you to put to they our new case please tell I you be not lose hope it be true I I have always fancy that the king after pursue his course for some time would turn away would yield to his conscience and change his purpose as he have do so often before I believe with all my heart that he would return to reason but now l Madam I pray you do not give way no Excellence I shall never give way thank you for what you have do for my father for my whole family there be more I 've make alteration to Wolsey 's old palace at York Place you say you like it I be give it to you what be it have I make you unhappy no I would only be unhappy if you ever stop love I London would have to melt into the Thames first it be everything now for the lady Anne Sir Thomas do this not remind you of a wedding feast it seem to I that nothing be want but a priest to give away the nuptial ring and pronounce the blessing God forbid that should happen it be none of my business my new job as chancellor will be to do my utmost to contend for the interest of Christendom perhaps the king 's Majesty be more inclined towards the Reformers than you know I do not think so I know he well than you do Excellence his deep instinct be traditional and faithful he may threaten to break with Rome but I do not think he will ever do so I hope you be right the consequence would be unthinkable everything seem to move in your favour your Grace I have bad news I happen to know that the king have send Wolsey an intaglio portrait of himself so so it be traditionally a sign of goodwill it may presage a reconciliation a small gift to ease the king 's conscience be hardly a sign that the bishop of York will be restore to his former glory think of it this way when Satan fall from heaven be he ever invite back you be I see that you have accept patronage from Mr Cromwell Mr Wyatt how very transparent the world be but be I wrong to do so Tallis I think so yeah you should be your own man do not be a fool Tallis you will not survive long in this slippery world without the support of a great man you think Mr Cromwell be a great man no I think he be a come man mark my word for what it be worth I do fuck she what be it Thomas I have have a reply to my letter from Mistress Boleyn what do she say that she will not speak to the king on my behalf then our hope be over no no no I have resolve to write to another lady who be far great far great than that mischievous whore and far more likely to be kind Madam the king be here please be seat Majesty I come because I hear you be unwell and that it be necessary for the physician to have bleed you how be you feel now I be very well your Majesty be kind to show concern how be our daughter she write to I in perfect Latin and tell I she dance the galliard and can play the lute much to everyone 's satisfaction and joy you should be proud of her I be proud of her you ought to invite she to court you could watch her dancing and play it might please you Catherine l I hear that several of your agent have be send abroad to canvass theological opinion about the divorce for every scholar that vote for you I could find a thousand who would vote for I my lord every day I be force to read new report of dissatisfaction confusion and delay throughout my kingdom my exchequer be empty and we be borrow money at a biting rate your Graces be president of this council and yet I hear nothing from you on these matter nor any other matter your Majesty must forgive I yes I know I must always forgive you but I grow tired of forgive you I have give you everything include the right to call yourself prince and what do I get in return I use to think the cardinal vain self serve and greedy just as you tell I but now I understand the burden he carry uncomplainingly your Majesty should not forget that he also steal from you and he serve the interest of the French even above those of England be that what you think Thomas it be certainly true that the cardinal be vainglorious beyond measure it do he tremendous harm and make he abuse the considerable gift God give he and yet he be a well man than any of you for manage this kingdom 's matter I will talk to he yes you must Ambassador Chapuys your Majesty Ambassador I have a letter for your Majesty from the emperor no from Cardinal Wolsey this be so strange do you know what it say the cardinal be offer to create a rapprochement between you and he the emperor and Rome the coup would be signal by the arrival of a papal edict order Henry to leave Anne Boleyn and return to his marriage the emperor will offer his financial and moral support and insist that Wolsey be reinstate as chancellor do you think it could work the cardinal be nothing if not ingenious I want you to set up a new parliament important thing need to be do my exchequer be empty for one thing I will do as your Majesty command but I must warn you that you may not find this parliament as compliant as those before how so well though I must confess to be amongst those who call for great tolerance and freedom of speech I fear that the freedom so give by your Majesty 's kindness be now openly abuse there be many dissent voice in the kingdom chiefly on religious matter there be call for a reformation how many have you burn Thomas six all lawful necessary and well do well do yes Harry what do he say well in so many word he tell I that he be inclined to pardon Wolsey and restore he to royal favour and what do you say I agree with his Majesty that the cardinal have many talent you do what I agree with the king that his Eminence have many talent I can not believe this have you not speak yourself of the terrible vengeance he would exact on we if he ever again have the power or perhaps you do not think vengeance to be one of his many talent I do indeed which be why I cultivate the king 's good grace your Majesty will be pleased to know that the University of Paris the great prize of all have declare in your favour and Italy I confess that the university there be divide but Padua Florence and Venice have all declare for your Majesty Spain Catherine 's country Spain be against be you surprised and

Cranmer virtually nothing he be an obscure cleric a nobody there be strong rumor that he be a secret lutheran then we should not approve his appointment no not in my opinion holiness and yet we want to give the english church the opportunity to return to its first allegiance and our true faith we want to please the king we want to make he beholden to we what well way to please he than to approve the appointment of a nobody after all what harm can a nobody inflict upon our holy church your grace we be most pleased to see you confirm as archbishop your majesty I confess I have some scruple

spiritual matter will be hear not in Rome but in England where the king will now enjoy plenary whole and entire power pre eminence authority prerogative and jurisdiction which mean I take it that the act prohibit the hearing of the king 's nullity suit by the pope and by the same token bar the queen from appeal to the vatican against any decision make here exactly no english sovereign have ever be grant such absolute power Poor Katherine it be bad there be rumour that the king have marry Anne in secret no and that she be already with child your eminence at the conclusion of this properly constitute ecclesiastical court I be ready to pronounce the verdict agree by we all it be a pity that certain person refuse to come here and testify but that in itself hold no bearing upon our

lawful in the eye of god Sir Elizabeth not that then what I come on behalf of my lady though not with her permission Thomas she be in a most wretched way abandon and betray it seem so cruel of the king to humiliate she in every way pretend to marry that Harlot what do you not know the duke of Suffolk come to tell she that the king have marry Anne Boleyn but what can I do about any of that you

Elizabeth but what about you if you still have feeling for I you will speak out for her I be sorry as the successor of st Peter I do solemnly condemn the separation of the king of England from Katherine of Aragon and his subsequent secret marriage which I declare null and void this matter of the validity of his majesty 's marriage can only be decide by the curia which have not yet reach its

obstinacy for not give your reason you must have some view of the statute I have this view that the act of Parliament be like a double edged sword for ever a man answer one way it confound his body and if he answer another it confound his soul but if you do not answer at all you will incur penalty his Majesty have command I to draw up an act of attainder against you this will make your imprisonment permanent Poor Alice Sir Thomas why will you not take the oath thousand have many I be sure share your belief and your faith and yet not your scruple well as for that some may do it for favor and some for fear and some may perhaps think they can later repent and be shriven and God will forgive they and some other may be of a mind that if they say one thing but think another then their oath go upon what they think and not upon what they say but I can not use such way in so great a matter in which case and in all honesty Sir Thomas you be likely to pay the ultimate price Mr Cromwell there really be no difference between we except that I shall die today and you tomorrow forgive I but be not you Margaret More Sir Thomas ' daughter yes sir I be Eustace Chapuys the Emperor

equal measure to my love for he be the spirit that deny it be up to you to judge whether or not he be on my conscience Sir Richard good day to you I see my cell be fast become the place for lawyer to meet I be afraid Thomas that I come here most unwillingly for I be order to deprive you of all your book and paper and suchlike that be a pity still if you be order to I suppose then I suppose there be no other way you have well get start may I ask you a question Thomas only if it be a hypothetical one Richard it be well that way suppose then that Parliament enact a bill to say that I Richard Rich be King and that it would be treason to deny it would you accept I as King yes but let I counter with another hypothetical case suppose Parliament enact that God be not God and to oppose the act would be treason would you say that God be not God no since no Parliament can make any such law it have no competence to decide on the existence of God and no more can Parliament make the King Supreme Head of the Church there Thomas I think my work here be do your Majesty the King be here my Lady come here do you still have a passion for I I do sweetheart I love you there now do not weep do not weep my own darling it be all right everything be go to be all right Sir Thomas more you be arraign before this commission on charge of high treason how do you answer the charge let I begin by deny that I ever maliciously oppose the King 's marriage to Anne Boleyn I have never speak maliciously against it but only sometimes accord to my mind opinion and my conscience and have suffer as a result but you have maliciously deny the Act of Supremacy no I have be silent upon it and for all my taciturnity neither your law nor any law in the world be able justly and rightly to condemn I unless you may also lay to my charge either some word or some deed your silence can easily be construe as an action but even in that case the presumption that silence give consent preclude the charge against I Qui tacet consentire videtur what of the charge that you conspire in prison with Bishop Fisher a convict traitor I never meet he in prison I only talk a little with his servant about familiar thing and recommendation such as be seemly to our long acquaintance we go back to your suppose silence on the Act of Supremacy we think you have in fact speak about it and we have a witness call the solicitor general call Mr Richard Rich Richard you be under oath do you tell this commission truthfully what the accuse say to you on this matter yes sir we agree that Parliement might not make any such law that God be not God to which Sir Thomas say no more can Parliament make the King Supreme Head of the Church so he maliciously deny the King 's authority in those word yes Sir in those exact word then I will charge this commission to return a true verdict I ask you good Sirs to determine whether Sir Thomas More do converse with Sir Richard Rich in the manner allege you do so find he guilty then I will proceed in judgement against the prisoner my Lord when I be a lawyer the convention be to ask the prisoner before judgement be give why judgement should not be give against he what then be you able to say to the contrary thank you to my view this indictment be ground upon an act of Parliament directly repugnant to the law of God and his Holy Church the supreme governance of which no temporal Prince may presume by any law to take unto himself it belong it belong by right to the see of Rome to St Peter and his successor as our Saviour tell we himself when he be on earth this realm be but one small part of the Church can not make any particular law disagreeable to the general law of Christ 's universal Catholic Church no more no more can this realm of England refuse obedience to Rome than can a child refuse obedience to his own natural father we now plainly see that you be maliciously bent no sir not maliciously I hope we may all meet merrily in heaven hereafter and I desire Almighty God to preserve and defend the King 's Majesty and to send he good counsel Sir Thomas more you be to be draw on a hurdle through the City of London to Tyburn there to be hang

and damnation George Boleyn Lord Rochford be to marry Lord Morley 's daughter yes your Majesty Lord Morley come to see I he can not meet Sir Thomas Boleyn 's demand for a dowry of 300 pound I assure

a duck which the monk renew regularly Duck 's blood well Mr Cromwell what do you propose we do about it if your Majesty will forgive I I think we should be look for way to promote your Majesty 's New Monarchy what do you have in mind one way would be through the production of play why play play be an ideal way of set forth before the people 's eye the abomination and wickedness of the Bishop of

than I be I trust in time to prove it our quarrel lie not with he but only with those close to he it be very well for you to sound so high and mighty but you and your kind be also to blame for not advise the King honestly about the spread of heresy and abuse throughout his kingdom for what be Cromwell and Cranmer but heretic and manifest abuser of this commonwealth Lord Darcy as I tell you we mean no displeasure to any person we ask for shelter and free passage all our pilgrim have take an oath not to slay or murder out of envy but to put away fear for the commonwealth and march with the

your Majesty and what of the royal army what be they do to crush this rebellion where be his grace the Duke of Suffolk and that bastard Shrewsbury I tell he too what in God 's name be these man do Lord Darcy my Lord Darcy and York have betray I well we shall see what end they come to and why have not Shrewsbury and Suffolk attack yet all I hear be their complaint and their excuse you know what I think I think they have become afraid of their own shadow I have a mind to go North myself I will lead the army I will teach these bastard ingrate and rebel a fearful bloody lesson in slaughter I wish your Majesty would not consider do so why do you suppose I be too feeble I mean that your Majesty 's life be far too precious to be put at risk against such a common rabble of course if you choose to go you would be like a lion among wolf Sir Francis I do not require you to flatter I no your Majesty send a plain message to Suffolk ask he why he refuse to obey my command and ask he if he be a coward Majesty and Mr Cromwell if thing go badly I know well enough who to blame can I get your Majesty anything for your pain yes I believe you can your grace the Earl of Shrewsbury be here my Lord your Grace Men dismiss your grace your Grace we meet at a desperate moment my Lord not only be the rebel force overwhelmingly strong against we but those man I do have I can not altogether trust

almost no horseman and those I do have be rather the flower of the North it be not possible your lordship to give battle know defeat to be a certainty do you have some other plan I intend to parley with they Parley my Lord it be our first duty to stop they escape and march South if they be talk they be not march then you must tell the King Shrewsbury 's force be here Suffolk 's here not far from Newark it seem likely that they have originally plan to hold a line here along the River Trent to block our advance southward how strong be they we think that Shrewsbury 's man be 6000 Suffolk 's a lot less they also lack horse and cannon and how many be we by my reckoning somewhere over thirty thousand Thirty Thousand we have keep large force here at Doncaster at Jervaux Abbey and we be presently lay siege to the Earl of Cumberland 's castle at Skipton North of the River Don we have almost complete control of the country let they come on to we with God on our side Mr Aske we shall prevail poor you your Majesty pour the ointment over it I smell sorrel and linsee Meadowplant crush pearl herb of grace other thing I concoct it myself I do not trust my physician hold still you be very brave Lady Misseldon Braver I think than my Captains and much more beautiful there it be do I trust your Majesty be more comfortable do your Majesty wish I to stay it seem we be wrong to suppose that the King of England would realize his mistake and the danger to his soul instead he continue to encourage Cromwel to vandalize and defile the house of God and steal their treasure all for his own use and pleasure and yet even in the darkness there be a light I mean this great uprising of the faithful this Pilgrimage of Grace I have hear of it too the pilgrim who march beneath the banner of Christ the Holy Father ask you to write a pamphlet in English denounce the King and his advisor as heretic of course I will start work on it straight away no no wait wait his Holiness need more from you than just your signature with my encouragement he have decide to appoint you an official legate you will travel to France and to the Low Countries and meet representative of the King and the Emperor Eminence you will persuade they to provide monie arm and mercenary to support this most Holy Crusade in England if that be what his Holiness ask I to do then of course I will do it like an obedient son to a father his Holiness have agree to make you a Cardinal and here be your biretta I can not accept why not I be not worthy in other word you prefer your own judgment to that of the Pope your Holy Father no doubt you suppose that make you seem humble but actually it be the sin of pride for the Pope his grace inform your Majesty he have no choice in the matter but to treat with they in so do he hope to bring the noble and the gentry to treachery and for their own sake and their own interest they will disown the common if promise a pardon as in fact happen in Lincolnshire they be not all to be pardon not the leader never the leader but what term do my Lord Suffolk intend to offer the common to make they go home Huh his grace do not go into detail but to allay your Majesty 's fear he write in his own hand I beseech your Majesty to take in good part whatever promise I shall make to these rebel for surely I shall never keep any of they Alas you unhappy man what fancy what folly

against the King that heretic Cromwell and all his sect we have hear some information certainly and naturally we be intrigue these popular rising be the great chance that we may ever have to restore the true religion to England but the faithful people of my country need support each of we senor Mendoza in our own way must encourage the rising to continue and to grow in strength even if that mean the overthrow of the King himself not just his wicked council yes we can imagine such an outcome without fear for there be another close to the throne with a legitimate claim and a true faith the Lady

why be you so sure that their word be not to be trust because of this what be that a copy of a letter from Cromwell to the Yorkshire gentry I will read some of it to you there be hope they may disperse peacefully but if these rebel continue with their illegal assembly and their defiance then their rebellion will be crush so forcibly that their example shall be fearful to all subject so long as the world do endure so long as the world do endure gentleman but the truth be they can not crush we and that be why the Duke be force to negotiate this sure sign of their deviousness do not impress

all of we agree there be at least 40 000 reble armed and in the field and yet your grace find only 74 guilty I hang those with the leader and most guilty inside rebellion have you actually be there to hear the evidence I must be honest with your grace you have be accuse of too great of leniency towards the rebel towards recalcitrant monk and other upholder of the old religion it it be disrepute whether you be in your heart and soul fully engage in struggle against the treason rebel or Wheather you be in your heart still papist who accuse I his Majesty consequently his Majesty now demand your return North and carry out an proper and efficient reprisal against these rebel and treator you be to make a terribly example of they and teach those part of the virtue of loyalty 74 be an inadequate number your grace since you ask I for the truth I will answer that in all part of the realm man 's heart be most hurt by the destruction of the abbeyes Becuase they think perhaps with a reason that this be the first fruit of the destruction of their whole religion in England this letter of yours on the 19th of Jan you write to reassure the mayor of common Pontefract I should keep a clean true heart to God on the King and whatever more far to be a true petitioner for the common wealth good you sign it T Dacy I remember it but I be not sure what be wrong with it can you not agree be it rather spread fauls foolingness for example the parish church we be go to put down which actully cause rebellion no it be the fact that the abbey be be suppress and burn it be 19th of Jan that after the King declare his Pardon and rebellion have end but I understand the King have also agree to a free paliament where subjest could still show their grief complain my letter be only mean to I will tell you what it mean my Lord what it mean be even after the King 's gracious pardon you have not change your traitor 's heart and opinion you continue to seek the annulment of law that make for the good of the commonwealth and you still wish to depose the King tell I why they be so important to you because the abbey in the North give arm to poor man and Lord belief to serve God they be one of the beauti of this realm to all man and stranger be alike they take care of their servant their tend and their local community in every sort of way from maintain bridge and seawall to see girl and boy be bring up in virtue and when they stand people not only have world of refreshment in their body but they also have a spirtual refuge so you grudge this suppression and the King 's supremacy after such confession Lord forgive we it be not Mr Aske but you who be the very oringal and chief cause of all this rebellion and mischief although you could probably find some way of have all the nobal man 's head of the realm strike off you if you want yet I trust there might be on leave who can still to strike off yours well may it surprise you to learn Mr Aske there be very reason I attempt to save you you 've be here for 2 day but still you do not talk to I even though you be unhappy how have you know you wake in the night you say thing what do I say unburden your heart if I do believe I everything will change I be command to return North to carry out retribution I must excute more rebel only this time I will trial proper process many yes many many hundred thousand I must kill hundred of man woman or child or I will lose the love of my King Women and child I have no choice of course you have choice what if they be your own child I will still have to do it his Majesty the King stand up Mr Aske Mr Cromwell have report your word to I I 've come to talk to you about the abbey and the religious house you care so much about please you have so much affection for these monk yet I can prove to you how far they be from good religious man they claim to live in willful poverty chastity and obedience yet they mass possession and put themselves outside the law they be religion prince yet but out our responsibility and what be willful poverty anyway and that be for obedience God help we how can they be obedient when they disoblige their sovereign Lord whom by God 's commandment they ought to obey in all thing we should not think of these man as good religious man who forsake all earthly possession as they claim but rather as idle and sturdy vagabond I like you Mr Aske you be

marriage after all however much be do to protect the Prince let I free my mind why not what do you suggest I take the liberty of instruct our ambassador in France and the Low Countries to begin make enquiry and the French have propose two possible consort for your Majesty Marguerite the daughter of the King and Marie the daughter of the Duke De Guise our ambassador to France sing the latter 's praise though it seem she be half promise to the King of Scotland Majesty how be the King he have just lately emerge from his seclusion it be say that although he be little disposed to it the council be urge he to take the extreme step of marry again a marriage I do not suppose hear any more about Don Luis and my marriage as to that Lady Mary I be afraid I have no news for you wether good or bad it seem perhaps the issue be in abeyance at least for the time be perhaps it be my fate never to marry no gentle lady no I be sure the King will make up his mind to to arrange an most brilliant marriage for you if not to Don Luis then to someone even more eligible I think you say Don Luis be incomparable Madame I do not mean no you mean well you always mean well Jane 's household be now all break up where will you go Lady Misseldon to live with my mother what about the young man you be engage to Robert Tavistock I think he be not so interested in I he be a fool then you be kind to think

all your family what should I do that letter be not write by your brother but dictate to he by Cromwell the messenger of Satan never let the Devil beguile you either with his threat or his promise the price of your soul be eternal vigilance if you once let down your guard the Devil will slip like a serpent into your mouth and forever afterwards he will speak for you my lord bishop you and your committee be ask to examine and determine the doctrine of the church of England but you seem unable to agree on anything your Majesty there continue to be some fundamental theological difference between member of the committee I be aware of that but I 've grow very impatient and I will not tolerate any more division I have formulate six fundamental doctrinal question the answer to these question will form the basis of our faith of course as your Majesty wish I shall go at once to Canterbury and consult with the Archbishop my lord save yourself the journey I think we understand each other very well let us leave archbishop Cranmer to tend his own garden there be really no need to bother he do not you agree your Majesty here be the six Articles of faith upon which your Majesty 's Church of England be to build and sustain read they the first article concern the truth of the Transubstantiation of God by the consecration of the bread and the wine at holy mass there take place a change in the whole substance of the bread into the substance of the body of Christ our Lord and change in substance of the wine into the substance of his blood the penalty for deny this be death by burn even after recantation the second article concern the withholding of the cup from the laity during communion for if we offer they the blood of Christ they will lose all their reverence for the holy sacrament and the power of the blood will be wash away Quam oblationem quaesumus tu Deus ut nobis corpus et sanguinis fiat dilectissimi filii tui the third article prescribe the continue validity of the vow of celibacy for all priest and nun for do not Saint Paul say he that be without a wife be solicitous for thing of the Lord how he may please God he who have a wife be solicitous for the thing of the world all priest who be now marry must now forthwith desert their wife or face the penalty of death the fourth article concern the observation of the vow of chastity a priest make a vow of chastity and any violation of that vow must surely be a sin against religion to turn aside a vow to God and to writhe in the pit of fornication be to follow the devil willingly into the mouth of Hell Accipite et manducate ex hoc omne Hoc est enim corpus meum the fifth article herein decide be concern with the continuation of private masse whereby good christian people may receive both godly and goodly consolation and blessing for their soul Corpus Christi the sixth article confirm the importance of confession Confitemini alterutrum peccata vestra confes your sin to one another Sanguinis Christi anyone who dispute against these Articles must now be consider a heretic like those extreme lutheran who now roam this land the punishment for transgression be to be death by hang drawing and quarter as well as forfeiture of estate and property and any man who decide to try to flee England in the face of these new Articles will be consider to have commit treason and suffer accordingly the awful fate hand out to traitor thank you my lord bishop you Eminences be to congratulated on your hard work and manifest wisdom here we have six Articles we may adhere to with a clear conscience there be one final amendment henceforth the Lord 's prayer will be alter to include the doxology for thine be the Kingdom the power and the glory amen amen my Lords Eminences your grace now that these matter have be determine let we prosecute with absolute diligence all those who stubbornly stand against we these be not six Articles they be a whip with six string Cranmer ought to send his wife and son back to Germany or be burn it be not just that Mister Rich private masse confession the blood and the body of Christ these be catholic measure he be roll back the reform it be the end of our reformation why because in his heart he have always be a true Catholic except just one thing that he will have neither Pope nor Luther nor any other man set above he leave we Charles please sit the faction and the fighting that go on inside this Court while I mourn be unacceptable I be appoint you President of the Council and Lord Great Master so in my absence all will be answerable to you not

marriage as usual the French want to mess I around who do the Emperor propose your Majesty the Emperor have put forward Christina his niece the Duchess of Milan tell I about her originally from Denmark she be marry at 13 to the Duke of Milan Francesco Sforza who die a year later she be now 16 both a widow and apparently still a maid she be live in Brussels with the Regent Mary of Hungary she be report to be a great beauty and like nothing well than hunt and play card hunting and play card I like she already have our Ambassador in the Netherlands find out more about her Majesty my Lord our

what have you do with my son where be he your son be unharmed he will remain unharmed until we be sure that you be not all traitor like your brother Reginald you know very well that my family have disown Reginald neither my mother nor I support or condone what he have do we will openly profess our allegiance to his gracious Majesty I like well the preceding of my brother the Cardinal but I like

church overthrow who give you that letter do you deny write it it have a postscript the King will die one day suddenly his leg will kill he and we will have a jolly stir your profession of loyalty be all hollow my Lord Montague you be after all the King 's cousin the last of the Plantagenets the last of the White Rose some say you Poles be the rightfull heir and will someday wear the garland do not they Sir Francis Majesty now that we find evidence against Henry Pole Lord Montague we need something against the Lady I ask you whether such dishonest and treacherous son could ever have have an honest mother who be that she be the widow of the Earl of Edgemont a widow wait it be true she do not look it but she be over 40 on the other hand there be a maid at Court she be only 14 but she already have a goodly stature let the fruit ripen before you pluck it Sir Francis my Lord my Lord Cromwell Majesty Cromwell I 've just receive a letter from Sir John Hutton the ambassador in Brussels he be be make enquiry on your Majesty 's behalf about the Duchess of Milan the Emperor 's niece what do he say he write there be none in these part for beauty of person and birth to compare with the Duchess she be not so pure white as the last Queen God pardon but when she smile there appear 2 dimple in her cheek and one in her chin and we be very well have he mention other Ladies only a sister of the Duke of Cleves Anne he write I 've hear about her they say she be of no great praise either of her personage or her beauty forgive I Majesty but on the other hand such a match could have its advantage this Realm have long be at the mercy of the machination of the French or of the Emperor but Cleves be a member of the Protestant League which daily grow in power across Europe and could easily rival with we thus at last could England make its own destiny even so I be anxious to see more about the Duchess of Milan I want to be sure she be as beautiful as Hutton claim send Master Holbein to do a sketch of she by next tide Majesty Master Cromwell with your permission Madam may I ask if you would consider marry the King you may ask Sir and as for my inclination you know I be at

pleasant that ' til this day I think no man have hear many if any angry word pass his mouth on the other hand it be not strange that the King 's Majesty be in so little space rid of his 3 Queens and I suspect that the first my great aunt be poison the second innocently put to death and the third lose for lack of care in her child bed frankly Sir if I have two head then one would be at his Majesty 's service Alas I only have this one Madam let I plead my Master 's well quality and appeal to your heart no you must not labour any further for I shall not fix my heart that way unless of course the Emperor command I to Madam Sir Francis the Royal Banner of the Plantagenets my God what expectation be there what be this the Royal Banner and this the most potent symbol of rebellion discover in your house Sir I be an old Lady I have do nothing wrong or against the King 's Majesty you still communicate with your son Reginald Pole despite he be a traitor no doubt you plot new treachery with he how can you suposse that at my age I be capable of plot anything against anyone I wish only to live a quiet life away from this world if the King in his mercy could show pity and forgive we Madam you have all be attaint for High Treason against his Majesty the evidence be great against you for what you deserve you may well beg mercy but whom shall say if it be grant or not Grandmother where be you Grandmother the Duchess of Milan be enchant I be singularly pleased this picture make she look very pretty very full of life keep your hand off her Charles after our wedding our young son will be enoble with the ancient Dukedoms of York Gloucester and Somerset and Princess Mary can marry Dom Luís that be what you want be not it Charles an imperial wedding just as Wolsey always want a french one everyone have an agenda and what I want do not matter the Poles have an agenda People talk about that poor little boy in the Tower and poor old Lady Salisbury but let I tell you they have Plantagenet blood in their vein and my father tell I my father tell I that if you leave even a sappling in the ground one day it will grow into a tree and that little boy in the Tower will have 40 000

ambassador mention there be two other cousin of King Francis potentially available to your Majesty Marie de Vendome and Anne of Varennes apparently Marie de Vendome have already announce her intention to become a nun although Castillon think that not necessarily an obstacle how very french I need picture do you understand I need to see they I need to see the woman who be go to be my companion for life what of the negotiation with the duchess of Milan there be the problem of affinity as niece of the emperor the duchess be therefore great niece to Catherine of Aragon in the past such obstacle might have be overcome by Papal dispensation well there be no question of that now but perhaps as head of the church of England the emperor will allow I to make a dispensation yes Majesty naturally it will take a good sport to make I feel amorous again I think your husband warn you to stay away from I oh he do but now he do not care he say he could not be bother to kill you you know the less I know about our husband the more he fascinate I see I know more or less where most people stand like Suffolk Cromwell I know their true belief even if they try to hide they but Edward who know what he truly believe would you like I to tell you ' for Services Rendered ' you be not quite as good as you think you be That'still pretty good tell I he believe in himself in his destiny Prince Edward be the key to his destiny nothing will stand in his way he be a reformer no you can answer I be too I swear everyone know I hate popery with a passion that be why sometimes they call I the black pope hello I 've just be fuck by the pope in Nomine Patris et Fili et Spiritis Sancti how do he think about Cromwell that I do not know but do anyone ever discover who shoot Robert Packington M P non temebo malem amen my Lord Montague I be here to help you to a well place you know I be not guilty you bastard only my brother be guilty but you can not touch he can you so you have to kill the innocent your guilt have be establish beyond question there use to be procedure here proper legal procedure in this country to establish who be guilty and who be not but that be all go now you do not even have to have a trial so since there be no judiciary what be leave be only tyranny where be my mother Lady Salisbury be here within the Tower please have a care for her my Lord Bishop whatever she might have do be it so offensive she be an old and true woman and have always live under the precept of God I will have a tender care for her body and soul my Lord trust I you know my Lord this the truth the King never make a man but he destroy he again so take a care my Lord come along I like more the look of some of these french girl more than the other but can the likeness be trust could the artist not use some licence to either flatter the lady or please I even Mr Holbein how can I make a decision on they when I have not meet they in the flesh talk to Castillion Majes if your Majesty might still choose to consider the simple but profound charm of Anne of Cleves or of her sister and of the benefit to you and this realm of a new alignment with the Protestant League his Grace the Bishop of Winchester my Lord Bishop Majesty your Majesty forgive I but it have come to my attention that certain evangelical be still preach against the six Articles of Faith and your Majesty 's religious agreement Mr John Lambert be one such who preach once a week in London to large audience Mr Lambert deny the real presence of God in the Sacrament of Communion say rather that it be merely a symbolic commemoration of the Passion of Christ then Mr Lambert will be condemn in Christ 's own word who say this be my body he will recant or be burn I will not patron heretic be there more perhaps it be none of my business your Majesty but I be tell that Mr Lambert be well known to my Lord Cromwell it appear that they be educate together at Cambridge and some six month ago when Lambert be aprehende on suspicion of promote religious heresy my Lord Cromwell have the charge dismiss thank you my Lord Bishop what news of the King 's marriage to the duchess of Milan Alas princess I think it be not to happen the duchess be the great niece of your mother and so the affinity be too touch also I think the lady do not want to marry the king then I shall not marry Dom Luis they say the king may now marry a french

Salisbury be be keep in the Tower and her son execute it be sadly so her grandson too be be keep a prisoner I be sure it be all Cromwell 's do I should not say this to many people Excellency but I say

ambassador Monsieur Castillion Majesty we have be consider all these candidate for our hand there be so many indeed a warren of honourable Ladies Quite but the fact be in the circumstance because many of they appear attractive I do not see how I can approach they individually so perhaps King Francis can assemble seven or eight of they at Calais I could go there and make their acquaintance all at the same time no it it be not a french custom to send lady of that rank of such noble and princely family to be be pass in review as if they be prize horse perhaps if your Majesty desire one of these

with Francis Dereham he use importunate force against I in a manner violence he rape you the Queen confess yes she tell I that Dereham rape she I be sure she be lie as and about other thing too but I do believe that there be some form of pre contract between they which would invalidate the marriage she claim to be innocent after the marriage of course and you believe that you do not believe it I

my delight no face Lord to those who look my Lord Surrey it have be put to we that your defeat at Saint Etienne be not as you claim due to the unwillingness of your soldier but to your own folly and an empty confidence in your own unreasoning bravery how do you answer such a charge I would answer it be not such a defeat there be loss and victory on both side and as a matter of fact the enemy take more loss than we even so my Lord our loss be the more grievous since we lose all our captain who you regardless of the danger send into the front line I think you be never in battle those officer want to be in the front line they charge with a cry and with great courage and in as good an order as anyone would wait for they be outnumber but they break through the enemy line they destroy four fifth of the convoy at that moment the French be in disarray and if the few man that this council have send I have not panic and bolt then his Majesty would now be celebrate a great victory but alas my Lord he be not you take a risk in attack an enemy far superior in number and you lose you be force to flee the battlefield which be reprehensible and one of only three way by which a knight companion can be degrade from the order of the Garter my Lord Surrey my brother have already announce allegation against you for corrupt misuse of office while you be Lieutenant General he have announce an immediate purge on those that you appoint to position of authority Sir believe I there be just too many witness that will tell you that Henry Howard be never corrupt by personal

lady send you that money there be a man in a blue coat who deliver I ten shilling and what do he say he say my Lady Hertford send it to I with the support and permission of the Queen Come come Mistress Askew we can make you speak have she move down one level to the chamber your Grace I can not allow you will do as we say Sir Edmund please please Mistress Askew your Grace have be misinform as to the event in Boulogne I be very prepared to believe it again and again the Council refuse to send reinforcement that I ask for even the garrison at Calais refuse to help except to send some flat footed squint eye unshapely man unfit to carry arm and now my command be revoke now I be a man of no service no activity and I must sit at home within the wall do not think of this as the end of your life my Lord God have give you grace courage liberality and after Saint Etienne he also give you good luck Luck desert you for a moment but if the rest go on then you will soon serve the King 's Majesty again and have every chance to regain your honor and reputation I thank you for your word but the truth of it be I be undermine and attack from the start of my command in Boulogne and now I swear to you Hertford will smart for usurp my place I would counsel your lordship not to raise arm against Hertford I have not the choice your grace it be sure the King will die before the Prince reach his maturity so who will then govern the Prince and the realm just pinch she for God 's sake just pinch she that be all nothing more we ask you again which of the lady of her Majesty 's chamber send you monie or promise of relief we want to know which of the Queen 's Ladies share your belief or if the queen herself do we must stretch she further my Lords it be absolutely against the King 's Law to rack a woman and I will do it no far on my conscience Come come you know perfectly well we have the authority of the King himself to examine she I do not know at all that you have his Majesty 's permission for this come you foolish woman let I ask you something do you say that priest can not make the body of Christ I say so my Lord for I have read that God make man but that man can make God I have never yet read and after the consecration be it not the body of Christ it be but consecrated bread and what if a mouse eat it after the consecration what shall become of that mouse what say you stupid woman I say that mouse be damn poor mouse what be it your Majesty I must tell you that the woman Anne Askew have be put to torture in absolute violation of your Majesty 's law you be right to come and see I so I may explain to you and ease your conscience in case of extreme heresy the law make no distinction between a man and a woman for as you know Sir Edmund the devil take many form and yet it be always the devil wake up wake up we desire to ask you again about the Queen Come now speak lady his Majesty the King my well beloved Commons I come here today to speak with you to set forth my mind and the secret of my heart there should be perfect love and concord in this realm but instead there be discord and dissention in every place what love and charity be there amongst the clergy when one call the other heretic and anabaptist and the other call he Papist and hypocrite be these token of charity amongst you be these the sign of fraternal love the people look for light and you bring they darkness and as for the laity you be not clean of malice and envy for you slander and rebuke priest and bishop you take it upon yourself to judge the clergy by the sole light of your fantastical opinion and vain exposition although you be permit to read Holy Scripture you must understand that it be under license and only to inform your conscience not to dispute and make scripture I give you the Bible in your own tongue but I be sorry to see that most precious jewel the Word of God have be disputed rhyme sing and jangle in every alehouse and every tavern in this realm I whom God have appoint his Vicar here will see these division extinct and those enormity correct or God shall account I an unprofitable servant therefore be of charity with one another like brother and brother Love dread and serve God to which I as your supreme head and sovereign Lord exhort and require you and I doubt not but that love and affinity which I speak of at the beginning shall never be dissolve or break between we what do the King say Sir Thomas he be angry with the religious division in his realm he say that he give people the Bible to read but not so that they could dispute its meaning it seem to I like his Majesty be like one who would throw a man headlong off the top of a high tower and ask he to stop when he be halfway down but surely our delivery from the tyranny of Rome and blind faith be not the end of the Reform and the renewal of our christian life but it be only the beginning the King do suppose that only he know the will of God and so whatever he think should therefore be the new Orthodoxy however fantastical it be like his own private religion and yet he ask for an end to division for charity and love Sir Thomas he be still the King and if he ask for charity and love then he be do no more than Christ do Madam the King have open a Pandora 's Box and whether he will or not he simply can not close it now whatever his complaint you look troubled what be it I fear now more than ever the machination of man how their plot and plan swirl about the Court and the King I can sense it but I have no knowledge anymore no one it seem least of all the King confide in I but be it not well so in some way since it leave I free to love you at my leisure but in other way it condemn my high station to neglect affair of the realm especially now man conspire to secure his future and their own profit but I do not understand how can they secure the future by control the Prince it be widely suppose the King 's infirmity grow bad and he will not live to see the Prince come to maturity do you still love the King my Lord Hertford Majesty so there be peace with France only if your Majesty accept the term what be the term in 8 year ' time your Majesty will hand back Boulogne in return for a payment of 2 million crown 2 million yes your Majesty the Admiral of France Claude d'Annibault will come here to your Majesty 's court to sign the peace treaty if your

surprised since the Earl hate we both the same so I be sure all of we will prosper well without he I agree my Lords forgive I but as foreman of the jury I have to tell your lordship that we be not impressed with the evidence against my Lord Surrey it be very clear to we that he have the right to bear the arm of Edward the Confessor and as to the plot against his Majesty we can find no credible evidence to support it Sirs we do not think it right that the Earl should be condemn for such trifle whenever have innocence be cause to save a man 's life when the King deem he unfit to live in the

be engage in a fight to the death with Bishop Gardiner and his I will not hide the truth from you the King 's infirmity and the youth of my nephew make the question of succession urgent the stake could not possibly be high and you desire to know I assume on which side of the argument I belong your grace whether you will it or not you carry a great weight of confidence and influence with the King and everyone know that but few people know that your wife the Duchess and my wife Anne together with the Queen be as close on matter of religion as it be possible to be and this close affinity have embolden I now to approach your grace surely your wife have tell you that the Duchess and I be estranged thus her affinity be not necessarily my own and you do I a disservice to assume they be your grace forgive I I do forgive you I forgive you even for hound poor proud Surrey to his death for it be his fault but as to religion I have never read the Gospels and never shall I be sure they enlighten you but I prefer they to remain mysterious and as for the promise of a well world I can only say that England be merry before and all thing consider I would all thing be as they use to be in time past your grace if I do not have your support may I ask if you will act against I I be not sure if this be any answer my Lord Hertford I have always be draw to a phrase use by the french peasant praise the God of all drink the wine and let the world be the world my Lady Hertford I be summon here but I have no idea why I wonder how I may help you you may help I my Lady by tell I the truth you

sometimes to have a different view of religion than we do only so that you could correct I forgive I your Majesty but I think that talk and discuss help to ease the pain and weariness of your present
